How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It is really a very short description of your concern. It would be better if you would send me your detailed gynecological, menstrual, obstetric, medical and other histories. Which pill have you taken and how much dose? Had you confirmed your pregnancy status before having the pill? If not, have serum beta hCG (blood pregnancy test) to have a clear idea about your pregnancy. On which date have you taken the pill and what was your last period date? If pregnancy is confirmed and it is early pregnancy, emergency contraceptive pills give withdrawal bleed but if already few weeks pregnancy it needs proper dosage to have induced miscarriage. Kindly send me your details so that I can guide you. In case of a positive pregnancy test, check again the level of beta hCG after 48 hours from the previous test. It will give us a clear idea about pregnancy progression or the effect of the pill on it as well. If the second level comes less than the previous it is a miscarriage. If the second level shows increase more than 60 % then it is a normal growing pregnancy. If the second level shows less then 60 % increase it is alarming and you need a transvaginal scan to exclude pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy). In case of pain, bleeding, dizziness with a positive pregnancy test, better to report to a tertiary care unit.

Are there any products, herbs, oils, etc., that I can use or ingest to help it heal? How long will it last?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See molluscum contagiosum is a viral infection and if it is not spreading then you do not require treatment. It is self-limiting and will stop on its own. If the lesions are spreading very fast then you may require contemporary treatment like cryotherapy or laser. If you only have some lesions, you can follow this management: Try all these things regularly and you will feel better results. In case of any problem, you should visit a nearby skin specialist.

I am aware of the tartar and that I need a good cleaning. I brush my teeth twice a day, use mouthwash twice a day, from there I use periogen twice a day and top it off with flossing once a day. When I read about gum disease, I see a lot of stories about gum recession and discolored gums. It terrifies me. When I brush my teeth and floss, they do not bleed. I see that is a good thing but I cannot help to just think that something may be wrong. I know I can do better with my teeth and I have been trying but the anxiety haunts me on a daily basis. Can anybody help me by looking at the pictures?","Doctor":"Hello. When you get a full scaling procedure done, all the calculus seen will go away. Then, the gums will look more healthy and good. You have some recession in lower front gums due to heavy calculus buildup (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Make it a habit to get your teeth cleaned by a dentist every six months. Other than that, you have healthy gums. You can maintain them by occasionally gargling with warm salt water gargle twice a day. It gives excellent results.

At 3 PM my ear started to bleed through the canal. Is it a scrape or cut maybe? The doctor said all is fine now. It is still bleeding. What can be done?","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern. As your ENT doctor had already examined your ear and says no cotton is inside that means only infection is there. I think if blood is coming out from the ear and your hearing is impaired than thorough examination and some necessary investigations are must to diagnose the real fact. Till you are managing to consult an ENT specialist you may take antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, and antihistaminic. Do not try self-cleaning of the ear by yourself otherwise, you may damage ear-drum.  For more information consult an ENT otolaryngologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 33 years old male.

Have you seen the ultrasound of liver? The first possibility is steatohepatitis or commonly called as fatty liver.

But I have a little bit of throat pain when I yawn or swallow food. I have lost two to five kilograms weight in one month. I changed my lifestyle. I had foamy poop thrice in these days. Is it because of antacids? How long is the course of Pan IT safe?","Doctor":"Hi. It is safe for a short-term period, for a month or two. But if necessary then the long-term is also continued as the side effects are not very serious. So I would suggest that you have it for a week. Then make it once a day and then take in a week or two. Most probably it is due to acidity and gastritis. Do you have upper abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, burping, increase in pain on food intake, sour water feeling in throat or chest burning? These are the other symptoms and may be associated. You should avoid fatty, oily and spicy diet. Have some walk after having food instead of taking rest. Have multiple small meals instead of heavy meals. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Take lots of green leafy vegetables, and fruits. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. If not adequately relieved, then you should add Syrup Sucral O (Sucralfate with Oxetacaine) or Gelusil (Aluminum hydroxide, Magnesium hydroxide, and Simethicone) two teaspoons three times a day for a week.

She is 13 years old now and at present she has been taking Valparin Chrono 500 and Levipil 750 both twice daily. She attained puberty before two years and presently studying in sixth standard. She has a learning disability, forgets everything very quickly and needs to be treated specially. But it will not be possible on the part of that school as the school does not provide any special classes for learners with LD or does not have any provision for CWSN. On the other hand, there is no any institution in my locality which provides special education to CWSN. Under the circumstances stated above, I have left no option except to enroll her in an open school and give necessary support to her. Now my question is will it be fine for her in the future to lead a life without any social development?","Doctor":"Hi. Your daughter has two independent medical problems. The seizure disorder needs management with medications. Her learning disability needs appropriate assessment and remedial work. I do understand that most schools do not offer remedial teaching and they leave the parents with no option other than NIOS (National Institute of open schooling). However, in most cities, there are organizations which are involved in remedial teaching for children with LD (learning disability). You can look up such organizations in your town.

She may have some psychiatric problems. First she faced a problem in her life before 10 years. She believes in different sociology and culture.

But, the problems never uprooted. For one and a half year she is running through the treatment. She made the first visit only. After that her parents are visiting with those doctors. As a witness, I noticed some irrelevant behavior 10 days ago, which makes us very annoying. I have a chronological prescription. My only question is, at this moment is she able to enjoy her marriage life? If she gets married, will she able to get pregnant? Please describe the family life difficulties, including sex life. I will be very thankful to you.","Doctor":"Hi. I will summarize the clinically relevant aspects of her case. The illness started early around the age of 17 years. It has not cleared completely until yet and she has not returned to her previous personality. The symptoms are suggestive of paranoid schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, though more information and detailed history will be required to confirm it. These factors suggest a poor prognosis and incomplete recovery from the illness. Her future will be decided by how much her symptoms improve. If she visits the psychiatrist regularly and takes electroconvulsive therapy if the doctor suggests, then her situation is likely to improve. But at the current situation, she does not appear to be mentally fit for marriage or children. Marriage is stressful in itself and she might not be able to handle the stress. Though there is no direct effect of the disease on her ability to get pregnant, a mentally healthy mother is required to take care of herself during pregnancy and the baby after childbirth. She currently does not appear to be capable of handling the stress of pregnancy and childbirth. Besides, pregnancy and delivery are stressful and might worsen her psychological condition. Also, the medicines that she takes might affect her ability to get pregnant and maintain a healthy pregnancy. I would like to recommend a course of electroconvulsive therapy. It works better than most medicines in such cases.

The patient takes Azathioprine for treatment for the past 15 years and was previously on steroids when first diagnosed. Liver cirrhosis is present, AFP levels are normal on the last check (four months ago) and have always been. Her PT is normal and albumin levels are low. Now for the treatment of PVT, what is advisable? LMWH or something else?","Doctor":"Hi. The information given here (attachment removed to protect patient identity) shows that she has liver cirrhosis. Also, she has portal hypertension. In this setting, treatment should be directed at liver cirrhosis which has ultimately resulted in portal vein thrombosis. The reports are negative for underlying tumor (which needs the CT image to be seen). She may benefit from LMWH (low molecular weight Heparin) if other liver parameters are fine. Else the best option ahead would be liver transplant. I would like to see her complete reports for a detailed discussion.

I was distraught so I ran to a hospital and they started my first dose of PEP after 12 hours of exposure. The regimen given to me for 28 days is Lamuvidine plus Tenofovir and Lopinavir and Ritonavir. Is this regimen right? I talked to another doctor and he told this is basic PEP and not of much help. He also prescribed PEP.","Doctor":"Hi. As per my experience, the regimen you are taking is fine. The only drawback is that it may be causing some more side effects like nausea, vomiting, headache, weakness, etc, and hence it is more difficult to take the one your practitioner has advised. You can continue with the PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) you are already taking and need not stop and start another one as discontinuing it may do more harm than good.

She is currently complaining of a burning sensation all over the body. During the daytime, she passes very less urine. But during night time, she is going very frequently. I have uploaded her urine culture report. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Do you have sonography of abdomen? If not, please do an ultrasound of abdomen with post-void residual urine to rule out any physical cause of UTI (urinary tract infection). As per the history, you can give tablet Levofloxacin 500 mg once daily for seven days and tablet Cranpac (Cranberry extract) twice daily for 30 days to prevent UTI.

It is very painful, and the patch has got bigger.","Doctor":"Hi. Your history is not clear. If the patch is severely painful and if it is present for two to three days, it can be an aphthous ulcer. If it is having a history of more than a week, it can be a fungal infection. I would recommend you an antifungal Candid mouth paint (Clotrimazole). Use it two to three times daily. Do not eat after applying it for at least 10 minutes. Also do salt gargles twice daily and take multivitamins for a month.

Enterogermina (anti-diarrheic microorganisms, multiantibiotic-resistant Bacillus clausii) is a probiotic that is available in a capsule form and a solution form. It is used as a treatment for diarrhea that is acute or chronic. I believe it will not cause any harm in nebulizer unless you have a hypersensitivity towards it. In that case, I would suggest you consult your specialist doctor for proper examination and management.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

No sputum, and now my airway feels a bit dry especially my oropharynx and it has been over a month and I still have an intermittent cough that is not going away. No bloody sputum or anything. And when I am sleeping at night, I do not really have coughs especially since I can sleep throughout the night without waking up from coughs. I feel it more when I drive in a car and have air conditioner towards my face and cold air.

I have gone through the picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). These tiny skin colored papules are called lichen nitidus. It is a harmless condition.  In about 70 % of cases, it is self-limiting which means it resolves on its own, no treatment is usually required. If it is itchy, then use Mometasone cream, mix one part of cream with two parts of moisturizer and apply a thin layer to the affected area at night for two weeks only. Mometasone is a moderately potent topical corticosteroid. It should not be used continuously. Use it for two weeks. Take a break for a week then again use it for another two weeks if the skin lesions are still present.  Olesoft moisturizing lotion (Olive oil with Sodium lactate) is fine.

Your pain needs antibiotic medication that you might be allergic to, the pain in your tooth is because of pulpitis and needs an antibiotic course like Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Before taking any medicine make it sure you are not allergic to it. Any case take medication under medical supervision. The other spots you mentioned must be the aphthous ulcers. For bleeding treatment, get an oral prophylaxis (teeth scaling) done.

I went for a check and had it removed and found out it was a fibroadenoma.I have been on oral contraceptives for past five months, Gedarel 20/150. However, I do not know if I should continue taking them as it is said to possibly cause these lumps.","Doctor":"Hi. Hormonal contraceptives have side effects as well and it is not better to use for years as can give long-term side effects. Gedarel (Desogestrel and Ethinylestradiol) is combined hormonal contraceptives and should be avoided in many conditions like obesity, age more than 35 years, migraine, systemic lupus erythematosus, history of breast and endometrial cancer, endometrial hyperplasia, venous thromboembolism, etc.  It can increase chances of stroke, dyslipidemia, stroke, hypertension, VTE (venous thromboembolism), etc. You already had a breast lump, not mentioned your family history regarding breast cancer. It is better to have some other contraceptives containing Progesterone only to reduce long-term side effects. Progesterone only contraceptives also have side effects if used for a long time but some patient can have symptoms on short term use as well like irregular bleeding or spotting, so better to avoid for years.

USG finding normal except grade one fatty liver. So, the doctor has given Udiliv 300 two times daily and cholesterol medicine 10 mg daily. Should I take it?

So, you need to get these tested and treating the deficient one will cure your homocysteine levels and risk of heart disease. Next, you may try having a healthy lifestyle as well. So, you need to have low salt, fatty, and oily diet, and regular exercises at least 30 minutes a day and need to repeat lipid profile after eight weeks to see the response.

Would a person test will be positive on hair or urine drug test in any situation? I am not a drug user.","Doctor":"Hi. While crossing a bar, when someone smokes marijuana (Cannabis) out, there is a possibility of inhalation through the nose. Chronic exposure occurs for people who work in the bar. Sufficient amount can enter into the lung and blood, which can be tested in hair or blood. So, just crossing the marijuana smoke never makes the hair to accumulate marijuana or to make positive. There is a small chance for deposition of smoke on the hair. But, it would go off if washed while bathing. If the hair sample is collected after the exposure of smoke without a bath, then there is a chance for the test to be positive in the hair. If the sufficient amount of smoke enters into the lungs, definitely it goes to blood. Once it reaches the blood, it needs to get excreted through urine. Hence, within 12 hours of smoke exposure, the urine may show a positive result.

His bowels are not clear and the right side of his body has a burning sensation. As per the ayurvedic doctor, his cholesterol is increasing. So, please can you help me with some probable reasons for the above problem and their cures?","Doctor":"Hello. Burning sensation in the body can be due to Pitta dosha increase. Moreover, your doctor's advice regarding an increased cholesterol level and prescribed treatment are also right. You can follow the same prescription you are following. He has to take treatment regularly for two or more months under supervision. These changes can be due to age or may be due to diet. So, avoid excessively spicy, oily, deep fried food and junk food. You can also perform a blood test related to cholesterol called as lipid profile test after discussing with your doctor.

The pain started suddenly two months back and I have never had a history of back pain. There is intense pain in my lower back. Currently, I cannot bend down, sit for a long time, squat properly and carry heavy things amongst many things. Sometimes, I feel a sharp pain and a numbing sensation on the side of my hip. I have consulted several doctors and done an MRI scan of my lumbar spine but I am not getting a proper diagnosis for my problem. I would appreciate it if I could get a second opinion on what could be the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The MRI diagnosis is of a disc bulge L4-L5 and a mild disc prolapse L5-S1 but both the discs are currently hydrated though L5-S1 is not maintaining the disc height. Primarily, L5-S1 is the source of back pain. Your symptoms could also be coming from core weakness (or muscular) or could be SI joint in origin. I need more clinical information and examination findings to confirm one from the other.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It might be a cause of your recurrent nasal discharge. If symptoms are very irritating, then you may try a course of nasal steroid spray for a period of one month and see the response. If runny nose is accompanied by sneezes, then try some steroid-antihistamine spray instead. After that, you may use steroid spray on a need basis. It is unlikely to fully resolve this issue but could be brought to a manageable state with medications.

Please reply soon.","Doctor":"Hello. Eagle syndrome is common in females. There are some medications that can help decrease the dullness sensation such as Neuroton ampoule (nerve multivitamins). I suggest taking just one injection every three days. Anti-inflammatory medicine such as Brufen tablets can be taken twice daily.

So I have one doubt like in case my fasting sugar level goes down and when it is in control, can I stop this tablet or I need to take lifelong? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, so if your sugar levels are less than 100 mg/dl without taking medication, your doctor probably might wean you off. But the condition is that it should stay in the normal range without medication. Right now, your sugar is in the normal range due to the medication. So make sure your doctor knows when you are having low sugar so he can taper it down. But mostly once the medication has started, it continues. It all depends on how good you can control your sugar with a healthy lifestyle and regular medication (if taking any).

Now, she is entirely unresponsive, does not answer the questions correctly, pretty unaware of her behavior, hallucinations, and there is a loss of memory (difficulties to remember at present). Before these medicines, she has been given Risperidone 4 mg (day and night), Procyclidine 5 mg (day and night) and Quetiapine 100 mg (at night). When she was taking these medicines, she felt panic, depressed. There was difficulty in sleeping. Then the doctor changed the medication. But with the current medicines also, the problems have raised. What can we do now, should we include Risperidone with the current drugs to alleviate the symptoms?","Doctor":"Hi. She is not getting enough antipsychotic medications. If she has hallucinations and a cognitive problem, then she needs an adequate amount of antipsychotic for a long time. She is on Quetiapine 100 mg which is not a full dose to her, or it is also not responding. So, either you should increase the dosage of Quetiapine or add other antipsychotic medicine. If she had responded well with Risperidone in the past, then you can start it again. If she is restless (akathesia) due to Risperidone, then give her Propranolol or Benzodiazepine.

Nine months later, I found she is HIV positive. My question: I have read that after a certain window period time (three months after getting negative) is conclusive and even after (six months) confirmation is definitely negative. But, why are all these other people saying you can go years without showing positive and that is really freaking me out big time. Is it true that it takes years to come up positive or does it only take six months to know it 100 %? What is true? Also, there is a doctor who says no test is 100 % reliable. I am still 15 months post exposure. HIV RNA PCR qualitative all are negative. 20 months post exposure, HIV-Alere combo test result is negative. Any further test is needed? I am negative now. Will my result change in the future? What is 100 % window period? Please clarify my doubts. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. For this question, it is based on the test you do. HIV enters the body on day-0, and goes to the nearest lymph node and starts replication by day-7. This is when, p24 antigens (core proteins of HIV virus) get detected and in turn, the body starts defense and produces HIV antibodies, and these get tested positive in 15 to 23 days. But, due to neutralization of antigens by antibodies, as per theory, testing after 23 days up to 28 days may give false negatives (<0.001%). So, getting a fourth generation HIV test after 28 days is confirmation by 99 %. Yes, not only in medical, but in any field, 100 % is not possible. And taking medico legality, no one gives you 100 % cure. No further test is needed. You are negative by 99.99 %. A change in result is unlikely. You will stay negative forever. The window period is a period where lab tests cannot detect the presence of infection by tests.

Neck pain is maybe a sprain or due to HIV induced myalgia. HAART (highly active anti-retroviral therapy) treatment would be sufficient and simple Aceclofenac is enough. Efavirenz has a tendency to cause heavyness in the morning. It is due to a drug. Nothing to worry. Isoniazid is given to clear latent TB infection. Complete the course.

Blood work came back as total testosterone 381 and A1c 6.9. Started exercising and lost weight and inches, 198 lbs to 178, 38-inch waist to 32. Symptoms still persisted. The doctor started me on Clomid 50 mg three times per week. Testosterone shot up to 900's but symptoms persisted although Cialis helped with erection quality, still low libido. Will attach a note with test and A1c results during this time. So, I stopped taking the Clomid in March this year and had my physical last week. The doctor says my testosterone is 570, A1c is 6.0 and everything else looks good. He says since I still have symptoms, that I have testosterone resistance. His analogy was; like diabetics, their bodies produce insulin but just does not know what to do with it. So, his treatment recommendation is TRT testosterone replacement therapy along with Clomid. I am hesitant because I feel this therapy is overused nowadays, and I feel pretty good except my libido. Sought a second opinion today from my urologist, he seemed disinterested in me doing that but said if I try a few injections it would not hurt me, then advised me to run this by an endocrinologist. So I guess in summary:  Do you believe that testosterone resistance is a valid diagnosis? If I do try the TRT, can I stop after a few weeks or a few injections and get back to the way I am right now with no permanent issues? Should I just start the Clomid again, or just keep using the Cialis and keep working out and trying to clean up my diet more?  Any other thoughts and advise would be appreciated. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello. I have a couple of questions for you: Testosterone resistance is a phenomenon that occurs due to a genetic defect and would have caused problems with puberty and would not appear now in adulthood. Clomid (Clomifene) gave a very good response. I would not advise TRT. The low libido could be due to a variety of other issues and likely not a result of testosterone levels. If the thought is resistance then there would be resistance to exogenous therapy too. Why do we think a chemical would be better than the body’s natural testosterone. You are thinking right, eat better. I would recommend reducing animal food consumption which have high sex steroids and these can act as endocrine disrupters. A plant-based diet is recommended to reduce these endocrine disrupters and lower inflammation in the body.

There is no pain and I can get food down but it feels like it takes more time to get the food down. I went to a hospital and they did a CAT scan of my throat and said there are no tumors. It feels like I have to throw up but when I try to, it feels like I am going to throw up a ball and cannot. I got this pressure in my nose and throat/chest when I tried to throw up the other day. Also, I saw small blood streaks in the saliva while I was trying to throw up. I have not seen blood any other time besides then.","Doctor":"Hello. Swallowing is a process which starts at the mouth and ends at the stomach. CT scan for your throat just investigates the pharynx and the upper esophagus. You have to investigate the whole track. A barium swallow is so helpful as it can detect strictures and masses along the swallowing tract. Barium swallow scan is cheap, safe and fast. The second step is pharyngoscopy and it may be needed or not according to the barium swallowing scan.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 34 years old and have an 8-year-old boy. I just got promoted and I am not happy with it.

I do not wish to go to the office and just pray that I should get sick or have an accident. I do not wish to stay at home also. I do not wish to live.

You are having multiple responsibilities managing son and household works beautifully. There are few medicines also to overcome stress and depression.

Recurrent preterm delivery can be seen in uterine anomalies, intrauterine infection, cervical incompetence, and tobacco use.

Try to have a full treatment for any health issue that is reducing your immunity and causing you recurrent yeast infection like diabetes, immunocompromised diseases like AIDS, etc. Try to have a high vaginal swab to confirm that recurrently you are getting an infection. Sometimes, normal vaginal secretions increase due to excitement, at ovulation or fertilization, genetically, near menses or at implantation, etc. So, try to recognize, differentiate and confirm via a vaginal swab test. Overtreatment can harm normal vaginal flora that regulates local pH and can result in a dry vagina, reduced libido, recurrent infections from different organisms and disproportion of normal and abnormal vaginal flora ratio. You can have Canesten (Clotrimazole) pessary per vaginal at bedtime on two alternate nights. If an infection is confirmed and gives symptoms as well. this will clear out infection. Consult a specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent.

I was inspecting my teeth the other day and I have multiple points of concern and I am now afraid to get to the dentist. I have my six-month cleaning in days and I am anxious. I have two small smooth dots on two teeth on the side. Is this a cavity or is it possible for it to be treated with fluoride and dental cleaning? On another tooth, I am pretty sure it is a cavity because it is a tiny hole on the smooth surface on the side of the tooth. I try to take care of my teeth and when people look at them they are not bad. Besides, my front bottom teeth are a little shifted but my teeth look fine to others. I am also disappointed because I thought I have been doing a lot better brushing my teeth since my last appointment. I had one cavity during my last appointment. And diet wise nothing has changed much since then. I just do not understand how I could have multiple cavities now considering my diet has not changed and I feel like I have been brushing better.","Doctor":"Hi. The black dots would be the carious lesions. It does not matter if you take much care and do regular brushing, with time the carious lesions increase in the dental arch. You need to get it filled by a dentist as soon as possible. The multiple carious teeth happen because of many conditions, for example, dryness of the mouth. The brushing of teeth before sleep is the most important one.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Frankly speaking, toothpaste is just an external application, and it does not make any difference based on the brand. Toothpaste does not have any therapeutic effects as portrayed in advertisements.

In the past, there were many instances of adverse reactions by taking medicines of Iron composition. These include restlessness, breathing problem, and diarrhea. About five years ago, upon the doctor’s advice and supervision, I was fed intravenously through saline bottle with some Iron injection to it. Immediately in about 15 minutes after the procedure, I experienced shortness of breath, burning sensation in muscles, swelling of legs, fatigue, and diarrhea.

For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Kindly suggest is he suffering from serious stomach problem and is it fine to give breastfeeding as well as powder milk to a baby?","Doctor":"Hello. A baby can pass as many times stool as they are fed. The stool can be slight curdy in nature and may vary in color from golden yellow to greenish yellow in color.

If she has started feeling so after the medicines have been started, it is as the dose might be high for her and her sugar levels are going too low. You can check it on your glucometer if you have one. Please meet your diabetologist for dose adjustment as soon as possible.

I have been getting sharp cutting pains in my vaginal area for the longest time hence we decided to go for a hysteroscopy and then we found out that I had the cervical polyps. So now for the past few months, I have been bleeding between my periods, bleeding after having intercourse and my discharge also has a foul smell. It also sometimes has a bit of blood mixed with it and I am starting to think this polyp might have developed into cervical cancer. I am not sure what to do as these symptoms are not normal at all.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Based on the symptoms you mentioned, it definitely implies that you need to go check with your gynecologist for an examination to see and rule out any cancerous changes or for any presence of polyps. Without examining it is difficult to say. The color and odor of the discharge indicate the presence of infection in that pathology. Why am I suspecting cancerous or precancerous changes is because you have been tested for HPV two years back which was positive. HPV (human papillomavirus) is the causative virus or the infective agent that develops changes in the cervix which over many years (mostly 5-10 years but not strictly) turn into cervical cancer. It would have been very helpful if you had provided the biopsy reports and discharge summary details of the hysteroscopy done and any pap or colposcopy reports if you have done in the past for a better understanding so that I could guide you better. I am prescribing you the medication to take care of the infection but you need to visit your gynecologist for evaluation at the earliest for early intervention. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) abdomen and pelvis if required. Ultrasound whole abdomen and pelvis. Cervical examination followed by pap smear and colposcopy or biopsy according to the findings. Blood investigations. Chest x-ray. ? Chronic cervicitis, ? Pre invasive lesion of cervix, ? Ca cervix. Tablet Ofloxacin plus Ornidazole twice daily for five days after food. Please follow up with your gynecologist for checkup and necessary evaluation and management."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 25-year-old man without major systemic diseases before. I am actually a medical student now. During the general examination this year, I noticed my Hb level around 12 to 13 g/dL. Follow up data in the following months showed 12.7 --> 12.8 --> 12.4 --> 12.6. Normocytic (84), borderline hypochromic (31.5) with borderline Hct (38.5 %) during the last examination. WBC and PLT were both within normal limits and I also had normal differential count with no blast cell. Other lab data like total protein, albumin, ferritin and stool occult blood were all within normal limits. Due to these problems, I looked back for my past examination history and found an examination seven years ago (when I was 18-year- old) showed also Hb level around 12.6 g/dL with similar other lab data. HbEP was also arranged for further survey and revealed Hb A 97.8 % and Hb A2 2.2 %. The reticulocyte count during the last examination showed 1.3 %, which would be bone marrow hypo-proliferative if I corrected it with reticulocyte index. I wonder whether I have some bone marrow problems and seek for bone marrow aspiration. Or, is it just not suitable to use reticulocyte index to calculate reticulocyte when my Hb level was only a little bit below the normal limits? (RBC count = 4570000/microL, absolute reticulocyte count was normal). Can Hb 12 to 13 g/dL be a normal variant in a generally healthy young adult? What other differential diagnosis do I have to keep in mind?","Doctor":"Hello. You are a medical student, so obviously you are very much alert about health. I have reviewed your query and here is my advise. Your CBC (complete blood count) report is not showing any abnormality except borderline hemoglobin level. You are right in that the male hemoglobin range is within 13 to 17 normally. But, do not worry about your Hb level, it is mildly low. You can take iron-rich foods like red meat, green leafy vegetables, beans, jaggery, etc. Provide me your serum ferritin value to check it. Your reticulocyte count is within range and I do not think you have to worry about hypoproliferative anemia. After taking iron rich foods you can repeat reticulocyte count.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I wake up every day with the confusion that I have not slept for the entire night. I have experienced child bullying in my school days. My classmate used to beat me every time in those days. My father is dominating, and my mother has experienced domestic violence. My home environment was tensed in my childhood days. In my school days, I had a better memory power to remember the page numbers. But now, I am having low memory power after I got OCD. I had no stage daring from early childhood. Now, I avoid public meetings, family functions because I am afraid of talking with a large group of people. Sometimes, I am scared of talking to a specific individual. All these things have affected my life entirely. I have missed a lot of opportunities due to these problems. I have a family history of issues in mental health. I have taken medication Fluvoxamine, SSRI, Olenz, Clonazepamine last year. But I felt tired and sleepy every day after taking pills for two to three months. So I stopped it. Now what to do, received treatment from four to five doctors. But I have not visited consistently due to sleepiness, tiredness due to medication. Still, the problem persists. Now, what to do?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. You are having symptoms of OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder), social anxiety and depression. You have controlled most of your OCD symptoms and have a problem of excessive sedation with the drug. Most of SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), Oleanz (Olanzapine) and Clonazepam can cause sedation. But Fluoxetine is one of the SSRI that usually does not cause sedation. If your doctor has not tried Fluoxetine, then you can ask him to give a trial of it as it has good efficacy for OCD and depression. Also, psychotherapy has good positive evidence in the management of OCD. If you have not received it, go for it, it is a type of therapy in which the therapist will lead you to behave in a better way. Forgetfulness can be due to many reasons including poor attention, depression and poor concentration. Do regular exercise and take adequate sleep. Avoid any substance use like alcohol, smoking.

I am taking Novomix 14 units of insulin injection in the morning and 12 units at night. But, sugar is not within normal limits. My PPBS is 190 mg/dl, FBS is 126 mg/dl. My TSH levels are also high 4.9 mIU/L. I have been prescribed Thyronorm 12.5 mcg for the same. Is this dose adequate? Kindly tell me how to bring sugar under control? Should the medication be changed or increased? Currently, I am also taking Folic acid tablets.","Doctor":"Hi. Make your FBS (fasting blood sugar) less than 95 mg/dl and after two-hours PPBS (postprandial blood sugar) as 130 mg/dl. Change your insulin dose to three times daily as it can bring sugar under control. Start taking tablet Glycomet SR 500 mg (Metformin 500 mg) after breakfast and after dinner. Use injection Novomix 50 (soluble Insulin Aspart, Insulin Aspart crystallized, with Protamine) 14 units before the meal in the morning and 14 units before dinner.

Earlier, pus used to come out of the hard structure and began to gather on my belly. Now, after two months, again a little bit of stitch has been opened. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi I had gone through all the details you have posted (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My eggs were retrieved in cycle three months back and this cycle the doctor has planned an embryo transfer. I am on 5 Progynova tablets three times a day plus Oestrogel in the evening. I also had a GSCF. Is this high dose okay? My lining is 7.7 mm and the doctor has advised embryo transfer on day 55. Is doing an embryo transfer on day 55 okay? I would be very grateful if you could advise me on this. I am 37 years old and had two failed embryo transfers a year ago.","Doctor":"Hi. Progynova or Estradiol valerate of up to 8 mg per day is fine. Dose is high, but may be needed to improve endometrium to a minimum of 7 mm. Any thickness of 7 to 14 mm is normal. I could not get what day 55 is. We can transfer in just normal periods or after downregulating with Lupreolide daily injections. So if you have had natural cycle transfer previously, maybe this time try Lupreolide this time. It will suppress all disturbances from your body hormones. Maybe another option is add Ecospirin, Nitric oxide donor or Sildenafil or best and most physiological method is to use HMG (Menotropin) injections. Endometrium will improve very well. Hope infections have been treated and blood sugar and thyroid, prolactin levels are normal. All the best.

My last ferritin level was 342, 20 days back. My ferritin level has been as high as 390. My TIBC, UIBC, iron, and iron saturation have always been within normal range. My glucose has always ranged from 100 to 104. I was tested for hemochromatosis and results are negative. My doctors keep telling me that we will just watch my ferritin level and I have bloodwork done every six months. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia last year. I am looking for some answers and some help.","Doctor":"Hello. Elevated ferritin could be from congenital hemochromatosis but HFE gene mutation is negative, so it is excluded (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Secondly, a hemolytic condition also can be a possibility but serum LDH (lactic acid dehydrogenase), reticulocyte count normal and HB (hemoglobin) also within range, so excluded. If you are having repeated blood transfusion history then provide history regarding that.  I suggest you investigate with transferrin saturation as well next time when you investigate for ferritin. Do not worry about high serum ferritin as all other related parameters are also within range. If ferritin constantly remains elevated than phlebotomy can be done to decrease the ferritin level. Once transferrin saturation investigation has been done, provide history regarding that. Take care.

If the BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) levels were high, it is probably due to heart failure as you said. For the ankle edema, she needs to be given diuretics (drugs which decrease waterlogging) in the body and fluid restriction should be adhered to. Daily intake should be less than 1.1 liters. In addition, medications for heart failure should be started. Also, she needs an echocardiogram to see the underlying cause of heart failure.

Why is it? Am I pregnant? I did not miss any of my tablets. I am having Metformin and Folic acid plus Femilon.","Doctor":"Hi. Femilon (Desogestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol) is an oral contraceptive hormonal pill that works as a contraceptive and can give you side effects as well as how early you get side effects might differ from person to person. Femilon can give you nausea, vomiting, irregular period, mood swing, headache, weight gain, and breast pain, etc. The long-term side effects could be a stroke, high blood pressure, endometrial hyperplasia, breast and uterine cancer, etc. For safe side, better to check serum beta hCG (blood pregnancy test) in case you have missed tablets or had vomited, etc. Try to revise your medications on request due to your symptoms after discussion with your treating doctor as well. Continue Folic acid daily if trying for conception. If cycles get better, you can check after stopping Femilon. In case, if you want contraceptive, better to have tablet Norethisterone 5 mg twice daily from day 4 to day 26 in each cycle cyclically. This will give you contraceptive as well as will regulate your cycles as well. In case of trying for pregnancy, you can just stop Femilon and have sex in the fertile period of the cycle or on alternate days from day 8 to day 18 of your cycles if you feel it is irregular.

The follicular study is a vital component of in vitro fertilization (IVF) assessment and timing. It basically employs a simple technique for assessing ovarian follicles at regular intervals and documenting the pathway to ovulation. A baseline sonography is done on the second or third day of the periods. Tablets are given for inducing ovulation and follicular sonography is started from day 9 of periods, till the ovulation is confirmed.

I have been masturbating since I was 13 years old and ever since then I have been masturbating 2 to 3 times every single day. Now for the past 8 to 10 months, I feel like my erections are very soft and I ejaculate too early. I was also in a very serious relationship and I broke up with my girl about two years ago and I have been very depressed and stressed because of that. I used to smoke a lot which I have cut down almost completely. Also, I have an eye floater in my left eye which I have recently discovered and is caused by excessive masturbation. Now my main question is that, do I have erectile dysfunction? If so, is it because of the stress and depression or is it because of excessive masturbation? Also, I have been taking supplements called Alpha Mars to boost my testosterone level because I feel I have not enough testosterone. It is all natural, is it safe? Can a penis pump improve my erections or cure erectile dysfunction? Please tell me if my problem can be reversed or not. Also, tell me ways to improve my erection.","Doctor":"Hello. It is likely due to stress and depression which is the most common of sexual dysfunction nowadays. In you as well, it is likely to be related to same. So you need to stop worrying about it and have a stress free life. Regular exercises are very important for erections so try to do regular exercises. Also, you should not do masturbation so frequently, as it also affects the sexual function. It reduces the sensitivity of penile nerves and may cause dysfunction. This is all temporary and resolves with time. Also, with masturbation, there is a release of prolactin which antagonizes the effect of testosterone, which is physiological. So, avoid so frequent masturbation and can do it twice or thrice a week.  Alpha mars (Shilajit, Tong Kat Ali, etc.) are usually safe, but you should not have as it is unlikely to be related to low testosterone unless we test for it. So, you may get yourself tested for serum testosterone levels. So, have a healthy lifestyle, try to reduce stress in life, regular exercises, and I think you should avoid Alpha mars at present.

It is persistent for the past one month.","Doctor":"Hi. Carrying heavy grocery bags just once will not cause any numbness in ring finger with a tingling sensation. Do you work for long hours on a computer using the keyboard? Your symptoms indicate nerve entrapment like carpal tunnel syndrome. Even, if your nerve is injured while lifting heavy grocery bags, then by one month, it should have healed as nerve regeneration, it reaches one inch per month.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Sadly, I declined rapidly and lost all my hypotheaner and some of my lumbericals in a matter of six weeks. I was operated on exactly 14 weeks ago where I had a decompression of the ulnar nerve and an anterior interosseous nerve transfer to the motor component of the ulnar nerve so that the nerve axons would reach my hand quicker. I still have no improvement and I wanted to ask if it is possible to transfer muscle to fill in the hand? And will this protect my nerves in the hand? Would it be too soon to be considering this operation?","Doctor":"Hi. Your query is genuine and I am extremely sorry to learn about your problems. To answer, let me explain to you how a nerve grows. It takes one month of latency and later nerve grows at 1 mm per day. Even though the nerve might reach your muscle, for bulk to improve, it takes another few months. For one to determine if the nerve signals have improved, you can get an electromyography to see for any improvement. Decompression will improve sensation very fast and then power. But for muscle bulk, it usually takes a while for muscle transfer to be suitable. In case, you have any form of weakness and never to fill up a cosmetic defect such as hypothenar flatness, for that one can consider fat grafting. If the bulk does not improve after six months. I would advise you to wait as it usually takes longer than 14 weeks. If you want to see and have proof of progress go for EMG. No muscle transfer as per my advise for now if you are not having any weakness.

I am 18 years old and I got my tetanus vaccination when I was 12. Should I go for a tetanus shot or is it unlikely that I contracted the bacterium?","Doctor":"Hello. You have a history of dog bite with little bleeding. For that, antirabies vaccination should be given to prevent a chance of rabies spread. Five doses at 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after exposure is recommended. I suggest you consult a physician for examination.

People who naturally have vaatha type of prakriti (lean body) has the higher chances of constipation. So, I would like to suggest the following: Consume dry grapes whenever you eat snacks, at least four times a day (morning, afternoon, evening and before bed). When taking more dry grapes, there is no problem of constipation. While sleeping, you sleep on the left side. While morning when you are getting up, make sure that you lie down on the left side of the body for at least 10 minutes before getting up from the bed. Sleeping on the right side or other positions will help to increase constipation. Then drink a cup of hot water. Avoid tea, coffee, and smoking if you have these habits.  You see whether your nostril is blocked, it can also cause constipation. Regular pranayama practice done daily can help you to relieve constipation.

I have since been screened for other autoimmune conditions, but so far none have been found. Over the last 2 to 3 weeks, I have been noticing a gradual onset of some strange neurological symptoms. It began with a blurred vision like the static you see on old televisions. I think it is called visual snow. I have also noticed some dizziness when I blink or close my eyes, and I feel like the world is spinning. In the past few days, I have started noticing a tingling sensation in both legs and feet, and it gets worse when I walk and better when I sit down.

If repeated irregular menstruation occurs in future then will think further.

If I am pregnant, how many weeks my pregnancy is?","Doctor":"Hi. Kindly send me your detailed history. Have one serum beta hCG (blood pregnancy test to check your pregnancy status). Have you recently observed any abnormal symptoms like abnormal weight gain, abnormal hair growth as on chin, face, arms, and forearms? Abnormal symptoms can give you polycystic ovarian syndrome actually. Before did you have regular periods? All these questions matters. If the pregnancy test comes positive, then you can go for the first pregnancy scan which could be around 8 to 9 weeks or more pregnancy. If comes negative, then you need a menstrual induction and day two sex hormonal tests and transvaginal scan to check pelvic pathology and discuss all investigations here or with a local gynecologist.

My usual cycles were around 30 days. Before two months, my cycle lasted for 43 days and I thought I was pregnant. But, I was not and had a period that was heavy and passed several clots. After it was over about two weeks went by and then I started spotting brown. It lasted for almost three weeks straight now and it has not stopped at all. It has remained very light the whole time. Yesterday, it got really heavy and red again, so I thought it was my period coming around but today it has stopped. It is just light spotting. This cycle now has been 46 days long. I am not sure what is going on. I am really worried because before now my cycle was always normal for around 30 days. I had been to a gynecologist for painful periods before and he told me that I had cysts on my ovaries and may possibly be getting endometriosis. Before that I had been somewhere else and he told me that I had hormonal imbalance. Did you get any clue what is going on? Should I be afraid that I am not fertile? The longer cycles and constant spotting really worries me. Please let me know your opinion.","Doctor":"Hello. You seem to be experiencing periods irregularity since last two months where I believe your stress levels have been high, which could have delayed your menses. The presence of continued spotting from the mid cycle to till date in this cycle is possibly due to serum progesterone deficiency or luteal phase defect (phase after ovulation and before menses). The presence of ovarian pain was probably indicative of ovulation called mittelschmerz, which was normal guess. Anyhow, you need to get an ultrasound pelvis to rule out any adnexal masses or even PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) which can often be a cause for infertility in women of reproductive age.

The report showed no menopause and thyroid was fine. My two recent pap smears were also normal. I had a hormonal check as I missed my periods four months ago and since then I have had normal periods. Again, this time I have had cramps and brown or slightly red discharge, but no real periods. I have had two pelvic ultrasounds. The first one showed hemorrhagic ovarian cyst and this disappeared on the second ultrasound scan. But, the second once showed a cervical polyp. Ovaries were normal and there is no cancer, pcos or endometriosis. I am going to get the polyp removed after a month through hysteroscopy and D and C. Why have I missed my period? Why do I have cramps and no periods? Why was there brown discharge? Is cervical polyp the reason? My cycle is always 21 to 23 day and today is my 27th day. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. This type of missed period could be due to ovarian cyst, which can also cause painful cramps with brownish spotting. Polyp can also cause pain with brownish spotting.

The doctor suggested Meftal-P. Is it fine to give for 10 months old baby?","Doctor":"Hi. Paracetamol drops are fine. Meftal-P (Mefenamic acid) is a group of drug NSAID which is not first class drug given to babies under 1-year-old. First priority is Paracetamol or Acetaminophen. The reason is NSAID causes closure of the vessel in hearing in the fetal phase. So until the baby grows up, NSAID is not preferred. As fever is high grade, sponge him with a wet towel. This would decrease temperature and then blood circulation will be normal and Paracetamol will reach tissues and work. Watch for other signs like a cough, flu, crying (abdominal pain), and diarrhea. Follow up after three days. Adequate fluid and breastfeed if given. 1.Viral. 2.Bacterial. 1.Complete blood count. 1.Acute gastroenteritis. 2.Respiratory tract infection. 1.Viral fever. 1.Paracetamol drops. 2.Adequate fluid, and food. 3.Wet sponging. 1.Avoid unhygienic measures. 2.No outside food.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Is it possible that my teeth are inherently weak and need more care? What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. Teeth having multiple cavities suggests improper maintenance. It could either be due to improper brushing or too much of sticky food or a hereditary feature. You need to just visit your dentist and get to know the correct way of brushing and also have a meticulously good oral hygiene.

I am 5'6, 120 lbs, and 42 years old female. About a year ago I started having problems with my neck. After MRI, it was determined I had a degenerative disc at my C4 to C7. I opted for no surgery and decided to go the pain management route. Being on Hydrocodone and getting steroid injections for about a year, I decided to stop cold turkey. I went through withdrawal symptoms and a month back I went to the emergency room because of heart palpitations and chest pains and shortness of breath. (Earlier that day, I went for a 4-mile walk). The EKG and X-ray which came back normal. But the laboratory work showed an elevation of TSH at 6.455. All other lab work was fine but I was a little low in potassium (3.4). Blood pressure was normal as well. The doctor on call suggested that I might have hypothyroidism. My question is could the high levels of TSH be a result of withdrawal from Hydrocodone and if so how long will it take to clear up on its own or do I have a thyroid issue that needs to be taken care of?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned it appears that you have subclinical hypothyroidism. You do not need any treatment for that currently but you need to repeat your thyroid function tests after six weeks again just to be on the safe side. Yes, you are right. This sub-clinical hypothyroidism could be due to many reasons, such as your neck trauma followed by steroids treatment and sudden discontinuation of that steroid and then suffering from hypoadrenalism which usually happens when you stop steroids suddenly without tapering them off. So, ultimately you just have to give your body time to heal itself. It could take anything from six months to a year to get back to normal, which is usually what has been observed.

There is no discharge or pain or itching when urinating or ejaculation. I live in a place with high heat and humidity. I also have a lot of sweating during sports-related activity.

Any soothing and moisturizing cream or lotion would help to resolve. Were there any white patches to suggest fungal infection? Did you have any sexual contact recently to suspect any infections? We cannot rule out the possibility of superimposed fungal infection as the fungus is usually present in that area.

If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

This condition was observed 10 years back. Also, there is premature ejaculation. Other physical ailments that I have are, I am suffering from hypertension and taking Amlopres-L (Amlodipine and Lisinopril) for the last 10 years, high cholesterol and triglycerides. My cholesterol level is 225 and triglyceride is 200 for the last 12 years. I used to do frequent masturbation in early age. I do have erection during morning hours many times, particularly after sound sleep or if I had long walk previous day. I am having Sildenafil 25 mg or 5 mg Cialis, which is effective enough. But, I wish to get rid of tablet support and live natural way. I consulted urologist today and he prescribed me Nano-Leo capsules and Modula 5 mg for 10 days. I wish to have your second opinion on this.

After a year, I got ED problem, and I am taking tablet Suhagra 50 mg before having sex which helps in solving the ED problem. But still, I am getting PE. Can you please help me with this?","Doctor":"Hi. Suhagra is Sildenafil, and the drug has a short duration of action.

I have always washed my face 2 to 3 times a day, drank a lot of water, etc., just nothing seems to help and I do not know what to do.","Doctor":"Hi. I have reviewed the attached photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity). If I was your treating doctor I would recommend you to apply a Salicylic acid facewash twice daily and apply Benzoyl peroxide 2.5 percent gel twice daily on the affected areas. Along with this take a course of antibiotic tablet Azithromycin 500 mg daily before lunch or dinner for three consecutive days in a week for six weeks. Besides this, keep face dry, avoid applying oily cream or moisturizers, avoid oiling of the scalp, use cosmetics labeled as noncomedogenic and reduce the intake of sugary foods. Continue this for six weeks and revert back.

I work 7 to 8 hours daily in computer and pain is gradually increasing. The pain earlier used to reduce by taking Voveran tablet and using Voveran gel. The pain has become frequent now and I am taking Tendoshot capsule for the last few days. I also use tennis elbow strap in both hands while working and that gives some comfort. I do a few elbow exercise but that seems not sufficient in reducing pain.  What is the treatment for elbow pain due to computer use? Whether should I take Voveran 50 or Tendoshot for pain relief? Is there any other medicine to use for pain relief? Whether tennis elbow strap or sleeve will be appropriate for this purpose? How to prevent elbow pain while using the computer? How serious can be this elbow pain in future?","Doctor":"Hello. It happens due to excessive use of muscle which causes stretch over the tendon at the origin giving rise to pain. So obviously, best treatment is to somehow restrict the use of muscle as much as possible. Now, you will not be able to avoid computer use but try to restrict other activities like the lifting of heavy weights, and all the motion which involves the use of these muscles like twisting or rotatory motion till it heals. It is not at all serious, it may trouble you, may settle with time or at extremes may need some local injection for the pain to subside. Next thing, you should support your elbow as much as possible during use of computer like keeping on the edge of the chair or using pillows or some other support so as to reduce stress. Also, rather than any medicines, you should use sleeves or brace as much as possible. If not adequately helpful then may have a local Voveran gel (Diclofenac). Tablet Voveran should be avoided as much as possible, and only have if absolutely painful. Tendoshot (Chondroitin sulfate, Vitamin C, etc.) you may have. In painkillers, if you need, safest is Paracetamol like tablet Dolo 650 or Ultracet if it is not helpful then comes Voveran. You may use hot water fomentation. Also, visit local physiotherapists and get some exercises learned for it.

What are the chances of becoming pregnant? Should an I-pill be taken to avoid it?","Doctor":"Hi. The chances of pregnancy are only in the midperiod five days, that is if you had sex in day-12 to 18 of the cycle. You can count the days as first day of your period is the first day of your bleeding. For example, you had four days of periods, then count the first period-free day as day-5 and so on. Secondly, you had protection (condom), that means there are no chances of pregnancy. As per my experience, there is no chance of pregnancy. If some precum touched without a condom, then there are chances, provided your menstrual cycle falls in the ovulation period, that is the 14th day of your period plus or minus two days. Yes, to be on safe side, you may need an I-pill although the chances are too slim for a pregnancy.

How will she handle the heavy bleeding? Is there any medicine to reduce the pain and heavy bleeding?","Doctor":"Hi. After taking Mifegest Kit (Mifepristone with Misoprostol), it is normal to have pain and bleeding. If she is one to two months pregnant, she will have heavy bleeding for two to three days with the passage of products of conception followed by minimal bleeding for a week. If she is more than two months pregnant, she may have heavy bleeding for a week also. It is advisable to take medicine under the supervision of a doctor to avoid complications. She can take tablet Hyocimax MF (Hyoscine butylbromide with Mefenamic acid) three times daily for pain. Take tablet Pause 500 mg (Tranexamic acid) three times daily for heavy bleeding.

They just told me I have been having a lot of tachycardia lately but with a normal rhythm. They told me I should be fine but I feel I am not. Three months back, I had gone into cardiac arrest due to a drug overdose when I got a laced pill full of Fentanyl when I tried to get the old medication I was once prescribed, Adderall. It took 12 mg of Naloxone to bring me back to life. Then about six months ago I had an ER visit because I decided to take what I thought was MDMA with some friends for a party. I do not take drugs anymore. The drug test only came back for Amphetamine and I took around 200 mg of the drug Methamphetamine. I started to go into cardiac arrest again but was luckily brought back to normal levels. It was a scary experience which haunts me now causing anxiety whenever I notice my heart rate go up. Three months ago I started to display worse symptoms. My cardiologist only put me on a heart monitor for three weeks but said I had a lot of tachycardia with a normal rhythm. I am not quite sure whether it is just anxiety or if my heart may actually have problems. I am only 18 but I feel these close calls might have put a toll on my heart. I just need somewhat of an answer on whether these experiences could have caused one term problems to my heart at my age. I do not do any drugs anymore. I vape but that is all. I get chest pains through the day and sometimes will get light headed and cannot think clearly. I will space out and not pay attention to anything else around me. I am worried it is a heart problem or could be PTSD cause from those events. Any information will help.","Doctor":"Hello. Likely it is an anxiety only causing you tachycardia. If possible please attach your reports like monitoring report, and echo if you have. Echo will tell us whether there are any residual effects on the heart of your previous problems. You should get a thyroid test done to rule out hyperthyroidism if did not have recently. You may use a portable monitor which is a mobile-based portable system to keep watch over heart rhythm. It is better you get started on Ciplar which is a beta-blocker that help to control heart rate and anxiety. Consider regular exercises to tone your heart.

Should she be administered medicine for hypothyroidism?","Doctor":"Hello. There are higher chances of hypothyroidism in a patient who has hypoadrenalism (Addison's disease). These both conditions can be the manifestation of the same underlying process (autoimmune). If your mother is symptomatic (weakness, dry skin, hair loss, constipation, pedal edema, etc.), then she requires thyroid supplement.

What treatment can cure her?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern, the report of your mother is clearly showing a food pipe cancer (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This cancer has not been staged yet. So she will have to undergo some more investigations including PET/CT scan, transesophageal ultrasound, and some blood tests. Once the staging workup is completed, she will be planned for management. The various modalities of treatment in this cancer include concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy, surgical excision of the tumor.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

If not, the PP (postprandial) might be lower as it depends upon the calories taken in during breakfast and the amount of insulin produced by the body.

I do have a cavity on the top row beside my front tooth, but would that affect my bottom teeth too? The pain feels like a dull pressure, so maybe it is the wisdom teeth? I am 18, so I suppose it is possible, but I do not have insurance or the money to figure out any solutions. My teeth have started hurting more since I started brushing them more often. I only brush in the morning and at night, but I brush for about five minutes each time. Could that be bothering my teeth, and the cavities I already have?

The brain does not listen if other person speaks, or anything that requires moderate attention like a difficult lesson or an English movie or very new issues and tries to skip it. Due to this problem, I need to read the books, again and again, to get familiar to talk in public or practice it. Even if I practice many times, after some weeks, I cannot recollect what I read exactly. Due to this problem, I am unable to crack PG entrance. I feel ashamed. Even though I am a student of English medium, I fear to talk and search for words while talking. I tried to learn good fluent English, but I am unsuccessful. Is this dyslexia with combined neurasthenia too? I used to score 95 % but after this problem started, I am just able to stick to 60 % and I am unable to digest very low academic growth. There seems to be no treatment in allopathy for this.I feel back muscles ache and when I do some physical work, I feel full body ache. Even without any work, I feel back muscles ache. I sleep more. I am able to work more at night times than early in the morning. I wake up at around 8 to 8.30 AM whether I sleep at 9 PM or 2 AM. I try a lot. One should be able to wake up after six to eight hours of sleep and feel satisfied, but for me, it is not true. My polysomnogram was normal. More the mental work, I sleep more. For example, if I study for a few hours, I may need to sleep for 12 to 16 hours. While studying, I go to sleep. But while doing other works, I do not sleep automatically. Due to sleep, I have lesser time than others. In this time, I am facing difficulty to manage myself, wife, home, job, next level studies, business issues, outside problems, etc. I am very easily tired with mental work than physical work. I am ruled out for depression as my problems or most of the symptoms are starting only if I start reading (memory) or physical activity. Else, I feel somewhat alright. I got these three problems when I was 18 years old and these symptoms were not given attention by my parents. Later, I went to hospitals but no proper treatment was given and I am trying to cope with them. But these dominate my self-confidence regularly.I have taken just one dose of Lycopodium 200, Baryta Carbonica 200 with one week gap. After taking Baryta, I have some discomfort and hence stopped. I tried Kaliphos few years ago and felt the symptoms aggravated and stopped using it. I have shown to doctors (psychiatry also) and they are unable to come to a specific diagnosis and said I am normal. My hemogram, CT, MRI, thyroid profile, and polysomnogram are normal. No alcohol or smoking or any other habits.Below, I am mentioning a summary of my mind and behavior to conclude what type of homeopathy medication personality I am:I fear to take change. For example, if I am doing a job, when any better job opportunity comes by, I fear to apply for change or travel. Hence, I am losing ways to improve in my field.I fear to talk in public.I fear when I see from the second or third floor of the building to down.I fear to tell lies. Many people easily tell lies and survive. For me even if it is mandatory, I feel difficult to lie. I am afraid of money matters. I will leave my money due to modest/bashful/hesitation problem. In this way, I am losing money.I cannot defend myself even though I know I am correct or right. I cannot convince others to accept what and why I did something. I just stand silently before them as if I did a mistake.I cannot convey properly what is in my mind and it comes out in a different way. Hence, even if I do better work than others, I am not focused enough to sell the idea.I hide my sad feelings inside.I cannot praise myself in front of others even if I did a good job where many people praise themselves even for a small work.Tears come while watching sentimental scenes in TV shows or movies. But I do not cry in real life easily. May be in childhood I cried, and later learned not to cry. I think more about other's feelings and care about them. I compromise myself. If my wife asks me for a huge sum of money, I give the money, even if I do not want to. But, when it comes spending even a small amount on myself I just let go even if it is something important.I change easily to other's feelings or moods or other's mentality. I lose my identity in the process sometimes and think later that I am changing and try to come back.I feel that I am having a struggle with my mind to keep it in track. An example is, I trained my mind not to eat rice (carbs) at night times. But, if I see people eating at night, I start eating (I adoptto their behavior).I am not rigid with my character or feelings.I think about money, but when I get money, I feel I do not care about it. This might make some people around me feel that I am stingy and a miser but the fact is I am not.People think differently and talk outside as if everything is normal. I tried to follow it but I am unsuccessful. Because to please somebody or to be happy, one should pretend or change to talking situations. Also, I put on weight easily. I stopped eating rice at night times. Just eating half of what other people eat for my age. My father is obese and may be I got those genes. Due to strict food control, I now weigh 68 kg which is near normal to my height. I cannot utilize the situation due to my above-mentioned symptoms like fear of change, afraid in money matters, cannot defend, convey my message well, etc.I sweat more. I feel intolerant to heat. I cannot sleep without a blanket.I feel irritable if work does not happen in time. I get normal if someone consoles me (with jokes) or by myself after some time. But never fire easily on others. I hide my true self.I do not get headache, vomiting or have indigestion problem.I might be polite if in someone's mind I am less than them. But when I reach to the feeling of a good person in their mind, I try to not be polite or good but will be polite only but think that way.I curse myself if somebody undergoes some suffering due to my mistakes. I have gone to that road (accident situation) or been late, etc. If someone accidentally hits my bike, I am afraid to ask them why they came in the wrong direction and ask for compensation. I am not interested to go outside for evening walks. No strong feelings for a particular activity. I do for a few days and stop. Not maintaining daily habit.I am a workaholic and I do not like postponing. I get angry if someone postpones the work.I have some child-like mentality. Helping nature.In my feeling revenge on any issue/problem is to give answer with success. But due to these above behavioral problems and symptoms, I am having low academic, personal, professional and social functioning. I strongly believe that homeopathy can treat mental and emotional symptoms better than any medicine and hence I mentioned the three symptoms due to which I am unable to lead a peaceful life. According to my mentality, what medicines suit me? According to my disease/symptoms, what medicines will help? Kindly help me out.","Doctor":"Hello. According to your narration, you have only fear and lack of self-confidence and self-motivation. Actually, you have no symptoms of dyslexia and you have only stage fear. According to your narration, you are very sensitive and you always feel that you are making mistakes. You have a feeling like you were circumspect by others. But no one has time to observe you. Everyone will be busy with their own work. You get tears while watching sentimental scenes - it is quite common. Actually, you are a very talented person, you can do anything, only if you can delete all these negative thoughts from your mind. One suggestion for you. If you try to proceed with your next step in your career, there might be a 50 % chance of failure. But if you do not even try, there will be a 100 % failure. So try and try until you reach your goal. I have gone through all the symptoms you have mentioned in the query and came to a conclusion to select a homeopathic medicine which suits your symptoms - Gelsemium 1M (10 pills once in 5 days for 15 days) and after 15 days take Anacardium 1M one dose (10 pills) only.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Then you need to take one tablet daily almost at the same time to get better results. As the pack contains 21 tablets, take it for 21 days. Then wait for seven days and then start a new package again. During this seven day break, you will get your periods.

Long story short, she performed oral on me for about 30 seconds and I performed oral on her for maybe about the same, less than a minute, no intercourse. About two weeks after my friend came down with a cold and so did my brother, that Sunday I felt a little weird too but had gone to the beach. At the beach, I ended up swallowing a lot of seawater accidentally. That entire week I had headaches, stomach felt weird every time I ate and a little sore throat. So my mind went back to the day I met that girl and started freaking out. Three weeks after my oral exposure, I did an HIV RNA test with a fourth generation duo combo test and came back negative. My headaches continued for a little over two weeks on and off. After 25 days of the exposure, she did RNA and fourth generation which also came back negative. During the fourth week, I did another fourth-generation myself and also negative again. On week five, I went to a clinic, did a rapid blood drawn test and a NAAT test, and all came back negative. Week six (42 days) did another fourth generation and was negative. 52 days little over seven weeks I went and did an HIV 2 RNA test, and today at 53 days did an HIV RNA test and fourth generation duo. After all, these tests, am I in the clear? If I had HIV symptoms for a few weeks already would I test positive by now? Does it matter if I got her tested to give me reassurance?","Doctor":"Hello. As you had enough sea water inside, it would have caused a sore throat. In all the tests you are found negative especially fourth generation which is very authentic and correct. So, no HIV infection is there. You have done a very good job to test the girl which is also negative. So, no HIV is possible. So, you are free from HIV.  For more information consult an HIV AIDS specialist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My husband and I have been trying to conceive and I have been trying to track my ovulation and I should have it correct but every time I take my ovulation test it says I am at low fertility even on my peak day. I do not know if I am doing something wrong or what. I just need some guidance. I have a really irregular period and have had complications in the past where I have lost substantial amounts of blood causing me to be hospitalized. The doctors do not have a specific answer for why my body does it but my body will not shed the uterine lining on its own.","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? The single reason for all your problems like poor cycles, no ovulation, excessive bleeding is your weight. Your expected weight is 55 to 57 kg. You must be having PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease). Extra weight is typically in the central part of the body. Typically distribution is above your elbow and knee joint. Mainly around arms, breast, back, abdomen, waist, and thighs. This fat is converted into estrogenic hormones, so also testosterone, the male hormone. Thus altering your hormonal balance, which is needed for normal ovulation. Symptoms that you may face due to this imbalance are hair fall, excessive hair growth, acne over face, back, arms, oily face, skin pigmentation on the face. Dark pigmentation over the back of the neck, the undersurface of breast and inner thighs. Skin tags over the neck. So when you have no ovulation on time, pregnancy will not occur and periods are also altered. When you have periods after a long gap, it will be heavy, painful. So, the single solution is to lose weight. Have a healthy diet, no junk foods. Lots of raw fruits and vegetables. Aerobics, yoga, exercises specific to the area where fat is more. Reduce weight gradually at 2 to 3 kg per month. You will definitely have regular periods and pregnancy. Do not worry. All the best.

I am ultimately unable to do well at my job and studies and badly need to get rid of this as soon as possible. And get start to be good at health.","Doctor":"Hello. Wet dreams and masturbation both are a normal phenomenon. They do not cause any weakness or sexual dysfunction contrary to popular belief. Actually, it is the associated guilt and anxiety due to social myths that cause problems instead. There is no fixed store of sperms that will last neither they provide any energy to the body.

The doctor has removed the stent on 31st but the fever has continued with shivering. There is no detection of dengue, malaria, or sepsis. What is the cause of high fever? Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. The stent and its removal induce inflammation which in turn can lead to fever. Paracetamol 500 mg SOS can be prescribed for fever.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

There is no research that supports diet or eye exercises to improve the condition. However, avoiding excessive near work (such as using mobiles, tablet, computer) helps.  A 6 monthly checkup with the ophthalmologist for refraction testing (with and without cycloplegia) and fundus examination is needed to monitor progression. In most cases, with the use of refractive correction, improvement is seen. In some cases, the refractive error may progress (pathological myopia), wherein the retina also gets involved.

You can get a blood test for STD (sexually transmitted disease) panel to be on the safer side and avoid unprotected sexual intercourse with an unknown partner. CMIA (chemiluminescence microparticle immunoassay) is the fourth generation test. It can detect both HIV antibody and p24 antigen simultaneously due to a coating of microtiter plates with both antigen and antibody for HIV simultaneously.

But I stopped it now because of my small penis. I am losing my confidence level on everything. Please, suggest me a permanent solution for penis enlargement and curvature.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). First of all, there is no medicine to increase the size of the penis. It is not a muscle. Medications are available to treat erectile dysfunction and other problems. The size of the penis after erection should be between 4 to 6 inches, and the extent you have mentioned falls under the standard category. So there is no need to worry about the size. Your next concern is about curvature. The mild curvature is not a big problem. It can be present in many people. I cannot tell you exactly about it. So for that, you can visit a nearby urologist or a reputed ayurveda physician or any general physician so that he can examine you clinically and guide you appropriately. Do not take any random medicine in the name of ayurvedic medicine. You are almost normal except about one concern, so for that visit your physician. There is no need to lose confidence without any reason.

Lately, I experienced abdominal pain accompanied by lower back pain and every morning I have experienced difficulty in urinating that started four days from now. I have no edema. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. It seems you are a hypertensive patient as you are taking Losartan but the side effect of Losartan is abdominal pain and diarrhea but in your case situation is different. You have difficulty in urination and if you have lower abdominal pain then my straight diagnosis is renal and ureteric calculi. It means there may be some stones in your excretory pathway. So, for that, get an ultrasound of abdomen done and drink plenty of water. To prevent infection, take tablet Oflox OZ (Ofloxacin and Ornidazole) 650 mg one tablet three times per day plus tablet Pan 40 (Pantoprazole) one tablet three times per day for seven days but be sure to get an ultrasound of your abdomen done.

The report of the semen analysis is normal according to the criteria at present, but this is just a structural test. It does not evaluate the function of the sperms which can be the cause of infertility.

I exercise daily and eat healthy throughout the day but due to this night eating problem, I am not able to lose weight.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have and gone through your query and would like to say that an abscess requires antibiotic coverage and specific treatment of the cause. If it is because of a cavity in the tooth, we can go for root canal treatment or extraction based on the condition of the tooth. If it is because of gums and supporting tissues, cleaning, curettage and further minor surgery if required has to be done. So, kindly visit you nearby dentist for examination and treatment. Do not worry. It can be treated. Since you have a chronic infection, it might shoot up anytime when your immunity goes low and cause pain too. So, better visit your dentist as soon as possible. You can send me an image of the tooth and lesion to guide you more properly with a provisional diagnosis. Anyways confirmation can be done with X-ray along with clinical examination only.

Again, at the 20th week, I had done an antibody test for HIV 1, and HIV 2 which also came nonreactive and the value was 0.385. Does this mean that the HIV antibody is building up gradually?

It came in two months after exposure, and till now it remains there for three months. Any chance of being positive later? Is my test conclusive? Should I get tested?

I am taking tablet Finasteride for hair loss and Vitamin supplements.","Doctor":"Hi. I have noted your concern, and I have viewed the image (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your tests are conclusive. An intervening period of 12 weeks between exposure and screening test is considered good enough for it to be reliable. The index value may vary slightly between tests on different occasions but that does not mean it is going to cross over from a non-reactive result to a reactive result. The raised lesion on your thigh is most likely a dermatofibroma. It is a benign lesion and is not an STD (sexually transmitted disease).

Sometimes, it pains on the back side as well. I can feel the pain when I press the body part where the pain originates. The pain aggravates when I press. There is no accompanied shortness of breath or sweating at all. Please note that pain may not be there in all the areas at the same time. Like for now, at this point in time, I only have very mild discomfort in front area near the shoulder and breast.Some of the points to consider for diagnosis:I am hypertensive. However, my BP is very well controlled (110/80) with Metoprolol and Amlodipine. I also take Atorvastatin 10 mg for cholesterol. I am now asked to stop Atorvastatin. I am on these medications since last one year. All my below tests (one year old) are normal. EKG.Chest X-ray.Brain CT scan.Pulmonary embolism.All blood works.48 hours Holter monitor.No murmur or gallop noticed.Arterial oxygen levels.Troponin levels.All my recent blood works (two months old) like lipid profiles, kidney function test, CBP, liver function test, HbA1c, vitamin profiles (vitamin D, B12, calcium, iron), sodium, potassium, urine exam are normal. I walk daily for 20 to 30 minutes. Occasionally, I run too and do not experience any pain. Sometimes, I take stairs and do not experience any shortness of breath or pain. I had a different variant of chest pain last year. I did EKG, TMT and 2D echo and results are normal findings. It was diagnosed with non-cardiac pain. I have some mild to moderate irrational anxiety (GAD) and I am not sure if the pain I am experiencing is of psychosomatic origin. I had my left shoulder dislocated some 20 years back. In last 20 years it dislocated almost 7 to 8 times of which four times, I had to go to the hospital and get it fixed non-surgically. All other times it got fixed on its own. Last time it dislocated was I am not sure if the pain is causing because of that. I was very poor in following the instructions about wearing a sling and all. I used to be sling free immediately after shoulder is replaced back. Although I never had any problem with my left shoulder or arm, I intermittently used to get some mild pain in shoulder and upper arm. My left hand is fully functional. Although, I am careful in not rotating it 360 with a fear that it might get dislocated.Currently, I do not have acidity so I think the pain does not seem to be related to GERD. 2D echo and TMT were done just one year back and returned normal, do I need to re-do these tests? Since then I believe things should have only been improved as I made a lot of lifestyle and dietary changes. BP is very much controlled. It is always 110/80, Resting heart rate is good too. 70 to 80 BPM. Lipid profile is normal. LDL (73), HDL (46), Total (145). If it is musculoskeletal pain, could you please suggest some medicine? I am looking for something that does not disturb my BP and heart rate. Is (Tramadol + Acetaminophen) good? Please suggest some potent and safe medicine that can relieve the pain and relax the muscles. One of the DMs I contacted in person is of the opinion that it may be psychosomatic in nature and prescribed a combination of Flupentixol and Escitalopram. But I am scared of the listed possible side effects like thrombosis, QT prolongation, etc. So I did not start it yet. What is your view on this combination drug? Is it safe to give it a try for four months and then wean off over next two months? Can you suggest any other anti-anxiety which is having a safest cardio-metabolic profile?","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, it is not at all related to the heart. Cardiac pain usually increases on exertion and relieves with rest. It will never increase on pressing or arm movement. You do not need to repeat any test.  Coming to possibilities, psychosomatic is certainly a possibility, but considering the site of pain, there is also a possibility of a cervical spine problem. Do you have any tingling, numbness in arm, neck stiffness, increase in pain on neck movements, neck trauma in the past, etc,? If yes, it suggests the possibility of cervical spondylosis. So I think, it is worthwhile to get X-ray cervical spine done anteroposterior or lateral view. Just check, sometimes during CT head, they may include neck region as well. If yes, then no need of X-ray.  Regarding medicines, Tramadol is the safest as far as BP is concerned. However, it may not be that effective. You may try tablet Naproxen 250 mg two times a day after meals. Only problem is with this, in some (minor) patients, it may slightly raise BP which will come back to normal after it has stopped. So I think, it is worthwhile to try it. Also, you should try muscle relaxant tablet Myoril 4 mg whenever needed upto three times a day and look for a response. If gets a positive response then we can complete the course of five days. This should not cause any significant cardiac issues in you. Regarding, antianxiety medicine, I think there is no need to have Flupentixol, and better to avoid it. However, Escitalopram, we use very frequently and it is quite safe. Side effects like QT and all are very rare so you may have it. It comes in combination with Etizolam as Etizola plus which is a good antianxiety medicine to have during bedtime for a week or so.

MRI was prescribed by my ENT doctor because I was very stressed. Gadolinium was injected during the MRI. It turns out the MRI was pretty normal, no tumor, no anomaly or else.

I want to assure you that do not worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. Started back even before six years you had the onset of what we call Parkinson disease. This is a disease, nobody may ever be able to stop or make it to a pause even with medications. But we may delay the onset of symptoms of the disease for sure.  The dopamine-producing neurons are lost in the brain and the patient loses the inhibitory effect of the neurotransmitter dopamine on our activities. The patient presents with unintentional movements of body parts which were normally kept in check by the inhibitory action of the brain chemical dopamine. In treatment, you are taking the best available therapy LevoDopa-CarbiDopa. Patients give a positive response to this drug. You need to carry on the treatment. This will help you keep the symptoms suppressed for as long as you keep taking the medicine. Temazepam is also good for you. It is a second line drug treatment and controls the shakiness and tremors.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

As I am a tall person with 6'4\\" height I feel very unique with the way others see me. This problem has started from around five years slowly and I think I am in its peak stage. I always have run away from facing people who know me. I feel that others think I am somewhat inappropriate. If there is any function in around my house, I used to skip from those by making excuses so that I do not have to face people.

Your case can contain just pieces of advice and way to do over the internet. Seems you are suffering from a social anxiety disorder. In general, these kinds of disorders are not treated via medications. The only way is taking sessions of CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) in person in order to discover what your unconscious brain keep and unlock it.

Any treatment or way to have a healthy baby and near to due date? IUD 18 weeks, fifth-week pregnancy due to no fetal heart rate, so DNE was done. Currently, I am taking Duphaston 10 mg BD, Asgard 75 mg OD, Glucophage 500 mg TDS, and Aldomet 250 mg QID two tablets.","Doctor":"Hi. It would be better if you can send me your ultrasound report. You have the previous history of stillbirth around 19 weeks. At present, as your medicines that you have described here, you have been on diabetes and blood pressure control drugs and placental supportive drugs as well. Blood pressure is towards higher limit and urine protein is also high that is showing your kidneys are affected and secreted protein in the urine. Due to high protein and blood pressure that is confirming preeclampsia, placenta insufficiently working and nutrition that needs to reach baby is not reaching to the baby that why growth retardation is confirmed in the scan and this is completely pathological. Your high blood pressure and urine protein are also really alarming as there are chances of eclamptic fits any time. That can be life-threatening to you. The only solution for preeclampsia is delivery, actually, if this is affecting mother and baby both too much. But, how and when that depends on the whole scenario of the patient, her vitals, signs, blood and urine reports, her scan report and baby's condition. Placental insufficiently also having grading that is helpful to make a decision. If the reversed flow in dopplers scanning is poor prognosis for intrauterine growth restricted fetus of preeclamptic, diabetic mother (who have a history of the previous stillbirth). As I do not have your complete history and recent scan but you need strict monitoring in high dependency unit. Baby is also very premature and growth-restricted as well, lung not developed and need months to develop. If delivers prematurely alive due to your unstable condition, it will need neonatal premature intensive care unit support for months and risk of neonatal infections, neonatal death even is very high. Lung supportive injection (Dexamethasone) can be given but still, the tissue that can respond to that injection nicely is still in a very early stage of development. Under your high blood pressure, sugar levels and low placental perfusion with abnormal dopplers and growth restriction not only you have chances of eclamptic fits that will worsen your condition but also greater risk of intrauterine fetal death. Strict diabetic diet, with almost nil salt, blood thinning medications (tablet Aspirin and injection Heparin), strict sugar and blood pressure control with normal blood, urine investigations, normal vital signs, and scan, stress free life with light exercise or walk from start of pregnancy were the basic rules to treat patient like you (with high BP, sugar, and previous stillbirth).

It is more obvious when I take pictures. Is there anything I can do or will I need to do a surgery?","Doctor":"Hi. From your photo (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I can tell you that the upper eyelid of your right eye is drooping down. It is a medical condition called ptosis. Although your right eyeball is not small, due to the drooping, it gives us a false impression that it is small. The main problem is in the eyelid. It is a benign condition and apart from cosmesis, has no relevance to the function of the eye. Does your eyelid drooping remain constant or does it vary depending on the time of day? If yours is a variable ptosis, you will need to be tested and treated for muscle disorders. But if your drooping is a constant one, then I can tell you that this condition will need surgery and there is no other remedy for this.

I know he is still too young, but when he is not feeling well or he is tired, he gets very deep sleep and he urinates himself- basically, he is bedwetting. Well, I have to admit that I was bedwetting till I was 14 years old, my father also was bedwetting when he was young. I know it is too early to say, but can he have the same problem when I was young and I was bedwetting? My problem was, that time to time I get very deep sleep and I did not respond to signal sent to my brain that my bladder is full. So, I wake up time to time wet. The second question, I see in him the same thing when I was young and also he is bedwetting when he is not well or very tired, he gets deeply sleep, but when he wakes up he is fine. Last time he gets a little bit higher temperature 38. I did not give him any medicine and let him sleep when he wakes up, he was wet, but the temperature was gone and he was fine. So what do you think? Any advice?","Doctor":"Hi. There is no co-relation between bedwetting and temperature. So do not worry about that. Also as regards to bedwetting, make it a point for the child to empty the bladder before going to bed. Also, you can wake up the child in the middle of the night if you find out that he has bedwetted himself so that this develops a behavioral change in the child and eventually will go a long way in stopping bed wetting. Another technique that can be used is a bedwetting alarm which sounds when the bed becomes wet and wakes the child up. This can also help in reducing the instances of bedwetting. In extreme cases, we use vasopressin to reduce bed wetting. Also, bedwetting beyond the age of 5 years is not acceptable. Hence, follow the above mentioned advise and observe the changes in your child. For more information consult a paediatrician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 38 year old female.

My bike heats up abnormally and when I tested for the heat levels the heat reaches a maximum of 45.6 degrees C near upper thigh which in turn also provides heat towards testicles. I could not concentrate on work and I do not get proper sleep. I also have undertaken medications and the abnormal feeling near testicles is gone. But whenever I ride the bike I could feel the same issue for the next two days.Kindly provide me your suggestion regarding what is the optimum temperature that could be felt on upper thighs and I want to know whether 45 degree C near upper thighs will cause any issues because I will be driving the bike at this temperature for at least one hour a day. May I continue using this bike for my daily usage?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. The purpose of the testicles being outside the body is to keep them cooler than the rest of the body by about two degrees which is essential for optimal function of the testes. Prolonged increase in temperature in the region of the scrotum will definitely affect testicular function in the long run. This happens over a period of several years and not in few weeks or months and the extent of damage also cannot be predicted as the body has excellent defense mechanisms to maintain a scrotal temperature in spite of external environment. If it is possible for you to avoid driving your motorcycle it would certainly benefit you, however, it is the scrotal temperature and not that of your thighs that matter.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I have high BP sometimes，and now taking Bisoplor and coenzyme q10.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, the possibility of ARVC (arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) is less. MRI or echo would pick changes in the right ventricle. I guess right ventricle is normal on echo and MRI so unlikely to be ARVC. Next thing, you mentioned about thickening of the septum in MRI. What is about your echo finding, does it suggest anything pointing towards hypertrophic cardiomyopathy? So we should rule out hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. If possible, please upload your echo, MRI and routine ECG for interpretation. Regarding the possibility of viral myocarditis, it would show some changes on echo or MRI so that is also a less likely possibility if echo and MRI not showing any consistent changes. Also, troponin would be positive in active myocarditis.

I got kicked in the face and due to this two weeks after my injury, I had to have a tripod put on the left side of my face. Two weeks after that my eye was drooped and had to have the floor of my eye orbital replaced. The surgeon said my eye was pushed back 5 mm and the floor was gone and he had to rebuild a new floor and moved my eye forward. The surgery was done a year back. It has been over a year my eye still looks drooped to me. At times throughout the day also it tends to open up around it making it look extremely worse. I also still have no feeling in my face and if I drink alcohol my face drops a bit. I am guessing that had something to do with it relaxing my nerves. To me, it just looks like it is getting worse. I do not like the outcome of it, there are people who tell me they cannot tell and others who notice it right away. I see a huge difference. My eye looks lazy and glossy. This has been really aggravating to me considering well, this is my face. From the research I did I understand it can take up to a year to appear normal again. Is this true? Will my eye elevate on its own? Will I ever get feeling back in my face? I think it should be getting a lot better and to me, it is not. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your query. I will attempt to answer individual parts of your query separately to maintain clarity. Starting with appearance, yes it is a gradual process of normalization and it will get better with time. First-year produces most of that improvement, the improvement will continue, but at a much-reduced pace after the first year. After the second year, further progress is unlikely. What you see at the end of two years is pretty much it in terms of appearance. Moving on to the second part of the query, the numbness and face dropping is due to nerve damage, it depends on how bad the nerve injury is and what type of injury it is. Nerves may have injuries ranging from a mild crush or stretch to a full severance or transection. Since you only report numbness and dropping when alcohol is consumed, not more severe symptoms of facial paralysis with drooling saliva, I am assuming it is a milder type of injury. If that is the case the numbness will slowly improve over the years, but nerve tissue is inherently slow healing by nature so it will take some time. It is unfortunate you must experience this trauma and wish you all the best for your recovery.

Previously, Roaccutane, clear skin for about six months, breaking out again but nowhere near as severely and only really on my cheeks with hormonal ones on my jaw and chin.","Doctor":"Hi. Erythromycin is a hepatic enzyme inhibitor meaning it will delay the metabolism of Lucette (Ethinylestradiol and Drospirenone) thus allowing increased levels of the hormone in the bloodstream for a longer duration than normal. Hence the effect of contraception will not be hampered but the side effects of the pill may be more apparent, including acne breakouts.

I am taking Betaloc 12.5 mg, Ecospirin 75 mg, Warfarin 5 mg, Fibator 5 mg. Last week, I went out of the station, and I had a significant amount of traveling.","Doctor":"Hi. It is likely a viral fever only as it settles within four to five days. ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (C-reactive protein) are usually elevated due to viral fever or any other fever. As it gets recovered within four to five days without any antibiotics, then it is likely a viral fever, and the possibility of other infection goes down like infective endocarditis, typhoid, malaria. So there is no need to get worried. One may get repeated viral fever with travel, change in environment or change in food and the body clears it successfully. So there is nothing to worry about it.  Since you have an aortic valve replacement, then we have to be vigilant regarding the possibility of infective endocarditis. So you should get your ESR and CRP done after two weeks, and if they are still elevated, then you should get an echocardiogram done to rule out infective endocarditis.

Since I married late, is it safe to conceive now or will I face any health issues? If safe, then when should I have sex to conceive at the earliest?","Doctor":"Hi. There is risk involved for conceiving at this age. Age-related screening is needed before conception even if you both are healthy and do not have any problem. As long waited oocytes (eggs) will be involved in conception, there are a few tests for conception at this age to check baby either it is free from anomaly or not like chronic villus sampling, amniocentesis and double, triple or quadruple tests to check early conception for excluding fetal anomalies. I am not confirming any mishap but it is the only recommendation for lots of precautions. If you and your husband have been treated for any disease, better to take full treatment like thyroid or diabetes. Quit smoking, tobacco, alcohol and other recreational drugs. Start Folic acid 0.4 mg a day if you are not having any disease. If having diabetes or epilepsy, have 5 mg Folic acid per day. Detailed preconception counseling and precautions are required in case of any disease if you have, like for diabetes, you have to achieve specific HbA1c level. If it is high, it is too dangerous to get pregnant and would recommend to avoid it. Similarly, renal, eye check-up is needed and frequent sugar level monitoring as well. Similarly, Insulin is mostly recommended in pregnancy with Metformin but rest of the drugs are mostly avoided for a safe pregnancy and nice outcome.

She used to take the 5 mg without any problems, for almost a year. A couple of months ago, she started a course of Accutane. At first, she took 20 mg per day, now it is down to 10 mg per day, and it made her sensitive to her Ambien when she would take that. When she cut the 5 mg pill and took what looked to be close to 1 mg worth, she would develop this strange alcohol-like breath about an hour after taking the pill. The breath would go away after 30 to 45 minutes. She also has complained of her entire body's skin getting itchy for about the same time period, after taking the low-dose Ambien. I have told her to quit the Ambien while she's on the Accutane, but she is trying to give herself small doses, that still result in those reactions. Are these reactions symptoms of something much more dangerous, or are they like an allergy and not indicative of permanent damage? Any help is appreciated. I am trying to weigh when and how to approach this subject with her.","Doctor":"Hello. Take care and God bless.

I have tried all remedies suggested online and it is not going down in size at all. Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hello. The history you give is suggestive of a condition called a chalazion (inflammation of sebaceous glands in the lid) which is typically painless. Secondly, it could also be an internal hordeolum (infection in the meibomian glands of the lid) which is generally associated with pain, and it being on the inner side of the lid is not visible externally. The treatment for a chalazion is generally conservative, which requires repeated applications of hot fomentation with a mild lid massage for at least two weeks. If this does not resolve still, you may need a small surgical procedure to get it drained. On the other hand, an internal hordeolum will require a short course of oral antibiotics and topical antibiotic ointments along with anti-inflammatory painkillers, supplemented with hot fomentation and lid massage.

Over the past few days she has complained of the urge to pass urine quite often and sometimes as much as several times within an hour. When she does visit the toilet, she sometimes passes little or no urine. Last night we got her tested for UTI and the test came back negative. We are concerned and exhausted. We look forward to getting your input. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. The increased frequency of urination and urinary incontinence are due to bladder overactivity. Your mother should undergo an urodynamic study to know what exactly is happening in the bladder during filling. I think she will get good benefit by taking antimuscarinics like Trospium hydrochloride or Darifenacin. For further information consult a urologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

If it is healing it is well and good, but most of the wound at this stage will either: Savlon, we do not prefer as a cleansing agent, as it irritates the granulation more. Better use plain saline.

So, I decided to take the ring off, but during that time, it was menstruation. I never had a normal flux, just spotting all the time. At first, kind of brown and after, redder and then brown again. Because that was not normal for me, I went to a gynecologist that did a Pap test (I do not know the results yet), but prescribed me a gel for five nights called Nidagel. After a week without the ring, I put a new one and today, a week before the cycle, I notice that the spotting has started again. I am super worried.","Doctor":"Hello. Nuvaring is Etonogestrel and Ethinylestradiol containing contraceptive. Hormones have its own side effects and appear a bit differently in every individual female. Combined contraceptives have short-term effects like abnormal bleeding, spotting, mood variations, breast engorgement, etc., and long-term effects like stroke, migraine, high blood pressure, venous thromboembolism, breast, and endometrial cancer. You might have bleeding as a side effect of Nuvaring or there could be other possibilities as well. Cervical pathology like dysplasia, erosion, cervical or endometrial polyp, any local inflammatory lesion, pelvic infection, or hormonal effects. It is better to have one high vaginal swab as well to exclude any pelvic pathology. Collect HVS and smear reports and discuss here or with your gynecologist. This brown discharge shows old clotted blood around NuvaRing. Oral contraceptive itself has side effects of irregular bleeding. So, if you have been on Nuvaring for years, I suggest replacing it with other contraceptives. Mirena reduces periods bleed gradually but again hormonal contraceptives have its own side effects. Better to have one local outpatient hysteroscopic examination to clear all local causes.

Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello. A delay of three days is not considered as irregularity. Also, urine home pregnancy test is not sensitive before eight days past missed menses. Please rule out any chances of pregnancy with a serum beta hCG test (human chorionic gonadotropin) as of now. If the hCG levels are less than 5 ng/dL, then you are not pregnant at all. In that case the spotting that you are experiencing is likely to indicate that your menses shall start in next few days. The present spotting pattern is due to stress and shall be fine once the flow starts. It is advised to be patient for a week at least as the cramps can be a part of PMS (premenstrual syndrome), if pregnancy has been ruled out definitively.

Thanks for your query and I understand your concerns. Persistent swollen lymph node requires tissue biopsy (sampling) as it could represent serious conditions especially if painless. Can you estimate the size? Is it painful? Is it single or multiple? The possible causes are TB (tuberculosis), chronic infection, lymphoma and other blood diseases. Please provide me with more details and send me the investigations to narrow the differentials. For further advice, please do not hesitate to follow up.

Please tell me.","Doctor":"Hi. Do not worry. Masturbation is normal and there is no harm associated with it. You should reduce the frequency to thrice per week.

At a normal time, I felt like something is stuck inside the penis. During urination also I felt itchiness. I observed penis but did not found anything wrong in the tip but saw some small white pimple like swellings in the lower area of the head of the penis. So, I started using hot water to wash but no change. Today I can see the tip of the penis is swollen and a white color coating on the tip. Also same irritation and a foul smell is their. What may be the cause of this disease. What precaution and medicine should I take?","Doctor":"Hello. Proper hygiene to be taken by both if you are married. Soap and water, Savlon and water. It seems fungal infection (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Fluconazole 150 one per day for five days, capsule Doxycycline 100 once for seven days, tablet Montelukast one at night for itching for three to five days or as required. Locally apply Betnovate N and T-bact OIN (Mupirocin) two times in equal quantity. You can consult a skin and venereal disease specialist.

The condom did not break or slip off, I withdrew from her right after ejaculation. The girl was clean and young. The intercourse took place in her apartment. Am I at risk of contracting HIV? I cannot live normally and keep thinking of it all the time.","Doctor":"Hi. First, protective sexual activity will keep you safe and any STD will increase chances of infection (an ulcer on genital has highest chances). In the above scenario, you are mostly protected from infection. As it happened two months ago, you can get tested with the western blot or fourth generation HIV tests to confirm the status and it remains conclusive up to 95 %. You are unlikely to get an infection as oral sex caries very less transmission and vaginal sex is protected one and I assume you are free from STD.

My gums have an indentation and feel rough. I brush twice a day, floss at night, and use Listerine mouthwash. I take Ibuprofen in the morning sometimes due to a bit of mouth pain.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the pictures attached along with your complaint (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It looks like trench mouth (in dental terms acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis). It is one of the common dental disease caused by bacterial infection. It is aggravated by stress, weak immune system, or habits such as smoking. It is usually painful and ulcerative.  Instead of Ibuprofen and Listerine mouthwash, I suggest using warm salt water rinse thrice daily or Colgate Peroxyl rinses twice daily after meals. Just use 10 mL of the mouthwash to gargle for one minute and spit it out. This helps in pain relief and removing dead tissue on the ulcers. Please avoid smoking habit if you do and also avoid hot and spicy food. Brushing and flossing are to be continued, and never stop doing it. But, avoid vigorous brushing. The indentation and the white gums in between the teeth is the appearance of the ulceration and this disease usually presents in this form. It will heal as you do the rinse treatment along with good oral hygiene. Meanwhile, I also advise you visit your dentist to get a professional cleaning done along with a blood check up to confirm any underlying infection. You might also be prescribed an antibiotic medication for the same.

About 14 months ago, I got one of these on one side of my leg and middle of the upper thigh. It got worse over a few days and then blew up very infected, and I went to the hospital and had to have four IV antibiotic drips. I was there about 36 hours at the hospital. The entire upper leg was swollen down to my knee. The diagnosis was cellulitis. Through last year I had several more of there sores, always on the left side of my body only which I thought was strange and interesting as to the cause? Several on the left side of the torso from a few on the side of belly and about ten at different times upside of my chest or near left armpit. I have had several lumps under my left armpit (about eight or so, some two or three at once) which can get quite painful. These have all cleared up by themselves over about two to three weeks but were red and some with red radiating outward on my skin, but I was able to fight off the infection. I have also had a rash under my left armpit several times. I had a more severe one near my left elbow about three months ago that the infection was spreading up my arm. So, I got oral antibiotics from the doctor and it cleared in about four days. I have just now in the last few weeks had another near my left elbow (still there and very sore) and a second one appeared nearby about five days ago. Initially, the first one looked like red was spreading but I put some antibiotic eye cream on the area each day for past week and it has gone down a little but both are still very sore. Overall, I am really wanting to find the cause and fix this. I had not taken antibiotics for about 15 years before the first leg episode about 14 months ago. I have changed my diet a lot to be eating very healthy past 12 months. So, I am surprised with this unless its something relating to gradual detox. I am not eating many complex carbohydrates (rice, bread, pasta) and stick mainly to lots of green vegetables and good protein like grass fed meat, free range chicken, salmon, and free-range eggs. I guess sometimes I may go in and out of ketosis a bit. When I drink, I drink a fair bit (15 standard drinks) but only do this once a week. Unsure if this is related. Hoping to get to the bottom of this. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi. It seems like a frequent case of bacterial infection of your skin. Why are you frequently getting bacterial furunculosis is what we need to look at. This usually indicates an immunocompromised state or underlying uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or a complement deficiency disorder. What I can gather from your symptoms is that you get bad cases of furunculosis, some with infected axillary lymphadenopathy (the tender lumps in axilla). The axillary rash is something else which also occurs in diabetics or immunocompromised individuals. It is called erythrasma. It also occurs with obesity as in your case. It would be helpful to know a bit more about your condition like, Given your BMI, you are very prone to insulin resistance. Hence we need to take a look at your blood glucose levels. I am very hopeful we can get to the bottom of this. We need to look at it in a stepwise manner, ruling out possibilities and establishing a diagnosis. Please give me the details I asked for and get the following investigations done. Investigation to be done: If these turn out to be normal, then we have to check your complete immunoglobulin levels. Hope this helps. For more information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have had a boil under my left armpit since yesterday morning or so. It is reddish and painful, and occasionally I may have felt an itch. I have had these before.

I have been in this condition three times in the last two years. This is flutter and not fibrillation. Two years ago, I was stuck in atrial flutter, for three weeks. After being on an anticoagulant for three weeks, I went through a successful electrical cardioversion, and was free for two years. I am 73 years old, thin built and vegetarian for several years. I walk 4 miles a day. No other heart or health issues, other than some PVC, which I have had since youth. Six weeks ago, I had a flutter return for about 5 minutes. I went through a 24 hour monitor and was completely clear. I can tell when I get into flutter. It is clear and uncomfortable, but tolerable. Then, about a month ago, it returned and this time for about 8 hours. During that time, I had an EKG to confirm and my doctor transferred me to a cardiologist who can perform an ablation, on the right atrium. This new doctor was not too interested, in details, I felt and I am scheduled for this procedure in a few days. I am very statistical. I understand the flutter may return at any minute and it may not return ever, or for years. What is the subjective probability of returning flutter, each year, for my condition? Would you have a recommendation?

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Mainly posture as faulty posture while sitting, standing, even lying can lead to malalignment of sacrifice iliac joint. Again faulty or improper firing of gluteus and piriformis muscles and pelvic floor muscles can lead to this issue. You have to maintain posture and lying on a proper surface (I mean lying on a bed that does not sag and properly supporting the body) and maintaining glute, piriformis, and pelvic floor muscles strength will help you achieve a good stable SI (sacroiliac) joint.

While coming back from office I felt discomfort around belly button then coming back from office I had buttermilk and after that fried rice and basa fish. After that loose motion started for five to six times at night and there was mild pain around the belly button. Took Norflox TZ then flow came down after day after I visited doctor yesterday seeing no improvement and after examining he did not suggest any test. I insisted him but still, he said nothing needed. Medicine advised by him are as follows:  Pantocid DSR one in empty stomach for seven days. Brakke one after breakfast and one after dinner for five days.

The report of that scan is normal but in the blood test, I found my free testosterone level has increased to 1.04 nq/dL and prolactin is 33.2 ng/ml. Please tell me if this is a serious problem.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Free testosterone is very slightly increased but serum prolactin is remarkably increased and that can reduce or disturb cycles and even stop these. Are you on any treatment or hormonal intake or any symptoms of a headache or secretions from the breast? If any breast secretions are present, that is also a sign of excessive prolactin levels. Antidepressant tablets can increase prolactin or a few other treatments also can stimulate prolactin secretions or some brain mass can also increase prolactin secretions. It is better to consult an endocrinologist. After a detailed history and examination, you might get advised to do a CT/MRI of the brain to exclude any brain space occupying lesion that can stimulate excessive secretion of prolactin. You might have to take treatment to reduce prolactin but only after a complete investigation has been done to find the exact cause. Do not stress about it. Do yoga, exercise, and other recreational activities. Discuss your detailed history with an endocrinologist as well.

For hyperacidity, Rabeprazole 20 mg OD for a week can be prescribed. Avoid gastric irritants like excess spicy foods, excess tea, and coffee, etc. Cooked oatmeal help in soothing the stomach.

It is impacting my ability yo exercise, so thought it was time to investigate. I just had a cardiac catheterization test. No blockages were discovered. However, they were not able to complete the procedure through wrist because my right side artery does not connect directly to the heart. It connects to the left side artery, which then goes to the heart or aortic arch. Stress test results showed abnormalities at high heart rate (both in EKG and echo). Are there any health issues related to the abnormal artery connection? Other than just being out of shape, are there any other medical issues to consider or investigate? I am currently on regular Amlodipine and Losartan for high BP.","Doctor":"Hi. First, you need to be started on medicines called as diuretics like Torsemide 10 mg once a day in the morning and also Amlodipine should be replaced with Beta blockers like Metoprolol XR 25 mg once a day. Both drugs will help you in relief of symptoms and also other benefits. So, you discuss with your local doctor regarding this. The symptoms occur due to pulmonary congestion. Both hypertension and your anomaly have a role in it. The next important decision will be of surgery to correct the abnormal connection. I need to know the details of the reports to know the exact type of anomaly and course of the artery. You can upload your angiography report. It is being the rare condition, the decision is not very straight forward, and data is inconclusive regarding the preferred modalities. In some conditions, patients are offered surgical management while in others patients are kept on drugs. It also depends on the opinion and willingness to undergo such major surgery.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My symptoms have changed and are mostly very painful referred pain after eating and fatigue. I am very worried about chronic pancreatitis. My question is, is my system still recovering and could I have these symptoms whilst the pancreas heals without it being now chronic?","Doctor":"Hello. Generally, it takes time to recover after acute pancreatitis. I suggest you stop drinking alcohol, absolute cessation of alcohol. You are at a risk of developing repeated episodes of pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis if you continue to drink. Please start enzyme supplements. As the CT is normal, you may not be having chronic pancreatitis but an endoscopic ultrasound is a better investigation to know if you have chronic pancreatitis or not as the CT is normal.

As long as you do not have any leg pain (electric or shooting type) or associated numbness you can do this without the intensive chiropractor sessions.

Symptoms: I have been experiencing what feels like I strained my chest muscle(s). They have been terribly sore for about a week. The pain lessens after sleeping. But something as simple as stretching my arms seems to flare it back up again. The pain is consistently in the same location. I can press on my chest and feel the tenderness. I have pulled a groin ligament, and the pain level is very similar. Massaging it seems to briefly relieve the pain. But, I can definitely pinpoint the pain with my fingers easily. It does hurt to breathe at times. But this could also be allergies, as the weather here would result in that. Over the past few days, the sides of my ribs have begun to feel sore. But I am wondering if this is due to me holding myself up differently, as I am attempting not to overload my chest. This is causing me a great deal of anxiety. Facts: I check my blood pressure and heart rate at home. Both have been normal. In fact, my blood pressure is looking great this week. I have terrible anxiety issues, which has landed me in the ER a few times due to heart palpitations. I have had two EKGs, CBC and other blood tests, an X-ray, and seen a cardiologist. The verdict: Anxiety. This April, I had my last round of blood tests and an EKG done. I was told that I looked great. I have the test results for reference, should anyone care to see. I am quite out-of-shape and have been trying very hard to improve my health. I started up the P90X DVDs about two weeks ago. This chest pain kicked in after a few P90X sessions. I moved a few heavy items around my home during this time as well, so I imagine I may have irritated whatever is going on there. Icing the chest seems to help a good bit. It is just so strange, as I can quite literally press on the pained areas. They are on both sides of the chest, in exactly the same locations on either side. The middle of my chest is a bit sore, but not remotely close to the pain on either side. I am uninsured and really cannot afford to shell out the money for cautionary tests. This is very distressful to me and triggering off some major anxiety for the last week. I have been hoping the pain would improve. I have ridden an exercise bike rapidly, multiple times, while having this pain. The pain did not worsen at all. In fact, it felt great (aside from the fact that I am in severely sore pain). Personal details: 37-year-old male. 5’8”. 185 pounds. This pain has been going for about a week. It feels like my chest muscle(s). I am not on any medications. I do not take any drugs at all. I have never smoked a cigarette in my life.","Doctor":"Hello. I have checked the attached files thoroughly (attachment removed to protect patient identity). All the investigations you performed are within normal and there is no need for further investigations. From what you mentioned, you have acute muscle sprain which is due to lifting heavy objects and the exercises that you have started.

She is on treatment with Cefixime and Ofloxacin. It is enough. But the temperature is too high and is above the Paracetamol range.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I am in stress and anxiety. I had many HIV negative antibody tests from such events. Now, I am feeling numbness and tingling in hand and feet because of fear due to ARS. Do HIV produce neuropathy at an early stage or it may be because of anxiety? Please help. I never had sex. I am not taking any drugs. I have regular sugar and calcium level. I have done ELISA, chromatography, immunofiltration tests.","Doctor":"Hi. No, you cannot get infected by HIV from a bedsheet or from toilet pans. Tingling and numbness occur due to many reasons. It needs evaluation. Remember, HIV can only live at approximately 8-12 seconds in the outside world and live up to 20 minutes in tissue samples. It requires a living cell with a CD4 receptor to live. Can you live in water? Same way, it cannot live in the outside world. So, do not get panic. It is transmitted in unprotected sexual activity and chances increase with ulcers on genitals, and it is transmitted by contaminated blood transfusion, needle sharing by drug abusers. So, be out of sexual activity from an unsafe person, say no to drug abuse and get blood only from a licensed blood bank (if you need a blood transfusion).

It has been a little over 10 years since my last, I know the pain associated with getting one and I do have a history. However, I had never actually seen exactly what it looked like as my eye would be too red. This time though, I see an off white dot on my cornea near the iris. I am a contact lens wearer and I know not to sleep with my contacts. I have been slacking some lately. It feels like something is in my eye and sticking a thin needle down through it. The pain goes through the whole eyeball. It feels like deep in my brain. It hurts like hell and I could not sleep. The moment I was finally able to relax my eye from fluttering, a painful vibration would erupt through my eye. I am also extremely sensitive to light. I know I need a topical antibiotic to put in my eye and no contact use. Can it go away on its own without having to see a doctor and get the solution? Or can I just get an RX without having to do all of that? It is not super easy right now to do. I also do not have any of my medical files on this as it has been over 10 years and I am currently in the middle of a moving transition and cannot locate them easily.","Doctor":"Hello. From what you have mentioned, you seem to be having contact lens induced keratitis (corneal ulcer) or marginal keratitis. A corneal ulcer develops when there is a break in the corneal epithelium. Normally, tears play a major role in maintaining the integrity of the corneal epithelium. However, there are several risk factors associated with corneal ulcer formation among contact lens users like overnight wear, duration of wear, lens hygiene practice, dry eye, and smoking. Marginal keratitis is known to occur as a reaction to staphylococcus toxins, or coexist with blepharitis or rosacea. If so, please revert back to me. The symptoms mentioned by you point towards corneal ulcer. However, the diagnosis is made by a slit lamp examination, which is done by an ophthalmologist. Hence, an eye examination by an ophthalmologist is necessary for the diagnosis and treatment. Also, corneal scraping maybe done to detect the infective organism. The most common being pseudomonas, followed by acanthamoeba. Delay in diagnosis and treatment can lead to further complications. So please see an ophthalmologist at the earliest.  Further, you must stop using the contact lens (the one you have been using). You must take the contact lens along with the lens solution when you visit the ophthalmologist, as they will need microbiological testing as well. Conditions leading to extreme dryness of eyes like environmental dust and smoke have to be avoided. You can also use dark tinted goggles as you have intolerance to light. And please visit the ophthalmologist at the earliest. After the diagnosis is made, you will be started off with fortified antibiotic eyedrops and cycloplegics along with lubricant eye drops.

The LVEF % which used to be in the range of 45 % earlier has dropped to 30 % to 35 % range. He had an episode of VT before two years and had ICD embedded. I am attaching his earlier and latest report. Please explain.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through his reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Wall motion abnormality is seen in the echo report of your father. The heart is supplied by three arteries LAD, RCA, and LCX that is, left anterior descending artery, right coronary artery and left circumflex artery respectively. Any obstruction in blood supply in these vessels will cause decreased blood supply to a particular area of heart (which is supplied by that artery). As blood supply is compromised the muscles in that part of heart will not get proper nutrition and will start degenerating, which is medically termed as regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA). A coronary angiogram should be done to rule out coronary artery disease (blockage in the coronary artery), which is the main reason for RWMA and decreased ejection fraction. My advice is to get a coronary angiogram to rule out the blockage in the coronary artery.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Before two years, my AMH count was 0.6 ng/ml. Last year, my AMH count was 0.1 ng/ml. Also, on the day seven and day 10, the follicular study gave nil result in both the ovaries (without medication). My periods have become irregular. I want to know whether IVF will give me success.","Doctor":"Hi. Let me start by giving you some points about the functions of FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and AMH (anti-mullerian hormone). Every lady is born with a fixed number of eggs in ovaries (to be precise around 7 million). Every month, the lady pushes out one egg. These are the best of all. So after every period, the number of eggs left behind is less healthy than the previous cycle. By 35 years of age, most of the good eggs are gone and by 40 years nearly all the good eggs are over. This is not a fixed number. It is only a range. Pituitary gland below the brain produces FSH, which has a normal range of up to 7 mIU/mL. FSH stimulates the ovaries to release the eggs. As the eggs reduce, the higher levels of FSH is needed to release the eggs. So, indirectly FSH reflects the number of eggs left in the ovaries. Once, the number of eggs reduce, it can never be increased again. AMH above 2 ng/ml is normal. AMH is a glycoprotein which prevents the eggs releasing from the ovaries. So as the eggs reduce, the AMH level reduces. So there is no treatment to increase the AMH. Periods are irregular as the good eggs are nearly over and the hormones are reduced. Your best and the only option is IVF (in-vitro fertilization). I advise IVF with a donor egg is the only option. Anyone who is willing to give eggs, related or unrelated to you, can be given hormone injections. They will produce all the eggs, which can be aspirated in the embryology. Your husband's sperm can be injected into the eggs and the embryo is formed. The embryo is placed in a frozen. Those embryos are placed in your uterus and the baby will grow in your uterus. Even after the first delivery, you can plan for a second baby, a few years later. On the other hand, if you plan to use your own eggs, as explained previously, the chances of getting unhealthy eggs is more. The overall number of eggs too will be less, so the success of IVF will be low. Even if you get pregnant, you will need a screening for lots of genetic problems in the baby. Just by using a higher dose of hormones, your egg quality will not improve. By using your eggs, success rates are decimal. Using donor with good egg quality, the success rate is 45 to 50 %.

Clomiphene citrate helps in inducing ovulation. So, continue taking the prescribed medication and try to reduce weight if you are obese. Regular exercise will also be beneficial in your case. Take a healthy diet and more fruits. Try to have intercourse especially around ovulation time at around 14 days of menstruation cycle.

This is not worrisome. Lipoprotein is just borderline, and you just need to have a healthy lifestyle to control it like low oily, fat and calorie diet along with regular exercises at least 30 minutes a day. Lipoprotein correlates with cholesterol. So, once you should get your lipid profile done. Homocysteine is elevated to some extent which is usually due to vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. So, you need to get the level of vitamin B12 and folic acid done, and supplements, if either one is deficient. Thirdly, you have mild prolapse of the mitral valve in echo which is not usually worrisome but should be kept under observation. So, you get echo done every two to three years. So overall, it is not worrisome, but smoking is always injurious to health. It increases the risk of many illnesses. So, effort should be always to cut down on smoking and it is best to avoid it.

I was diagnosed with diffuse toxic goiter in 2005 (age 19), and ever since I have been on medical compensation (Thyrozol). I have taken 20-30 mg of Thyrozol for couple weeks, then gradually reduce the amount to zero. After a couple of weeks (month) symptoms were back, and I resumed to medication. Last recurrence appeared a month ago and my doctor recommended surgery, complete removal of thyroid gland. Currently, I am taking 30 mg of Thyrozol to prepare for surgery. As surgery leads to hypothyroidism is any other options I have in this situation? Last tests results (before getting medications): TSH - 0.008 T4 - 2.9 TSH receptor autoantibodies - 6.32.","Doctor":"Hi. There are three ways to treat hyperthyroidism as what you are having. First is with medication and you are already taking that. Usually, it is given for 18 months but 50% of people will have recurrence once they stop medications so the choice is to either continue the medication for life long or go to the other modality which is either thyroid surgery or radioiodine therapy. Now you are advised to have thyroid surgery which has two main complications one is complications during surgery including bleeding, infection, and losing voice due to recurrent laryngeal nerve damage and you will need thyroid hormone for the rest of your life for hypothyroidism. About radioiodine, it is one of the best treatments nowadays available right now. It has a very low chance of malignancy which may be negligible. It can cause hypothyroidism as well but it is over years. If your goiter is causing problem like you do not like its appearance or it makes difficult for you to breath which it can cause once it enlarges and obstructs the air pipe. So if that is the case you can go for surgery."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I brush regularly and floss, even started oil pulling with coconut oil. My bottom gums feel really tender and bleed over the smallest thing. How can I manage it?","Doctor":"Hi. I think you have injured the gum not because of trauma from the coconut but because of force. Now either there is calculus (hard deposit) or you have got the periodontal infection. You need to take medication like Ofloxacin and Ornidazole combination at least for four to five days. Also, you need a scaling if you feel there is calculus. You can check with a dentist for further evaluation because sometimes there are chances of fracture too.

Sometimes the phelgm is white and sometimes black and sometimes traces of blood in phlegm. No chest pain, no shortness of breath. Is anything to worry? Is there any chance of lungs cancer after clear X-ray.","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your issues. Coughing up blood can be a symptom of many diseases like throat or chest infection, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis (a disease where your windpipes are damaged) or lung cancer. A detailed history of complaints and your reports are needed to determine the reason. If you are below 40 years and coughing up blood only for a few days, it is likely a chest infection or tuberculosis (TB). If age is above 40 and a smoker, we need to consider the possibility of cancer. If coughing blood is for months to years, bronchiectasis is the likely cause. If X-ray is normal, TB and cancer become less likely. I would suggest you get a sputum exam for TB, blood tests CBC (complete blood count) and ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate). If TB is not detected in sputum and coughing up blood is persistent, CT scan of the chest may be needed. Bronchitis, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis. CBC, ESR, sputum AFB (acid-fast bacillus) smear, chest HRCT scan.

After doing cold and hot compress, the pain in the area disappeared but my donating arm still feels tired. What could be the problem?","Doctor":"Hi. First, coming to blood donation, you have done a very good thing. You saved one life. Secondly, the bruise may be due to puncture of the vein (double puncture) during needle insertion and it will cause pain and leakage of blood (causing bruise) and this will be healed fast and leaked blood will be reabsorbed.

What could be the problem? He has a previous history of a hernia.","Doctor":"Hi. As he has a previous history of a hernia, this is most probably an inguinal hernia. As BMI is 33, it is in the range of obesity and it causes a hernia. A further check-up is needed by surgeon whether there is any blockage of vessel or nerve in the region due to a hernia. Avoid any straining factor which causes pressure on the abdomen like a cough (smoking or dust areas), constipation. Consume high fiber diets like fruits, vegetables, and husk powder. Enlarged deep inguinal ring due to a weakened abdominal wall due to obesity. Examination of genital area by a surgeon. Indirect inguinal hernia. Indirect inguinal hernia.

I was given Acyclovir 200 mg taken five times a day for five days and then they increased my dosage to 400 mg to be taken for five times a day for 10 days. After my Acyclovir course ended, I did an RNA PCR and DNA PCR tests. After getting my results negative, I had sex with a guy. He also went for RNA PCR and DNA PCR tests. It came negative. After two months, I went for a PrEP. I got a sore in my tongue which was pink in color. The next day, I got a stuffy nose which was an allergy that lasted for four days. I got a light brown spot under my right foot. I had a small nonpainful white spot on the bottom of my lip. There is an irritation in my throat that causes blocking and I have to cough to clear up the throat. It does not happen when I sleep. I do not have any sinus problem. Currently, I am taking olive extract supplements. I have done ELISA, fourth generation tests, SD bio line at the eighth week, ninth week, 10th week, the 11th week with home test kits every week.","Doctor":"Hi. I wish to clear some important points before answering your questions. 1. Regarding HSV infection and treatment: The HSV will remain in your body and it is not completely treated as it is a genetic material. It will be present in the cells and get reactivated in stressful conditions. We cannot treat it completely. Its dose is 400 mg taken five times a day for five days with Acyclovir ointment. It may reactivate in future. 2. Flu-like symptoms: These complaints normally precede a viral infection. 3. Regarding HIV: You have tested every week with RNA PCR kits and ELISA kits. It is good. But, RNA PCR testing is not efficient in home-based kits. So, get whole blood RNA PCR test along with ELISA. This dual testing is needed to rule out HIV. 4. Regarding PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis), I suppose you are using a dual drug based on Tenofovir. If yes, then you are having least chances of acquiring HIV. Finally, stop testing on a weekly basis and get whole blood RNA polymerase chain reaction test to rule out HIV. Mostly you are not reactive. Confirm with a whole blood sample.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Whenever I play tennis it is usually only for five minutes. The pain goes away in a few days but recurs as soon as I even swing a racquet. What is the problem?","Doctor":"Hi. The wrist pain that you are experiencing could be due to the following reasons. 1) TFCC (triangular fibrocartilage complex) injury. 2) DRUJ (distal radioulnar joint) instability. 3) Carpal tunnel syndrome. 4) Osseous (bone) injury. 5) Cartilage injury. If you are having a history of trauma, there are high chances of osseous or ligamentous injury in and around the wrist joint. I would like to suggest you to get an MRI of the wrist joint to get a detailed understanding of the intraarticular and extraarticular pathology causing the wrist pain. Wearing a brace would definitely help you when the pathology is acute, but since you are experiencing this pain for the past three years and it is not subsiding I recommend further investigations."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,This case of suspected IBS is related to my wife who is 34 years old.

You can take more lentils, beans, and salads. Another important aspect is intermittent fasting that can also help to control your sugars. Even there is growing evidence that intermittent fasting can reverse diabetes. I hope it makes sense.

For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I want to know that what are the side effects of it if we take it one or more times. Help me, please. Can I regularly take this type of medicine?","Doctor":"Hello. The emergency contraceptive pill should not be taken more than once in a month, because it causes a withdrawal bleed in next 7 to 10 days and hence by consuming continuous pills, the bleeding may not occur at all. If sexually active, then there are high chances of pill failure and continued pregnancy. Also, the cycles are changed completely. There is a chance of heavy bleeding during menses as well.

Please suggest me any medicine for the permanent elimination of the problem.","Doctor":"Hello. Premature ejaculation in most of the individuals occurs because of anxiety and stress. The permanent solution for premature ejaculation is to get relieved of anxiety and stress. Stop anticipating things and avoid thinking that you will ejaculate earlier. Drugs like Dapoxetine can be used on SOS basis to delay the time. You can visit a psychiatrist for help.

Will simply treating BP reverse any risk? All I have read about this indicates the prognosis is unclear but I am very worried and hope you can shed some light on my situation. I have not had confirmed NSVT but I have felt longer fluttering sensations and have had PVCs for 10 years off and on. I am 23 years old. My stress test was normal. I am on Zio patch now. My echo showed apparent LVH and aortic root dilation 3.8. If I have LVH, does that predispose me to arrhythmias like a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy would, and can it be reversed if I control my blood pressure, which is higher than normal?","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, how bad are your hypertension and hypertrophy? Can your hypertrophy be explained by your hypertension? If yes, then it is likely hypertension induced. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may cause hypertrophy in young age, but it usually causes severe hypertrophy, with thickness usually more than 15 mm, and can be detected in the echo. Please attach echo report if possible. Also, let me know how much maximum was the BP reading? You have mentioned 145/90 which is mildly elevated. Next, Compared with those without VPCs (ventricular premature complexes), patients with VPCs had significantly higher all cardiovascular mortality, somewhere between 1.5 to 2 times. But, the majority of patients do well and lead a normal life. Also, your stress test is negative ruling out coronary artery disease which additionally contributes to mortality. Also, you should have a treatment for hypertension which should remain under control and strict BP control may reverse hypertrophy and ectopics to some extent but not completely usually. However, you should ask for beta blockers containing medicines like Metoprolol for BP so it will also control ectopics. So overall, the majority of patients do well and there is no need to worry much about it.

None of my doctors have told me anything about it till now. Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Hello. I have reviewed your query and here is my advise. Your hemoglobin level is slightly high according to history. I need to know your hematocrit (PCV- packed cell volume), RBC count and total WBC count as well to guide you further. If you have any respiratory or cardiac problem then mention that. Only hemoglobin rise cannot be taken as seriously. If your HCT (hematocrit) and RBC are also elevated then investigate with EPO (erythropoietin). So you can attach your reports for giving more comment.

Been coughing as well but voluntarily, in attempts to clear my congestion. What gets produced, if anything, is barely anything and does not help the clogged feeling at the back of nose or top of my throat. My ears, mainly my left one, started feeling a bit sore this morning. Also, I am running a bit warmer than usual, 99.5 to 99.8. But before I get too detailed I will just wrap this up. Should I be concerned? Mainly because if whatever I am doing involves a medium to high level of physical activity. I start wheezing due to the congestion. I cannot exhale and begin to feel kinda short of breathe. Other than this I am not too worried and plan to cancel my appointment with my primary if things start to clear up in two days.","Doctor":"Hello. Have you seen your throat? Is it congested or are there any pus points over tonsils and throat? It is better if you could upload the picture of the throat. It is likely a viral infection involving the respiratory tract with may be superimposed bacterial component as well. You may need antibiotics like Azithromycin. Also, have Betadine gargles four times a day. For a cough, you have syrup Alex (Dextromethorphan) two teaspoons whenever needed up to three times a day and tablet Allegra 120 mg once a day for 3 to 4 days for running nose. Avoid cold food items.

I have constant, chronic pain in my upper right abdomen and chest. I was adamant it was my heart but have had all heart tests done and everything is fine except for palpitations they think are from anxiety. Gallstones have also been discovered but that pain would be on my right side and not on my left. The left side pain is unbearable sometimes, it hurts to breathe in deep, it is very tight. There is popping sensations a lot and I really struggle with constipation and then I can have a couple of days with diarrhea. I have completely changed my diet and lifestyle, given up smoking and alcohol for two months now. I only drink water and the occasional green tea, have cut out all other drinks. I eat clean now and have lost 20 lbs in the last two months. My bloating has dramatically gone down but the pain has not. I have taken so much Gaviscon since four months that it does not work for me anymore. I have cut out nightshade vegetables, gluten, unhealthy fats and dairy except for the occasional non fat greek yoghurt in my smoothie. The pain is still there, I have been to the hospital multiple times and they just say it is gastritis. I know I have indigestion problems but I feel like there is something else going on.

Take Buscopan as per need, if you feel colicky abdominal pain because it can cause constipation if taken frequently. 3. Take Ispaghol husk two teaspoons, put in a glass of water, keep it for four hours and then drink it to make your bowels regular. 4. Avoid foods that you think that troubles you most, so you have to decide which are those foods for you. 5. Keep yourself well hydrated. 6.

I also had diarrhea, which is why I am somewhat worried, as I have not had diarrhea for years, and was somewhat constipated beforehand from eating too much. I am somewhat worried about appendicitis (it does hurt mildly when I push on my lower right stomach), but it could just be the stomach flu. I am also taking Malarone if that is at all relevant.","Doctor":"Hello. The symptoms you are describing are mostly suggestive of bacterial gastroenteritis (commonly called food poisoning), which is the bacterial infection of the intestine. Stool analysis and culture are required to confirm the diagnosis. Management is with antibiotics (usually a combination of Ciprofloxacin and Metronidazole) for which you will need a prescription. So, please be advised to follow up with the urgent care. Meanwhile, drink plenty of water and electrolyte-containing drinks like Gatorade. Follow a soft diet. BRAT (banana, rice, applesauce, and toast) diet will be easier on your tummy. You can also take Buscopan (Butylscopolamine) 10 mg thrice daily for abdominal cramps.

We consulted a specialist a month back, he said that the cartilage in the knee joint has become less in one side of the joint and he suggested few medicines for pain relief and cartilage renewal namely, Calcium (Celedol -100, Jointac C2, and Osteodon). I read about Cartilage type-II that it helps very well in cartilage improvement and pain relief. I just want to ask you whether we can use this Cartilage type-II capsules along with the above-mentioned medicines for fast recovery of the cartilage? Or should we use only Cartilage type-II capsules without using ' Jointac C2?","Doctor":"Hello. Whatever you use, whether cartilage supplements or Glucosamine, it will not help in moderate to severe osteoarthritis. Only in the very early stages of OA, it helps. ' If she is not diabetic, I suggest she can take intra-articular steroids or if affordable, intra-articular viscosupplementation. Continue quadriceps exercises, avoid squatting and sitting cross-legged. Weight reduction also helps. If X-ray shows advanced stage, only joint replacement helps.

Everything else including protein and albumin are normal. The doctor is giving Ricovir 300, Pantosec 40, Udliv 150, Vitamin A to Z daily and Lasilactone 50 mg on alternate days. But, he is not giving any medicine to increase platelet count and for reduced hemoglobin. Is it alright or is that required?","Doctor":"Hello. In liver cirrhosis, chronic fibrosis occurs and such fibrotic tissue obstructs portal blood flow and so, because of portal hypertension splenomegaly can occur. An enlarged spleen traps platelet count and so your platelet count is low. With an improvement of cirrhosis by medication and avoidance of alcohol and through a healthy lifestyle, your platelet count can increase with time. But if cirrhosis worsens, then the condition might reverse. You have been prescribed antiviral medication as well. So, hepatitis B or C might be associated. In hepatitis, bone marrow can be suppressed and there can be pancytopenia in which hemoglobin, WBC count, and platelet all three get reduced. So, check your WBC count as well. For low platelet, you need only monitoring and a healthy lifestyle. For low hemoglobin, check your serum ferritin and TIBC (total iron-binding capacity) level and peripheral smear examination to give more comment on that. If any unusual bleeding starts, then platelet needs to be transfused. For more information consult a family physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I recently gave birth three months ago.

Next, you say that your recent test for chlamydia resulted positive while your partner was negative this time.

Is Dronis useful because it is a contraceptive? I am trying to conceive naturally also in this gap. What should I do? Please guide me.","Doctor":"Hi. Dronis (Ethinylestradiol) is a contraceptive pill also used to reduce the size of the ovarian cyst. You will not conceive in the month you are taking the pills. But, it is necessary for the cyst to resolve before you can be given medicine for ovulation induction. So you should take Dronis. You may have to take it from one to three months depending on the size of the cyst. If your cyst is absent next cycle, you can be given medicine for ovulation to happen. It would be great if you could lose weight, at least 3 to 4 kg. Since you are 38, do AMH (anti-Mullerian hormone) blood test and antral follicle count on the second-day scan to know your ovarian reserve. If it is low, I suggest you go for IVF since you are elderly. Do not delay much. Are your TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and prolactin normal? If you can send me your reports, I can guide you better.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I am 33, no prior pregnancies, and otherwise healthy. I have been taking an oral contraceptive pill since the IUD removal as I didn’t want to become pregnant immediately, but I am concerned now that both periods I have had while on the pill since the IUD removal have been extremely light. Both have only lasted one day, and only needed 2 tampons total.  My periods were typical prior to the IUD, and stopped completely while the IUD was in for 3 years. Before that I was on an OCP so periods were regular, but I’ve been using hormonal contraception since I was a teenager so I’m not sure if my physiologic periods would be regular or not.  I am a Pediatrician, so please feel free to use medical language. I am concerned that these very light periods indicate abnormal endometrial function or some other abnormality that may affect my fertility, and I’d be very grateful for any insight you have.  Thanks,  Roisin","Doctor":"Hello doc Welcome to icliniq i will explain you a little bit how estrogen progestin contraceptive and a levonogestrel DIU effect fertility : Combination of OCs suppress basal FSh and LH They diminish the ability of pituitary gland to synthesize gonadotropins when it is stimulated by hipothalamic GnRH.Ovarian follicles do not mature ,little estradiol is produced and there is no midcycle LH surge .Ovulation does not occur ,corpus luteum does not form and progesteron is not produced .This means that interferes ,and block negative and positive feedback of HHO axis . Also the IUD (Mirena ) which contains levonogestrel reduced the FSH ,there is less follicular activity ,less estradiol production and no LH surge also cause an local inflamatory rection inside the uterine cavity . The blocage of HHO is revesible ,as far as you interrup the coc pills,the estrogen and progesteron levels will fall (may be it will take a few months) ,so HHO axis will start to functionate normally ,and the cycle will be ovulatory again . So the change of the quantity of bleeding isn't so inportant ,if your cycle arw ovulatory . Only if you have amenorrhea more than 6 months after discontinuation of OCs pills shoyud undergo evaluation. So it' normal to experience change of menstrual cycle after IUD . I hope, I 've been helpful . Kinds regards"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

There is a problem with my nails. Out of 10 nails, six nails have one-third of the nails separated from the nail beds, with a v shape, looking white underneath, rest of the nails are looking pinkish pale. The nails are painless unless I press them hard. All the nails have some ridges. I kept my nails short with no polish for over five weeks. My fingers felt dry with mild skin peeling after a travel. Currently, I have a mild skin eczema. I also had seborrheic dermatitis in my scalp a few years ago. But it is under control with special shampoo treatment. I had one fingernail with a similar problem but it was in a milder condition. I thought it was nail fungal. I used Mometasone furoate 0.1 % cream for my skin eczema. It cleared up when my nails grew.

But, my doctor prescribed me the axis of the power 180, and I could see even the smallest letters in the Snellen's chart with that glass. So, I want to know why there is a huge difference between the axis given by the auto refractometer and the axis given by my doctor?","Doctor":"Hi. You see, ten by ten or six by six mean the glasses are good and suitable. For the difference, actually, the difference is 30 and not 150 and I will explain it to you. The cylinder and its axis is a piece of the rod without base and head, both ends are same. Now imagine that you put this rod at axis 180, it is totally horizontal and it is at 0, for this the difference is 30. Why this differs from auto is because the autorefractor guides us, then there is an exam and we are trying lenses many times and sometimes it takes more than 10 minutes to have the prescription depending on the medical and physical rules. All of this auto and exam with trying gives us the last result. Otherwise, if the auto is better, you can do auto and give its result to the optician for glasses and often it will not be correct.

The doctor advised for full abdomen USG, mammography, and FNAC. The results showed duct cell carcinoma (NST) with a lesion measuring 12 x 15 mm. Surgical Oncologist has advised for surgical removal of a tumor (BCS surgery) followed by radiation and chemotherapy. He suggested, my mother, to undergo four to eight sessions of chemotherapy, depending upon the biopsy report of the tumor. I wish to seek a second opinion depending upon the requirement of chemotherapy and radiation therapies and also want to know the possible side effects.","Doctor":"Hi. The current treatment for the early breast cancer is breast conservation surgery and sentinel lymph node (axillary node) sampling. There are oncotype testing to personalize the treatment which gives the magnitude of benefit for a particular individual. Radiotherapy is mainly given to reduce the risk of local recurrence. Side effects of radiation are skin reactions in the short term and hardening of the breast in the long term. Chemotherapy, not sure whether your mother needs chemotherapy. If the nodes are negative with strong ER (estrogen receptors) in positive status, we could avoid chemotherapy altogether.

Do you think I have HIV or STD? I have a little pimple on my neck. I have a feeling of vomiting and a fast heartbeat. There is no rashes or ulcers in my private part. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hi. Transmission of HIV is impossible through oral sex. Saliva cannot cause the transmission of HIV. But, other STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) like herpes or HPV (human papillomavirus) or candida can spread through oral sex. But, a sore throat is not a presenting complaint in these STD's. A sore throat is due to infection. Take a proper antibiotic course and you will be alright. Warm saline gargles can also help in quick recovery.

Mostly, the primary teeth fall due to the clear eruption of the permanent teeth. There will be a formation of roots of the permanent teeth to erupt.

He got sick as a kid from meningitis in the 60´s. His uncle was a pediatric and placed him on a first check in the hospital to make sure that the child as a patient was calm. He forbade his mother from seeing him in the hospital, and the mother did not come after a dramatic goodbye scene from the kid at the hospital. He was 4 going 5 at that time. In the hospital, he was tied up to make sure the baxters did not get disturbed. At night, his father and the doctor sneaked unannounced to grab him for a spine puncture. As the kid wrestled and cried from the pain of the puncture, the uncle was very angry and said that kids should not cry. So, the next time it happened, the kid shut up an vowed not to make a sound. After seven days at the hospital, the kid was then taken to the uncle's house where his aunt took care of him, and this during a full month. Only after a month, he saw his mother back.","Doctor":"Hello. I am sorry to hear that you experienced these traumatic events in your childhood. The given events are traumatic. When a person experiences continuous traumatic events in his life, he could develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This could happen at any time during his life. During his young adolescent and young adult days, this may not happen. But could happen in later stages, especially in old age. The second possibility is obsessive-compulsive disorder (continuous negative thinking). But, this has to happen during his adolescent age period and should continue further. The third possibility is depression and anxiety. This should also start in the person's adolescent age period and should continue further. The fourth possibility is psychoses, but this incident is rare. You are already sixty. If you have not experienced anxiety, depression, OCD, etc., during your younger age, those may not be due to the incident that happened in your childhood. You could have developed those due to some other reasons now. PTSD is a possibility, but again psychological assessment is needed. The above are all theory and these could happen but not for sure at all. There are many people who underwent continuous traumatic incidents in their childhood but lived unscathed throughout their life. Mental resolve is the key.

I have been prescribed multiple antibiotics and they only work whilst I am taking them and after that, the infection comes right back. After doing some research I came across the term biofilms and truly believe I may have a biofilm in my vaginal wall preventing me from curing this horrible infection. I understand antibiotics and other methods are unlikely to cure BV completely if there is an underlying issue such as a biofilm. I am also aware of the fact that biofilm can make bacterial vaginosis reoccur which is what keeps happening to me. It comes right back after taking anything for it. If this is the case what do you advise to get rid of this? I am willing to try anything.","Doctor":"Hi. Biofilms are sticking of bacteria or infection that remains in the wall of the vagina and cause recurrence of infection. Vagina has its specific pH and it is maintained by bacteria lactobacilli that are normal flora of the vagina. Disbalance of pH occurring by this bacteria has less proportion in comparison to other infective organisms. You have taken treatment many times but this infection recurs due to effect on your normal flora by medications recurrently. My advice to you is to have some natural approach to the problem and less exposure to the medications recurrently to normal flora as it is affecting normal flora of the vagina. Have sitz baths (sit in warm water to relief irritation). Have soft comfortable undergarments, strict hygiene. Use only clean water locally. No products use of any kind.

There is another probability that you have bacterial infection and in this case you will use Fucithalmic acid eye ointment applied on the eyelid three times a day and inside the eye once a day in addition to oral tablet Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) 1 g twice a day for seven days with anti-edema (Daniza or Ananas forte or other as the pharmacy give you- the kind and the dose).  Now, the big problem is that whether this swelling is an allergic or fungal infection or bacterial infection. Look, if the swollen lid is soft and not painful on touching it is most probably allergic and I have told you the treatment. If the swelling is hard and painful on touch it is most probably an infection and we cannot give the treatment for bacteria if the infection is fungal. Kindly visit your ophthalmologist for the diagnosis.

He has taken three antivenom doses and was under observation for two days. After six days of snake bite and treating it from medication, he has got swelling in snake bite area (right-hand middle finger). He is facing anxiety and itching as well. Please let us know the solution to this.","Doctor":"Hi. I would suggest taking an advice from the doctor about getting steroids and anti-histamine. It may be a localized reaction to anti-venom or maybe sequelae of snake bite or another possibility. It may be an infection that can be controlled with antibiotics, make sure he has got anti-tetanus vaccine or immunoglobulin after snake bite. I am pretty sure he is getting checked for his CBC, kidney functions, PT-INR (prothrombin-international normalized ratio).

Am I pregnant or not? Please tell me.","Doctor":"Hi. Since the size of endometrial thickness has increased and the size of the ovary follicle has increased, there are chances of pregnancy.

My outer layer of penis is attached to the head. I feel to ejaculate due to excitement. While having sex using condom I am able to insert whole of my penis and enjoy good sex. But without condom, I ejaculate in few minutes and not able to insert inside properly. As my wife is more supportive I feel bad for her now. I am afraid whether it is phimosis. Please suggest some remedy.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read and understood your problem. Yes, it may be Phimosis, the symptoms like difficulty during intercourse, hard to urinate will occur. You should use some lubricant or soap and try to pull the foreskin back by holding your penis in one hand and pulling back with another. Do not apply force and over few days it will be pulled back gradually. If skin remains stuck, then you may need a simple surgical procedure called Circumcision.

I'm not always sexually active, but when i am with my partner, I don't feel anything vaginally during intercourse, during foreplay I feel some but not much. However, when masturbating I'm perfectly fine, and I feel amazing. I have some slight anxiety, and I've had Major Depressive Disorder in the past, but now I'm doing much better on Zoloft 50mg, with limited symptoms now. Im aware that my medication has proven to have negative effects on my sexual libido, but my real concern is why there is such a difference in my sexual experiences when with my partner versus myself. Thank you !","Doctor":"Hello, Feeling satisfied in intercourse depends on a number of factors - Sexual desire (spontaneous sexual interest including sexual thoughts, erotic fantasies, and daydreams.etc.). Psychological issues. Relationship issues. Another important point is that during masturbation you are aware of the pleasure points in your body and can therefore attain maximum pleasure, while with a partner a lot of other factors are involved. Also, maybe you should consider using another drug instead of Zoloft 50? Sexual desire is typically more psychological and situational in women, influenced by how they feel about their bodies as well as the quality of relationship with their partner. I suggest you talk with your partner so that you can experiment with different techniques. Also to find what suits you and your partner best so that both of you can understand each other better sexually. (Many women do not experience desire until after they are genitally aroused, and arousal may require an extended period of foreplay)"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I stopped and had a chance to see another urologist. He did prostate check and urine and semen sample. Found nothing. No bacteria. He stuck a camera in my bladder and found no bacteria. I was given Flomax for two months and my symptoms went away. Recently, six weeks ago, I got chlamydia. I was given 1.5 grams Azithromycin taken over two days. Seven days after, I was re-tested and no more chlamydia. Then four weeks ago, I started to feel prostatitis symptoms show up again. Inflamed urethra and frequent urination with tenderness. I was given Pirinum by a doctor at my work to try to flush out any bacteria. The pain and inflammation went down but it is still constant. I believe after research I have chlamydia prostatitis and cannot go to a urologist at this time because of being in a remote country working.","Doctor":"Hi. I need to know a few more details to answer your query better: If your symptoms are similar to your previous attack of prostatitis then the treatment would be antibiotics for at least four weeks and Flomax.

Otherwise, serum alpha-fetoprotein, CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) chromogranin and CA (cancer antigen) 19.9 along with triple phase CT of liver would help in differentiation between the two.

The HIV contaminated instruments and waste material from instruments cannot cause HIV infection as there will be more than 30 minutes before contacting you. Second, never work with open wounds. Taking HIV out of the equation, you have the highest chances of HBV (hepatitis B virus) transmission as it can survive upto 30 days in a harsh environment.

I do not think there is anything to worry about. Running for a longer time, say for few months at least, will make the heart stronger and decrease the heart rate, not for a week. There are numerous factors which can affect our heart beat like exercise status, walking before taking heart rate, psychological status like anxiety, etc. So, this can cause an elevated heart rate. I guess you do not have any symptoms like dizziness, shortness of breath with elevated heart rate, right? Also, no harm in getting a thyroid test done as resting heart was on the lower side. For more information consult a cardiologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, In sonography of the baby's heart, there is an echogenic focus on the left ventricle of the heart. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. Intracardiac echogenic foci in the left ventricles are due to papillary muscle injury/insult and most often resolve spontaneously but they hint at the underlying chromosomal abnormality. I would highly recommend an early anomaly scan this week itself instead of 20 weeks so that if other abnormality is detected, you get some time in hand to decide the next step. If the anomaly scan is done at 20 weeks, you would not get any time to decide and also no action could be taken.

After 30 days, I did a tridot test, and it showed me a negative result. But I have a sore throat and white tongue for the past three weeks. Can it be the symptoms of HIV?","Doctor":"Hi. First, it is a bad practice to have unprotected sexual activity with unknown persons. Second, 30 days is too early for the tridot to be positive. You need to wait for at least 45 to 90 days. Tridot test is an antibody test, and HIV antibodies will not form within 45 to 90 days. A sore throat is not a symptom of HIV as it is a common upper respiratory tract infection. A white tongue is not a common symptom, and it should be ruled out for candidiasis. The symptoms of HIV needs time to form around one and a half to three years. Finally, get fourth generation HIV test done after 45 days for the final confirmation.

Unasyn 1 gram tablets every 12 hours for seven days after the three days of injection. Drink warm fluids and avoid cold and spicy foods.

Either I have to take nebulizer with Duolin or Borecort or Asthalene inhaler. But I am not satisfied with all these medicines. Kindly suggest. I got an asthma attack 13 years back.","Doctor":"Hello. If your asthma symptoms are not under control, an evaluation will be necessary to know the reason. Change in inhalers will be necessary. We need to evaluate what all things you are allergic to and those have to be avoided. I see that your weight is 92 kg. Weight reduction will go a long way in asthma control. If you also have a nasal allergy, that also has to be treated. Allergy testing may be done to determine what all things you are allergic to. 1.Poor inhalation technique.  2.Obesity. 3.Regular exposure to allergens. 1.CBC (complete blood count). 2.Serum IgE. 3.Absolute eosinophil count. 4.Spirometry. 5.Allergy test.

She had done abortion with the help of Mifepristone 200 mcg and Misoprostol 800 mcg. She took Mifepristone in the morning and after 24 hours, she took Misoprostol orally. After taking Misoprostol, within 40 minutes she started bleeding with clots. For four days, she got bleeding and then it stopped. Then again after seven days from the day Mifepristone was taken, she again did a blood test. At that time, her hCG level came down to 9. So, can you tell me if her abortion is successful?","Doctor":"Hello. If her hCG levels have gone down from 600 to 9, it means she has successfully aborted. No need to worry. Generally, we recommend ultrasound by a gynecologist after two weeks to see some bits lying inside but as your levels have reduced drastically, it is almost a complete process.

I had protected sex with a call girl four weeks back and do not know about her HIV status. I heard from her, she lost weight in recent months and also has cough.

Again, the doctor told it is food poisoning. I am worrying, is this sign of HIV? When do I need to be tested again? What are the symptoms?","Doctor":"Hi. Call girls are high-risk group for HIV infection. Your complaint of diarrhea and fever may be due to anxiety causing increased bowel movements and increased core temperature causing fever. Rapid tests will be negative for 45 to 90 days. It is too early to have diarrhea and fever from HIV infection. Get tested for fourth generation HIV tests after 45 days.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

After surgery, I had two days of pink spotting then nothing and from yesterday, I have dark brown discharge, is it also normal? Currently, I am on Ibuprofen.","Doctor":"Hello. The incision taken is for the surgeon's comfort. A right-handed surgeon will take a right incision. The incision site usually does not depend on the site of the problem. Yes, you can definitely have a vaginal birth in future and there is no doubt in that. Laparoscopy is a very safe procedure and will definitely not harm or damage the uterus or adjacent structures.

The emergency room glued the finger closed. Seven days later, it split back open. It was no longer bleeding, despite being an open wound. I taped it back closed and was very cautious not to split it open again. The finger seemed to heal together. However, for the last 10 days, no additional healing or changes seem to have occurred. The finger appears mostly together, but the area that was sliced is inflamed and sensitive to the touch and does not seem to be improving any longer. Though the appearance is a bit inflamed (swollen/red), I am mainly concerned about the nerves which sting or hurt a little when the finger touches things on this spot. I would like to understand more about the nerve damage or issues that could be permanent with this injury.","Doctor":"Hi. I went through the files (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You seem to really have a bad wound. But you need not worry too much about the nerve damage in this part of your body as this area is naturally rich in blood and nerve supply. Though healing may take some time and area may remain sensitive to heat, cold, and touch but all will be fine within next two to three weeks as natural regeneration may take some time. The present condition of your wound looks satisfactory. And for the swelling, you need to do pressure bandage for few days or it will heal with time. Just apply Voltral gel (Diclofenac) and swelling will be better soon.

Can I-pill cause any side effect when taken three times again and again between the period of 10 days?","Doctor":"Hi. It is better to have another I-pill. Although it works, the efficiency decreases with time. There are no other significant side effects. However, menstrual irregularities are more like delayed periods for few cycles, nausea, vomiting, and breast tenderness. Also, taking I-pill on a regular basis will reduce the efficiency and increases the failure rate. So it is better to take oral contraceptive pills.

Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

Could this be HIV because I read that nodes on the neck are normally associated with it?","Doctor":"Hi. Lymphadenopathy is not related to HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and probably caused by infected teeth as HIV infection takes approximately six months to one year to get lymphadenopathy. Get HIV test after 45 to 90 days with generation four dual tests or western blot to confirm infection. Soft movable node is probably due to infection and abscess may be formed.

We have been asked to consult a hematologist. We are worried as in what type of issue is she having. She does not have a fever, is acting well and eating well.","Doctor":"Hello. In children, there is usually a presence of high lymphocytes. But in your child, absolute lymphocytosis is present. Hence, your child should be referred to a hematologist for examination, especially, lymph nodes palpation, liver, and spleen palpation. (If needed, USG scan can be done for that). Tuberculosis, measles, chickenpox, hepatitis, infectious mononucleosis, brucellosis, etc., are some of the infective causes but specific symptoms regarding that are not present as per history. Autoimmune disorder and leukemia also are some of the causes. These are different causes to provide you information regarding lymphocytosis cause.  Your latest smear report shows high atypical lymphocytes (attachment removed to protect patient identity), mostly it can be some form of viral infection. But we do not want to take the risk and consult to a Hematologist for examination and investigate with USG abdomen scan also. If needed, then flow cytometry like higher investigation can be planned. Hope this provided information will be beneficial to you while you consult a nearby hematologist for examination. Take care.

The doctor prescribed Albendazole 5 ml-5 ml two doses in half an hour interval but by mistake, I had given 10 ml-10 ml dose of Albendazole. So, is there any problem?","Doctor":"Hello. The recommended dose below 2 years of age is only 200 mg. Albendazole is an anthelmintic or anti-worm medication. It prevents newly hatched insect larvae. You have over dosed your child. As such child may be fine, keep a watch for adverse symptoms. If any, visit a Pediatrician for a clinical evaluation.

I have been diagnosed with endometriosis two years ago, had two failed IVF protocols. It seems that the main problem is the egg quality. Also, have a high prolactin level. I am taking Dostinex for that. My doctor prescribed me to take Janine (oral contraceptive pill, consisting of Progestin 2 mg and Ethinylestradiol 0.03 mg) for two months. I have also heard about the combination of supplements Myoinositol, Curcumin, Folate, Resveratrol, and Melatonin. Would taking an oral contraceptive pill with Myoinositol bundle simultaneously not contradict each other as contraceptive pill works to suppress the ovulation and Myoinositol on the other hand works to improve the egg quality?","Doctor":"Hi. That is a good question. Let me assure you that, only oral contraceptive pills, taken continuously, to avoid periods will help you. As the occurrence of periods will add on to the blood collection into the space around the uterus and increase the endometriosis. It is not the function of stopping the ovulation which it is used for.  Myoinositol, on the other hand, reduces the insulin resistance and improves the chances of future ovulation. I do not see any use of having this in your case. It will only be a placebo. All you need is to have serum FSH (follicular stimulating hormone) and AMH (anti-Mullerian hormone) on day 3 or 4 of periods. This will predict the number of eggs that you have. Depending on that you can go ahead with a different protocol for IVF stimulation (in-vitro fertilization).

My question is whether the illness is related to cancer? Also, what kind of treatment can be given?","Doctor":"Hi. I have reviewed your query and here is my advise. When there is a decrease in neutrophil count, the chances of infection are more. So, a close clinical observation is needed. If any unusual fever, dyspnea occurs, you should consult the doctor immediately. The low neutrophil count will not cause cancer. Infections can suppress the bone marrow and makes the count low. The CBC (complete blood count) report with peripheral smear examination report has to be checked for giving more comment. You can attach your report for giving more comment.

If your erection is normal, then stop worrying about the size. If you are not able to move the foreskin freely over the tip, then this should be evaluated by a surgeon. This could be due to phimosis.

Recently, I had taken a general complete blood and urine checkup. Certain readings on my blood sample are not normal. They are as follows:  Lipoprotein: 43 mg/dL. Cholesterol (HDL): 55.2. Cholesterol (LDL): 125. Lipoprotein: 43. GGT: 68.8. Homocysteine: 25.3. Hs-CRP: 9.41. Vitamin B12: 147. 25 hydroxyvitamin D: 20.5.  Please advice in regards to my report.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your reports are fine with some derangements. Firstly, your LDL cholesterol is borderline elevated due to which lipoprotein (a) is elevated. So, since it is borderline elevated, there is no absolute need for medicines. You should follow a healthy lifestyle like having less of high-calorie food, low oily and spicy diet. Less of salt, light dinner, and avoiding rice. Regular exercises like running for at least 30 minutes a day. Repeat lipid profile after eight weeks and see for the response. If there is a response, then we will continue the same, and if no response, then we will add medicines. If you think, you are already having the best possible healthy lifestyle then should be started on tablet Rosuvastatin 5 mg bedtime. Your HDL (high-density lipoprotein) is fine.  GGT (glucose tolerance test) is borderline elevated and like due to obesity and fat deposition in liver and alcohol intake, weight loss and above lifestyle will help. Also, alcohol consumption should be reduced. Vitamin D is low, so should have tablet Uprise D3 60,000 units once a week for eight weeks and then, once a month for six months after a weekly course is finished. HsCRP (high sensitive C-reactive protein) is also elevated due to obesity and will gradually settle. Next is elevated homocysteine which is likely due to low vitamin 12. So should have tablet ME12 (Methylcobalamin, Folic acid, and Pyridoxine) once daily for eight weeks for that. Also, get folate test done to look for the cause for elevated homocysteine.

Although the pain has reduced, I guess there is an infection. There is a cyst underneath my jaw.","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, regarding the swelling, which you assume to be a cyst could be a lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph node). It shows that there is some inflammation or infection process going on. Regarding the wisdom tooth, if it has space and is in a correct position, it will come out or chances are there for it to be impacted. An OPG will be needed to assess that. For now, go and consult your dentist for examination as the pain could be due to pericoronitis (inflammation of the gums covering the erupting tooth). Do lukewarm water salt gargling. I suggest taking Aceclofenac 100 mg after food morning and night, in case you have severe pain; otherwise, no need. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicine with their consent. If you have acidity, I suggest Pantoprazole 40 mg once daily half an hour before food. For the inflammation/infection, you can take capsule Amoxicillin morning, noon and night after food for five days. But, these are symptomatic treatment. Kindly meet your dentist for the examination and treatment plan. If you have decreased mouth opening, then also, do not worry, these medicines will help relieve it.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I went to my doctor and was told it was due to anxiety so I started Zoloft and Prilosec. I had panic attacks and hyperventilation, but my severe gas and pain will not go away. I tried every gas/indigestion medication and these problems still persist. Could this be heart-related? No known family history of heart problems.","Doctor":"Hello.

Kindly get back with the above details for further discussion and management."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I have noticed this very pale light brown vertical streak in my thumbnail about a week ago. I am very worried after reading online about something called longitudinal melanoma. I am 27 years old female.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case. Well, longitudinal melanoma is one of the causes of brown streaks. Other causes include multivitamin deficiency including zinc. These are micronutrient and not stored in the body and need a continuous replacement. Other causes include normal variation.Drugs like Doxycycline and many others can cause it, and lichen planus too. To rule out lichen planus, I need to see your all 20 nails and buccal mucosa.  It is longitudinal melanonychia. Melanoma is a malignancy and it does not look to be the cause in your case. Take capsule Perfectil plus (multivitamins) for three months. In my clinical opinion, this is a normal variation (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Melanoma is dark and irregular in appearance. Just stay relaxed. Nothing to worry about this.

The doctor did an angiogram, and they told there is a block in the blood pumping vessel and it is closed. We planned for placing a stent. The next day, the doctor tested again and told the blood vessel is opened and it is normal. So, the stent was not placed. After a few days, my father had pain below the heart which was on the rib side, and he told something is holding in the heart. So, again we went to the cardiologist. The doctor examined him and said he is fine and there is nothing to worry. Whenever he got this pain, we consulted the cardiologist, and he said there is no problem in the heart. He got this pain for about three times till now. Again, we tested for a gastric problem and a neurological problem. That was also fine after the examination. But, still he is experiencing the same pain, and he is willing to do angiogram now. I cannot understand the problem. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Your cardiologist would have done ECG (electrocardiogram), echocardiogram, and TMT (treadmill test). If all these three tests are normal, then the cardiac problem is unlikely to occur. If this pain is not increased during walking or any other physical activity, then it is not from the heart. Usually, heart attack pain increase during physical activity. It can be a muscular, or anxiety or microvascular angina. If he is in discomfort, you can go for an angiogram on your will.

With proper diet and exercise, I was able to reduce my weight. Now, my weight is 65 kilograms. But I am unable to control my urge to eat. I am cheating on my diet every single day and it makes me frustrated. I am overeating again. I have stopped losing weight now. I take around 1200 calories a day. Please tell me how to control the urge to eat all the time.","Doctor":"Hi. You have reached your normal BMI (body mass index). So after this, weight reduction will be a very slow process. According to WHO (world health organization), you are weighing right for your height. Coming to the eating problem, divide your meals into six small meals. Eat veggies and fruits in between the meals. Whenever you are going to a party have a habit of drinking water first. Eat fibers like salads or fruits with proteins. Select carbohydrates or desserts in the last. By this way, you will be able to relish and enjoy the food. You can maintain your weight. Never eat food alone or in front of the television or laptop. Eat with your friends. Sharing will always make you eat less.

My doctor tells me it is not stabilized, but may become that way sometime in the future, but now needs frequent treatments. What should I do? Is there any stretching exercise that will free up the joint? Any other advice?","Doctor":"Hello. In my opinion, I would like you to do glute stabilization exercises as those exercises will help you stabilize your pelvis, and thereby your back and SI joint. Along with those stabilization exercises, some simple hip mobility exercises will help you reduce the load on the lower back. Simple exercises like bridging clamshell will help to strengthen gluteus along with step up. Stretching for gluteus and piriformis hip iR stretch will help maintain hip mobility.

The baby movement is fine but I am not able to eat anything because of nausea and frequent urination. Burning feet is also there accompanied by gas and constipation.","Doctor":"Hello. Vomiting is more usual in the first trimester. In the second and third trimester, it is less usual and can be due to a urine infection. Have urinalysis and urine culture. If it comes positive for infection, you need antibiotics. Have a strict check on thyroid as well. It should be normal and have recurrent checkups. Have plenty of water and cranberry juice to prevent/have relief from a urine infection. I suggest you have tablet Cyclizine 50 mg eight hourly before 45 minutes of taking food. Have small frequent meals of your choice that you like nowadays and you can have easily like juices, soups, soft diet but homemade. Have walk daily and try to have diet properly with a tablet as improper diet habits cause digestive problems. Have Calcium on alternate days for few days till you have relief from these symptoms.

For the past two months, I started having a pricky ejaculation every time when I have sex. My erection is perfectly fine, but my ejaculation is painful. I have consulted a local doctor here. Currently, I am taking Calamox 625 mg twice a day, Safepram in the morning, and Maxit 50 mg twice a day. Since after taking these medicines, I am unable to get a full erection and there is a delay in ejaculation. Sometimes the ejaculation is absent. I am willing to take a second opinion online. I think it is due to the side effects of the medicines. Please help me and advise proper treatment for the painful ejaculation.","Doctor":"Hi. It seems that the delay in ejaculation and erectile dysfunction is probably due to the side effects of Safepram (Escitalopram), which is an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). They are known to cause such effects. Painful ejaculation and micturition are most probably due to infection, and Calamox 625 mg (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) will take care of it. You can stop taking Safepram, and these side effects will disappear within two weeks. For more information consult a sexologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have bleeding, swelling, and pain in the gums. Please suggest tablets for getting relief.","Doctor":"Hi. Bleeding gums are due to inflamed (simply, swollen) gums. The most probable cause is calculus (hard deposits) and plaque (soft deposits) irritating the gums. The treatment is to get a professional cleaning (scaling) done by a dentist. You can do lukewarm salt water gargling to give some relief to the gums. Mouthwash (Chlorhexidine) can be used but, use it after diluting it with water once or twice daily till the gums get normal. After that, you can continue just lukewarm salt water, as Chlorhexidine can cause tooth discoloration. Kindly, follow the correct brushing method (modified Bass sulcular method). Medicines are not required compulsorily in this case. The other cause could be of swelling (sinus opening) due to chronic infection of a tooth. In this case, antibiotics are prescribed. I would like to see the image of the tooth to guide you with the provisional diagnosis. Kindly visit your nearby dentist for a further clinical examination, X-ray, and treatment.

While there was no blood, a small scratch remained. I took only one dose of the rabies vaccine and a tetanus injection. Is that alright?","Doctor":"Hello. Scratches on any region of the body by a rabies animal or suspected rabies animal need to be treated with a five-dose schedule of Rabipur (inactivated rabies virus vaccine) on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. And if that scratch is on regions like head, neck, shoulder, arms, and hands, it must be treated with an additional human rabies immunoglobulin injection (within seven days of the first dose of vaccine) in addition to a five-dose schedule of Rabipur.  You have not mentioned how long it has been since you have been bitten and taken the first dose. You should check with your local physician and discuss regarding further doses of vaccine.

The activity I indulged in was blowjob and kiss, no penetrative sex was done, and I did not give her oral either. I was so tensed that on the 20th day of exposure, I had HIV 2 plus p24 antigen tests which came negative with an index value (.1) and index value greater than one are positive according to the report. I am so depressed and will go for testing after three months. Is my exposure high risk? Which test should I do now? And what are my chances for other STDs?","Doctor":"Hi. First, I need to inform you that, the oral cavity has the lowest viral load and the possibility of transmission is least to none. Secondly, the HIV virus has an envelope that is made of fats which will be digested by salivary enzymes. So, HIV survival is least in saliva. But, only indication to count is injury or ulcer in the oral cavity. Thirdly, coming to your scenario, oral sex cannot transmit the infection even if she had HIV infection considering she had no oral ulcers and you had no ulcer on the penis. You are not at risk of acquiring HIV. HIV has a window period of 45 days to three months. So get western blot test after 45 days to completely rule out HIV infection. Coming to STD, yes, you may get and chances are high. The infection can be HPV (human papillomavirus), HSV (herpes simplex virus). No need to have any measures at this stage.

So, if your period is delayed for one week, then a urine hCG card test is advisable to rule out pregnancy. If you want to rule out early, then a blood hCG estimation can be done.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Like your father, who loves you, he will also be pleased with your achievement. Your boyfriend is just using you. He is not even ready to accept your progress. He is not a person for you. First of all, stop talking to him and clear all the contacts with him. You must go to college and do not stay alone, always stay with some friends. Talk with them once. Initially, you will feel bad, but it is best for your good future. You will find someone better. It is not the last one. Be bold. Do not get afraid. Take a healthy decision for your life. Life is to live. Do not feel guilty for the wrong choice of boyfriend. It is a part of life. We are meant to make mistakes. Concentrate more on studies, score higher marks than him. Get a high score in your exams. Make him feel guilty for losing you. Love yourself. Spend more time with your family and friends.

Firstly, your risk is unwarranted in this case. To the best of my knowledge, as per published literature, there is no case reported of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) through kissing. Saliva itself has very low concentrations of HIV and also contains anti-HIV factors that prevent transmission. However, theoretically, there can be a risk if there is a presence of blood in the mouth of the other person like in the case if there is an active bleeding gums or sores or ulcers.

So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

If possible, how can I improve my height?","Doctor":"Hi. I have reviewed your query. The growth of bones eventually stops, because of the closure of growth plates in long bones, which occurs in puberty that is around 16 years of age in girls and 14 to 19 years in boys. According to the majority of studies, the growth of height stops between 18 to 20 years. It is highly unlikely for a girl to have her height increased after 18 years (especially after 16 years for girls). Rarely, few studies propose that you can gain a little increase in height by taking foods with Calcium and Vitamin D as required regularly. But this seems to have only small benefits after the growth plate closure. Growth hormone injections do not have any role in your age group (just for children with deficiencies of hormone). But, in some countries, bone lengthening procedures are being done, which are high risk associated with varied results and even not allowed in a few places. There is very minimal chance of increasing your height at this age group. Still, you can follow a few simple methods like taking nutritious food and exercising regularly and maintaining proper posture methods.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

For your dark spots, you may use a skin lightening cream like a Kojic acid-based cream (Kojic cream). Use it twice daily over the dark spots and hyperpigmentation.

They include low creatinine clearance, high potassium, patient becoming acidotic, symptoms of uremia (increased urea in the blood), loss of appetite, uremic heart problems and accumulation of fluid in body parts like feet causing edema and lungs causing shortness of breath. Even if your mother is not experiencing any of the above symptoms, depending on her history of chronic diabetes and levels of creatinine clearance, (I could not calculate exact creatinine clearance for your mother as you have not mentioned her weight, but taking an average female weight of 60 kilograms, your mother's creatinine clearance is very low), she might be considered for dialysis, which can be confirmed by a few other tests and examination done by your physician. Postponing the dialysis when she needs, it will make her worse. Though she is producing a decent amount of urine per day, she might still be at risk of various uremic complications based on her creatinine values.

No breakouts or irritation and I can tell slightly that my complexion is better. I also try to do some organic and natural remedies on occasion, like turmeric powder face masks to lighten the dark areas.

As this tumor is not common in this age group, it is advised to review the pathology specimen again with the use of immunohistochemical markers in a different lab or take a new biopsy as FNAC is sometimes insufficient to confirm the diagnosis. After staging workup is completed and pathology (second opinion) report will reconfirm the diagnosis, the patient may need and benefit from chemoradiation (radiation therapy and chemotherapy).

I have a peak flow of 67 liters per minute which is good. I did a chest X-ray before two months ago, which was normal.Why am I getting out of breath so quick?","Doctor":"Hello. Your respiratory and cardiac workup is normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The tests you have investigated is fine. So cardiac and respiratory cause seems less likely. Now for dyspnea, check your CBC (complete blood count) report to rule out anemia in which low hemoglobin can lead to dyspnea. Give your history regarding anxiety, if present.

What should I do to heal and get rid of the dark spots?","Doctor":"Hi. Your history is suggestive of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It was on the fingers near the nail and also between the fingers joints with water blisters it oozes out then dry and cracks. It hurts like burn some time especially when I use my finger to touch or peel onion or ginger or garlic it aggravates. Since it was lockdown I cannot go to the hospital and the doctor asked me to use the ointment until it looks normal then told me to stop using it.

I have read your query and understood your concern. As per history and pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it seems to be allergic contact dermatitis to me. Such condition tends to recur very often. I would advise you to kindly use double-layered gloves always while doing household work using detergent or chemical. Since long term use of such creams make the skin thinner so it is advised to continue the creams containing steroids like Clobetasol, Halobetasol for a week followed by maintenance therapy meaning apply the creams over weekend like Saturday and Sunday. While active disease, you may use oral anti-allergics like Levocetirizine 5 mg once daily in the night time for a week. Use ample amount of moisturizer to keep the skin hydrated.

Should I make her wear glasses, or stye can be cured by following a proper diet?","Doctor":"Hello. It is not wrong to correct the vision. You have to learn, or your daughter has to learn how to clean her eyelids and eyelashes every night before sleep. She can use a small piece of tissue, wet it by sterile water and then gently wipe the edges of the eyelids so close to the roots of lashes, this must be done daily as a daily habit. After that, she can put an eye ointment after cleaning the eyes on the edges and lashes. The eye ointment should be Tetracycline or Fucithalmic (Fusidic acid) used for one month. Then stop using it for three months. After that, you can use it for one month. Then stop using them for six months. Then use them for one month. But, do not leave them unclean. If the stye comes again, continue what I have explained above. If the stye come due to infection, you must discuss with an internal doctor to search for the cause.

Atrial fibrillation occurring in this age group needs evaluation like an echocardiogram, cardiac stress test, coronary angiography to rule out coronary artery disease. Next, I guess you do not have any other diseases like diabetes, hypertension, or stroke. If not, then you do not have to take blood thinners. Usually, atrial fibrillation is not a life-threatening disease, but it can cause troubles. Regarding management, you should be treated with beta blockers like Metoprolol to keep your heart rate under control.

Soon, after that, they started my treatment. Now I am on ART therapy. But till today I am not sure that whether I am HIV positive or not. I have started taking medicines. I am having a problem with my appetite and some brain problem. My CD4 count was 503. Please help me. I did a VDRL test which came out positive. I am also taking medicines for TLE.","Doctor":"Hi. As far as the HIV test is concerned, it is positive (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and if you have a doubt, then you can get tested for RNA PCR.

Regarding VDRL (venereal disease research laboratory), it indicates syphilis, and you need to take Benzathine penicillin injection of 2.4 million units once weekly for three weeks.

If you have any feeling of doubt, then you get a rabies vaccine. Licking an open wound can transmit the virus if the dog has a rabies infection.

Loss of smell or anosmia has been one of the peculiar atypical features of covid and there have been lots of theories and explanations behind it. In all circumstances, loss of smell and taste are always associated together irrespective of the cause. This is attributed to the close approximaty of both the processing centres in the brain.

I also have burning and tingling sensation that runs down my inner legs from my thighs to my ankles. Some days, it is better than others. I feel fatigue and it is a bit hard for me to get out of a chair due to being weak at times. I do have energy though to perform daily activities once I am up. I stopped drinking two weeks ago. I eat daily. There is no nausea, vomiting, bleeding, spider veins or yellowing of skin and eyes, I have normal bowel movements and there is no blood in stool. The stool color is normal. I do not feel hallucinations or loss of memory. My urine is dark yellow or brown and cloudy at times. I am a bit pale, but I have always been that way. I sleep regularly and have not lost any weight on the scale. But, I feel my muscle may have been replaced with fat.

A blood sugar level of 218 is higher than the recommended range. In pregnancy, this needs to be brought to the attention of your gynecologist at the earliest. However, if you have checked your blood sugar at home using a glucometer, there could be an error occasionally. Hence, I recommend that you talk to your gynecologist about this. He or she will recommend you to undergo a test called the oral glucose tolerance test. If this shows high levels, you might be started on medication to help you control your blood sugar level and to ensure good health of the baby.  You do not have to worry too much because this kind of high blood sugar during pregnancy resolves completely after pregnancy in most cases.

You can put it on the lid and inside the eye twice a day for the first week and once a day the next week.

Next two days, I was better. So, I ran for another 10 kilometers but, this time when I arrived home, it was even worse. There was a shoulder pain, and dorsal muscle back pain when I was walking. Then, it was very hard for me to move, to walk more than one km, and I felt very tired after some walk. Also, when I take a deep breath, I could feel my back muscles in pain. There was a slight muscle pain on the right side of the back in a specific point on the middle side near the spine. I did MRI, chest X-ray, cardio-echography, ENG, and EMG test, and also done a series of blood tests for the rare infections and virus. They found a sign of unknown infection. The leucocyte level was high and after a few days, it became normalized. I also saw a neurologist and he told me that everything is fine from his point of view. In MRI, there were minor changes on the dorsal side of the back, but there was no nerve damage or joint damage. The immunological test and the other results also came negative. This happened two months back and still, I feel weak and have muscle pain in my back, especially when I am doing slight activities. Is there any chance to have persistent muscle back pain from running? I am taking Magnesium, Calcium, Cerebinox, and Propanolol tablets. I had no issues like this before.","Doctor":"Hello. Post-exhaustion muscle necrosis is a known entity which occurs when the blood supply to the muscle is compromised during the exercise period. It is usually documented by demonstrating the high levels of LDH (lactic acid dehydrogenase) test and CPK (creatine phosphokinase) in the blood. The conditions will recover slowly until the damaged muscle fibers recover and may take months. You need to restart slowly by exercising so that the muscles will adapt properly in a graded manner. I believe your vitamin D and TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) levels are normal, if not done, do the tests and hopefully, you will recover soon.

Is it advisable to wait for one month to be seen by my gynecologist or go to an urgent care right away?","Doctor":"Hi. If you had a yeast infection, you would have been treated with antifungals and not antibiotics. Since you have a recurrence after being cured with the first treatment, you should be examined to see if it is similar or different infection now and treated accordingly. 1.Vulvovaginal candidiasis. 2.Urinary tract infection. 1.You should get urine routine and microscopy test with midstream sample to see if you have associated urinary tract infection. 2.You may require a pap smear. 3.Fasting and postprandial blood sugars. 1.Capsule Clotrimazole vaginal pessary at night daily for one week. 2.Syrup Citralka one teaspoon with one glass of water thrice daily for one week. 1.Control sugars if you are diabetic. 2.Drink plenty of water. 3.Keep your private parts dry.

She has one central incisor protruded and the other is inside and one lateral that has not come out fully and another lateral is normal. How can I get this corrected?","Doctor":"Hi. Till one year, do not do anything, that means until she crosses 11 years of age. Most of the times, this ugly duckling stage (we call it in medical terms) is corrected by the fully erupted canines. At this stage, if you do anything or start any treatment, it may hamper the development of her jaw. So, wait for a year and a half and decide after that too.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Yes, usually echo is sufficient to diagnose restrictive cardiomyopathy if findings are clearcut and the observer is sufficiently confident in the findings.

I would really appreciate this as I am wondering if I am not really able to have any more kids? I am not sensitive and am happy to hear the truth.","Doctor":"Hello. Do not be stressed and think positive. It would be better if you send me your complete history of menses, gynecological, obstetrics, medicine, and medications you had ever. As far as I could understand, you had postpartum bleeding (after delivery of your second child). For that, clots were removed manually and it is a source of anxiety for you still. Postpartum hemorrhage (bleeding after delivery) could be mostly due to four 'T's: tissue, trauma, thrombin,and tone. For you, it was some retained tissue that caused bleeding and that removed even manually as well. I do not know your circumstances and situation of that time but it is past now. So, now think positive for future. Pain, before menses is part of the premenstrual syndrome or only pain, can be observed by normal females.

I have gone through the attached reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Yes, the biopsy report has confirmed the diagnosis of breast cancer. Now, the next step will be to stage this disease. For that purpose, she will be adviced to do a CT scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis plus possibly an isotope bone scan and mammogram of bilateral breasts. Once the staging work is completed, she will be planned for an oncological treatment. Various treatment options are available for breast cancer - chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, hormonal and target therapy. It will be planned after completion of staging workup and once the pathological and molecular details of the tumor are available.

Now, I found that I am pregnant for five weeks. Will it harm my baby? Should I continue with the pregnancy or are there any chances of abnormalities in the baby?","Doctor":"Hello. You have not described your detailed history regarding medical, surgical, gynecological, obstetrical history here. Have you done serum beta hCG or transvaginal scan? If done beta hCG, it is better to have two levels (test to be done two times with an interval of 48 hours) beta hCG to have a clear idea about the pregnancy whether it is increasing by more than 60 % in a healthy manner. Divery is a progesterone hormone. Few doctors give it to support conception and early pregnancy as well. So, it does not have a harmful effect actually. Ask all medications from your treating doctor in detail that you have been taking for conception, PCOD, regulation of cycles, etc. as few hormones are supportive to pregnancy while others can have wrong effects as well. Have full treatment if any disease that you have been experiencing. Continue Folic acid 0.4 mg daily. Have transvaginal scan and beta hCG two levels with an interval of 48 hours. Few patients with a history of multiple miscarriages, polycystic disease, infertility, etc., are advised supportive hormone progesterone for pregnancy or early conception. You have not given your history here but it is better now to discuss with the treating doctor that with early pregnancy your previous history will he/she think that you need progesterone support. If yes, it could be given until the end of the first trimester or even more. I hope you get my point.

You need to start working out (better would be to join the gym and do treadmill and cardio exercises under the supervision of a gym instructor). Take healthy and natural diet. No junk food and lazy habits. Remain active and keep calm. ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) is high and the reasons can be discussed with your treating physician. Causes of high ESR can be inflammations and infections in the body. Your chest X-ray shows infection (bronchitis) and that may be a causative factor. Hope it helps.

I am under stress and depression. I got married under a forceful pressure from my mother, despite me telling her to postpone it for few years. As I was very obedient to her, I succumbed to her demand for marriage. After six months of my marriage, my wife was brainwashed by her mother to come back to her house and live with them. Only by that she can live a luxurious free life. I heard all these when she was talking over the phone. My wife agreed with her mother for all the plans to take me out of my home and go to her mother’s house. I thought, let me not talk openly about this and change her attitude patiently instead of being aggressive. Unfortunately, my wife’s brothers are living in their in-laws home. There are living an immoral life and now my wife wants the same trend. On the top of it, my mother’s behavior also changed and every time there is some fight between my mother and my wife. In the meantime. I know my wife like to have marital affairs. The dispute got worse where my in-laws keep telling my neighbors that I am torturing husband and all cheap accusations. They came to my house along with neighbors and I clearly got to know they want their daughter to come back and take care of them instead of my parents. My mother-in-law is not happy with her husband. At this age, she has extramarital affairs. All the unknown people come to her house in her husband’s absence. I got to know all these notorious after my marriage. People do say that she was a sex worker before her marriage, which is sadly true. She openly teaches my wife about pornography, watching all boys (that she regularly does) and all the shameless stuffs. I am good looking, appear very young, very smart and look very professional in my dress, outlook. Most of my neighbors are jealous of looking at me as well in professional look.When all these false accusations were made against me, I was silent and kept quiet but now I feel depressed and alone. I regret why I did not reply to them. I blame god, fate, my mother and everyone for all these. I feel like hearing those words of accusation in my ears. I regret why I could not reply to them. I regret why this type of notorious women came to life. I regret why I marry. I murmur to me as if I am replying to them of their accusations. I get angry frequently now and my mood changes frequently. One time I will blame with frustration to god and after sometime I feel let them learn a lesson. I consulted a psychiatrist and he recommended Estomine SF once daily for three months. I took it for three months and I was fine. There were no negative thoughts and I started with normal life. I was happy with recovery. Now, I have stopped the medications. Already one month over. Again, same negative thoughts coming to my mind as usual. No control on my thoughts of blaming to all. I do not know what to do? My doctor said to change the lifestyle. He advised me to do meditation, as the tablets cannot help in the long run. I have lots to study for my IT exams in four months. I am unable to concentrate. Please advise. What is my condition? Why am I getting these negative thoughts over and over? Should I start taking tablets? Should I change the tablet? I like fitness and bodybuilding passionately. Should I join a gym? Should I also go for a some body massage to get relief as few websites do suggest for stress and depression relief?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read each word of your query with keen interest and understand your concerns. For further information consult a psychiatrist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am a 17 year old girl. I am suffering from tension-like feeling about everything around me since I entered puberty. I have very very low power of decision making. All this has now affected my studies. Now, I am very worried about my studies. I do not know what to do. If I found my performance going low, then I have thoughts of suicide. I cannot achieve what I want due to my negative thoughts.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, you need to reduce thinking so much about all these issues. Most of the issues resolve with time and on their own. Your priority should be studies only. Just focus on one thing at a time.  Try to work hard and perform well. Once it improves, you will get some confidence and other things start improving. You should do some yoga and meditation in order to improve concentration and mental stability. Also, consult a psychologist for counseling sessions regarding your future action and dealing with negative thoughts. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.

He took Clavam 625 mg for five days. Along with that, he also took Foracort 200 mcg inhaler twice a day and Nasonex inhaler twice a day, but there was no relief. Then, our chest specialist suggested Nebulizer with Budecort 0.5 mg twice a day for 15 days. After taking this too there was no relief. Then, he took Omnacortil 30 mg (Prednisolone) and Montair LC once a day for five days. He is prediabetic, but the medicines have not been started so far. Please suggest me some advice.","Doctor":"Hi. Your father is suffering from bronchial asthma. The current medications Foracort 200 mcg inhaler (Budesonide and Formoterol) and Nasonex (Mometasone) nasal spray were given for asthma. As there is no relief even after taking tablet Clavam (Amoxicillin and Clavulanate) and tablet Prednisolone, it indicates that the dose of current inhaler is not sufficient. So, I suggest that it is important to increase the dose of Foracort inhaler to 400 mcg two puffs twice daily followed by gargling. I also suggest Levolin inhaler (Levosalbutamol) two puffs thrice daily and Benz pearls (Benzonatate) two puffs twice daily.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

She also faints at times during periods. Earlier, she used to bleed heavily. Two months ago, she bled for 3 weeks and due to which she had gynecological checkup and a few tests. Since she started these tablets, she is getting a lot of clots and her periods are not regular. She has put on weight in the last two to three years. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. She is a case of PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). She is having anovulatory cycles with decreased estradiol levels and painful menses with severe premenstrual symptoms. She needs to be placed on low dose oral contraceptive pills for at least three to six months and Myo-inositol supplementation along with antispasmodics to be used as and when required when the dysmenorrhea sets it. OC pills shall avoid clots, decrease blood flow and maintain the hormonal imbalance. Also, exercise and weight control through diet would have to be practiced with sufficient daily water intake. Ask her to avoid, oily, spicy, fried and fatty foods completely. Deviry (Medroxyprogesterone) alone should be stopped and it is not the treatment. Because, it does not contain Myo-inositol.

I have been having black colored periods bleeding from the last three months. The bleeding is black on all the days of the periods.","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? That is quite a short history. Having black or altered blood in the first few months after abortion is common. We have to rule out the following possibilities. Get a pelvic scan to rule out any endometrial polyps or any uterine masses or any endometrial pathology. This polyp may be from the cervix projecting into the vagina causing such symptoms. Rule out a possibility of a second pregnancy, so get a home urine pregnancy test done. It may be early pregnancy bleeding. Hope you are not using any other hormonal pills. If you have a lot of vaginal discharge, itching, foul smell, then it might be a vaginal infection. In such a case, I suggest a course of antibiotics. Vaginal infection can cause a lot of spotting or altered blood loss. If your periods are associated with severe abdominal pain, then it could be endometriosis, which will be corrected only with hormone pills or by getting pregnant. It can be diagnosed with physical examination and using pelvic scans. During the examination, the cervix can be evaluated, and Pap smear can also be taken. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

She had been on painkillers (Indocap) for three years, which she was taking on a daily basis. Then for a year, her doctor advised her to have maintenance doses of Remicade infusions and she took six to seven infusions over a period of one year. After her last infusion, which she had before six months, she has been doing physical exercises and maintaining a strict diet and has not taken painkiller or infusion. Kindly suggest regarding her life after marriage, pregnancy, and others as she is planning to tie the knot soon.","Doctor":"Hi. For further information consult a rheumatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My daughter had a little girl four years ago. About three months postpartum, she fell down a flight of stairs injuring her back. At the same time, she had a very bad cold. When her back continued to give her pain after seeing the orthopedist, she went to a neurologist. Her blood work showed an ANA of 640 and a positive anti-DNA number. She was told that she was a candidate for developing lupus. Since that time she had seen a series of rheumatologist as her ANA has remained positive, rarely 320 but generally 180. He just went for a routine rheumatology and her ANA is negative as is her anti-DNA number. Of course, she is elated, as she and her husband have wanted a second child badly. They have been afraid however because of the risk of her developing lupus, especially afraid of becoming disabled as she already has one small child who needs her care. She has also been told that the offspring of women with positive ANA with potential lupus may have children with a higher incidence of autism, another great fear in this generation.She is now very confused about how to proceed in terms of getting pregnant. On one hand, it feels like she may have dodged a bullet - and if so is there any sense in running after the bullet? On the other hand, she is trying to think positively that this may be a window during which a pregnancy might be safe. There seems to be a rise in autoimmune disorders in general, especially among childbearing age women. She is a 35 year old professional. Of course, pregnancy is a hormonal firestorm and she is afraid that it will reignite lupus. On the other hand, she and her husband desperately want a second child. In your experience, once an individual who had previously tested positive ANA for four years goes to a negative status, is it likely they will remain there? Would you advise against the pregnancy? In your practice have you seen the offspring of ANA positive having a greater incidence of neuro-developmental disabilities like autism? (she was never positive for that congenital lupus marker). Do you think it is likely that the pregnancy would put her at greater risk for developing lupus either now or in the future?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, there have been cases where ANA once positive becomes negative towards the later part. Initially, it may have been induced by pregnancy or any infection but over course of time, it becomes negative. As for your friend, I would suggest we do ENA (extractable nuclear antigen) profile and antiphospholipid work up before she plans for next pregnancy. This will give us a clear idea if she has any other antibodies apart from ANA which can trigger underlying lupus. If they are negative she should be fine to go with it. But yes, with pregnancy it is difficult to predict if she will develop lupus or any other disease for that matter. But lupus in itself is not a contraindication for pregnancy. And there are no risks of autism in such patients. ANA is a mere antibody which can come positive in thyroid patients or you can even see in 5 % of the normal population without causing any symptoms. So to conclude, if her ENA is negative and antiphospholipid is negative we should not focus too much on just ANA. But yes, we cannot deny the little risk any pregnant female carries for developing new diseases. So if they really want we should not stop them. Hope the information was useful.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

It appears that you have a tight foreskin and not phimosis, I would have to examine you to confirm the diagnosis. In either case, the treatment advised would be circumcision to avoid a possibility of paraphimosis at a later date.

It has been two days since she is in ICU with artificial oxygen. Can you please comment more on this?","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the report (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your mother has pose a danger on the left side of the brain in a very critical area. The most common cause of this bleed is high blood pressure. In such a situation, patients take a long time to recover. The fact that the bleed is on the left side puts her at high risk of residual disability such as speech disturbance, memory disturbance even if she regains consciousness. The bleed is pretty bad and causing increased pressure within the skull which might pose danger to the remaining normal functioning brain. In such a situation, a decompressive craniotomy surgery may also be required. In the long term, she will take a long time to recover which can be up to six months.

Tooth discoloration can be caused either due to internal stains or external stains. If the discoloration in your case is due to external factors, then you can simply go for scaling or cleaning of the teeth which is very safe for everyone. Teeth whitening or bleaching can be done in cases of internal staining. It is done using certain chemicals, results are good, but you need to be little cautious while having colored food like tea, coffee, etc. But if you have teeth sensitivity, then bleaching would not be a good idea as it can lead to more sensitivity.

Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Yes, it is a skin disease and may be caused by allergies to various chemicals, nickel, gold, artificial jewelry, soaps, detergents, cosmetic, dettol, and antiseptics. A patch test is done to find the cause. A biopsy may also be done. At present, the clinical picture is little modified either because of treatment or picture is not very clear.

I was diagnosed with oligodendroglioma grade 2 brain tumor in the right posterior parietal region ten years back. I underwent neurosurgery, followed by radiation therapy. MRI taken after treatment showed no tumor left. But during follow up MRI’s, two years back, I was again diagnosed with a recurrence at same region as earlier. Biopsy showed it as oligodendroglioma grade 3 (anaplastic), for which I again went through a surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. At present, I am treated with anti-epileptic tablets and recent MRI was not showing any definite recurrence. I am hearing a lot about the paleo diet, which helps in reducing weight, controlling diabetic, etc. I currently weigh 105 kg and I do not have diabetics. My concern is about the recurrence of brain cancer in near future. My doubts are:  Can paleo diet help in non-recurrence of cancer, and/or, Can paleo diet help in postponing the recurrence as much time as possible.  I kindly request you to clarify me, the effect of the paleo diet in treating cancer and if so, can I come and meet you with reports, further tests.","Doctor":"Hi. What this means is assume that the chance of recurrence of a particular tumor is 80 percent. That means out of 100 people, 80 will get cancer again. Suppose all these 100 take paleo, only 50 will get cancer again. Now assume the chance of recurrence of a particular tumor is 30 percent. That means Of 100 people, 30 will get cancer again. Suppose all these 100 take paleo, no one will get cancer again. So, if you have already got a tumor, you have to take paleo.

You have taken I-pill before 10 days (before periods), and you had your menstrual cycle last week. So, I-pill will not work for you in this intercourse. If you want to avoid pregnancy, you can take another I-pill again today. But, I-pill is an emergency contraceptive pill, so it used in emergency conditions. Because of its side effects, it must not be used every time after unprotected sex. It is not a regular contraceptive pill. To avoid pregnancy, if you are sexually active, it is better to choose other alternative contraceptive methods which can be used regularly with few side effects and even lesser failure rates compared to I-pill (like oral contraceptive pills or even copper-T insertion after taking a gynecological consultation).

When I move my cheek out the way it looks like there is an ulcer. It aches and I am struggling to brush my teeth properly. I also have come down with flu symptoms. I do not know if that is related to the tooth or separate.","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? I have seen your image (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This is pericoronitis (inflammation of gums surrounding the wisdom tooth). Your wisdom tooth does not have enough space to come out completely into the mouth and hence a part of it is embedded in bone and covered by gums that have got inflamed. Right now, since you have pain, do lukewarm salt water gargling to help with the gum inflammation healing. For severe pain you can take Ibuprufen 400 mg thrice daily after food for three days. If you have acidity, take Pantoprazole 40 mg half an hour before food once daily (preferably night). Do you have any lymphadenopathy (painful swelling) below the angle of lower jaw? Do you have difficulty in mouth opening? Kindly answer these and send me your X-ray (OPG or IOPA) of that tooth to guide you precisely. Since you have flu-like symptoms, you should also have antibiotics (Amoxicillin 500 mg thrice daily for five days). Take that painkiller only when you have pain, otherwise not required, but finish the antibiotic course completely. You can also apply Dentogel topically over the ulcer half an hour before food so that it does not hurt while eating. Kindly tell me if you have any medical condition or drug allergy to guide you with proper medicines according to your condition. If you have no medical condition or any drug allergy, then you can go ahead with these medicines. Coming to the treatment, it is advisable to get it removed as this tooth is not much useful in chewing. Instead, it will cause problems only and as you said brushing is also difficult there.

Many healthy people, as well as patients with other non-cancerous diseases like rheumatic diseases, diabetic nephropathy, chronic heart diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, sepsis, may have elevated levels. So there is high false positivity rate as well. But, since it is elevated and also you being asymptomatic for other diseases I mentioned that it is better to undergo an evaluation to rule out cancer. Also, the blood test is not a very good test for screening of colorectal cancer (attachment removed to protect patient identity), and it is not recommended due to high false positivity rate, and fecal test M2-PK is a better option. So, I think you should have a fecal test as well.

Your serum creatinine is a slightly high, not much elevated. So, mild kidney involvement can be present because of lupus. Your urine eGFR (glomerular filtration rate) and protein estimation also should be done. Eosinophil can be high because of allergic inflammation and CRP (C-reactive protein) can be raised in any inflammation. Your vitamin B12 is slightly high, so it can be because of mild kidney involvement or can be from taking Vitamin B12 supplement if history is present of taking it. ALT, AST also mildly elevated and it needs to be monitored. If your SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus) flares then non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug can be prescribed for that.

Moreover, too much mental or physical stress also aggravates existing dyspepsia or hyperacidity as this causes an increase in gastric acid secretion, hence the throwing up and loss of appetite. However, if you have other symptoms like fever, abdominal pain, or malaise, we would have to look at other possibilities too. Let me know if that is all you are feeling or if there is more to your symptoms. In the meantime, try to relax and de-stress yourself by listening to music or meditate and see if you feel any better. If not, then report back to me so that we can take a look at other probable factors.

She finished six months of chemotherapy nine months back and had a radical mastectomy two months later. She is now taking Capecitabine for four months 14 days on and 7 days off. The Capecitabine gave her diarrhea so her oncologist gave her an extra week off. My question is will the extra week off effect the tumor growth? My mom started taking Capecitabine six months back. She is also taking high blood pressure medicine.","Doctor":"Hi. Triple-negative breast is usually having a poor prognosis as compared to other types of breast cancer. She has completed six months of chemo followed by surgery. Now the patient is on Capecitabine. The side effects of Capecitabine are loose motions,vomiting, low blood counts and hand-footsyndrome. Usually, if mild diarrhea 1 to 3 times per day it can be controlled easily at home with medications and hydration and Capecitabine can be continued but if more or recurrent, it is sometimes necessary to reduce the dose or stop the medications temporary or even delay the next cycle. Occasionally one week delay in chemotherapy will not cause much problem or rapid progression of the tumor. But I do not know the stage of her cancer (no attached reports), whether she has any metastasis or not and I do not know about her overall general condition. Is she eating and drinking well, walking, bowel and bladder habits and her blood report? So your doctor knows about her condition and he can guide you better. You can revert back any time or day with more details (CT scan or PET CT scan reports, blood tests, etc.). I would be available to answer your queries.

After two months of my delivery, my one breast produced more milk than other. But now I am planning for second child. My query is whether there will be normal or same production of milk after second delivery?","Doctor":"Hello. This cannot be told. Breast milk production depends on many things like how much baby suck from it, how much development of breast tissue occurs under the hormonal influence during pregnancy, the nature of cell, how much these cells are sensitive to milk production signals after delivery and what are the glandular tissue. So, try to breastfeed equally on both sides, and it should end your problem. There is some chance of less milk production on the same side.

I am a 43 year old female. I am normally healthy. I am 178cm tall and I weigh 75kg. Around 9-12 months ago, I started to suffer from anal itching. It is rather intense at night, after passing stools and during/after having intercourse or anal masturbation. I also have few lumps on my anal ring that seem to grow outside of my anal opening as an extended piece of flesh. They are very sensitive but they are odd and it really troubles me. I fear that my problem started as a result of anal masturbation and anal sex. I feel very ashamed to say this. I was using anal toys and hand and I am afraid that during these years I myself  have created problems to my health and I do not know how to fix it. I do not have constipation and my stool is normal. I pass motion once a day and I have no abdominal pain while passing stools. Sometimes when I have anal sex I start bleeding from my rectum for a few seconds and then it stops. It does not bleed when I pass stools or any other time. I have not attained menopause even though my period seems to be every 6-7 weeks these days. I would appreciate if you can help me understand how to treat this issue and what should I do (i.e, special diet, special creams, instructions on how to clean the area etc.) Help me please, I am looking for a very discreet way to handle my situation since I am too concerned about talking with my spouse.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I read your entire history and have understood your concern. I also understand your hesitation in discussing your problems with anyone. Lastly, no good doctor will ever judge you for anything you do in your personal life. So do not feel ashamed in consulting one and getting the growths removed.

Because of that, her breasts plugged and did not empty properly. She has tried breast pump without any luck. She has now developed painful galactoceles on both her breasts. How long does it take before these galactoceles disappear by themselves? They have not declined in size since all this time. Is it necessary to go for a surgery? If so, what specialist would perform this kind of surgery?","Doctor":"Hello. A galactocele is a milk filled space inside the breast. Breast problems are common after childbirth in those women who had stopped breastfeeding or experienced sucking difficulties. Firstly, I hope you are sure that it is truly a galactocele and not any other swelling. Probably it was diagnosed by mammography already. If not, you have to get it done first to assess the nature of the swelling. However, considering this as a galactocele, I understand your concern, as five months has passed without any regression of size. Now, as per my opinion, there are limited options for conservative therapy. Let us hope that it might resolve on its own. There are two options available. The first one is to go for aspiration of the cysts under ultrasonography guidance. If this fails, the second option of open surgery should be considered for drainage. And a general surgeon can perform these procedures after a proper diagnosis, and few preoperative investigations.

This happens for the last four to five days. I feel discomfort during walking and mild pain in the lower abdomen just above the left testicle. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Hope you are doing well. Coming back to your query, I think you are having an infection in your left testis a condition known as Epididymo-orchitis. First, you have to give yourself scrotal support (a langot /relatively small V shaped underwear) to support your testes from hanging. Second, start medication as in the prescription (see attachment). Are you a diabetic? Do you have any urinary complaints (night frequency, burning micturation, poor stream)? Any previous history of accident, trauma, urinary catheterization? Are you on any medications? Are you a smoker or alcoholic? If you can click a photo of both testis then it will be great.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I went to a doctor and they did an ultrasound and said my cervix is still closed and both gestational sacs (I am pregnant with twins) are still there. I also did a blood test and my beta has been doubling as it should (currently at 1734 at 5 weeks). Could this discharge be something else? Does this sound like a miscarriage if there is no bleeding and the cervix is still closed? I cannot stop worrying.","Doctor":"Hello. No, this is the effect of the medicine. The discharge normally increases during pregnancy. And, if you are using vaginal suppositories, it may be because of staining. If the ultrasound shows everything is normal, then do not worry as your beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) is good with doubling values. Do take rest. Do not exert yourself. Avoid intercourse.

A severe headache triggered by indigestion or sometimes even too much exhaustion results in vomiting. Occurs at least once a month, sometimes twice. One whole day goes into sleeping and resting in a dark room and vomiting in between, with a severe headache. Last two times it happened after eating meat. Food does not digest and bowel movement does not happen which is followed by a headache and vomiting. He insists on not taking medicines in general. Do we need to get MRI/CT scan or something or consult a neurologist?","Doctor":"Hello. The first possibility is a vascular headache (migraine). Usually, it is a throbbing-type pain (or pulsating blood vessel-like feel). It is associated with difficulty in hearing sounds or looking at light, followed by vomiting. Sometimes, vomiting reduces pain. If these features are present, CT or MRI is not necessary. I suggest taking painkillers during these episodes of pain along with prophylactic medication like Sibelium (Flunarizine) or Amitriptyline or Propranolol regularly. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. It is triggered by decreased sleep, exposure to sunlight, stress, etc. Gastritis itself can lead to headache. So, take an antacid to prevent gastritis. If these features are absent get a CT brain and consult a neurologist. Avoid exposure to sunlight, large amounts of coffee and chocolates. Take adequate sleep and rest. Avoid stress conditions too.

Therefore I met a doctor to do a proper check. He scanned me and said I am not pregnant and I have fibroids in my uterus. He requested me to stop having birth control pills as I have very thin walls in my womb. I was worried about all the things and he suggested me to have Primolut N (5 mg) tablet twice a day for three continuous days. He said from the third day I will start having my periods and everything will be all right. But I am still missing my periods. Is something wrong with me? And is there a permanent cure for fibroids without any surgery? Why my periods are so late?","Doctor":"Hi. For irregular cycle treatment, you get it right but dose and days should be extended and then withdrawal bleed you would have in 1 to 2 weeks not just after finishing tablets. The dose of Primolut N should be 10 mg twice daily for five days and then wait for bleeding for 1 to 2 weeks. Better to have medicine from day 4 to day 24 for three cycles to properly regulate cycles. It would be better if you could send me a detailed history and scan report as well. If fibroid big obstructing cavity and causing symptoms like urine incontinence, infertility, abdominal heaviness then myomectomy (removal of fibroid) necessary but if no symptoms like above no need to remove actually. It is better to have blood tests on day two of periods (serum testosterone, progesterone, insulin, prolactin, FSH (follicular stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone), thyroid function test).

How can I gain weight? The major issue is that I cannot eat properly even if I feel hungry. What should I do to get rid of this underweight problem?","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, it is important to rule out any specific cause for not gaining weight like thyroid problems with serum TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) estimation. For gaining weight, you can take protein-rich foods and simultaneously gym also can be joined to build up muscles. With active muscle exercise, muscle hypertrophy occurs and your weight will gain. Try to maintain your BMI (body mass index) between 20 to 25. If your BMI remains within this limit, then no need to worry.

He is now on a once-a-year review with the oncologist. Yesterday, he went for his checkup and discovered that the neutrophils have dropped. Below please find his readings: WBC 4.07, RBC 4.96, hemoglobin 15.0, platelets 188 and neutrophils 1.35. The reference range for neutrophils is at 1.56. He will need to go back in one month's time for a retake of the blood test. He is so far doing fine with no fever, sore throat, ulcer apart from some backache. We are worried as there could be a relapse of leukemia. Can you assist to enlighten me? Thank you so much.","Doctor":"Hello. Your total WBC (white blood cell) count is within the limit and only neutrophils dropped down slightly. There are many causes for dropping in neutrophils count and infection like certain viral infections can sometimes lead to bone marrow suppression of neutrophils series. If it is a relapsing case of leukemia then peripheral smear might show abnormal premature cells in excessive amount.

So, the doctor diagnosed that my excessive gas formation was due to anxiety and they prescribed Xet CR, Etizola, Clonafit, and Rabekind. I have used Etizolam for three weeks and stopped. I used Xet CR for the last six to eight weeks and Clonafit for the last two weeks. However, I still have episodes where I feel my head going numb in the back of the head. I got an X-ray and it said I have mild spondylosis. Because of the pain, I have developed a repulsion to sleeping as well and now I am completely tired during work. My doctor asked me to consult a psychiatrist. So, looking for help here.","Doctor":"Hello. A lot of individuals with anxiety present with symptoms of epigastric discomfort. This could present as symptoms of excessive gas formation. It is usually accompanied with symptoms like rapid heart rate, sweating, trembling of hands or body, sense of fear, feeling as if the throat is choking, etc. The cervical X-ray (attachment removed to protect patient identity) is almost normal. Mild spondylosis is seen in a lot of individuals and this usually causes slight pain in the neck. This is not the cause of the symptoms you are having. Feeling of heaviness in the neck and numbness in head is most likely part of anxiety. If there is any associated stress, then that further confirms anxiety. You have been given Paroxetine (Xet), Clonazepam and Etizolam. These are anti-anxiety drugs and help control the anxiety. If even with Xet CR your symptoms are persisting, then you can talk with your doctor to increase the dose. If you are on 12.5 mg dose then the dose can be increased to 25 mg per day. For reducing the heaviness in head, drugs like Propranolol can be used. Propranolol 10 to 20 mg in morning can help to control the symptoms and will reduce the numbness of head as well as anxiety.

From the picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity) it seems that you have acne of grade 3.

You have to apply cream which contains a combination of Clindamycin and Adapalen (Deriva CMS or other brands) every day at night for four hours, wash before going to bed, not only over acne but on other acne-prone areas. Take Vitamin B complex daily. Wash face with soap and water twice daily. Follow up with photos in two weeks. I am sure you should show some improvement in this period.

I was able to walk with minor to moderate pain, and visited the nearest trauma center in an hour, got an X-ray and cast immobilization, and was diagnosed with fractures in second and third metatarsals. I was told to take antithrombotic medications, avoid putting any load on the feet, and basically, that was all. The feet itself did not hurt for the whole week afterward. Today, I visited a different clinic for a check-up, got another X-ray and a different diagnosis (no fracture in the third metatarsal, but a fracture in cuneiform bone). So, I would like to ask to take a look at DICOM X-ray data from the second clinic and check what bones actually have fractures (because I am quite anxious that something could have been missed), and if there are any indications of recovery. Currently, I am taking delayed-release Acetylsalicylic acid as an antithrombotic, Calcium and D3 Vitamin supplements.","Doctor":"Hi. Your radiographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity) do not show any meta-tarsal fracture. However, a medical cuneiform fracture is seen. Probably it could be a Lisfranc injury. An orthopedic consultation is advisable as you would require casting to stabilize the joint. Else you may end up having chronic foot pain due to the resultant altered alignment of foot bones. Take care. For more information consult a radiologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case details. I am with your thought process of diagnosis. Let us try symptom analysis and the clinical syndrome that patient v has. The major symptom is hyperhidrosis that is increase sweating. This can be due to primary hyperhidrosis or secondary hyperhidrosis. This is less likely primary hyperhidrosis. Generalized sweating is mostly due to an underlying systemic illness or as a side effect of medication while focal sweating is generally due to a neurologic disorder or primary hyperhidrosis. In this case, it is generalized sweating, we need to find out are there signs and symptoms of: • Infection (acute or chronic). • Neoplasia. • Metabolic/endocrine disease (diabetes, thyroid, pheochromocytoma, carcinoid). • High catecholamine state (respiratory failure, heart disease, pain, drug/ETOH withdrawal). • Drug therapy (Propranolol, antidepressants, Pilocarpine, Physostigmine). • Neurologic disease (dysautonomia, diencephalic epilepsy, hypothalamic lesion, structural brain abnormality). In your case, it has a high metabolic rate with the childhood-onset disease process. So metabolic, endocrine, and high catabolic state is likely diagnosis. In the metabolic, it is more mitochondrial metabolic disorder likely diagnosis. The mitochondrial damage results in defects in the electron transport chain can affect any tissue. Tissues requiring the highest levels of energy production are the most severely affected. Certain “red flags” which should immediately increase the suspicion of a mitochondrial disorder. These include short stature, neurosensory hearing loss, progressive external ophthalmoplegia, axonal neuropathy, diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and renal tubular acidosis. Hope this insight will help you. Primary hyperhidrosis. Secondary hyperhidrosis, Metabolic myopathy. Mitochondrial disorder electron chain transfer. Morvan syndrome (autoimmune). Serum lactate. Muscle biopsy for metabolic myopathy. Mitochondrial disorder. Genetic analysis. Mitochondrial disorder. As per diagnosis antioxidants, vitamin E, and Riboflavin. Avoid excessive exercise to keep hydrated."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I have a copper IUD. However, this is due to expire in two months. Because of this, I wanted to double up on protection. The morning after pill is not available where I live. Therefore I took four Jasmin combined pills 48 hours after the incident and then another four 12 hours later. Four days later I had five days of bleeding that mimicked my natural period exactly. My question now is two-fold, should my copper IUD have protected me anyway even though it is due to expire? And when should I expect a natural period again to confirm I am not pregnant following the withdrawal bleeding that I have had?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your history and understand your concern. As you took the pill on time, there is no chance of pregnancy in your case. Delayed menses and menstrual irregularities due to hormonal imbalance caused by I-pill. Get your home urine test if you missed your period by seven days. Your period is little unpredictable.

Etizolam is a mild Benzodiazepine and the drug cannot help in sleep on considering the long-term use of Diazepam. To get sleep, you can think of taking Clonazepam for some time. Since you are on Etizolam 2 mg now, so in this state, an equivalent dose will be around 1 mg of Clonazepam. You can take 1 mg of Clonazepam for sleep for around six weeks and then reduce to 0.75 mg of Clonazepam for the next six weeks followed by 0.5 mg of Clonazepam for around 12 weeks and if needed, the dose can be reduced further to 0.25 mg of Clonazepam.

According to her doctor, there is nothing to be done, and she has to live on a liquid diet. I am looking for a second opinion because I do not want her to die from this. Any help is appreciated. Is there anything that can be done for this?","Doctor":"Hi. As per the description, she is suffering from chronic pancreatitis. In this, a persistent inflammation develops in the pancreas. Over time, the inflammation causes scarring and damage to parts of the pancreas. This can then lead to enzymes and insulin deficiency. The lack of enzymes causes poor digestion of food (malabsorption), and lack of insulin causes diabetes. The clumps of calcium are deposited and can form stones in the pancreas. Calcium stones or scarring of the pancreatic tubes (ducts) may block the flow of enzymes along the pancreatic ducts. Enzyme replacement medication may be needed if the low level of enzymes causes poor digestion of food and steatorrhoea. Capsules containing artificial enzymes are taken with meals. Restricting fat in the diet may be advised if steatorrhoea is bad. Insulin is given if diabetes develops. Surgery is only rarely needed, and the patient often does well on medical therapy. Please message the reports of ultrasound, CT scan, and blood enzymes, for a better professional advice. As most of the patient get stable on medical therapy.

After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I was hospitalized and now I feel better as I strictly follow the diet. The MRI scan which I took last week (1st August) shows an improvement than the CT scan taken in the month of July. I am taking the following as maintenance medications: Metoprolol 50mg twice a day and Irbesartan 150 mg once a day for hypertension. Escitalopram 10mg once 1 day for anxiety.

I have the feeling of vomiting, chest pain and I am feeling sleepy too. Is this normal? Can I get pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello. I have reviewed your query. Unwanted 72 is an emergency postcoital contraceptive pill containing Levonorgestrel. Though it is effective within 72 hours after intercourse, it is very active when it is taken immediately after sex. As you have taken within 20 minutes, you will be having higher efficiency and a very little chance of getting pregnant but, not a zero percent chance. Because even this tablet also has a minimal failure rate of 0.3 to 2 percent taken within 72 hours. Do not worry much but you need to keep track of your expected date of periods and get a pregnancy test done if the periods are delayed. Regarding the symptoms you are experiencing, chest pain is unlikely to occur after taking Unwanted 72. But vomiting and sleepiness are quite common side effects.

Hope, you did not have any recent change in your diet habits and you are not taking any medicines which can potentially alter the bowel frequency. Transient changes in bowel frequency is a normal phenomenon. Nothing to worry much. Keep a close watch. You need to worry only, if you have watery stools, blood in stools or if you have pain associated. Other precipitating factors like anxiety, stress is needed to be ruled out.

I can understand your concern as bleeding along with stool (bleeding per rectum) is a major concern for any individual. Do not worry much as there are more noncancerous causes of bleeding per rectum than cancerous causes in your age group. So, you need thorough investigations. Your stomach problems, indigestion, and burning sensation seem to be associated with APD (acid peptic disease). It is common in males. So, you should visit a general surgeon and he will examine and look for any local hemorrhoids, anal fissure (tear), fistula, etc. If he cannot find any such thing, He will refer you for colonoscopy and if needed for gastroscopy (less chances) plus they will advise some basic blood tests. Usually, if the blood coming with stools is reddish, it is mainly through the colon, rectum, or anal area and if the blood is coming from the stomach and above, it will change the color of stool to black. So, there will be blackish stool. The various causes of bleeding coming with stools are: All these are noncancerous causes and the last one is colon, rectal or anal cancer. In your age group, it is not so common to have colon or gastric cancer unless some genetic or hereditary factors are involved and cancer is usually associated with significant weight loss, decreased appetite, etc. For more information consult a medical oncologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My head feels heavy all the time specifically backside and I have pain in the neck.

I️ am an 18-year-old female and am overall very healthy and active. Six months ago, I was taken advantage of by a male in college whom I️ did not even know. This was my first sexual experience, and I️ have not had any since then, but I️ do not know his sexual background. He did not use a condom, but also did not have enough time to ejaculate inside of me because I️ got away. I️ had absolutely no symptoms until now. One month after the traumatic experience, I️ decided to get an IUD to protect me from any unwanted or unexpected situation. Three months after the sexual experience, I️ was admitted to the hospital due to gastrointestinal issues. After my release, I️ discovered that I️ tested positive for chlamydia. I️ took the two pills (one dose) that completely cleared my STI. In the hospital, would they have been able to tell from my blood work if I️ was HIV positive or not? Now three months later, (six months after the initial experience) weird symptoms have begun to show. I️ first had a sore throat, and then only one of my lymph nodes on my left side of my neck slightly started to swell, but not significantly enough to show through the skin. At first, the lymph node was hard, but now i‎t is starting to soften. After, I️ started having nosebleeds. Then, large red bumps started to appear in the back of my tongue, and some on the side of my tongue, but none of them are painful. I️ have no bumps in my throat or roof of the mouth or underneath the tongue, just on the back. I️ have never noticed these bumps before. Around the bumps, there was also some white coating, which was easy to brush off, but when I️ did there was still no bleeding. I️ have no rash, no night sweats, no fever or anything. But from research, i‎t says that these kind of bumps are common for HIV positive people, as well as swollen lymph nodes. I️ also have found small white specks in my stool, but no other parts of my body have been affected but my mouth and throat. The back of my throat is still sore and scratchy, but I️ have no vocal changes. If not HIV, could I‎t be some other STD or viral infection that is serious? Could i‎t be another problem with my gastrointestinal tract? And what can I️ do to get rid of these bumps? It has been less than a week with these symptoms. Should I️ get tested for HIV? I have been very paranoid.","Doctor":"Hi. Regarding your complaints, I think the following will resolve some of the issues. Bleeding disorders. 1.HIV RNA PCR. 2.Vitamin K levels. 3.Bleeding time, clotting time, prothrombin time, APTT (activated partial thromboplastin time). 4.Liver function tests. 1.Ludwig's angina. 2.Sublingual hematoma.

Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks.

At the age of 24 year it is unlikely that you have ulcer in the stomach. It could be GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease) that is causing all these symptoms, but after long time it may cause ulcer. If you are not responding to PPIs (Proton-Pump Inhibitors) then it could be H.Pylori infection that is causing the problem. The investigations you have mentioned are not having much abnormalities except mild anaemia. The management of GERD symptoms include medicines as well as dietary modifications and exercise with position maneuvers. Usually we do not do investigations, but if it is not responding to medicines then it is needed. Advice: You have anaemia, so please take iron and folic acid (100mg iron combination) once daily. These disorders have great relation to behaviour and mood changes, so please alleviate any tension. Get Thyroid Function Test (TFT) and fasting glucose level done.

At times, she has heavy clots also. The doctor had asked us to do the scanning and some test. The scanning report is attached. 'There is anteverted and bulky uterus which measures 11.7 by 10.3 by 5.7 cms in size. The fundal endometrial thickness is 6.6 mm.' The doctor says the reports are fine. He has asked her to take Regestrone tablet (5 mg) twice a day for 15 days. My questions are:  Are the scan reports fine? Is her uterus fine? Should she take the Regestrone tablet?","Doctor":"Hello. The scan (attachment removed to protect patient identity) shows a bulky uterus which can be due to adenomyosis or possible fibroids in situ, but the absence of fibroids is evident. She is likely to experience painful menses and heavy bleeding due to adenomyosis as well. Again the report shows an endometrial polyp which can often be the cause of irregular spotting as well and pain in the abdomen. This can be removed by hysteroscopy. Adenomyosis is a form of endometriosis and can grow with each menses. So, ideally, the perfect treatment is to control menses by GnRH analogs or Progesterone-only pills (medical management) and if still not controlled medically and the patient is symptomatic and in unmanageable pain, then hysterectomy is suggested. The plan for giving cyclical Progesterone for 15 days will not apparently help much in her case, as it has been given seeing the thin endometrial wall thickness if she has irregular shedding during mid-cycle which she does not. Also, she is nearing her perimenopausal period. So, the thinning endometrium can be attributed to that. But in either case, cyclical progesterone will not help as the cause is adenomyosis and endometrial polyp for heavy bleeding in her case and not hormonal.

She suggested I take Regestrone 5 mg, two tablets a day for five days. But, I still did not get my periods. Kindly advice me for the same.","Doctor":"Hello. After you have finished taking tablet Regestrone (Norethisterone), you will have to wait for 15 days to get your periods. If you do not get it in 15 days, you have to repeat the urine pregnancy test and visit your gynecologist. Please do not take emergency contraceptive pills so casually. It is not to be used as a regular method of contraception and it is not to be used more than once a month. Have patience. Everything is gonna be alright.

When I woke up this morning and looked at my clock across the room I could read it but everything close to me was blurry. It was like that for the whole day and it seems that I am farsighted now.","Doctor":"Hello. You are a myopic patient (farsightedness). Due to your vision problem, your eye is under strain which leads to spasm of a muscle inside your eyes which causes a problem in reading.

She has a regular period cycle of 28 to 31 days generally. After four days, we were close together but there is no penetration just using hands but for safety purpose, she took unwanted 72 the next day. Then after 10 days, she got mild bleeding for three days. After that, till now she did not get her periods. 10 days back we got blood hCG done and it came negative (less than 0.6). She is very stressed and feeling weak these days. For past one week, she is feeling pain like periods but getting no periods. For the past two days, white water discharge is taking place. We are very stressed about her health. Kindly help us as fast as possible.","Doctor":"Hi. Emergency contraceptive pills are hormonal pills that can irregulate bleeding pattern, can give spotting, erratic bleeding, etc. After unprotected sex she had a withdrawal bleed and serum beta hCG (blood pregnancy test negative). Now she is not having periods as per schedule. White discharge with smell and or irritation could be candidiasis. She can have a high vaginal swab and after that pessary, Canesten per vaginal can be used at night to have a clean vagina. Collect HVS (high vaginal swab) result and discuss here or with a local doctor. She can repeat beta hCG for her satisfaction that would be more likely would be negative if not any recent unprotected sex. If periods do not come in a week can have a menstrual induction (tablet Norethisterone 10 twice daily for seven days and wait for bleeding for 1 to 2 weeks) it becomes negative.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I do not want or cannot afford a root canal. Considering my age, what do you think about my starting to rinse my mouth with 3 % Hydrogen peroxide and delay the tooth pulling and see if the infection clears up?","Doctor":"Hello. Well, as per your age, the root canal is the best option. But, as you cannot afford treatment then removing tooth is the only treatment left. Infection in the tooth cannot vanish permanently but you can keep using mouthwash for few weeks and gather money or take dental insurance to get root canal treatment done, if possible. Else, I suggest you go for treatment as soon as possible because the more you delay, more the infection will spread from one tooth to another. Also, inform your dentist about your medical health like blood pressure, diabetes, breathing problems if you have any, before removing the tooth.

What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi. Since you have taken the emergency pill within 72 hours of intercourse there is no chance of pregnancy. Also, you say that you had withdrawal bleeding. So relax and do not worry. The delay could be because of hormonal changes due to the pill you have taken. There is nothing to worry about.

I have been getting cramps around my tummy area (like I would the day before my period starts), my bra feels tight, my boobs do not look big but bra feels tight. I have been getting pain around where I get pubic hair if that makes sense like sharp tugging pains. I have stopped getting the discharge. I am not sure what it could be. Please, could you advise if it is too early for pregnancy as I am due to start my period between 20th-22nd of this month or do you think it is a virus or bug?","Doctor":"Hello. As you had LH surge, so the ovulation would have occurred after 36 hours post-LH surge and practically the intercourse after the test would account for possible conception, but the symptoms of pregnancy are never so early. However, the earliest you may test for pregnancy is after eight days post intercourse with a serum beta hCG test which can give conclusive results. The symptoms are more of premenstrual syndrome if pregnancy has been ruled out.

Is it a side effect of the pill? Is it implantation bleeding? I also have a history of ectopic pregnancy which had happened two and a half years back.","Doctor":"Hello. Emergency contraceptive pills are hormonal pills that can disturb cycles. Post pills, there could be withdrawal bleed and you can have unscheduled spotting, erratic bleeding, and irregular periods as well. For your satisfaction, I suggest having serum beta hCG (blood pregnancy test) and then to regulate cycles, you can have combined oral contraceptive pills cyclically for three months. In case of irregular periods for many months with abnormal hairs growth and sudden weight gain, it is better to have a transvaginal scan and blood sex hormonal tests on day-2 of periods.

Proteins in eggs are of most superior quality and now the cholesterol (in the yolk) is also not considered as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. But eating 12 large boiled eggs (about 600 grams) will provide you more than 900 calories. Since already you have a high BMI (attachment removed to protect patient identity), try to reduce your calorie consumption. Eating raw eggs increases the risk of salmonella poisoning and deficiency of biotin (vitamin B). Also, boiled eggs have better bio-availability of proteins than the raw egg.

BP generally runs 120/77 but can be higher depending upon stress levels. My most recent physical showed healthy levels of cholesterol and blood sugars. I do however have anxiety issues. Until last Thursday, I generally woke once or twice each night with strong erections. On Wednesday, I had sex with my wife that morning and then masturbated later in the day. I woke up on Thursday with only a weak morning erection. I was not too concerned but I noted it. (I have had a fear of ED since turning 50). Friday, I had weak morning erection and that night, I had no real libido and when I tried to force the issue, I could not get an erection. I woke up Saturday morning with a moderate erection and was able to achieve 80 or 90 percent hardness and ejaculate. I was still concerned about not being doing so the night before. Sunday morning, I awoke with a moderate morning erection and masturbated to 70 or 80 percent without ejaculation. Monday, there was no morning erection, but I was able to get to get myself fairly erect. Tuesday nothing. Wednesday, no morning erection but I could masturbate to about 70 percent. Thursday, no morning erection but I masturbated to about 70 to 80 % and ejaculated. Each of these times the erection deflated fairly quickly once stimulation stopped. Last night, Thursday night, I was able to masturbate to about 80 percent without ejaculation. However, it deflated quickly again. No morning erection today. Throughout all of this, my libido has been subpar and my anxiety has been fairly high. As I mentioned, I have had a fear of ED. This came on so quickly, it has me very concerned. My question for you is, given what I am experiencing, do you think there is a physical cause of this or is it simply my anxiety about erectile dysfunction?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your description and the likely cause is stress and anxiety. These factors quite commonly affect sexual performance, libido, and erections. Considering your libido was also low during this period, it is likely a stress and anxiety-related issue only and unlikely to be erectile dysfunction (ED). Also, normally in humans, there exists some period during which overall sexual activity is low which is influenced by multiple day to day and hormonal factors. Also, to consider the possibility of erectile dysfunction, one should have a consistent and recurrent inability to sustain or acquire erections and cannot jump to a conclusion of ED over such a short period. So, overall, I do not think this is ED but stress-related and should improve in a week or two. If you are not having libido, then better not force yourself for masturbation and sex, and just wait for few days and then you will certainly come back with stronger desire and erections.

I have stabilized my weight and eating habits for about two months and still no period. I am extremely worried that I may become less fertile or even completely infertile because of this. What do you suggest that I do in order to get my period back? Also, some days ago I decided to try herbs, more specifically Vitex agnus-castus, for 3 or 4 days and even though I have not read online anything about side effects I got eczema on my arms. I have a past with eczema. First, when I was a baby it was a bit serious and I had to get medication (Cortisol). Recently, two months ago, I got very little on one arm but it was gone in a week. Now it is the third time and it is a mild case on my arms. I know that I will have to consult a dermatologist to get rid of the eczema but I felt like you had to know this in order to give me more accurate advice. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing today? By reducing Weight you have definitely improved your fertility potential. But you have overdone it. For a height of 173 cm, ideal weight is 73 to 76 kg. A minimum weight is needed for regular periods. When you suddenly reduce too much weight, the condition called anorexia nervosa occurs. Your brain controls the hormones needed for regular periods. So, when that balance is distributed, no ovulation occurs, so no periods. The sudden weight loss may reduce your immunity too.  I am not advising you to put on weight. Avoid junk food and overeating. Have lots of healthy diets, no fried items or sweets. You can have vegetarian or non-vegetarian, but not fried, no oil. Have lots of protein, egg whites, fish, nuts, sprouts, and so on. Most importantly, have lots of aerobics, exercise. Then eat more. Over time your health will improve. To have regular periods, have any of the birth control pills, once at night for 2 to 3 cycles. This will regularize your hormones. Gradually you can tide over that allergies too.

I want to quit masturbating but I cannot because I feel the urge to do that. Even sometimes I feel lower abdominal pain after masturbating. Please help me doctor.","Doctor":"Hello. The only way one can avoid masturbation is by one's own willpower. One needs to channelize one's thoughts on nonsexual activities when such sexual thoughts cross your mind. Secondly, avoid wearing tight undergarments or jeans which can often stimulate the area due to constant rubbing and friction, thereby causing an urge to masturbate.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am 27 years old. My weight is 65 kg. Height is 1'6\\". At 9 AM I took three tablets of Cytotec drugs orally and inserted one. But have been having cramp and diarrhea but no bleeding just sign of small blood when I urinate. Please can I insert another one this night?","Doctor":"Hello. The abortion procedure depends on the age of gestation. Cytotec contains Misoprostol and it is used for the abortion procedure. For the first trimester, abortion Mifepristone should be given orally as 600 mg dose and than Misoprostol orally or vaginally inserted after 72 hours. If no induced bleeding, then repeat the dose if needed. You have no induced bleeding, so the abortion process might be incomplete. According to my opinion, you have to consult your gynecologist for examination and transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) will confirm whether the pregnancy is intrauterine or extrauterine. In only intrauterine pregnancy, abortion procedure is carried out in this way through medication. So do not try any self-medication for abortion. Consult the gynecologist for examination and discuss your further management plan for carrying out abortion. Take care.

I went to a neurologist but he did not listen to me. I have a constant headache, a pressure in my necks and shoulders, nausea with vomiting daily. I have a problem with swallowing, buzzing in the left ear. I have been going for pain management for the past two years with numerous injections. Currently, I am taking tablet Percoset 7.5 mg, Tizanidine 12 mg. I have dizziness, my hands, and arms tingle and there is numbness.","Doctor":"Hi. Tonsillar herniation of more than 5 mm in adults is significant and defined as Chiari type 1 malformation. The usual symptoms associated with this condition are imbalance while walking, cough induced headache, numbness over hands, nape of neck and weakness of hands. Many people are not symptomatic. In asymptomatic people with tonsillar descent more than 5 mm, we usually do CSF flow studies to look at the CSF circulation in the foramen magnum. If the CSF flow is altered, we recommend surgery. If the flow is normal, we observe the patient with periodic clinical exams and imaging. In the images that you have provided (attachment removed to protect patient identity) none of them shows the tonsils. So, I am not able to comment on whether there is Chiari malformation or not.

According to the mentioned history, you are having pain in the testis and slight swelling is there. So, orchitis-like testicular inflammation has to be ruled out and for that, it is better to investigate with ultrasonography of the testis. For pain and inflammation relief, Ibuprofen or similar non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug can be prescribed. According to report further management plan can be decided if needed.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

With your descriptions, it seems you have developed dark complexion at the forehead, nose, and mouth of your face. These areas are found with more sebaceous glands which lead to excessive oiliness under the influence of hormones. This leads to more photosensitivity and more post inflammatory hyperpigmentation causing temporary tanning of these areas.

Pain in testicles can occur due to multiple reasons. Since it is mild, it could be due to prostate swelling, a urinary stone or dilated testicular veins. These can be ruled out by examination and ultrasound. Since no lump is palpable and there is no change in testicular size, a testicular tumor is unlikely to occur.

Her hemoglobin appears to be low and the ESR is elevated. Does this suggest an autoimmune disease? What kind of doctor should we consult and which tests would you recommend?","Doctor":"Hello. Anemia can lead to fatigue as well. Your mother's hemoglobin level is low and iron deficiency anemia could be suspected here.  Further work up is needed in the form of serum TIBC (total iron binding capacity), serum ferritin, and transferrin saturation assay to confirm iron deficiency anemia. If confirmed, Ferrous ascorbate tablet containing good elemental iron can be prescribed. ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) can be high because of an inflammation or infection and it is not indicative of any specific disease. For both knee joint pain, osteoarthritis can be the possibility and according to the grade, a management plan is decided.  To investigate further, digital X-ray of both the joints, serum ANA (anti-nuclear antibodies) estimation, serum RA (rheumatoid arthritis) factor estimation can be done primarily. Check her serum calcium and vitamin D3 levels as well. These work up just now can be done as primary work up.

There are certain treatment options for keloid although none are perfectively effective. This includes injection of steroids in the keloid or laser therapy. Avoid scratching and picking of pimples to prevent further keloid formation. If it does not cause many problems you can wait for a few months, most probably it will subside itself.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I suspect the problem happened due to tight fitting jeans I wore. Please let me know what other details you require. I have recently started swimming and pain started five days back. My age is 22 years, weight is 60 kg, height is 5’6\\" and I am a female.","Doctor":"Hello. Do you have other symptoms like pain in lower abdomen, fever, increase in the frequency of urination? These may be the symptoms associated. There are two common causes for burning, one is dehydration. Do you also get yellow colored urine, if yes it further suggests dehydration, concentrated urine and subsequent burning due to it? So you should initially drink plenty of water until urine is white and transparent in color and continue to do so.  However, if it does not help then it is better if you can get urine routine examination done which will diagnose the infection. You just have to collect some urine in speci-can and give immediately to any laboratory. Other option, you may take a trial of antibiotics directly for UTI (urinary tract infection). Tablet Nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice a day for five days along with antacids like tablet Pan DSR (Pantoprazole and Domperidone) 40 mg before breakfast once a day for five days.

Highlighted in bold are the tests which are out of range. Can you please advice on the reasons and corrective measures to get the exceeded test values in control? Do I need to perform any follow-up tests? I have got the blood test profile checked just as a general checkup and not specific to any illness. I am little skeptical about TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) results in its extremely high than acceptable range. Is it possible that there might be some mistake in the report? I have completed a course for hormonal imbalance (three strips of medicine, 21 tablets each).","Doctor":"Hi. Let me assure you there is nothing to be worried about. Few dietary deficiencies and the thyroid report (attachment removed to protect patient identity) shows hypothyroidism (that means your thyroid gland is not producing sufficient hormones) and yes, a TSH level that high can be seen. But before I suggest any medications I would like you to repeat the test with a NABL certified laboratory in your locality. Presently you can start with the following: Your report shows low Hb (hemoglobin) because of iron deficiency. So eat a lot of iron-rich food like ragi, dates, peanuts, jaggery, laddoo, and leafy vegetables. Avoid raw cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower in your diet. They tend to alter the proper function of your thyroid. Eat it only if well cooked and not more than once a week.  1.Capsule Dexorange (Ferric Ammonium Citrate), 0-1-0, after meals daily for 90 days. 2.Capsule Uprise D3 60k, 1-0-0 after breakfast, once a week for 8 weeks.

Today, I checked and found some white substance inside the foreskin and the glans area on that side is red. The foreskin inside there is also red. The white substance cleared when washed but after one hour when I checked again, it was back there. I washed again and it cleared mostly but some still remained. There is no lump or fluid discharge except the white substance. There is no pain or unusual feeling while urinating or any unusual smell. But there is slight itchiness at times as I said. I did not have any sexual contact with anybody in the past seven months. Please advise what this could be and how to deal with it.","Doctor":"Hello. It would be better if you can take a picture of it and upload it. There are two possibilities. Is this whitish substance present at the base of glans where foreskin meets the glans? If yes, this is a normal thing. This is called as smegma. These are normal secretions and nothing needs to be done about it. Daily morning, you may just pull your prepuce back and wash it. No need to wash it frequently. If location is just on the glans, but not at the base then there is a possibility of fungal infection called as candida infection and you need to apply antifungal like cream Clotrimazole two times a day for two weeks. So overall, it is likely a possibility of smegma and nothing to worry about it.

Could you please tell me that is there any chance to be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello. There was no apparent need of taking the second I-pill. The first would have sufficed for next 72 hrs as well. However, now your withdrawal bleed should be expected in next 5 to 7 days following progesterone withdrawal and not on your due expected date. If you have a withdrawal, it would indicate that you are pregnancy safe.

At 5 years, it should be possible to make him calm with just a nitrous oxide inhalation, if possible. If he is not cooperating, then either just give him antibiotics for a week, delay for a month or so like that. Brush twice a day. The abscess and pain will go away for a few months.

It is true that the chances of pregnancy decrease with the advancement of age but pregnancy are still possible upto 45 years of marriage. The chance depends on the number of follicles available in your ovary which varies from person to person.

When and how can I take it now?","Doctor":"Hi. A mother with blood group negative and father with positive blood group can give a child with positive blood group and immunity develops in the mother's blood that can cause hemolysis in child's blood, in case of fetomaternal hemorrhage. In this scenario normally, anti-D has to be given to Rh-negative mother at 28 and 32 weeks in addition to a hemorrhage if she has or if the antibody titer is high on the blood test. It would be better if you would describe your complete obstetrics and gynaecology report, menstrual history and the medical history. It is better to have antibody titer and discuss your situation with your obstetrician. If this is the first child, it is not a big issue but if you have a child then you need immediate attention as there are antibodies present. In case of any bleeding, you need an immediate anti-D injection. Baby's blood has to be checked immediately after birth. If you are not getting the anti-D injection, baby can have hemolysis, anemia, low birth weight, jaundice.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

I have gone through your query and you are having a habit of grinding your teeth during the night, that is called as bruxism and the symptomatic treatment for that is the use of mouth guards.

The mobility can be in grade 1 or grade 2. If it is in grade 1, it will resolve on its own and if it is in grade 2, you need to go for scaling and root planing that is a 15 minutes procedure done only in the surgical environment.

First of all, do not touch it or try to push it back into position. Do not bite on that tooth. There is bleeding which is from the gums (as the picture is not clear). So, there is soft tissue injury too. Next, we will have to take an intra-oral periapical radiograph to check whether there is a crown-root fracture or the whole tooth has moved. If there is a fracture of the root, the treatment will vary based on the location of the fracture. If it is just displacement with the whole segment of a tooth, we can replace it back into position and splint the tooth. In later stages, if you have pain or discoloration of the teeth, we can go for root canal treatment. Hence, visit your dentist soon and get the treatment done. Kindly do not delay, and do not worry. In any situation, we have treatment (simple or complex based on clinical examination and radiograph) and it will not affect your esthetics and function.

What dosage or schedule would you recommend for temporarily relying on Novolog only?","Doctor":"Hi. I can tell you right away that your type 1 DM (diabetes mellitus) is not being managed correctly. Those who have type 1 DM cannot make it without basal insulin so insulin it has to be provided 24/7. You should be on balanced Lantus and scheduled Novolog (and not sliding scale of Novolog- Insulin aspart). You can take Novolog but it has to be every 3 to 4 hours, and it has to be scheduled. Also, you need to check your blood sugar every 3 to 4 hours before taking a shot, that is a must. You will run into very high or very low blood sugar and will see an erratic pattern, you will have to adjust the dose accordingly. Watch and check your ketones 2 to 3 times daily, should not stay without Lantus (Insulin glargine) for more than 24 hours.  Novolog dose at least should be seven units every four hours (calculated from your current regimen you should need at least 1.8 units of Insulin every hour to survive).

I have never heard of such procedure and I think it would be too extreme for an eight-year boy. Is this a common procedure to extract teeth for the eruption of permanent teeth?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your query and I do not find it suitable to extract all his teeth as the recommended time period for the eruption of permanent teeth is between 6 to 12 years. It is better to wait and you can do one thing apply a gentle force to the milk teeth to make them mobile so, they can be extracted naturally not under anesthesia or all at once. Give a better diet and nourished food for your son, undernutrition is thought to be one cause for a delayed eruption so keep a notice on his diet. Give him adequate minerals and salts in his diet. You do not need to worry, just wait for some more time and in case, the problem persists then, they need to be extracted by a method called serial extraction, not all at once.

It was heavy but still light and lasted only three days. I was late by two weeks this month. The sonar showed an oval almost water drop like dark line and the doctor said he does not know what it is. It is above the pregnancy line. The way he described it could I be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Let me start by giving you a few basic facts about fertility and pregnancy. When blood levels of Beta hCG hormone (the pregnancy hormone) are above 25 miu/ml urine test becomes positive, that is you get two lines. If it was faint, maybe the levels were just above 25. You can see a pregnancy on scan only when the levels of beta hCG is above 1500 miu/ ml. So what you saw on scan might mostly be a thickness in endometrial lining. From your history, I presume the pregnancy was not strong enough or healthy enough to survive, so you had your period. No matter how the daily bleeding was. If you still want a confirmation, have a serum beta hCG tested today, it will give you a baseline value. Then repeat it after 48 hours, that is two days. If it is a healthy pregnancy, it will double or else it will be the same or fall if an unhealthy pregnancy. Do not worry about the scan, it is too early to see anything on the scan.

I have been prescribed 75 mg Clopidogrel for a stent I have recently had fitted in my heart. I am a bodybuilder and so I wanted to know if taking anabolic steroids, T3, Clenbuterol, and Accutane will reverse the effect the Clopidogrel is having and put me more at risk of having a problem with the stent.","Doctor":"Hello. Here the relationship of Clopidogrel is not straightforward. Firstly, I would like to tell, little data is available on this topic as such patients are very less, so definitive answers are available. Now, regarding anabolic steroids, there is no randomized control available to tell us the straight forward answer. However, anabolic steroids are known to be thrombogenic and may increase the risk of clotting. This is study proven. Also, has got other cardiac effects like hypertrophy, dyslipidemia. So it is better to avoid anabolic steroids use as it may antagonize the effect of Clopidogrel.  Regarding T3, it can increase the heart rate and increased myocardial oxygen demand so it may be deleterious if there is ongoing ischemia or significant blockages left in some arteries. However, may have it with proper monitoring in optimum dosage. Again, Clenbuterol should not be taken in excess as it can also lead to an increase in heart rate at a higher dosage. Accutane again has got some cardiac adverse effects but may be taken in optimum dosage, but lipid profile should be monitored and as less duration as possible.

Relax and do not worry. You have uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. HbA1c should be less than 7.  Regarding urineanalysis, ACR (albumin-creatinine ratio) should be watched carefully. Less than 30 means normal. 30 to 300 means microalbuminuria means starting of CKD (chronic kidney disease). More than 300 means macroalbuminuria risk of CKD is very high.

So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have been prescribed Doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily, this is my third week on. My acne got worse for the first week and then better. Much less swollen. But it is still very painful, bleeding and oozing through all my clothes. My doctor advised against non-comedogenic lotion, but I find it is making my skin dry, and that is making the acne split open as well as the scabs. Does it take very long to heal? I believe the acne started because I have been using anabolic steroids, but I believe it got infected (as does my doctor) and that is why she prescribed Doxycycline. My question is, what would you do for someone who developed severe cystic acne due to anabolic steroid use? Stopping steroid usage also is not an option at this point as body and hormones could not recover on their own. Please tell me how this would affect your treatment and how health insurance would be affected?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case. If your anabolic steroid is the causative agent then you should really stop it in order to keep it in control. Please remember all acne treatment makes skin dry so do not worry about dryness. If it is troublesome then apply lotion on your palms and gently tap on your face. In my opinion, your treatment is optimum. Sometimes it may take three months for recovery. Or take an opinion about Retinoids intake. They should be given under the strict supervision of your doctor.

Two years ago when the same scenario of irregular periods for about four months happened, I consulted a gynecologist and did thyroid profile and ultrasound scan. TSH was 5.8, Vit D 21, one 3 mm kidney stone and had one small cyst in ovary then.

I was also told that this is the treatment whenever periods go missing, I should repeat the same. So this time with the same situation, I would like to confirm if I can take the Regestrone again? Also, please suggest vegetarian dietary changes, supplements related to this which solve the issue.","Doctor":"Hello. After going through your health history it is evident that you are having hypothyroidism and more likely clinical polycystic ovarian syndrome. In this scenario, irregular menses are very common and in some people also weight gain can occur. In my opinion, first, you need to regulate your thyroid levels to the optimum level. Second try to do as much as exercise as you can. It will not only reduce your weight but also regularize your periods. If you are very much sure that you are not pregnant as you mentioned that you are not sexually active, then take a course of tablet Deviry (Medroxyprogesterone acetate) 10 mg twice a day for five days.

For chronic cases, there is an option for surgical repair but that cannot be decided without a physical examination.

Since you already suffered from two episodes in last four years, I do not feel you should discontinue medication as long as your doctor says so. I would also like to inform you that decision to discontinue medication depends on multiple factors such as severity of symptoms, duration of the index episode, the disruption caused during the episode, the time taken to receive medication and their effect on symptoms as well as side effects.

Originally, I was told I had lupus but now I am beginning to think it is something else. Nine months back, I consulted an orthopedic surgeon due to suspected necrosis in left hip, after an arthrogram was done it revealed I had severe bone marrow inflammation in my si joint and was referred for a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis, that brings me to now. I have severe hip and leg pain, it aches constantly, severe fatigue and itching, bad headaches and migraines. I just feel like crap and I am not getting any better. I am on Plaquenil 200 mg daily, Duloxetine 60 mg, Monica, Dexamethasone as needed, usually three days a month, Oxycodone 30 mg as needed, Imitrex as needed. Not sure how to post a copy of my lab but my RBC is 5.3 but my MCH is low 26.9, my hematocrit is 44.2. My hs-CRP is high at 6.6. My calcium and protein are both borderline high. My ALT and bilirubin are also high. My UA shows high for ketones, WBC, leukocyte, esters and hyaline cast. I tested negative on the HLA-B27 DNA test. My sed rate was borderline high at 19, I was negative for Sjogren's antibody as well as sm and sm/RIP antibodies. At this point, I am not sure what is going on. Should I push for a bone marrow biopsy to rule out a possible MPN? I desperately want answers as to why I am in such pain and ill health.","Doctor":"Hello. I have checked your blood tests (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and read your complaints about your health. Apparently, you have a rheumatic disease. It does not seem to be lupus or rheumatoid arthritis at first sight according to the laboratory reports. In the MRI of the hip, it actually seems to be better than the last time. I saw that you may have a urinary tract infection according to the urinalysis you provided (do you have a burning sensation during urination). You should follow up with a rheumatologist to further characterize your pain. Regarding pruritus, there is some test that should be done. A sonogram of your liver and some laboratory reports as well to rule out hepatic disease, blood disorders, parasitic infections in your bowels, etc. You should also get an MRI of your brain and cervical spine for a better understanding of your headache.

SGOT 61.0, SGPT 42.0, triglyceride 241, cholesterol 220, LDL 125.8, HDL 46.0. The BT report a year back is as follows: TSH 8.38, T3 92.3, T4 6.75, SGOT 26.5, SGPT 30.24, triglyceride 188.85, cholesterol 215.61, HDL 44.32, LDL 156.6. Ratio 4.90. I feel a continuous ache in my eyes, headache, fatigue, become anxious easily, get a severe headache if exposed to heat. I get hungry every three to four hours. I have been doing exercise and Yoga for last eight months. It brings slight relief in morning hours and by 12 PM fatigue sets in. I was taking Thyroxine 25 mcg for six months last year. I used to have low BP and low pulse, felt giddiness in evening and so reduced Thyroxine dosage to 12.5 mcg for last five months. I am not diabetic. Kindly advice.","Doctor":"Hi. Your all problems are linked with your poor controlled thyroid disease. All your previous thyroid reports are out of range. You need to start Levothyroxine (Thyronorm or any other brand available in your city) 25 mcg once daily in morning on empty stomach. At least 30 minutes before eating anything.  Your cholesterol is also not controlled. Start tablet Rosuvastatin (Rosuvas F) plus Fenofibrate combination 10 mg once in the night after dinner. Please check your blood sugar as well. A headache in heat is very common for that you can use an umbrella and try avoiding sun exposure if possible.

My cycle is 38 days and my period always comes on time. I have had intercourse five days ago and did bleed a bit that day. It stopped and yesterday I started to bleed again but this time it feels like at the beginning of my period. I should get my period after a week. What can be the cause of the bleeding? I am 19 years old. Just started to be sexually active. I am 154 cm in height and 48 kg weight.","Doctor":"Hello. If you have mild blood spotting than rule out pregnancy by blood hCG test after three weeks of LMP (last menstrual period). For moderate to heavy bleeding your detail evaluation should be done. Sometime during few initial intercourses, vaginal tear can lead to bleeding. So per speculum examination should be done for that. Check serum TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) and serum random blood sugar estimation to rule out thyroid and diabetes problem. Pelvic examination should be done and if needed USG scan done to check ovarian cyst, polyp, fibroid, etc. like problems. Take care.

I feel like something is in my throat sometimes. Can it be a COVID-19? I take Azithromycin 500 mg once a day after meal and Rhinokast F before sleep.","Doctor":"Hello. Do you have any recent travel to countries or areas with COVID-19? How about any recent exposure to someone who is positive with COVID-19? If your answer to these questions is none, then it is least likely for you to have COVID-19. COVID-19 initial symptoms would include cough accompanied by fever. On top of that most patients would also experience difficulty breathing. Since you mentioned you did not have a fever, it is least likely you have COVID-19 at this point. However, if symptoms, persist, worsen or new onset of symptoms such as difficulty breathing, and fever further consult is advised."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Indiscriminate use of topical steroids can cause skin thinning (due to collagen degradation) amongst other side effects like acne, facial hair, etc. Most of these side effects resolve gradually over next few months after stopping the topical steroid cream. This recovery can be aided by certain creams as well as certain procedures like dermaroller that help in collagen regeneration. Dermaroller is safe.

You need to be very careful for at least 24 hours after the extraction like avoiding rinsing your mouth too hard to running or jogging, eating cold and soft food, etc. Ideally, you should not be having any problem if you follow all the instructions properly 24 hours after the extraction.

I get scared of sleeping at times and have nightmares at times when I do.","Doctor":"Hi. I am so sorry to hear about your situation, I can imagine how hard it must be for you. With the little information that I have, I think your sleep issues are just an external expression of underlying anxiety. It is the fear that is keeping you awake so to help you with your sleep issues. First, we need to take a few measures to help you in increasing your relaxation levels which would calm you down. For that, you can try why deep breathing exercises like box breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation before sleep. You have to maintain your sleep hygiene which essentially means regulating your bedtime and your process of going to sleep which in common language is called night rituals. Once you have established this then you need to work on your anxiety. As you have also mentioned that you were sent for anger management 10 years ago, I would suggest starting psychotherapy as soon as possible which will help you understand the negative thoughts which are causing all these mood symptoms. Taking care of anxiety and anger is one thing, then the next step is finding the root cause of it and getting rid of it will help you solve the issue permanently. So I would suggest you to start psychotherapy. You can find a local counselor or we can start therapy online via video consultations.

The chronic whole body pain does not necessarily mean leukemia. Your CBC report is within limits as attached herewith (attachment removed to protect patient identity).

Your vitamin D level is slightly low below reference range and for that Cholecalciferol sachet with milk 50000 IU per ml can be prescribed once a week for six weeks.  Check your liver and kidney profiles report as well. High ESR could be from inflammation or infection as well. Check your thyroid status as well by serum TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) estimation.

See the pain in left side of abdomen and lump in the anal area has nothing to do with your previous anal surgery. Left sided abdominal pain may have many causes like minor causes as gas or acidity or some major issues too like kidney stones, etc. So I advise you to visit a nearby reputed surgeon so that he can examine you properly and rule out the exact problem.

Within past 12 hours, I am experiencing lots of pain typical of when I am to pass a stone. However, the stone has not passed. Also, noticing blood in urine for the first time. I have passed urine about four times within the hour. I am aware that this is part of the symptoms but want to know if I should see a doctor immediately. Any other advice appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi. I hope the bladder stones you mentioned you had earlier had passed. Blood in urine after renal colic suggests stone may have reached the lower end of kidney tube (ureter) and may pass soon. However, it is best to confirm it has passed by getting an ultrasound done. Flomax (Tamsulosin) helps dilate lower end of the ureter and so may help stone to pass. You may take painkiller or antispasmodic for pain. Increased fluid intake helps. If the stone is of pure uric acid, taking citrus juices or taking potassium citrate syrup may dissolve the stone. I suggest, if bleeding continues, or there is pain or fever, or you have difficulty emptying your bladder, go see your doctor. Later, a metabolic workup of your 24-hour urine collection may be needed to see why you form so many stones.

While the condition has improved, I am still not back to the normal and I still can feel the mucus is sitting in my throat region. Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hello. After going through your query, it seems you are suffering from allergic bronchitis. Usually, this condition is precipitated only if you are exposed to the particular allergens called triggers. Also, environmental pollution makes the situation more worse. As you said, it is very obvious that symptoms recur in your home town but never appeared in other places where you stayed. So it is very important to find out the particular trigger in our surroundings and avoid outside pollution as much as possible. To rule out any other pathology and possibility of asthma, it is advisable to do a chest x-ray and spirometry test. If the reports suggest the possibility of asthma then there is a need to start an anti-inflammatory inhaler called controllers. Expectorants work magically in any kind of bronchitis and help in expelling the thick mucus out. Allergen avoidance remains the main priority. You can continue tablet Montek-Fx and Flomist nasal spray. Rest of the medicines as follows. Environmental pollution and allergic triggers. Chest x-ray, spirometry test. Asthma. Allergy. Tablet Loxof 500 mg (Levofloxacin) daily once for five days, TusQ-X 10 ml 1-1-1 for seven days. Continue Montek-Fx and Flomist nasal spray. Avoid environmental pollution and known allergic triggers."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My wife tested positive for pregnancy four weeks ago. Three days later, she was passing a little blood.

I had a sexual encounter 15 days back with a confirmed HIV positive guy. I gave him blow job with a condom and we smooched. He also blew me but I was not putting on a condom and when he spit out, there was a streak of blood in the spit. He says he has sinus problem so he has blood in the spit, not in the mouth. I checked his mouth there were no sores or bleeding gums. What are my chances of infection in this case? We did not ejaculate in each others mouth nor we had any kind of penetrative sex. I came to know two days back that he is positive. I am showing acute HIV symptoms burning eyes, nose, and lips. I am unable to sleep. Can I go for RNA PCR? After how many days will the RNA PCR be accurate?","Doctor":"Hello. There is certainly a sizeable risk of transmission. Since he spit the blood, whatever may be a source, meaning he has had viruses in his oral cavity. HIV RNA or p24 antigen test, both are equally good becomes positive in one to two weeks period after infection, so you may get tested now. However, it is better to get combined p24 or RNA and antibody testing done. Burning eyes, nose, not necessarily mean HIV. Repeat testing should be done after two weeks.

My periods are mostly irregular and I usually have cramps in stomach and my breasts hurt before periods not every time though.

But today my breasts are hurting and I am having cramps. My vagina is also dry. Is there any chance that I am pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi. Since you have taken the emergency pill within 72 hours of intercourse, there is no chance of pregnancy. These symptoms could be because of hormonal changes due to the pill you have taken.

I do not have any symptoms of pregnancy, no implantation bleeding. Just a bitter taste in my mouth, frequent urination, and tiredness.","Doctor":"Hi. It is nice to hear that you are overdue and have been trying to conceive. Symptoms of pregnancy are different person to person. It is better to have serum beta hCG (blood pregnancy test) that will clearly describe your present status of pregnancy. Urine pregnancy test normally in early pregnancy is confusing as it is sometimes unable to detect pregnancy hormone in urine. The transvaginal scan will also be able to detect pregnancy clearly in 5 to 6 weeks.  In case of bleeding pain, dizziness or fainting report immediately to tertiary care hospital. If pregnancy test of blood comes positive for your satisfaction you can have another similar test after 48 hours of previous. If next level shows increase in level more than 60 % it is a normal pregnancy. If it is less than 60 % it is ectopic (alarming condition outside uterus pregnancy need immediate intervention). Periods can be delayed in case of strict diet, strenuous exercise, hormonal imbalance, thyroid abnormalities, illness, anxiety, etc. If pregnancy test comes negative wait for periods for a week. Check for menstrual irregularities in future cycles as well if present might need investigations.

I have what appears to be a single genital wart just below the head. I have had it since I was 16 years old. I went through five years in the military with this without any problems. I passed all the medical screenings and received all the vaccinations that were standard at the time. I have been out of the military for two years and still in relatively good condition. I do not have high blood pressure or any genetic propensity for any large health risks. I also can confirm that I do not have diabetes. Partner wise, I did not have sex for the first five to six years of having one, nor did I have any sexual contact to include oral. I did not notice any change once I started having sexual partners after. I was always careful to wear a condom though. I only am bringing it up now because I was asked today by my doctor (during a routine yearly visit) when the last time I had an HPV vaccine was and if I had one in the military. When I could not tell him he made me another appointment to see him to get a sample and a few other things.This single wart has never grown in size, become sensitive, multiplied, or shown any sign of life for lack of another way to put it. It is small enough that if I did not look for it at the underside of the head, I would not see it at all. Surely, a wart cannot just exist for a decade?","Doctor":"Hello. A single wart cannot exist for such a long time. There has to be an increase in the number. Are you sure it is a genital wart? Were you diagnosed by a dermatologist? Clinical photographs would have helped. For more information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, About six weeks ago, I started having pain in my right index finger.

I have no redness or swelling or pain when the doctor examined me. And then a few days ago, I started having slight pain in my knees and I also had pain in my back. But, now pain in my hand is almost gone.","Doctor":"Hi. You do not have rheumatoid arthritis. There is only pain and swelling in the joints along with morning stiffness.

Sprained muscles can easily be reduced and healed with Ultrasound therapy for 10-15 days and also applying hot water fermentation using Diclofenac ointment at home is also an added advantage to reducing sprain. After reducing the sprain and getting relaxed muscles then need to stretch the muscles step by step slowly increasing the exercise day by day or weekly once changing according to improvement. Here i will suggest you simple exercises for lower back need to be strengthen for a period of 15-20 days.

This inhibits swallowing, forcing me to hack it up and spit it out. I think this can make my voice scratchy but other than that I am not experiencing any other symptoms. I have gone to an ENT previously and I believe i tried a proton pump inhibitor but it did not have an effect.","Doctor":"Hello . Good to hear from you. I understand your situation. There are two reasons for your complaint mostly. One as the doctor who has seen you previously suggest must be because of a reflux from your stomach. Second might be because of something called as a post nasal drip. For dealing with the reflux, just a ppi would not help. You should make certain life style changes such as: 1. Avoid spicy food. 2. Eat on time. Your stomach should not be empty for for than 2 hours. 3. Do not sleep soon after you eat. Give atleast 2-3 hours of time between your meal and sleep. 4. Try to keep your head end elevated by a couple of inches while sleeping. Now regarding your post nasal drip, do have frequent episodes of cold/nasal discharge..? If yes take the necessary medications for it. So I would suggest you with the following medication: 1. Continue your ppi( like pantaprazole 40 mg once daily before breakfast). 2. If u have a cold, take an antibiotic( like amoxicillin 500mg twice daily for 3 days), an anti histamine( like levicetrizine 5mg once daily before sleep), a nasal decongestant( like oxymethazoline thrice daily in both nostrils).

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Will you be able to provide me with details like: I am answering assuming few things like he is heavy metastatic prostate cancer recently diagnosed and must have been started on some medication (probably androgen deprivation) along with steroids (Dexona). It looks like a metastatic prostatic carcinoma stage IV. If he has been diagnosed recently and has not yet taken any kind of hormonal treatment (antiandrogen medications), then the best treatment option for him is to go for a small surgical procedure known as orchiectomy or removal of both the testes. Dexona for short-term use has some benefits but for long-term use, it has got a lot of side effects in many patients, for example, blood sugar increase (can lead to diabetes) increased blood pressure, gastritis, insomnia, weakening of bones, muscle weakness, etc. Dexona cannot be stopped at once, it has to be tapered off slowly as per your physician's advice. For hiccups, he should take tablet Ranitidine (Aciloc) 150 mg twice daily for one week and tablet Metoclopramide (Reglan) 10 mg three times a day for three days.

For hepatitis B surface antibody, a level less than five is considered negative, while a level more than 12 is considered protective.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Now, I am not using any tablets and my periods are regular. Almost for four months, I am facing acne problem. My skin also looks so dull and dead. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Do not worry. Acne in your case is due to the hormonal changes which occurred due to the medicines you took in February and due to childbirth. But, just relax, it may take some time, like up to four months, but it will be fine. Apply Skinoren cream (Azelaic acid) in very little amount only on the pimple or dark spots only at night. Take very little amount. You will experience slight peeling of your skin but do not panic. The pimples will be dried off and the superficial layer will be removed. Use Cetaphil cleanser.

But, it is there all the time and I get pain when I eat something. Nowadays, I am not getting to control my stomach problem. Another thing is that when I eat something, I just get pressure on my stomach. I am not able to sit for long on my office seat. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. Where is the stomach problem? I mean which area of the abdomen your feel pain? Are you burping frequently? How many times in a day are you passing stools? Is there any mucus in the stools? Probably, you are suffering from an IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). Other possibilities like chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease, lactose intolerance, celiac sprue, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease can also be included. So avoid spicy food and dairy products, avoid processed foods, avoid coffee and alcohol and have a regular exercise. I suggest you use tablet Pantoprazole before breakfast for two weeks, tablet Normaxin (Clidinium Chlordiazepoxide, and Dicyclomine) twice a day for five days, tablet Rifaximin 200 mg thrice a day for five days, and tablet Simethicone 80 mg twice a day for five days. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines. If still, symptoms persist then you may need an ultrasound of the abdomen, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, stool examination and a doctor consultation. Follow up after five days.

There is one dark line and one is light (faint). I am not able to guess whether I am pregnant or not. My last period was just a day after having sex. Please advise me how to avoid pregnancy right now. What medicines should I take and is that available online?","Doctor":"Hello. I have reviewed your health query and can well understand that you are worried about chances of pregnancy. You have missed your periods and there are many causes for that. One of them is pregnancy. You have done Prega News test at home and got two lines of different intensity colors (one is dark and one light colored). This means either the test is not performed correctly or the strip may be damaged, expired or you may be under the influence of some medications (see the leaflet information given with the test strip for medications that can interfere with your test strip and can give a false result). In such a case, the best next step is to either wait for about four to five days and repeat the test or go immediately to a hospital for a proper pregnancy test and ultrasound evaluation of the uterus. This makes everything clear. In case you are pregnant (that is not sure at this point in time) you need to consult your gynecologist for discussing if you need the baby or not. The management of the case depends on your choice. If you do not need the baby, your gynecologist can best guide you how to proceed. The medications in most of the countries are not available over the counter. You need a proper prescription for the medications to abort the baby. Even if you are able to get the medications over the counter, I would say not to take it without the consent of a doctor as it may cause excessive bleeding and/or a lot more complications in your reproductive life. Sometimes, the situation leads to life-threatening complications. You need a proper cover of a gynecologist for the management of the case. Hope it helps. Please feel free to ask more if you have doubts or need further assistance.

I was put on Metformin but I started gaining even more weight so I stopped taking it. My facial hair increased and I still had very slow weight loss. I then started taking it again and the weight loss has started again. Is this common? I am on 500 mg once a day. I am currently 118 kg","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned it appears that you have PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome). Yes, it is common to have weight loss with Metformin therapy and it is actually very good for you. You see Metformin decreases insulin resistance which is very common in PCOS. Once insulin resistance decreases the body starts utilizing the available insulin made by the body and in turn, there is modest weight loss. Now PCOS therefore, decreases, resultant hirsuitism decreases along with weight loss and the cycle continues so on and so forth. In fact, you must take Metformin 500 mg thrice a day to see best results. To top it off if you combine brisk walk of 45 to 60 minutes daily and eat mostly fruits and vegetables and avoid sweet drinks and carbohydrate-rich and junk foods then you can achieve not only excellent control over PCOS but also lose a considerable amount of weight. So yes it is common to lose weight with Metformin.

The most effective way to treat the allergic reactions your wife experience is to avoid the allergen (the substance that causes the allergy) like pollen, dust, mites or detergent, etc. If it is difficult to identify the cause of allergy a batch skin test could be done to identify the cause. The medication prescribed is suitable for her condition. A short course of steroid can be tried if the symptoms are severe.

There is also a presence of light gas and burning in the stomach and I feel a slight tension in the neck area as well. What is the diagnosis?","Doctor":"Hello. I went through your post. Your BMI (body mass index) is very low, just lower limit of normal and obviously, your reserve glucose will also be low.

Can I reduce my Glycomet dosage to half, that is, 250 mg twice a day and check my glucose levels at home to know whether there is an improvement?

I walk 4 km every day. I am not sedentary. I wish to know that this loss of fat and muscle, is it due to hypothyroidism or Glycomet intake. Please be kind enough to advise me clearly.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the details (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your sugar control is excellent. As far as target levels are concerned, HbA1c of less than 7 indicates excellent control. So, the target is less than 7. However, since you are elder, slightly higher HbA1c is also acceptable. You may reduce the dose to Glycomet SR 500 mg once a day. Fat loss is due to diabetes itself due to insulin resistance. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) is fine and you should continue the same dose of Thyroxine. Rest, you should continue diet control and exercises.

If the sex is the thing, then she can take I-pill or Unwanted 72 (Levonorgestrel). She can take on the day of sex or soon after the sex, just one pill. But it is needed to be taken within 72 hours of having sex. The I-pill is very high in hormones and it should not be taken more than once a month.

Your test for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is conclusive (attachment removed to protect patient identity). If there is no further exposure other than that you mentioned, no more test for HIV screening is required. There is no specific category of rash through which diagnosis of HIV can be made. The only thing which can diagnose HIV is the test that you had already undergone. A test performed on or after 90 days, post exposure is considered as conclusive. I suggest you get tested for other STIs (sexually transmitted infection) as well. This includes syphilis, herpes simplex infection 1 and 2, gonorrhea, hepatitis B and C infection. It is unlikely that Finasteride will affect the HIV test result. Please also get a urine culture sensitivity test done along with serum vitamin D3 levels.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I just read your query and from what you have mentioned, it appears that you have hypothyroidism. Well, you can increase your dose to 112 Levothyroxine as per your doctor, but mind you Levothyroxine is not actually a weight loss drug. Your symptoms could be improved over time with 112 mcg Levothyroxine but additionally, try taking vitamin D supplements after ascertaining vitamin D deficiency. Check serum ferritin levels. These symptoms could also be attributed to vitamin deficiencies. Include a multivitamin plus minerals supplement daily. Besides, exercise can itself initially cause slight water retention as the muscles soak up water like a sponge. Also, the exercise causes lean muscle mass gain and that makes you look slimmer but actually weighs more than fat. So try to look for non-scale victories like decrease winding or breathlessness and better endurance, decrease in measurements of your clothes and not to fix yourself on weighing scale only.

These processes could affect even the tiny neurons in the skin resulting in repeated episodes of itching and burning. Antihistamines, oatmeal bath and compresses could help to some extent. However, an addition of drugs such as Pregabalin or Nortriptyline or Gabapentin, which are thefirst-line agents in small fiber neuropathy, would be of great help to alleviate the symptoms.

Currently, I am taking Zifi CV 200.","Doctor":"Hello. Kindly let me know if any other symptoms you have like burning micturition, abdominal pain, dyspnea, etc. Your total WBC count not much raised, it is only slightly increased. In urine, 6 to 8 pus cells are not significant. So, it can be a viral infection and symptomatic management is done for that. Kindly attach your reports to check it. Take care.

Is it safer for me to wait and begin taking the Zoloft after the surgery if I need it?","Doctor":"Hi. I would like to know that whether your hernia is the cause of anxiety. If anxiety is the case let me assure you that you have nothing to worry from surgical aspect as hernia repair is not a complicated or major surgery. So, the blood loss should not be worrying if you were only on Zoloft. But would like to know if you are having any other medication. Also, since your BMI indicates you are obese, which might be one of the causes for a hernia. Would like to know some other parameters like your blood pressure and sugars, your cardiac status as indicated by ECG and 2D echo. How is your exercise tolerance? Your coagulation profile, other basic blood reports like CBC. How about laparoscopic hernia repair? Or why not under regional anesthesia?

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

There are many reasons for this condition, so you need to be evaluated and physical examination is required. For managing ED (erectile dysfunction), a drug like Sildenafil or Tadalafil are the first-line treatment. Sildenafil can be started from 50 mg for almost half an hour before the sexual activity. Similarly, Tadalafil 10 mg can be used. The effects of Sildenafil last for one day while Tadalafil lasts for three days. For managing Premature ejaculation, a drug from SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) group such as Fluoxetine or Sertraline or Dapoxetine is used. Fluoxetine 20 mg daily or Sertraline 50 mg daily or Dapoxetine 30 mg can be taken one hour before the sexual activity. There is a combination of Dapoxetine and Sildenafil available in the market that can be used one hour before the sexual activity.

One is to have hormones (norethisterone or COCP-combined oral contraceptive pill) cyclically for three months (will regulate cycles hormonally) and have blood tests serum testosterone, serum prolactin, serum inhibin, serum progesterone, FSH (follicular stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) and thyroid function test on day two and the result should be checked and abnormality to treat .

My concern is if this is the right decision because I am not on HIV medication yet and I do not want to see my viral load count increase by B vaccine. My doctor wants me to start medication for HIV, so I am planning to take Genvoya. I am scheduled for an ultrasound and fiber scan for my liver in a month. My concern is starting the medication a right decision for my situation before I know the condition of my liver.

I think it is the right decision to vaccinate against hepatitis B because it protects you against future exposures to this virus. Hepatitis B is having the same routes of transmission as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) vaccination. Hepatitis B does not interfere with HIV infection.

Two straps of tape were attached to the penis in the form of a cross, so that they met in the tip of the penis' head, while the ends went all the way down to the skin of the shaft. This allowed the tape to pull the skin of the shaft up when the penis became erect. Here, I also attached the tape also to the foreskin that was left after circumcision had been performed on me during infancy. This also allowed the tape to put tugging force directly on the mucous membranes so that force could stimulate a supposed process of mitosis. I thought that direct pulling force on the mucous membranes, or the inner skin of the foreskin, would be ideal in my effort to regenerate the foreskin that I had. More than a decade later, I realized that this sort of behavior could be dangerous since after all, adhesives comprising these tapes are chemicals and mucous membranes are known to absorb chemicals. I am not aware of what specific kinds of chemicals are at work, except that they are pressure-sensitive adhesives that include acrylics. I am also not aware of the processes involved in a mucous membrane absorbing chemicals, or whether that process also applies to artificial chemicals such as pressure-sensitive adhesives. Will I be okay? Will this increase the chances of me having children with birth defects, or will this make me unable to have a baby and what not? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. I could not understand what made you do this practice and what benefit would you expect in this practice? There are no scientific studies available to support using this practice.  Let me give my opinion. First of all, the mucous membrane is one of the highly sensitive areas in our body. Better do not let hard substances come in contact with that, that will hurt it. This could lead to inflammation and pain. Due to a rich blood supply in the penis, there is a chance for absorption through it. Definitely, it will not increase the chances of defective children. The child genetic/defect will never be based on this. So, be confident. This will have no role in affecting the baby issues. Basically, this practice has no benefit in any aspect. It may produce local inflammation or irritation on the penile tip (glans penis). I suggest you consult an andrologist or psychiatrist or sexologist for your specific problem. There are few drugs to manage premature ejaculation (early ejaculation), less erection, or other issues. It is not advisable to practice this tape sticking.

This month, just before my period date, I had brown discharge and still, menses has not come. My pregnancy test showed negative, but nowadays, I feel little cramps in my stomach. Am I pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello. You have missed cycle, and have cramps and brownish vaginal discharge. Have you taken any hormones, medications, recent illness, crash diet, strenuous exercise, had thyroid abnormalities, abnormal hair growth, sudden weight gain, etc.? These all are the causes of delayed menses. Vaginal swab also needs to be sent to a lab. My advice is to have immediate serum beta hCG twice with an interval of 48 hours. If this beta hCG of the second reading is less than first, it could be a miscarriage, if the second level of beta hCG increased only less than 60 %, it could be pregnancy outside the uterus, but if beta hCG shows increase more than 60 % in 48 hours it is a healthy pregnancy. In case of dizziness, heavy bleeding, or pain immediately report to the hospital.

The doctor that treats infertility put me on Synthroid, started with a smaller dosage (75 mcg), but since my results were worse after being on the low dosage, they increased it to 112 mcg.

I was told since my spouse has infertility issues (not me) and since I am trying for a baby, natural way or through IVF or IUI, then I have to be on Synthroid forever and Hashimoto cannot be cured. I have been taking all natural homeopathic Vitamins and even when I get sick I also buy natural medicine that was recommended by my Naturopath doctor. I continue to take Synthroid, I lose a lot of hair in my shower even prior to taking Synthroid. What do you suggest I should do? I do not want my body to be dependent on Synthroid for the rest of my life. He also said if I get pregnant I need to stay on Synthroid. I wanted to know from a professional if I am better off taking homeopathic medicine or should I continue on Synthroid?","Doctor":"Hi. Great that you are open to trying complementary systems of medicine. I would recommend that you shall consult a homeopath and start appropriate medication. I would also recommend you to take up Yoga practices on a regular basis. I would like to emphasis few points that might be helpful. According to Yoga philosophy, the mind plays a vital role in manifestation and vitiation of a disease. So, it is of prime importance that you voluntarily suggest yourself not to get worried or think of anything negative thing repeatedly. The simplest way to do that would be breathing practices. I have listed a few breathing practices that might help in balancing the hormonal imbalances. 1.Deep breathing - Please ensure that the duration of exhalation is longer than that of inhalation. Longer the better. And strictly a big no to breath holding. Practice for 5 to 7 minutes. 2.Abdominal breathing: Inhale completely such that the abdomen bulges out stretching your diaphragm completely and then exhale completely. Even ten minutes of this practice decreases oxidative stress and promotes vagal tone (responsible for relaxation). 3.Bramari pranayama: Close your ears with index finger so that you do not hear any external sound. Inhale completely and while exhaling produce a mild humming sound. Keep your concentration on the humming sound. Try to observe where the sound comes from and where all it spreads. It relaxes the entire body and regulates thyroid functioning.

My pressure was 110/80 mm Hg and ECG was normal. My cholesterol levels are good. I am taking tablet Metformin and Aspirin. My HbA1c is 6.1 %.","Doctor":"Hello. Regarding your heart rate, it is fine to have a resting heart rate of 75 to 84 beats per minute. It does not signify any major abnormalities. Exercise, stress, anxiety, smoking, caffeine can certainly lead to pulse rate elevation. So, as you mentioned, your ECG (electrocardiogram) was normal except rate. So it must be sinus tachycardia, which can occur due to anxiety if you had brisk walking. Moreover, your home readings are fine so, there is nothing to worry about it. So, just get thyroid test and hemoglobin tested once. The rise in pulse rate with exercise is an absolutely normal thing. According to the age, maximum heart rate for you is around 160 beats per minute. Also, try to note your pulse rate while sleeping. So overall, I think there is no need to worry about it. Next HDL (high-density lipoprotein) is lower (attachment removed to protect patient identity), we expect it to be above 40. The best way to elevate is healthy lifestyle including healthy diet like low calorie, fat and oily diet, weight loss, avoiding smoking and drinking.

I have had one of the white patches biopsied and it was diagnosed as follicular lymphoid hyperplasia. Everyone says the soft palate is normal but I am not convinced because of the length and duration. I underwent allergy testing of which I had none. Also, I had an endoscopy to check for reflux which also was negative. The last doctor I saw said he would remove my tonsils. I have had imaging tests of which nothing has shown up. Could something be hiding or could this be precancerous? Also, I get white pimple sores that pop up and then go away only to come back again in the same place. Not sure what I need to do next but my prior alcohol abuse has me concerned with these symptoms. I realize these symptoms are all over the place but it seems oral cancer can vary quite a bit. Can you advise, please?","Doctor":"Hello. It is good that you stopped drinking. Meanwhile, I do not find any cancerous lesion in the pictures you sent (attachment removed to protect patient identity). However, none of the pictures show the posterior pharyngeal wall. If you can take a better picture it will be appreciated. Can you detail your symptoms more? Can you share the reports of your allergy testing? Did you change your place of stay or work recently?  Your symptoms seem to suggest an allergic cause and the constant allergy can be a cause for the chronic inflammation of the throat. Please revert to me with all details. Please upload the CT and MRI reports as well as the biopsy report. Revert with more information to an ENT otolaryngologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My LMP is 20th April.

You need to understand acne is common in your age and it is an ongoing process and you may experience frequent exacerbation due to stress and hormonal. It occurs due to hormonal activity at puberty. So you may not get final medicine or final decision. And the problem may last until your twenties. Moreover, you have taken too much of medicine which may be another reason for resistant acne.

Dark circles under the eye are caused by fatigue. Dark circles under may merely be shadows cast by puffy lids of eye or hollows under eyes, actually that are due to as a normal part of aging. Common causes are mainly allergies, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, pigmentation irregularities, rubbing or scratching your eyes, sun exposure, heredity, etc.  Treatment depends on the cause. It is not a medical problem. Self-care also needed like cold compression, elevation of the head with more pillows while sleeping, and extra sleep.

I have been doing a warm compress three a day and a hot shower once. It seems to be getting more painful. I cannot go to the doctor because of COVID-19. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. From your history and pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I gather that it is vulvitis, which has got localized to a single point. Usually, infection starts in the vagina and later it gets localized. It forms a blister and over time it forms a pustular lesion (pus as in your picture). Steps to solve this: 1. Avoid tight undergarments. No undergarments at night, so the area will be dry. 2. Abstinence until the infection resolves. 3. Have a course of antibiotics which will reduce infections and pain. Take tablet Azithromycin 500 mg two tablets after food, Fluconazole 150 mg after food, capsule Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid 625 mg twice daily for five days. Use pain killers with Serratiopeptidase. 4. Use vaginal wash, douches, and avoid any vaginal discharge soiling the area. Do not use any local antibiotic ointments, this will form antibioma. To reduce the local edema and pain, you can apply little Glycerine and Magnesium sulfate ointment over the painful area. Then place a small gauze over it. This will immediately reduce the pain. Apply twice daily for three to five days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a female and single.

My query is that in the report it is showing decreased level section that oral contraceptive, ovarian failure what does that mean? Please help me understand what does that mean I am worried.","Doctor":"Hello. First, calm down. I have seen your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your antimullerian hormone level is showing high, and that means you have a polycystic ovary. A polycystic ovary is a gynecological hormonal disturbance that can irregularize cycles with other symptoms like abnormal hair growth, weight gain or insulin irregularities. You should have some healthy long-term precautions. It is better to have daily walks, exercise or yoga for having normal BMI (body mass index) and weight. Have a healthy diet with less salt, sugar, oil, and spices to reduce the chance of diabetes as in PCOS, it is there. Have a check on other symmptoms like irregular periods or abnormal hair growth. I suggest you have combined oral contraceptive pills for regulation of cycles for three months cyclically.

Last month, I tried having sex with my partner. Even after taking Viagra 25 mg, it lasted only for five minutes. Then, I again took Viagra 100 mg immediately but it did not erect properly. I cannot control the thought of sex. Usually, I masturbate three to four times a day. I know it is harmful but cannot control it. Please advise me how to control these thoughts and increase sexual stamina and hardness in the penis. I am also worried about penis size and penile papules and a sebaceous cyst on the scrotum.","Doctor":"Hello. It seems from your question that you might be having a psychological difficulty in performing a sexual act with your partner, as you do not have any difficulty in masturbation which you can do three to four times a day. Masturbation is not harmful, however at the rate you masturbate, it might affect your sexual performance. As after each sexual act (either coitus or masturbation), there is a recovery phase during which the body reconciles back to its normal state and prepares itself for the next session. This recovery phase can vary from person to person, but on an average can be between 30 to 60 minutes. As mentioned by you, you have difficulty in having sex with your partner, as a result of which you do not get the sexual gratification hence resulting in preoccupation with sexual thoughts. I would advise you to calm yourself, let your body relax and rejuvenate. Do not force yourself into sex without any feelings for it, gradually you will regain your sexual strength and stamina. Eat clean, refrain yourself from using any kind of drug to increase your erection as these will result in rebound in the form of result erections. For papules/nodules in and around your genitals, you should seek a consultation from a venereologist and seek proper treatment for the same. For penile length, until you are able to penetrate and can have penetrative sex with your partner, you need not be worried about its size.

Now, with new blood-thinning medicines and exercise, I am starting to see good results. The doctor wants to do an angiogram next month, after that stents or surgery on my lower legs. I have two stents near my heart. One was placed, when I had an infarction 19 years ago and another one was placed after eight years. They seem to be good and I am afraid of another procedure. Now, I am willing to get a second opinion about this condition.","Doctor":"Hi. It is very good to know that you are doing well with medications and exercise. The development of collateral blood supply in the lower limbs is a good option. You could discuss this with your doctor and postpone angiogram and stenting. However, it is important to realize that collateral vessels are small and do not provide the same amount of blood, as the normal vessels do. Besides, peripheral angiography and stenting are safe procedures. So, I would advise angiography to see the state of the blood vessels and collaterals and then, you can decide for stenting.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have noticed that your TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) level is very high. It indicates that your thyroid hormones levels are not in the sufficient range. Hence, we need to increase the dose of Thyronorm. I recommend you to take tablet Thyronorm 50 mcg (Thyroxine) every morning in the empty stomach daily. Also, your vitamin D levels are also low. I recommend you to start taking Vitamin D supplements. Take capsule D-Rise 60K (Vitamin D3) one tablet weekly once for three months.

Platelet count can be high in iron deficiency anemia, post-hemorrhage, inflammation in the body, infection, etc., like secondary cause. Your physical examination should be done. Check your blood pressure and sugar level as well. Your otological ear examination also has to be done that can lead to referred headache and dizziness.

Use warm salt water gargle twice a day for a week or two. There will be a relief.

This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

We are planning to extend our family whenever I will be perfect in health so that there should not be any health issues to the baby and the mother. I would like to elaborate on my health condition so that you can advise us on how to improve my health condition. Please note that the below tests have conducted before three months and after that, I have gone through some medication for one and a half months. 1. Iron, vitamin D, and hemoglobin: My hemoglobin remains low every time I go for annual health check-up (for the past seven years). Currently, it is 10.8. Iron - 18, TIBC - 492, transferrin saturation – 3.66, vitamin D - 19.91. 2. Yeast infection in vagina: I have been suffering from recurrence of yeast infection in the vagina for the past one year. It comes again and again and I am taking Fluka every week one tablet. After taking Fluka, I feel no itching and no yeast infection but within a week or so it happens again. 3. Boobs itching and enlargement of area around nipples: for the past four to five years, I have been observed that area around my nipples has enlarged, and that area is really very dry and itchy. Although, there are no lumps in the breast and armpit. I visited a gynecologist but they told that it is a dermatology issue. Hence, I also visited a dermatologist and the doctor suggests that it is just because my skin is extremely dry and it can be cured after applying good moisturizer in the long run. But I have not seen any improvement till date. I really want to be healthy and want to get rid of the above issues before conceiving the baby.","Doctor":"Hi. First thing, I would like to tell you that you are a healthy individual. Even though you were anemic before, now you have made good progress in your hemoglobin. Now coming to your recurrent fungal infection in the vagina, it seems that you have adequately taken antifungal and antibiotics. I would recommend you to get done your 1) Blood sugar level. 2) Thyroid profile test. Now coming to soreness and itching at nipples, yes, it happens due to dry skin and micronutrients and minerals deficiency. I would like to suggest you to apply the moisturizer and take nutrients supplement. Nutritional deficiency. Blood sugar levels. Thyroid profile test. Multicomponent deficiency. Tablet Azithromycin 500 mg once a day for three days, Candid V6 pessery every night intra vaginal for six days, tablet Omeprazole 20 mg twice a day for three days.

About five months ago, I had sex with a CSW during a vacation. The relationship included oral sex and vaginal sex. The relationship was completely protected (also oral) and I put on a condom (I do not know if it got broken). After two days of the incident, I noticed a small red bloodbath on my scrotum, which later grew (the skin doctor diagnosed it as an angerectomy). After about two weeks after the incident, I began to have severe pain in the legs and feet that have gone and are still coming today randomly. In addition, 10 days after the incident, my temperature rose to 37.5 for about a month and a half. After a month or so, I started to get a lot of wounds in my chest, shoulders, and back (the dermatologist diagnosed it as a folliculitis). These wounds are coming and going today. In addition, many small red dots (about 50 to 60) have begun to appear on the skin especially in the chest and arms to this day, more and more news appears (the skin doctor claimed to be hemangiomas). It looks like a little blood blister. Also, I suffer from severe dehydration in the skin and palms for a long period of three months, there is really a white layer of dryness and even hand cream does not help. Lately, I have also realized that my tongue always feels dry and the color is white with a little white bump in the end. I have lost weight about 5 kg for a period of two months. In addition, strong head pain that comes and goes and a painkiller does not help at all, and also suffers from fatigue all the time. I have done a lot of testing of HIV combo Ag-Ab, fourth generation, and all were negative. In addition, two weeks ago (four and a half months of the case), I tested hepatitis B and C (negative result). As well as an antibody test for syphilis SCR by ELISA (negative result). In addition to the above, about a week after the incident, I began to feel a stab at the end of the penis, and I also had a feeling of burning at the end of urination. I have done many urine tests that include PCR from urine for chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, mycoplasma and/or plasma several times, all of which returned negative. About two months ago, I started a transparent discharge from the end of the penis. I repeated the tests, negative, also a general urine test without findings (no leukocytes) and urine culture returned without findings. Here are the questions:  Have the tests I performed and returned negative throughout the period clearly indicate that I have not contracted HIV from the case described? Can there be a case in which the virus is not detected and more time is required for further testing? If so, when to do it? In light of all the symptoms I have described, what can it be? What more can be checked that expresses itself in such a way? Are light symptoms recommended to perform a different method test like PCR for example? Has the combo test detected HIV types 1, 2, O? Does the test detect all sub-types and all strains of the virus? Can it be that I have HIV 2 and the test cannot detect antibodies because it can take a longer time? I read that sometimes in rare cases it can take a year to detect enough antibodies and before that all the test will be a false negative, is that really possible? Is there anything new that has emerged in the medical literature at this time that figured out from what all I have said?","Doctor":"Hello. I have viewed the images (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your screening tests for HIV are conclusive. A three months intervening period between risk exposure and HIV screening tests (fourth generation HIV antigen-antibody combo test and third-generation HIV antibody screening test) is considered enough for a test to be considered conclusive. There is no need to do another type of test. The combo test is suited to the strains, types and subgroups of HIV prevalent in a particular area and therefore unlikely to miss HIV strain, type or subgroup. HIV 2 can be detected by a combo test and it has the same window period (three months) as it has for HIV 1. Delayed seroconversion is only possible in case of immunosuppression like organic transplant recipients or those on oral steroids. Not otherwise. Your tongue looks normal. The little white bumps, in the end, are circumvallate papillae which are quite normal. The bumps on chest and shoulders are perhaps acne rather than folliculitis whereas the red dots are perhaps cherry angiomas. However, I request you to kindly upload a few more good quality images of the affected areas so that I am able to confirm and guide you better.

Fever occurred five days back but spikes have reduced now. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Dengue is positive in this patient as ELISA for dengue is positive. In dengue, fever subsides by 5 to 6 days. In this period, you have to keep a watch on whether any swelling appears in the body, a petechial rash appears on the body, and also to watch for platelet count. If platelet count is falling, or swelling increases then we have to admit the child. Most cases of dengue do not require admission and require monitoring of hydration status and platelet monitoring. So, I suggest you give an adequate amount of liquid diet to the patient and repeat the platelet every alternate day for one week.

That day I did not get erections so she gave me oral. I did not perform vaginal sex because of non-erection, and whatever I have tried that was protected. But I had unprotected oral sex where she gave me a blow job. After two weeks, I have noticed a bump on my penis. I went to my doctor (skin specialist) and he gave me a few medicines for one week. Doxycycline (two times in a day), Zifi (one time in a day), Lycopene, one cream. He also first asked me to go for VDRL test but next moment refused. Still, I tested for VDRL which comes negative (test happen after one-week medicine course), although the bump on my penis now fully healed (after 2 to 3 weeks).I have also tested for HIV RNA and HIV 1 and 2 antibody and p24 antigen, both came negative after five weeks. HIV 1 and 2 fourth generation antibody test negative on the sixth week. My doctor advised me Doxycycline for next one month but I am not taking it for past four months. So, my Doxycycline course goes like one week (two capsules in a day), two weeks (one capsule in a day). My question is how much I can rely on HIV testing after five weeks. RNA and antibody and antigen test accuracy related to the window period after five weeks. Should I again continue with Doxycycline as I got a new bump on my face? Is that syphilis too? Why I got a new bump on my face (picture attached). Which test I have to go for again to detect syphilis or get HIV status? I am facing fever like feeling since two weeks after exposure where fever is not measurable (not more than 98 even) but extreme body aches. Two times I got loose motions too. Itchy body.","Doctor":"Hello. I have noted your concern and I have viewed the attachments (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Insertive oral sex has a negligible risk of transmission of HIV. Moreover, your HIV screening test (p24 Ag and anti-HIV antibody test) is conclusive. This test has a short window period of 2 to 3 weeks and is considered conclusive after that.  The bump on your face seems like an acne lesion. Is it painful? I suggest you apply Clindoxyl (Clindamycin) gel once a day. No need for oral Doxycycline. Since it has been seven weeks since your unprotected oral I suggest you take a screening test for HSV and syphilis (VDRL) and again at 12 weeks for a conclusive result. There is no need to retest for HIV. For more information consult an HIV AIDS specialist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My foot and hand skin layers are removing day by day.

This condition is not due to any vitamin deficiency or any other deficiency. This is keratolysis exfoliativa which is a form of eczema. It does not cause any irritation or itching. You just need to apply moisturizing cream containing White Soft Paraffin frequently and liberally on hands and feet. Along with this avoid frequent washing of hands and feet; avoid hard soaps and use gloves while cutting and washing activities. This will definitely help you.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours.

Due to a reduction in their flexibility, they are not able to take up high impact activities like running or jumping, while the low impact activities like daily chores are pain-free. During high impact activities the stress which should have been taken up by the muscles now falls on the inner structures that are not made for it, and so there is a sharp shooting pain felt.

I know this is wrong and want to get on regular birth control as soon as possible. My periods is supposed to happen on in a week. But, I have brown discharge and light bleeding for past two days. Is this implantation bleeding? Or is this because of I-pill? I am scared that I might be pregnant.","Doctor":"Hi. There is a possibility of pregnancy. It would be better if you get urine pregnancy test, if no period in next two days. Since it was a fertile period, there is a possibility of pregnancy. Though you had pill, 1 to 2 % possibility of contraceptive failure is there. Spotting that you got could be due to hormonal imbalance too. Get a blood test called serum BhCG (beta human chorionic gonadotropin) to confirm pregnancy which is 100 % accurate.

My labs show that my numbers were very low. Trying to explain to a new partner:  Never have sex if I have an outbreak. Condoms are recommended by doctors for all sex because there is the possibility of transmitting HSV even if there is not an outbreak. He thinks this is excessive and unnecessary because it is a legal issue of liability. He also thinks he is smarter than doctors.  My question is that if we have unprotected sex during a non-outbreak, is it 100 % certain that he will get HSV? We read that his hands touch my herpes outbreak area, he could wash his hands after and he would not get HSV. Does this apply to his tongue to the same genital area, just cleanse the mouth and teeth and what if there is no outbreak, is oral sex safe for him? Yes, we know about dental dams.","Doctor":"Hello. Regarding your first question, it is better to avoid sex during an outbreak because there is a high risk of transmission during this period. Also, it would be painful to have sex if lesion involving near the vagina.  Next thing, it is possible to acquire an infection during non-outbreak duration as there is asymptomatic viral shedding although the risk of infection is less. So it is better to take precautions in order to avoid transmission. In hand, we have a protective epidermal layer, which prevents direct transmission of viruses unless there is a break or wound. But, same is not true for tongue and mucosa as there is no protective layer. So, it can directly transmit infection. So oral transmission may occur irrespective of washing teeth or tongue.

This has been happening for last seven weeks and the vibration of the twitching when I am resting my elbow (say on a table while using a mouse) is quite large enough for my entire arm. I have no associated muscle weakness in the right arm and an EMG and NCS done last week have come clear saying it is a potentially benign fasciculation. A full MRI scan of the spine and brain has shown no abnormalities. My concern is that the twitching has not stopped for such a long period. Is there cause for concern for this to be a motor neuron disease? Currently, I am taking Lyrica 75 mg and Rejunex CD3.","Doctor":"Hi. If the nerve conductions and EMG (electromyography) have come clean then there is nothing to worry about. Fasiculations are generally considered significant only if they are associated with weakness or wasting. Do these occur only in a particular position?

I am desperately seeking answers as my daughter who is 5 years old has been diagnosed for the first time with a congenital polar cataract. The doctor who originally diagnosed her stated with confidence that it has been there since she was born. My daughter has been diagnosed with 20/300 vision and deprivation amblyopia. I took her to another doctor to get a second opinion and he stated there is really no way to tell if it has been there since birth but stated it could have been. How was the first doctor able to make this diagnosis with such confidence when another doctor stated there is really not a way to tell? From what I have researched online, posterior polar cataract is very rare and has a congenital onset, is this true? The second doctor has started her on a patching regimen for half of her waking day. Her vision has not improved since she has started wearing her eyeglasses and I am wondering how much or if at all it will improve, with such a late diagnosis. Also, I, unfortunately, contracted HSV type 1 during my third trimester while I was pregnant with her and I have also read that this could be a cause, is this a potential cause? If it is a cause in your professional opinion, would you recommend that a newborn born to a mother with HSV 1 developed during late pregnancy with an ophthalmological issue due to the risk? Any input you can offer will be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hello. Since you had an HSV (herpes simplex virus) infection, there are increased chances that this polar cataract is congenital (since birth). Now, during initial years, if there is a hindrance in vision, then due to cataract deprivation, amblyopia sets in. Your ophthalmologist has correctly started patching therapy but my question here is why has he not thought about surgery because then we can remove the cause of amblyopia, get a clear visual axis, and start patching again. In my opinion, that would yield a much better result. Please consult a pediatric ophthalmologist who does pediatric cataract surgeries and discuss the case there because I think removing the cataract and implanting a lens is a very good choice and it will help in amblyopia therapy very much.

She is currently taking Warfarin, Bisoprolol, Ramipril, and Furosemide. Despite the Warfarin at 5 mg, her INR is 1.7 (that is outside the therapeutic range). She is 41 kg and age is 76. She is being encouraged by her doctor to change the anticoagulant. Please advise, given her age and weight and the most current research, which one would be best for her to move on to - Apixaban or Dabigatran. Which dose should she be on? Please give your reasons why. Thank you for your help with this.","Doctor":"Hello. As per the history, it looks like it is getting difficult to manage with Warfarin. Warfarin is notorious in terms of interacting with many other drugs and thereby it is difficult to achieve the target therapeutic level. So, now newer oral anticoagulants are used with no need of monitoring and without any excess risk of bleeding as compared to Warfarin. There are various papers to confirm that newer oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are safe and effective compared to Warfarin. So, once we decide that we are switching to NOACs, then we have to see which one is best out of them. For that also, there have been various studies done recently. When we compare, we see two things: All the studies will mention these two facts while comparing the drugs. Most of them have quoted that Apixaban as equivalent to other drugs in terms of effectiveness (that is preventing the stroke) and better in terms of side effects (that is lesser risk of excess bleeding). Regarding the dose, different studies have quoted 2.5 mg BD versus 5 mg BD. So, this will depend on your doctor and his experience with the dose commonly used in your country. My suggestion is to move to newer oral anticoagulants with a slight inclination towards Apixaban based on the current data.

Every year, my hands has this condition where it will itch and form rashes with liquid inside then skin itself. Most of the time, it starts on December then end on February, however it differs every year. This year it started on March and up to now. I experience this every year, as in yearly so I assumed it is normal. It is not hereditary, I assume, because none of my family members is experiencing it other than me. My mother told me that maybe it is because of cold weather which I agreed. It is there for the past 11 years. I have never consulted any professionals about it since it does not look severe. However, I am curious what is this condition called.","Doctor":"Hi. Seasonal itch and swelling over the exterior parts of the palms, soles ear, nose occur due to a type of cold allergy called perniosis orchilblains. Lesions for increased itchy sweling occurs mainly during the start of cold weather and end of the cold weather when there is temperature change in the environment. I am not sure which part you are living in as you have not mention. Treatment for this is avoidance of cold exposure, wearing warm clothes. Calcium dobesilate gel twice daily. Diltiazem 30 mg tablet BD for 2 weeks during the lesions. For itching you use Loratadine10 mg once daily for two weeks or whenever there is itching. Apply aloevera moisturizing cream over the hands multiple times with rubbing of the hands and feet and the parts so that good circulation bring warm blood flows into those area."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

But, I do not feel hungry and I am just feeling weak. The panics come on and off throughout the day. Sometimes I get panic when I wake up and when I am taking my breakfast late in the morning.

Feeling weak, fear of losing control, sickness, death fear, the feeling of low blood pressure and low blood sugar levels, all symptoms seem to be due to anxiety. Feeling mild dizzy, dry throat feeling like there is a ball in your throat, fast and hard breath, fast heartbeat and feels like there is a stone in your chest, feels like your in a race or you are drowned into the sea, extreme fear, stress, chilled and shaking, no fever, no pain, no nauseation, these all, are the common symptoms of anxiety. Changing salt and sugar levels in your food will not help you to get relieved from this problem. Please take regular meals and it is just a disease which needs evaluation and proper management according to the diagnosis made by a physician. If you are under treatment and you are on a regular visit to your physician, he can adjust the dose of medications if needed. Please ask for PCP (Phencyclidine) when referred to a Psychiatrist and ask him to add some medications for the proper management of anxiety. This problem can be managed only with proper evaluation and management by a Psychiatrist. So proper and timely follow-ups are very important even when you are not feeling good after taking medicines for anxiety. Antianxiety medications take time to have improvement in your condition.

I was wasted but I remember that I was protected with a condom. The condom did not break nor leak but maybe was not put perfectly. I did not manage to cum, removed it and masturbated in a very aggressive way with my bare hands for some minutes. She spit twice on my dick, that is all. Since then, I had major symptoms starting from day-2 with burning sensation and painful urination for some days and my genital organ was tender and painful. I took Ceftriaxone and a short course of Ciproxen on my own assuming I had gonorrhea/chlamydia without any test. On day-5 started a very weird tingling numbness in all the limbs which continued for a week or a bit more, sores in mouth on and off starting from the first week including a huge one in the roof of my mouth, headache, low appetite, weakness, and myalgia. Later on, I started to realize changes in the nails after one month, joints pain still ongoing, no fever nor lymphadenopathy, most importantly I lost a lot of pounds and lost appetite and lost weight especially in my face - around the eyes and mouth. I want to mention that I never stopped crying from the very first day of being horrified of HIV. I got psychological and psychiatric consultation several times with no help. Combo fourth generation lab test and syphilis test were performed in a very reliable center and were negative. After eight weeks, the second combo fourth generation test at almost 16 weeks in another major hospital also negative. Can I be a case report of late seroconversion? I am scared to death. Gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, and PCR negative as well. Nowadays, I am almost asymptomatic apart from the joint pain that might not be related (got examined by orthopedic who suspects a particular problem) and of course my shrinking face and the changes in my nails which are still there. It seems so far that nothing could reassure me. I admit that there is a psychological or perhaps psychiatric element because of the huge persistent stress. But I must tell you that I always had a big round face and since the event, I lost a considerable amount of facial volume, facial wasting indeed and this was confirmed by a dermatologist. I managed to regain my body weight but not my face. I read online about HIV causing apoptosis of facial fat cells. What is your opinion in that regard? I am only four and a half months from the event. I am really confused. Should I do an HIV viral load test? What are the chances for the duo test to miss twice after the window period? Have you ever heard of or seen a duo turning positive after such a long period? I do not feel like becoming an international case report you know. Thanks in advance. These facial changes what I am experiencing are simply driving me crazy. I want so much to move on with my life but I am \\"losing my face\\" which is my social ID. I do not know how to explain. My relationship with my wife, my social life, and my career are already destroyed and a total mess cause this \\"thing\\" had taken a huge toll on me. So, I am desperate. Again, I am talking about shallowness around and under eyes, temporal wasting, maybe a prominent change in my face contour, much smaller cheeks and some empty holes in my forehead and in my skull just behind my ears. It is just weird. It was not there before, it is advancing and I cannot find any explanation for it apart from the potential relationship with that one-time unfortunate exposure. I asked a couple of national HIV experts and also got a consultation from a doctor. All of them are pretty sure I am HIV negative. The doctor was a bit mad at me even. Please help me. In my country, negative duo test at 12 weeks or after is considered conclusive and definitive.","Doctor":"Hello. I have noted your concern. Protected sex is safe as far as the risk of HIV is concerned. Spitting on bare penis is not a risk for HIV as saliva is not infectious. The virus cannot survive in saliva because it contains enzymes inhibitory for the virus. Moreover, a fourth generation antigen/antibody HIV screening test is considered conclusive at six weeks and beyond by most sexual specialists. Therefore I do not think you need to worry about HIV.

It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My hCG level came less than 2. Does it mean that I am not pregnant.","Doctor":"Hello. Based on the present hCG levels, it suggests that you are not pregnant at present (or today), as beta hCG level is quite low. But if you frequently have irregular periods and there had been history of sexual contact, (and if you had delayed ovulation then there may be chances of pregnancy, or in other words chances of beta hcg increasing in next few days , depending on the time of ovulation and sexual intercourse). And if your cycles have been previously regular, and if this is the first time it got delayed, then you need to evaluate for the causes of it. Please get back to me if you have further queries with the exact timeline of events and your suspicions based on the event. Meanwhile you can take medication for withdrawal periods as already 12 days have lapsed from your expected date, or you could wait for another 3-4 days, and if still not getting periods you can start taking it and evaluate yourself for the cause for delayed periods. Ultrasound abdomen and pelvis, complete hemogram, thyroid profile, serum prolactin level. Tablet Meprate or Deviry 10 mg twice daily for 5 days and then stop.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy.

My husband's sperm analysis was normal and we have been having sex almost everyday. This complication started after my second miscarriage. I just am at a loss. And do not know what more can we do other than IVF.","Doctor":"Hello. How are you doing? I understand the strain you are experiencing. Your age, normal reports, semen parameters, trying almost every day are all good prognostic factors, most positive factor is that you had a pregnancy, no matter what your result was. Use of Clomid improves your ovulation chances, IUI improves the chances of sperm meeting the egg. The only thing I find missing in your history is the tubal evaluation. The fallopian tube is a bridge between the uterus and ovaries. Here the egg waits for the sperm, here embryo is formed and gradually moves to the uterus. This tube is never seen on scan or examination. The inner diameter of the tube is 1 mm. This can be blocked. So, no matter how good the sperm or egg is, they will not meet each other. So I would advise, if I may, have a tubal evaluation with HSG (hysterosalpingography) X-ray with dye pushed into the uterus. The other method to evaluate is hysterolaparoscopy. An IUI after this test will definitely have better chances. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more queries.

For one period of about a year, they were raising every month. My Tg and Abt within normal range. I did anti-TPO and my result is 2.01 and ref range is less than 5.6. My question for you is on my case can Hashimoto thyroiditis decrease neutrophilia and increase lymphocytes even after hysterectomy? Or shall I consider blood cancer and make the test to rule out. I do not have any symptoms.","Doctor":"Hi. I have reviewed your results (attachment removed to protect patient identity). From what I have seen leukocytes are within normal range as well as hemoglobin, platelets were not reported. From the automatic differential, there is indeed a slight lymphocytosis, but the manual differential (the one reviewed by the doctor under a microscope) report 70 % neutrophils and 30 % lymphocytes. A mere laboratory result does not hold much strength especially like in your case when the total leukocyte count is normal and you report no other complaints such as malaise, night sweats and/or fever. However, if you have a concomitant enlarged lymph node and/or spleen to proceed with more specific tests such as flow cytometry to rule out chronic lymphocytic leukemia. But, anyway, the manual differential would have shown the presence of atypical, abnormal cells. Since it does report no atypia, this means that it is much less likely that there is a blood disorder (provided that no lymph nodes and spleen are enlarged and you have no complaints). I would suggest a regular, monthly blood count and differential tests and an abdominal sonography to check for the spleen. The changes in the blood counts can be just reactive to some condition. This could be autoimmune disorder such as thyroiditis or viral infection.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have reviewed your query and can understand how worried you are about your health. I understand you want an expert suggestion on vaping and how it affects our health. It looks like you are using e-cigarettes that may be a closed system which means they use their own refill systems. If you never smoked regular tobacco products or e-cigarettes, I would recommend never start vaping e-cig. It is not for beginners of any age, pregnant women, youth and young adults. If there is nicotine too, it is almost the same as the conventional tobacco cigarettes. The chemicals that help in making vapors (in the aerosol) are also not good for lungs. Diacetyl is a flavoring agent used in e-cig that is a culprit now known as a cause of lots of lung diseases. Cancer-causing chemicals are also found in the aerosol that is inhaled deep in lungs. Volatile organic compounds are lethal to the human body and can cause lung diseases and other bodily issues. Nickel, tin, and lead are frequently found in the inhaled aerosol. These are heavy metals known to be hazardous to our body. US center for disease control and prevention states clearly that many e-vaping liquid containers print that there is zero nicotine in them but they actually contain nicotine. Otherwise, the users would not use their products. It is a dangerous situation. Battery system explosion while charging the e-cig systems is not a rare phenomenon and a large number of cases have been reported. Using e-cig system at high voltage produces dangerous chemicals that sit deep in our lungs and can be harmful. If you were a regular smoker (conventional cigarette smoker) and are trying to quit smoking and have chosen e-cig as an alternative by yourself, I would suggest you consult a local physician about it instead. There are better options available. Hope this helps. Please feel free to ask more if you need further assistance. I would be happy to help.

We suspect it is a result of prostate laser surgery several years ago, but the doctor wants to rule out other sources of bleeding.

Ultrasound: I also read there is a new, safer contrast media using some type of \\"microbubbles\\" for use with ultrasound to detect blood flow. Questions:  From a diagnostic perspective, is it absolutely necessary to use contrast with the MRI's? Would ultrasound with contrast be of diagnostic value?  I appreciate any suggestions. It is very difficult for a patient to get knowledgeable answers to these types of questions. I had prostate laser surgery several years ago to improve urine flow with large prostate BPH. After surgery, I had visible blood in urine for nearly two months. Since then, I have been experiencing bleeding after exercise (for example, 5K run, tennis, basketball, etc.). Bleeding usually ends in few hours but recently experienced greater duration of bleeding.","Doctor":"Hi. Prostate MRI is one of the best noninvasive techniques to asses any condition of the prostate. Gadolinium is a contrast material used for better delineation of any suspected lesions. The chances of adverse effects are higher in people who have a kidney condition. However, you may proceed with a plain MRI of the prostate to get a basic idea of any lesion of the prostate and there is research showing that Gadolinium contrast is not absolutely needed for prostate MRI. b for evaluation of prostate. Transrectal ultrasound prostate may be done without contrast but gives less information than an MRI scan.

What does these report signifies especially the rubella quantitative IgG antibodies, and does it impacts the pregnancy cycle?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? To understand better let me give you few facts about the test. Rubella is a virus, which can affect anybody and the usual clinical presentation may be just a cold or maybe slightly higher respiratory infections with or without rashes. Everyone is exposed to this throughout life, as it might have been the last common cold you got last time. Also the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine everyone gets in childhood. Rubella infects only once in life. Next, if anyone gets any infection due to any bacteria or virus, etc, they immediately develop IgM (immunoglobulin M), which is body's immediate response. Then after few days, this replaced by IgG, which only means that sometime in past you had the infection. So her result of IgG high means she had rubella sometime in the past 30 years, not recently.  If you are still worried about the levels, just postpone pregnancy for next 2 to 3 months. Even if her IgM was high, she is advised to avoid pregnancy for next 2 to 3 months. By then her IgM values come down. So my advice would be to just forget about these unnecessary test, just go ahead and have a great pregnancy.

There is no apparent limitation to the range of motion. I have also experienced a bit of a stinging pain in and around the big toe joint. Pain occurs while wearing certain footwear. I have begun to supinate a bit to avoid the pain. The pain is before the joint more than the joint itself. No apparent swelling. When not using feet or not wearing footwear, there is no pain (unless I press). Last year's X-rays came up negative except for small heel spurs. As pain is more prominent in right foot, podiatrist only X-rayed the right foot. He said that he could not find a reason for the pain. I have asked him for a format report several times and have not received it after two weeks. Please note that foot had athletic tape wrapped around it just below the metatarsal joints, which seems to appear on the photos. I have compared both X-rays of the metatarsal joints (last year and this year) and can see no difference at all, except the shadow of the athletic tape near the first metatarsal joint. I know it is a shadow as in some of the pictures, you can see a three-dimensional shadow surrounding the toe. However, I am not a radiologist, but a philosopher. Your honest and professional opinion would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi. Most likely due to improper footwear here is asymmetrical joint space reduction involving the first and second metatarsophalangeal joint, relatively more in the great toe which might be the reason for your pain. Also, your foot radiographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity) do show few small osteophytes at the first metatarsal-phalangeal joint. However, no similar lesions are seen proximally at the tarsal-metatarsal region (area of your pain). No soft tissue abnormality is seen. Above changes are concerning for rheumatoid etiology. Take care. For more information consult a radiologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, This is regarding my father who is 58 years old. For the past two months, he has had a pain in both legs - down from the knee to the foot whenever he sits in his office room that has an AC. He says that if he sets the temperature to over 26 C, the pain recedes in about half hour. What could this condition be? This did not happen before and started only two months ago.","Doctor":"Hello. Bilateral knee osteoarthritis can cause this pain which can be affected by temperature. Also, the calf muscles attach at the back of the knee joint and go right till the heel. So pain of the knee can cause this. The other possibility is vitamin D deficiency along with vitamin B12 which causes sarcopenia and muscle weakness, also electrolyte imbalance can cause muscle pain. He will require the following: Follow up with reports.

We got are hemoglobin results back today. My wife's test results were positive. Ea, HbE trait with or without thalassemia. I would like to know if child's health could be a concern? Please help. Her grandmother has diabetes. Got it at an old age.","Doctor":"Hello. HbE trait will not pose any health problems to your child if he or she inherits it. Only the size of the red blood cells will be smaller than normal. The only worrying aspect is the fact that your wife might have the alpha thalassemia gene which might affect your baby. The inheritance of alpha-thalassemia is complex because the condition involves two genes: HbA1 and HbA2. People have two copies of the HbA1 gene and two copies of the HbA2 gene in each cell. Each copy is called an allele. Therefore, there are four alleles that produce alpha-globin, the protein that results from these genes. For each of the two genes, one allele is inherited from a person's father, and the other is inherited from a person's mother. So each person inherits two alleles from each parent. The different types of alpha-thalassemia result from the loss of some or all of these alleles. I would suggest that you both get yourselves tested for the genes involved in alpha thalassemia genes. If both of you are carriers, your child should also be tested either through chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis.

I have not played badminton for four years so the groin injury subsided by whenever my groin is stretched it is always tender and has a lot less range of motion compared to the other side. I took up squash a year ago and have been playing at quite a good or intense level five times a week. In the last week, I have had quite a bad hip pain on the same side as my old groin injury. The groin injury has not come back (i.e. jarring, pain, etc.) since starting squash but it has still remained a bit tender when stretched with less range of motion than the other side. The hip pain has started getting bad at night three days ago and affecting my sleep so I have therefore stopped playing. I have been doing resistance band exercises I found online for adductors, abductors, etc., with stretching groin, hamstrings, etc., but has not got better (although it has only been three days). It is a dull ache for most of the day which only goes if I take Ibuprofen and does seem worse at night. The hip pain is fairly central but more on the outside.","Doctor":"Hello. I have understood your concern about groin pain. See you need to give sufficiently enough time for healing of adductor muscles tendons, which is getting worsened by repeatedly stretching. No doubt that you need more range of motion, but the first choice is to promote healing and decrease the pain, so for that, you need to take physiotherapy treatment, like ultrasound with ice and laser therapy, which helps in healing. then gradually after 20 days, you may start with exercises.

In the process, we just rubbed our genitals against each other. Two to three days later, she has started feeling nauseous. She is complaining of pain in the breasts, pelvic pain and swelling in the vulva region. A pale white fluid has started discharging at regular intervals from the vagina. After some time, it was gelatinous. She is frequently complaining of abdominal cramps. I am worried whether she is pregnant.","Doctor":"Hi. Since there was no ejaculation, there is no chance of pregnancy. This could be because of hormonal changes or anxiety or physiological. There is nothing to worry about. So relax and do not worry. However, if you have a doubt, then get yourself checked by a gynecologist. For more information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I do not have morning sickness and no pregnancy-related symptoms except for hyperacidity which almost happened every day.","Doctor":"Hello. If an emergency pill is taken within the time limit, that is within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse then it is very effective in preventing pregnancy. But if your next period is delayed then pregnancy has to be ruled out. For that, blood hCG estimation can be done three weeks after LMP (last menstrual period). If you want to do urine hCG card test then get investigated after one week of thedelayed period.  Sometimes, high dose Progesterone in an emergency pill can delay period for a week. So, if your period is delayed for more than a week then urine hCG card test can be done to exclude pregnancy.

The bleeding that you had on 18th was your withdrawal bleed, but it was scanty because you took two emergency contraceptive pills in a gap of less than 48 hours. The urine pregnancy test is negative which is done today on 29th, rules out pregnancy. However, the best way to conclusively rule out pregnancy is a serum beta hCG test which if less than 3 mIU rules out pregnancy conclusively. Your next menses now is likely to be delayed, probably after 18th of the coming month, if we consider 18th as the day of your withdrawal bleed. This can again be correlated with an ultrasound pelvis which can show us the endometrial thickness.
