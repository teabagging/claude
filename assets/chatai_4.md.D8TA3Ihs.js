Now that we have brought her home they sent her with Oxycodone IR 80 mg and she immediately became a mental mess. She mumbles and is trying to pick up things that are not there and she can not answer anything. She is also on Morphine liquid and is to take a .25 on the syringe if she has pain in between the 4hr intervals of oxycodone. Anyway, I acted on my belief that she is over medicated or having a very bad reaction to oxycodone. Last night I did not give her the oxycodone but only gave her the morphine and gave it to her every 4 hrs. Before the 3rd dose would have been due it was like she woke up, she got out of bed went to the kitchen got something to drink and gave me very sensible intructions on what she wanted from the store. She has not been eating or drinking anything for a week and if she went to the bathroom it would take at least on hour just to get her down the hall because she would stop and try to pick up stuff that was not there. She made absolutely no sense at all. She couldn t hold a glass or eat. I asked her several times if she was in pain and she clearly replied no she was ok. So when her oxycodone was due again I gave it to her instead of morphine and she was once again out of her mind and not in this world. I do not want my friend in pain at all and I do understand that at this point, the point is to just make sure she is pain free. I want her pain free. I am aware that she will not be able to communicate before this is all over but I do not think this is the time. So, my question is what would cause her to have such a bad reaction to the oxycodone? Is it because her liver is not working right ? if that is it why don t the morphine mess her up like that? I just really believe she would not want to spend her last few months incapacitated if she didn t have to be. Please help me understand so maybe I can help her family to see she is not at that point yet.","Doctor":"Hi, dearI have gone through your question. I can understand your concern. She is in last stage of cancer. Morphine is the painkiller of choice in terminal stage cancer. Oxycodon is also a morphine derivative.  No need to worry about side effects.

Im going for triple ctscan to try to find the location. If found my sugeon wants me to get the surgery which is very drastic 7 hour surgery. What could happen if i do not get the surgery. Can the insulinoma get worst?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is important to know if you have a functioning insulinoma or non functioning tumor. Surgery for insulinoma requires complete preoperative work up and the surgery needs to be precise and specific. Locating the insulinoma requires both non invasive and invasive methods.If operation is not done then following treatment might be recommended. Medical management of insulinoma is generally restricted to high-risk candidates for surgery, those not suitable for resection or in those who have undergone an unsuccessful operation with persistent symptoms. Options include dietary management, diazoxide, calcium channel blockers and somatostatin analogues. Patients are advised to avoid prolonged fasting and to take frequent meals and snacks, including complex carbohydrates.Tumor localization procedures are characterized as noninvasive in the case of transabdominal ultrasound (US) and triple-phase spiral computed tomography (CT) of the pancreas and, in a few cases, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Invasive localization/ regionalization procedures like EUS (endoscopic ultrasound) and SACST (selective arterial calcium stimulation test) are used. With these techniques surgery has gained importance in the treatment of insulinomas. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Undergoing chemo 2x month...my second treatment was last Weds thru Fri.

These are strong medications and destroy abnormal cells. When acting on abnormal cells, few normal cells are also affected. These can cause symptoms like sweating, tiredness or fatigue with or without nausea. Sweating can also be present. These are mild side effects. However if fever is persistent and high then any other secondary infection must be investigated for and treated if present.It is good to maintain a temperature chart every 6 hourly and also have adequate amounts of fluids and healthy diet.If your temperature is consistently more than 100 degree Fahrenheit for more than a day then you should talk to your doctor and get treated.

I suggest you get your stools tested for occult blood till the time you have to wait to see your surgeon. If there is occult blood in stools and as you have strong family history therefore you should get a colonoscopy done.

The auto immune system also is connected to the white blood cell generation. Leukemia is a condition in which there is uncontrolled proliferation of immature white blood cells and this causes a high WBC count. During infections there is always a slight increase in WBC counts. However if the increase is more than 3 to 4 times normal and the patient has symptoms like fatigue, tiredness and generalized weakness then a diagnosis of leukemia has to be ruled out. The first step towards work up of possible leukemia is doing a peripheral blood smear. This is a simple test and done using a few drops of blood spread over a glass slide and seen under the microscope by the pathologist. This will show blast cells which are immature forms of WBC and then further detailed investigations are required."},{"Patient":"I was just diagnosed with reoccurent Papillary Thyroid cancer. two masses.

My endo doesn t think it is a problem. What doctor should I see about this issue.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.It is important to review your condition in detail with imaging findings. A 1 mm and 2 mm mass in lymph nodes is less likely to be a cancer. These are too small to be told apart and can also be seen in many benign conditions. This requires clinical examination by a surgeon and correlation with your scan report.Since you had a total thyroidectomy in 2010, it will help to know the scan findings in the post operative thyroid bed and know if there is any suspicious malignant process going on. In the absence of a recent mass or lymph nodes of considerable size in the area it is difficult to call it a recurrent cancer.You should consult a head and neck oncologist and discuss your report and get examined. If required further testing will be asked like a FNAC or nuclear scan. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hello, my wife has brain cancer (giobastma) and she has had surgery and chemo for 4 months.

What happens is that the brain is a complicated structure and when treating the cancer area, other areas are also affected. The nerve fibers are interconnected and in some places they are very closely placed such that the normal areas are affected. Having tremors in different parts are due to side effects of treatment. Some remote areas in brain might be getting stimulated leading to tremors. These will take time to resolve and she might also require medication that helps in nerve growth.

I have been dealing with painful bleeding for pretty much 2 years non stop. Why can t I just go ahead with the hysterectomy and end my suffering?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cell multiplications take place continuously in us from birth until we die. This occurs in a programmed and regular way. At times the DNA in the cell gets changes due to many factors in a single cell and it changes its features and subsequent multiplication of the abnormal cells causes a mass of abnormal tissue which is called a cancer.During transition for normal to abnormal, the cell goes through a transition period when it is neither completely normal nor fully abnormal. These cells retain features of both normal and abnormal cells. These are called precancerous cells.It is believed that you have these transition cells in your uterus and this might be causing your painful bleeding; the smear shows the presence of these cells.To be doubly sure about your condition, your doctor wants to do a D and C and then proceed with a hysterectomy. If hysterectomy is not done then the precancerous cells might transform into cancer cells and cause more discomfort and might become difficult to treat but confirmation i required before that.

Almost every patient of pancreatic cancer will survive for months or few years at most unless it is detected at early stage and resectable.The main concern right now for your wife is to control the rising bilirubin levels. What has happened is that the tumor in pancreas might be causing block in the biliary channels. This leads to collection oof wbile within the liver and biliary pathway. PTBD is a procedure by which the blocked bile will be drained through the skin and the bilirubin level is controlled. This is a safe and easy technique but might affect patient mobility due to insertion of tubes. There is another way called intrahepatic biliary stent placement. In this the biliary channels are approached with catheters and a stent is put in the area of maximum block. Following the procedure bile is drained through the normal opened passage and this reduces the symptoms."},{"Patient":"hi there i am male,23i am suffering from abdominal pain and burning sensation and i am feeling difficulty while urinating for the past one and a half year...my abdomen gets swell always as there is a big amount of urine retains in it..I am getting very less urine output everytym..so this is the reason for bladder swelling.i have gone through all tests like CUE, SERUM CREATININE, ULTRASOUND, CT SCAN, X-RAY,URINE CULTURE,URINE PCR for TB,etc..all the results are resulted as negative...plz help me","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query to H.C.M.

The doctor who did the biopsy said if it was a benign Schwanomma then it would be best to leave well alone. My doctor has said it should be removed. I am wondering which nerve it is on. Does the Vagus nerve go below the collarbone. How dangerous is it to leave it there? I have read that it will grow but how fast there is no way of telling. If it has to be removed, I guess it is better to have a smallish tumor removed than a large one.  Can you give me more information please. Thanks","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A schwannoma is a benign tumor that has got origin from schwann cells in a nerve. This tumor is in the collar bone area but the exact location can be known only if you have got a CT scan or MRI scan done. This usually does not cause pain but if it stets getting painful then surgery is recommended. Vagus nerve does not course along the collar bone but it is important to know anatomical details of your tumor before coming to a conclusion regarding the origin. The nerves supplying the arm form the brachial plexus and it passes close to the collar bone.It is important to do a detailed imaging investigation and also compare the symptoms of pain should you experience any and then go for surgical treatment. As there is no pain, you can get a MRI scan of the region and then discuss the findings. This will tell us if the schwannoma is arising around an important structure and will give rise to complications if left without surgery. If there are no important structures around the schwannoma and if the size is small then you can have the wait and watch approach. The tumor is usually harmless in most patients. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"my mother in law had operated for breast cancer some 4 years back. after radiation and chemotherapy she has developed tumor on shoulder, physician has advised 30mg morphine 6 times a day.can yoy explain the condition of the patient?  she is suffering from pain","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It will help to know the entire disease and treatment history in details. It is possible that there is a new tumor that has developed in the shoulder or there effects of radiation or chemotherapy which is giving her the pain. Cancer is a difficult disease to treat and the manifestations might be different in every patient. It is possible that in your mother in law, there is a tumor that is infiltrating the nerve supply to the arm or the nerves are getting pinched due to the chemotherapy and radiation effects. The main cancer and any spread to nearby areas is important when we discuss the condition of the patient. If she is not having any recurrent cancer in the operated area, opposite breast or the arm and shoulder then her condition can be called stable. Pain varies with every patient and appearance of pain can also be due to a benign cause in the absence of any cancer activity after treatment. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hi. I have Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and I believe my spleen is enlarged because I am having pain and discomfort on my left side by my ribcage. I also have diarrhea and was wondering if that could be a side effect of an enlarged spleen. Please give me an answer soon. Thanks","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Hope you are feeling better and continuing in your fight against your cancer. The spleen is an organ which is part of the immune system. It is located under the diaphragm on the left side. The pain you describe in the left upper abdomen might be due to an enlarged spleen. You should get an ultrasound scan done to see for the spleen size. The spleen grows from the left upper abdomen to the right lower abdomen and appears like a firm lump or mass. The pain might be due to spleen enlargement if present. However the diarrhea is unlikely to be due to the spleen.Commonest cause of diarrhea in patients taking treatment for leukemia is common stomach infections. Please consult your doctor and take a short course of antibiotics and eat healthy home cooked food. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My mother has breast cance and lymphoma.

She started to have pain in her abdomen. What is the best advise you could give? How long do people with her diagnosis live after pains start? Thanks!","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It will help to do an ultrasound scan and know where in the abdomen she is having pain Usually pains are due to underlying problems in abdomen like fluid collection or pressure on organs or nerve irritation. Some of these conditions can be treated if known. Pain can also be due to stomach infection or in relation to disease in organs like kidneys, live, spleen. Therefore it is important to give her higher dose of pain reliever and also treat any condition other than the cancer that is causing pain.In my opinion, it is best to do an ultrasound scan and know if the cause of pain is treatable and give medication for that.Pain and life expectancy are not comparable. Some patients might have severe pain but can still live a few years while many patients can have a downward course in days without much pain."},{"Patient":"Hello, Im writing from Latvia.

Then she has been diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma. Is the  thyroid cancer causing the right pleural effusion?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Your mother has been confirmed to have papillary carcinoma thyroid. Any cancer can cause generalized weakness in the patient and also lead to infections. A patient of cancer can easily get infections which a normal person will not have. In this case it looks like your mother is susceptible to infections as a result of cancer treatment that might include surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. During or after treatment the body becomes weak and even simple infections can affect any organ. In this way the lungs might have got affected and it led to fluid collection or pleural effusion. However it is important to know that in later stages papillary cancer of thyroid can spread to the lungs and that is the reason her doctors have done detailed investigation. If the pleural effusion is not responding to treatment then she might require repeat X ray chest or CT scan at a later stage."},{"Patient":"sir, i have soft tissue sarcoma in my right for arm last eight years. i have make it see many doctors in lucknow. but they are not able to treat it and still problem is not solved. can you give me some suggetion about this.         i can see my biopsy report ( Six time done), MRI report, MRS report, xray of my hand. ( i have all these reports).","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Soft tissue sarcoma in the arm is a type of cancer in the muscle. The main treatment of this tumor is surgical excision and this can be followed up by radiation or chemotherapy. This sort of cancer might have a locally aggressive form or might even spread to other areas. It is best to go through your reports of biopsy and MRI scan and then know the extent of the tumor. It will help to know if you have consulted any cancer surgeon and they have done any surgery earlier. Cancer treatment is not easy and in some patients every medicine available might have to be tried before getting a observable cure. Since you have the problem for 8 years and there is no other problem mentioned by you therefore it looks like a locally aggressive disease. I suggest you consult a cancer surgeon at a cancer institute and then discuss treatment options available depending on your disease extent and past treatment details. Wish you a quick recovery."},{"Patient":"Is it dangerous for a cancer patient to be near someone who has been vaccinated for shingles?

No treatment other than homeopathy and major change in diet - cut out most refined sugars etc. Used to drink up to five cokes a day. Is it usual to be so hungry and to constantly eat?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The human body requires meals adding up to 2000 kcal each day. It is best to have a heavy breakfast, moderate lunch and light dinner. In your case, since you are having a possible cancer in pancreas, the diet requirements might be slightly on higher side. Also you are taking small meals which number about 5 to 7 each day. This is fine as long your meals are healthy. During illness the brain signals the body asking for more energy and that is a possible reason for persistent hunger. It will help to know any increase in body weight that has happened. You can continue the treatment with homeopathy but regular scan must be done to know the position of the mass in pancreas. Since you have cut refined sugars, you can continue to have smaller meals with lots of fluids.

It also might also help to avoid eating or drinking 2 hours before you lie down. To help control the stomach acid one should not drink alcohol or drinks with caffeine in them or eat chocolates or spicy food, greasy foods. As omeprazole provide symptomatic relief , while ursodeoxycholic acid acts over liver and evion is Vitamin E .

Cancer symptoms of bowel includes sudden change in bowel habits like constipation or diarrhea. Some people also experience bleeding in stools. Unexplained loss of weight can also be seen in bowel cancer.Since you have found blood in stools more than once then you should get a detailed cancer screening examination done. I suggest you get your stools tested for occult blood till the time you have to wait to see your surgeon. If there is occult blood in stools and as you have strong family history therefore you should get a colonoscopy done. It will locate any abnormal areas of polyps which are precursors to colon cancer.

This means that there is a primary cancer somewhere which is the main problem. In this situation the doctors have to identify the primary site if not known. Many times primary site is not detected easily and then complete cancer workup has to be done.Treatment of a secondary with known or unknown primary is usually chemotherapy, radiation and pain relief. This has to be done at a good hospital and I think Guntur might have cancer treatment facilities in many hospitals. The cost varies ans it is good if she has health insurance. We cannot give a fixed cost but it is on the higher side like a few lakhs of rupees. However there are many cancer treatment concessions provided and you can utilize facilities for cancer treatment of your mother. After treatment life depends on the disease spread and response.

However this requires confirmation by tissue testing. This can be done by FNAC or biopsy. In this technique cells from the probable tumor are taken out using a needle and seen under the microscope. Under the microscope, we can know the features of cancer and if it is one. Many patients look normal from outside even with large tumor in the liver. Even liver function tests are normal and patient is unaware of the condition. The liver is an organ which regenerates its function and ieven with the cancer it is possible that the cells in rest of the liver are functioning properly.Please get your father tested for cancer by doing FNAC or biopsy at the earliest and if cancer is confirmed then discuss treatment at a good cancer center.

Since you have changes over to adapting a healthy lifestyle including food habits and exercises as described, your general health condition appears to be good. Also you have quit smoking and that is a positive development in reducing the chance of throat and lung cancer.Cancers can happen due to particular activation of cancer genes, some cancers might start after infection of viruses like HPV virus causing carcinoma cervix and hepatitis B causing liver cancer.

However, it will help to see the mole clinically and then make a confirmation. The size and growth of the mole in recent times is also important.If it is a small mole then I suggest you closely observe the mole by either asking your relative to check it every 3 months or take a picture and compare each time to see any changes in appearance.For larger moles it is better to consult a dermatologist and take a clinical opinion and if required a skin biopsy from the mole. This is a painless procedure and done to look for cells in the mole with signs of cancer.You can also get your mole removed completely by getting radiofrequency ablation sessions. This requires few sessions and is a permanent procedure done by the dermatologist.

Pain is a subjective sensation and no two people can experience the same degree of pain. In your brother, it is possible that the cancer in the esophagus is irritating surrounding sensory nerves that carry pain sensation. This pain is being transmitted to the higher center in brain and that is why he needs morphine to suppress it.A fight with cancer is allowed to go on as long possible.

I'd be very greatful for any advice.Victoria","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for posting on HCM,There are many possible causes of lower abdominal pain and the doctor examining need to consider the most common and focus on trying to rule them out. In most women I meet in my clinical setting, they usually turn to suffer from either diseases of pelvic origin which could be PID, fibroid/cysts (which you mentioned had already been ruled out), urinary tract diseases (could be cystitis, ureteritis, pyelonephritis, stones etc) and digestive diseases (could be infection, colopathy, inflammatory or irritable bowel, dyspepsia etc). So your doctor needs to run some tests aiming at trying to identify each of the above conditions (some will only be determined by excluding the others).As for the lump, I am suspected that you might be having hypogastric hernia (which could even explain the lower abdominal pain you could had been having). As strangulated hernia could present with stabbing pains that go on and off. In that case, your doctor will need to confirm this and perform a surgery to repair the hernia.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"hi my father has a stomach cancer stage 2 but i did allow him to take the chemo therapy but he feels better now , and he's not taking any medicine but some times he's having a hard time swallowing is this connected to his condition? actually doctor said he's food appetite should be back in two months after the major operation and he's is very good in eating lots of appetite even without vitamis","Doctor":"Hi, dearI have gone through your question.

If there is a small non functional tumor in you then treatment is not required. However periodic evaluation by doing scans is recommended to judge any increase in growth of the tumor.Basal pneumonia is infection of the basal segments of the lungs. The basal segments refer to lower lobe segments and you might be having pneumonia in one of the lungs involving the lower lobes basal segments. There need not be fever in every patient having pneumonia in the early stages. Some can only present with chest pain and discomfort and coughing.

In this technique, the artery or blood vessel supplying the tumor is approached as close to the tumor possible. This can be done by reviewing previous imaging investigations and once this is done, intra-arterial injection of chemotherapeutic drug combinations like doxorubicin, cisplatin and mitomycin into the hepatic artery, followed by lipiodol injection, Gelfoam for vessel occlusion and degradable microspheres. Once major blood supply to tumor is blocked and chemotherapy agents infused, then the tumor will not get its nutrition and will not grow or grow slowly.The pain is controlled by giving sedatives and not more than a puncture in the groin region.

Can a hystiocytoma become cancerous? . .","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.There is an entity known as malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), a type of sarcoma, is a malignant neoplasm of uncertain origin that arises both in soft tissue and bone. It is a malignant tumor by itself and has several sub types. This is seen in elderly population over 50 years age and rare in young people. Since your cancer testing is negative, it is unlikely to be a malignant form of histiocytoma.You might be having Benign fibrous histiocytoma (FH) is one of the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the skin. Several histologic variants of cutaneous FH have been described, some of which also have distinct clinical features including a propensity for local recurrence. It is important to note that rarely there might be metastasis in benign fibrous histiocytomas which contain atypical cells. Please discuss with your doctor."},{"Patient":"i have had itching and burning pain in my rectum for a year now.in the past 5 months i have a niggling pain on my right hand side. i dont have piles. and my gp is sending me to a bowel surgeon. but waiting time can be up to 16weeks. i fear this could be bowel cancer","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Chronic itching and burning in rectum can be due to a superficial skin infection or worms. Cancer of bowel will not cause only burning and itching in the area. Cancer symptoms of bowel includes sudden change in bowel habits like constipation or diarrhea. Some people also experience bleeding in stools. Unexplained loss of weight can also be seen in bowel cancer.Please be assured that you do not have bowel cancer if there are no specific bowel related symptoms. I suggest you get your stools tested for occult blood till the time you have to wait to see your surgeon. This test can be ordered by your GP and will show any invisible blood in stools. Most likely your occult blood stool test will be normal. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, My father who is 84 years old is suffering from  metastases of TCC. Currently he is asymptomatic. One Oncologist consulted wants to put him through chemotherapy. A second opinion from another Oncologist says that at this late point it is best to leave the patient untreated.  Need your advise. Also, if any treatment can be provided to avoid pain and suffering, i would like to know about the options","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Sometimes it can get difficult on deciding the treatment of a patient having cancer with metastasis like your father. Chemotherapy can prolong survival in TCC with metastasis. It is important to know accurate details of the tumor in bladder and metastasis location. If the patient is asymptomatic then it is possible to further extend his survival by giving chemotherapy. Chemotherapy agents that have shown activity in metastatic bladder cancer include paclitaxel, docetaxel, ifosfamide, gallium nitrate, and gemcitabine and these are promising as they extend the survival of the patient even with metastasis. I suggest you discuss in detail with the second oncologist and then take an informed decision.Pain relief is an important part in treating cancers and this assumes a greater significance in those with metastasis. Pain relief is given using a step approach an that much of pain relief is given which can allow the patient to stay in comfort. Pain relievers are usually opioids and controlled medications."},{"Patient":"i had blood in my urine with my uti. two weeks after drugs i had just a little pink so i called dr and he put me on a three day dose. he was an on call dr over the phon nd he said it could be bladder cancer   he scared me so much i am almost sick  i will be seeing my dr on thrus. ithink his comment was way out of line   do you?  this is my firat uti.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cancer of the urinary bladder is evaluated in a step wise approach.First there may or may not be blood in the urine. This is evaluated by doing an ultrasound scan of urinary bladder as a basic investigation. If there is any cancerous area withing the urinary bladder then it requires a cystoscopy. This is an investigation by which the inner lumen of bladder is directly visualised with the help of a fine tube like endoscope. If any mass is confirmed then a biopsy is also done and the material sent for pathological analysis to the lab.The pathologist in the lab will confirm if there is cancer on the suspicious area or not.If a cancer is confirmed then further detailed examination like CT scan, MRI scan and PET scan might be required to know the stage of disease.As this is your first UTI, please do not get worried and take treatment for your UTI first. Get the ultrasound scan done to clear doubts of any mass in the urinary bladder. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hi My name is Cheryl, I had a total thyroid ectomy in sept. I did have cancer. One day surgery turned into 2 days in intensive care then 6 more days in hospital. I still have stridor and possibly going to have my vocal cords injected. But today I started having pain on my left eide of myuper neck. What could cause that?","Doctor":"Hi, seems like you had recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy during surgery of thyroid. Hospital stay can also be because of hypocalcemia due to parathyroid gland insufficiency. Serum calcium level estimation will help in reaching to a diagnosis. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation will help over coming this. Pain in neck 8-10 days post surgery is can be because of some infection inside or an infected stich. Local examination of the area will help in finding the cause. If it is so, antibiotics will help resolving this. If this is long time since your surgery, muscular causes are usually the reason for  pain in neck. Pain killers and muscle relaxants will help in solving the problem.

I take adderral 10 to 15 mg every other day. I noticed that this discomfort is less to non existent when I don t take my medication. Does adderral trigger the pulsation a of those nerves to cause this discomfort on the left side? Also, does it have an impact on tumor growth?","Doctor":"Firstly, your symptoms are explained by the tumor location as these muscles are partly supplied by nerves arising from T3-4. Adderal on the other hand has no known triggering effect on the pain or on tumor growth. The tumor however will continue to grow and cause further problems. So I suggest you get it removed."},{"Patient":"yes a patient who had multiple myeloma and had his own cells used a year ago went back for a regular 3 month check up and the doctor said there was a protein spike and wants to see him in two months rather than 3 unless he has complaints then come right away. What is protein spike and what causes it?","Doctor":"A protein or M spike is one of the indicators of multiple myeloma. It is due to abnormal proteins being produced by the body as a result of the tumor. The presence of M spike indicates that the tumor has returned and that you will need further investigations and treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi my mum was diag. with breast cancer 4 years ago and on every check up, she was told everything was fine a year and a half ago the scans had no sign of cancer, 3 weeks ago she had more scans and now the cancer is in her bones and lung, my mum is 81 years old. now she is on medication AROMASIN, I would like to know how affective is this medication, we were told 75 cent, does that mean to stop the cancer from spreading or eventually cure her, we would like to go and get another opinion , what do you think. My sister died of pancreatic cancer 6 years ago and I know how much she suffered, I would like to know shouldn t my mum have radiotherapy, thank you","Doctor":"Firstly, there is no role of radiotherapy except if the bony metastases are painful (to reduce the pain). Secondly, at her age and stage (stage 4), it is impossible to cure the disease. The aim now should be to prolong her life and keep her comfortable. For this aromasin is a good option as it is well tolerated and keeps the disease under control. It does not cure the disease.

Diarhhoea is a common side effect of the drug and is normally not worrisome. If it is excessive you can try giving Tab loperamide at bedtime. Else, you might have to discontinue the drug in consultation with your oncologist."},{"Patient":"I am missing my left lung due to a cancerous tumor exactly 7 years ago.

It seems that in the last few months I am becoming much more uncomfortable after slight distress, such as climbing stairs.

The shortness is probably due to some abnormality in the remaining lung like an infection or spasm. You should consult a respiratory physician and get it checked out."},{"Patient":"I am a 47 year old male diagnosed last year with B-cell Follicular Lymphoma last year.

I am wondering if the chemo will affect seminal fluid/ sperm count/ fluid discoloration... basically anything such as male sexual side affects. Otherwise, where would you suggest that I look, please? Thank you very much.","Doctor":"All chemotherapy drugs lead to reduction in sperm counts. This reduction is permanent in some cases. Since you already have started chemotherapy long back, there is no question of sperm banking. It however, does not reduce your potency, and you can have a normal sex life.

Oncologist advised to only limit carrying and lifting with left arm. Are there any other precautions I should take (restrict physical activity, travel plans, diet changes, sex life)?","Doctor":"Actually, the main precaution that you should take is not to miss your medicine as prescribed by your doctor and not to discontinue without his advise. Restrict physical activity of the left arm, but otherwise continue your daily routine activities. Infact, include some form of excercise in your routine, such as walking, if your health permits.

I ve had stomach problems since last Tuesday, consisting of nausea , vomiting , and diarrhea . I mostly took Pepto Bismol to deal with it. When it started there wasn t much pain but the pain has gotten terrible. Sunday night I was in such pain I went to a 24 hour CVS where the pharmacist recommended Zantac , it helped and I was able to sleep. However, it doesn t seem to help with the pain anymore. I went to an urgent care facility yesterday since my doctor s office was closed, at first my blood pressure was through the roof--the nurses words--so the doctor gave me IV fluids as well as IV pepcid and zofran as well as a prescription for zofran. This morning I unexpectedly had diarrhea--I was in the shower, felt like I was passing gas but instead a large amount of diarrhea came out. When I was cleaning it up, most was brown, but a small amount was red. Between the pain and the possibility of blood in my stools, I m wondering if I should go to the ER tonight. I have an appt with my Dr. tomorrow but the pain is really bad right now and I m wondering if I ll be able to sleep. Thank you for your advice.  Edit:  Went to ER, then to my regular Dr next day.

The doctor prescribed me with Lopamide, Dolopar and Recoup for hydration. The stools and fever stopped on the second day but the stomach pain persisted and I thought it was normal and after one or two days. But the lower abdominal pain persisted and in addition to that I developed urinary tract infection. A relative of mine suggested that may be I had bacterial infection and asked me to take Norflox. So I took norflox and the stomach pain reduced but I started developing allergic swellings all of a sudden around 4 to 5 inches in my thighs and it was also paining. The next day I went to the doctor and he prescribed cefixime, xyzol, flavomed and cyra. But this were things got worse. The allergic swelling grew in numbers all around my legs and thighs and it was more painful than itchy. I felt the pain when ever I stretched the legs and I felt like the skin was tight around those spots because of the swellings. So the next day Hydodoctor stopped cefixime  and flavomed but asked me to conitue the other 2 along with Methyl Prednisolone twice and he gave me Hydrocortisone injection.But there was very little relief and it started to get worse and the next day he stopped all the medicines except Methyl Perdisolone and gave me 8cc of Hydrocortisone injection and he started to suspect vasculities and auto immune . So he tested my serum creatinine, urea , sugar levels, CRP Levels and ANA. The tested revealed that  my sugar levels were normal but I had infection along with high CRP levels. So he sent me to a dermatologist. The dermatologist told me that I had chronic Urticarial Vasculities. I asked her if that was auto immune problem. She told me that she would tell me once the all the blood test are redone along with LFT, RFT, CBC and ANA.There are 2 other important things to note that I have had this urticaria problem from Jan 2013 when my wife was sick in the hospital with many serious problems and she died. She had Tuberclosis in the uterus (don't know if it spread to other parts- hydrosalphinx) , Veno Occlusion Diesease of liver, Auto Immune Hepatitis,Liver Failure , Ulcerative Collities and she got infected with CMV ,Pnuemonia Skeibella in the hospital. I was in the hospital for nearly 90 days that's when I got this allergic reactions. So after my wife death I did a master health checkup done in a big hospital and they said my liver functions were normal and prescribed medicines for urticaria. There was no permanent relief and it would come on go mostly in the evenings and noghts. So I went to a allergy clinic and they tested me for several items and prescribed me with immunotherapy drugs (2cc after every 2nd day)and allergens and gave me a big list for foods to avoid. There was almost everything which I ate like and mostly proteins,pepper, milk etc. But the therapy treatment also didn't give permanent cure. It would be good one day the next it will not give relief .So after 2 months I stopped taking them and started eating normal diet.  After sometime I made up my mind to not worry and would apply caldryl lotion if I developed the  rashes along with allegra or fexofinadine. It suddenly stopped I was free from it for nearly 2.5 months until last week. But the nature of the allergy now is  different from the previous one because. The previous one was more like rashes even though it would come up in all possible places, but this time there is swelling and I have pain as well as itching. Last month around 25th august I had loss of appetite along with yellow colour urine and giddiness so I did a urine culture and it revealed Escherichia Coli infection colony count >100,000 so I was asked to consult an urologist . He gave me urifast, nosdol and chitralka and asked me to come for kidney scan but he was not available after that time and so I didn't take the scan. For giddiness I met the ENT in the same hospital and he gave me Aceclofenac, Almodac 2.5mg, Alprax and Cobadex CZS. I took that for only 2 or 3 days if I remember correctly.Now i want to know whom should I consult . Is chronic urticarial vasculities a serious threat and is there anyway I might end up with Auto Immune Disorder like SLE. If so what is percentage of survival. Is there by any chance that my kid(5 yrs) and my mom 76yrs will also get infected with the disease. Sorry for the big explanation I don't know which part to tell and not which part to leave out. Thanx in advance.","Doctor":"Hi, It is good to follow-up with your allergist, and rheumatologist. Furthermore, I would recommend to do the urine test again to exclude the relapse of infection and get proper treatment.

You  have talked to several that have used this treatment with good results ,It is encouraging . You should certainly go for it  . Using insulin in IPT, the end result is that the low dose chemotherapy gets channeled specifically inside the cancer cells, killing them more effectively, while greatly reducing, and in most cases eliminating the possibility of chemotherapy side-effects. The innovative advantage to IPT is that it kills cancer cells by using the very same mechanisms that cancer cells use .As studies show , per cell, cancer has sixteen times more insulin-sensitive receptors than normal tissues. As ligand effect is a function of receptor concentration, these facts serve to differentiate cancer from normal cells – a vital consideration for the safety of cancer chemotherapy.

He is already on medications to treat prostate enlargement.If there is no improvement then I would suggest a uroflometry test to decide whether he needs surgery to correct his urination problem.As far his constipation is concerned, it may be again age related.A stool occult blood test and a colonoscopy test are to be done.He can take high fiber diet and continue taking miralax.Was that helpful?"},{"Patient":"My wife and I recently visited our dermatologist and a biopsy was taken from my wife’s nose. The test results were positive and the Dr. has scheduled an appointment to discuss the cancer. This appointment is scheduled for 3/28. My wife asked what type of cancer this was and was told fibro-nic-oma. I can not find information on any cancer that sounds like this. She was told that it was not carcinoma or melanoma. Her nose appears to have no sores just puffiness at the lower portion. Though the biopsy was taken from the outside surface of the nose she has complained about the inside nostrils having scabs (scabs appearing after the biopsy). Can you give me any information on what type of cancer this might be? I would like to research it before we visit the Doctor.","Doctor":"Hi, dearI have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.There is no any cancer name fibro-nic-oma. You should consult your doctor and ask for perfect name. There is some spelling mistake or misunderstanding in the name of cancer. Get the correct name and tell me. I will provide all details.Hope I have answered your question, if you have any doubts then contact me at bit.ly/Drsanghvihardik, I will be happy to answer you.Thanks for using health care magic.Wish you a very good health"},{"Patient":"Hi. I am twenty five. I have been trying to conceive for almost a year now with no luck. I have just recently been diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer. They have removed the right side of my thyroid where the cancer was and I am returning for surgery again next week when they will remove the left side of my thyroid. They are then going to start me on 100mg of eltroxcin. I am wondering if my fertitilty issues had anything to do with having thyroid cancer or will my fertility chances improve once I am on eltoxcin?","Doctor":"Firstly, your fertility issues had nothing to do with the development of this cancer. Also, the treatment being done is correct and scientific. Finally, the removal of thyroid will only adversely affect your fertility issues as you will become hypothyroid. Taking eltroxin will make you normal but the fertility issues will remain. Also, when you get pregnant, the dose of the eltroxin will need to be adjusted frequently."},{"Patient":"My husband is suspected of having pancreatic cancer, but I am somewhat unsure of all the information we have been given. He has been quite ill lately, but the only overt symptoms are the presence of a 3-4 cm mass on his pancreas which is blocing the bile duct, resulting in elevated liver functions, rash and itching with jaundice. He feels fine every other way and has no pain or other issues. An ERCP with stent was done and labs are improving. The surgeon plans to proceed with a Whipple procedure as soon as his liver function is in the normal range, but I wonder if we should get a second opinion before proceeding. Please tell me what you think. Thank you, Charlotte Newsome","Doctor":"Please do not worry about second opinions. Your treatment so far and the plan ahead is all scientific and correct. Pancreatic cancer causes pain and other symptoms only in the late stages when it goes beyond the confines of any treatment. Luckily for you, your husband's cancer got detected in time. At this stage it does not cause any pain. Also, the only curative treatment for this cancer is surgery (Whipple's). It is a major surgery but as I said there is no other option. If your husband is fit for this surgery then he should undergo it. It was deferred earlier due to the jaundice."},{"Patient":"I have been having treatment for cervical cancer radiation, chemo and internal radiation.

Good evening.

Till then, I would advise you for a proton pump inhibitor, an anti spasmodic, and possibly a broad spectrum antibiotic for a symptomatic relief.

It is not due to her disease per se. All known chemo therapies are known to produce these side effects in varying degrees.

Also, it can cause infection of the bladder area leading to these symptoms. Eventually the size reduces and the patient is relieved. Important thing is to know if the disease is under control.

I am a Gastroenterologist (DM).Elevation of lipase more than three times the normal limit level is cosidered to be significant.

Will this continue even during radiation. Thanks Padma","Doctor":"The problems that you are facing are the side effects of this chemotherapy and will go after the chemo is topped. During chemotherapy you can a multivitamin supplement and maintain a healthy nutritious diet in order to ameliorate these symptoms somewhat. Radiotherapy will not lead to any such symptoms as it only lead to problems localized to the chest wall."},{"Patient":"Yes, Thank You. I was diagnosis with ovanian cancer. in 2012 and was cancer free for all this time. Now I find out that it has returned as many tumors. It is a rare type called an yolk sac tumor even rarer because I am 62 years old. Can you explain this to me?","Doctor":"You are right. Yolk sac tumor tumor at your age is quite rare as it mainly affects young women. So first thing you should do is to make sure you have the right diagnosis. If you are showing at a standard cancer center then its alright, else take a second opinion from one. If it indeed is yolk sac tumor and it has come back, then the best option for you will be to have chemotherapy and then if there is any residual disease after that then to undergo surgery."},{"Patient":"Hi. My father is in the later stages of prostrate cancer and is under hospice care. They just tried the morphine patch which he was allergic to. He now has the hiccups that are coming and going constantly for the last 2 days. He is having trouble taking all the other medicine that he is on because of the hiccups. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"There could be a number of reasons for his hiccups. It could be because of the disease or the medications themselves may have left a lasting side effect. You can try giving him Tab. Perinorm one tab thrice daily for 4-5 days. If he cannot take even that then give him injections by the same name. That should help."},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma 3 years ago. I had bilateral mastectomies and was given Arimidex. I am also seeing a naturopathic oncologist and he has me taking 12 mg Coriolus (powdered Mushrooms) per day. Research has shown that mushrooms are a natural aromatase inhibitor. I also take 5000 iu of D-3 daily and grape seed extract. I am just wondering how necessary the arimidex is considering all the side effects.","Doctor":"Actually, the only scientifically proven treatment that you are taking at present is Arimidex. The rest, including the naturopathy is all experimental and unproven. I am assuming that your estrogen and/or progesterone receptor status was positive. It is mandatory then that you take this drug non-stop for 5 years. Please do not omit this drug as it is the only thing that is preventing your cancer from returning"},{"Patient":"I m having pains in my right ovary. From 1-10 the pain is a 6. A few days ago I had blood in my stool. There was no itching or irritation afterward, after the bm. So, hemorrhoids are out of the question. I m afraid I could have either ovarian or cervical cancer.","Doctor":"Firstly, ovarian or cervical cancer rarely if ever presents with blood in stools. Secondly, itching or irritation is not mandatory in case of hemorrhoids. So, please do not jump to conclusion. The best course of action will be to show your self to a general surgeon who will take a proper history and examine your anus and rectum. If there are any hemorrhoids, he will see them and treat them, else he will advise you further investigations to ascertain the cause of your bleeding. He will probably then order a colonoscopy."},{"Patient":"I had a ct scan and it is indicated that the duodenum wall is thickening. I know this is not common and a visit to a gastro doctor came with an answer of two distinct possibilities -- inflammation or tumor like a donut that is closing. I am not keeping any solid food down - no pain or nausea. Will have endo scope tomorrow with then a visit most likely to a surgical oncologist. Is it a high risk of cancer?","Doctor":"At this point it is difficult to be certain. Duodenal cancers generally present as a mass rather than just thickening. An endoscopy will definitely tell the presence of any overt cancer and also biopsy it for confirmation. If the endoscopy is normal, then you should take some antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs for 2 weeks and then repeat the scan. Another option is to get a PET scan done now. I would suggest the former."},{"Patient":"I had a nodule removed from my right forearm. Earlier diagnosed as a picker s node or something like that but after removal, there was a final diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma, nodular, with fibrosis. The dermatologist wants to do Mohs surgery on it now. However, I had a second opinion and this dermatologist suggest that this does not constitute or fulfill criteria for Mohs…however, it does need to be removed. Can I wait because I cannot afford Mohs?","Doctor":"Firstly, you do not need MOhs surgery. Mohs is reserved for skin cancers that are present in an area where you want to remove minimum skin such as the face. On the forearm this is not a concern and a simple wide excision of the skin around the nodule with a 1 cm margin is all that is required. However, it is mandatory that you undergo this excision else the cancer will return."},{"Patient":"I had a CBC with diff 3 weeks ago wbcs were 11.4 repeated yesterday wbcs 14.7 no sickness except high bp 130s over 90s that was the reason I went now my doctor who I ve only deepen once wants me to go see a hematologist I think of lukemia when hematologist is mention any thoughts","Doctor":"Please do not be worried. Such rise of WBCs is normal for any infection in the body and a course of antibiotics for 5 days should suffice. Get a repeat CBC after that and if the WBCs are still rising or if there are any abnormal looking WBCs on the smear then contact a hematologist. the picture you have portrayed hardly fits in with a diagnosis of leukemia"},{"Patient":"my son has a large lump on the bottom of his calf when he was 5 or 6 they said just keep an eye on it if it gets bigger have it checked out well he is 11 went in for his 6th grade shots and they said it is a tumor it has gotten bigger with his age but not outgrown his size or you could say it is no bigger than his muscle has grown the insurance wont do the MRI with out the X-ray first and the DR said it is fleshy and the x-ray wont show anything and he does not want to put radiation on it - if this is cancer should we just do a biopsy","Doctor":"It is best to undergo a needle test first called FNAC. If this confirms or shows suspicion of cancer then you can think of a biopsy and even this can be done with a thick bore needle (called corecut biopsy). This will conclusively tell whether this is cancerous or not. It doesnt appear cancerous though based on its slow rate of growth over so many years. Cancers generally grow much faster."},{"Patient":"what are the exact symptoms of oral cancer i think i have some yellow fungus in my tongue and sometimes it turns white but i think its because of something like a toothpaste i think i can remove it by following a good oral huiguene but s sometimes it scares me i went to 2 dentists and a school doctor and they told me nothing or don't worry about it","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. If you can scrape it easily, then it is probably not oral cancer.2. Try to maintain good hygiene. 3. If not sure, biopsy of lesion can be taken for histopathological confirmation or scrape can be taken for cytological examination.4. As there are no masses, do a scrape test.

I can understand your concern  .THE  CAUSES of low sodium , known as hyponatremia may be many . But apparently  it  may be  outcome  of  - cirrhosis of the liver , congestive heart failure , nephrotic syndrome in the kidneys  & massive edema of any cause &Diuretic medicines, which increase urine output . Radiation and other therapies also have good or bad impacts on our blood counts .Too little sodium in the diet alone is very rarely the cause of hyponatremia, although it can promote  indirectly .A low sodium level in the blood may result from excess water or fluid in the body, diluting the normal amount of sodium so that the concentration appears low.  Normal level of sodium in blood is 135 - 145   your mother's level is 120 ,which not very low and is managable  with drip followed by  proper diet control .suggested by your phisycian  .Sodium is found mostly in the body fluids outside the cells. It is very important for maintaining blood pressure. Sodium is also needed for nerves, muscles, and other body tissues to work properly.Chronic hyponatremia can lead to such complications as neurological impairments . Therefore, emergency care is necessary for patients with altered mental status, confusion, or lethargy or those who have had a seizure or cannot be wakened.The treatment of low sodium depends on the underlying cause and as per  the patient's blood volume status , intravenous administration of normal saline (salt) is usual, care being taken not to raise the serum sodium levelPrevention is important with respect to hyponatremia. It is important to respect the thirst mechanism to help decide about adequate hydration.little exercise ,pranaya -deep breathing &healthy nourishing  diet  conaining all essential nutrients will  lead her to healthy &  blissfull life ahead  .It is suggested to consult your doctor for proper guidanceHope this helps solves your query .Take care .All the best .Get well soonDon't hesitate to get back if have any further query ."},{"Patient":"hello i have been dig.with polycythimia vera i have had a rash n my arm since i was alittle girl to day i was looking at som old lad reports one was dated in 2003 i had high levels of plts, and white and red why did they nt tell me i had trouble back then now my question is ihave read that i can excpect to live 10 to 15 yrs  how do i found  out how much time i have ?im feeling worse all the time","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Polycythemia vera is a condition characterized by increased hemoglobin levels due to increased production. Its a chronic condition.2. Patient can survive for a longtime with appropriate treatment for polycythemia vera like hydroxyurea, phlebotomy and apheresis.3. Further change into a acute myeloid leukemia is the major risk and needs to be watched closely. 4.

HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN OUT OF NO WHERE","Doctor":"Its an unfortunate situation and am sorry to say that there is nothing that can be done to completely cure it. The entire treatment will now be aimed at making her as comfortable as possible and to prolong her life. You will need to get a needle test done first to ascertain the type of tumor she has. Thereafter she needs to be put on chemotherapy if she can tolerate. At the same time she will need to start something for her pain. This will have to start with oral painkillers and escalated as and when required."},{"Patient":"Hello Doc, My name is Rana. I am doing a biology research in school about monoclonal antibodies, and I was hoping you can help me in it if you can. my questions are : How monoclonal antibodies can help in cancer therapy? and how does this therapy work? Since when this therapy had been used and how many people improved or were cured because of it? Thank you","Doctor":"Hi Rana. All cells in the body have a large number of receptors present on the surface and inside the cell. These are necessary for their normal functioning. Cancer cells utilise some of these receptors to enhance their growth and stay immortal. So we as oncologists have started to use these receptors for treating cancer by blocking these receptors. That is done by using monoclonal antibodies and is called targeted therapy. It was started in the 90s with a drug called imatinib. Now there is a plethora of such drugs available and are used in a variety of cancers and are working wonders."},{"Patient":"Hi, my mother has just been diagnosed with cervical cancer, we are awaiting the stage result.

I am 27 year old female.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.Cancers can be hereditary and runs in family. But it is not always true. But chances of cancer is high if family history of cancer is positive.You can do annual health check up every year to detect cancer early.Health check up should contain1. Chest x ray for lung cancer2. PAP smear for cervical cancer.3. Ultrasound examination of abdomen to rule out liver, stomach and kidney cancer.4. Routine blood investigation like CBC (complete blood count) to rule out blood cancer.So consult your nearby hospital and discuss about these tests.You can also get done genetic testing but very few centers are doing this. No need to worry much as all offsprings don't develop cancer."},{"Patient":"My uncle is having various health problems that are being diagnosed.

Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello dear,thanks for your question on HCM.Yes, you are right about cancers giving knot under skin. It is known as spread of cancer in the skin. And many cancers cause this. The common ones are liver,lung,kidney and breast cancer.So possibility of cancer spread in skin in your  uncle's case is high as He is having liver cancer.So better to get done biopsy of the skin lesion and get done histopathological examination to diagnose its cause.If it is malignant than your uncle is having stage 4 liver cancer. And it is having poor outcome."},{"Patient":"my father in law had a heart transplant  4 years ago...now his test results came back saying he has prostate cancer , and has tripled in 6 months.

In blood malignancy immunity of the patient is very compromised. And chemotherapy makes it even worse.So these patients are at great risk of infection. In such patients infections tend to stay longer and chances of resistant or uncommon infection are more.So possibility of Fungal infection, tubercular infection or parasitic infection is high.Since you are having chronic lung infection , fungal and tubercular infection appears more .Better to consult pulmonologist and get done bronchoscopy and BAL (Bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis to find out the causative organism and start appropriate treatment."},{"Patient":"hi thereI am 30 years old and a month ago i noticed my left breast increasing in size, it felt heavy and achey, any how i went for a mammo and no lump was found only fibrograndular architecture of the breast was found, to date my left breast has grown more and i am now finding it hard to tuck it into my bra it just overflows i have had 3 children and a subtotal hysterectomy, the size does not increase or decrease during the month it just gets bigger.my aunt on my moms side has had breast cancer on both breast years apart, my other aunt had cancer and my grandfather also had testicalur cancer. my breast also pops up with bruises for no reason at all","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.If mammogram is clear and no evidence of lump than no need to worry much about breast cancer.Breast enlargement can be seen in hormonal imbalance or due to drugs like birth control pills.So better to consult gynecologist and get done hormonal study.If any abnormality is there, start its correction.I advice you to get done regular mammography annually to detect early breast cancer if at all developing as you had family history of breast cancer.

How are you?Brief answer: It is common to have persistent vomiting during treatment of cancer.Detailed answer: During the course of cancer chemotherapy it is quite common to have vomiting as most of the anti cancer drugs are highly emetogenic ( capacity to induce vomiting). This most common side effect of anti cancer drugs can be prevented by giving an effective drug which can control the vomiting....i.e. ONDANSETRON which is given along with the anti cancer drugs. The effect of vomiting persists as long as the anti cancer drugs are found in the blood once the treatment is completed the vomiting will also subside and the appetite will also improve.

He also removed a few precancerous polyps deeper in my colon. Stains in underwear seem to be getting progressively worse.

Im 21 years old and I'm 5' feet..and i weight 145 .","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.First of all, no need to worry at all for breast cancer. So stop thinking about breast cancer as your age is too young for cancer. And pain is not a feature of breast cancer.Squeezing of nipple if forcefully done can itself cause pain without any disease. Other causes for nipple pain are infection, irritation, hormonal changes etc.So no need to worry at all for cancer.You are not having cancer for sure.

And this goes true with esophageal malignancy.So to determine staging in his case following investigation s are needed.1. CT scan of neck to see for local extent of disease.2. PET scan to see for distal spread of disease.If distal spread is present then it is known as stage 4 cancer and it carries poor prognosis. Life expectancy is less than 1 year. Only palliative chemotherapy and radiotherapy is given.In the absence of distal spread surgical removal of esophagus with clear margin is the treatment of choice. Post operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy is given to prevent local as well as distal spread. In these cases life expectancy is less than 5 years.Overall esophageal malignancy is not having good prognosis because of poor feeding issues after surgery."},{"Patient":"i am 27 yrs old and have just recently noticed when i pull my bottom lip down that i have a dark brown line going across my gum its in the middle to about quarter ways down my gum its not around my teeth. but i am worried thats its something very serious or could be cancer even.i have started using a teeth whitener while tanning about a month or so ago and was wondering if it could be that or if maybe it caused my gums to tan or something i know that sounds crazy but i dont know what else could have caused this because i have pretty good teeth","Doctor":"A brown line on the gums is usually insignificant.

The fact that you have not felt any better after receiving this treatment of a possible UTI and the feeling of a foreign body warrants a doctor's visit.I would like you to meet with an OBGN and get examined.

I have to say my oral hygiene hasn t been up to par due to my simply feeling crappy from the chemo. So, does the problem inside my lips sound like a result of the chemotherapy or could it be some sort of a periodontal disease caused by my intermittent brushing? — John in Sacramento","Doctor":"Chappy lips is a very common side effect of most chemotherapy drugs and is a result of poor oral intake and vitamin deficiencies.

However, if you find the procedure too distressing or painful, then you will require sedation which can be given with fentanyl with or without versed.

So, I have no idea why you have been placed on this drug as it has nothing to do with the treatment of uterine or any other cancer.

Where is the metastatic cancer and where did it start from. These are the 2 main factors that will determine his outcome.

So get a repeat serum TSH after 15 days of the altered dose and adjust the dose accordingly. Also get a serum calcium done as this may be low which can happen after thyroidectomy.

It is a very aggressive cancer and resistant to all forms of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. So, if by any surgical plan it is possible to take out the entire disease then you should undergo it without delay else it will soon spread and go beyond the scope of surgery.

However, there are other non-cancerous conditions that can cause thickening and discharge. These are benign endometrial hyperplasia and endometritis. These will become clear after the  D&C report comes."},{"Patient":"hi sir/ ma'am....i am 20 year old and musterbating from last 7 years. some times twice ,even thrice but normally once per day.

I also have a pimple type structure on my penis since my childhood. It is below the lip type structure, where skin is atteched to the penis. Is it a cancer? what should i do?","Doctor":"First of all, masturbation does not lead to any physical or medical problems and never causes cancer. Of course excess of it can lead to psychological problems and so should be avoided in excess. Otherwise there is no harm doing it. As to the pimple, if it is painless and not increasing in size, then you should not worry about. If there are doubts then it is best that you show it to a surgeon."},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with prostate cancer 6 months ago.

What's going on?","Doctor":"The symptoms that you are having are due to enlargement of the prostate gland which sits around the urinary outflow system. It can thus lead to urgency, increased frequency, burning, blood in urine etc. These symptoms will improve after your treatment starts and the gland decreases in size."},{"Patient":"Will eating brazil nuts help a stage 4 liver cancer patient Who isunder treatment with drugs with no positive. Indications of success. The patient is up and around with weakness and tiredness and has been given a different drug a couple of months ago that helps increase appetite.

It will not help you further.Instead of all these,you should start palliative treatment in the form of1. Pain treatment like centrally acting pain killers (opioids)2. Nutritional support in the form of supplemental iron,vitamins, calories,carbohydrates, protein etc.3.

My mom has been suffering from a rare form of muscle tumors called leiomyosarcoma for the a long time now. Surgeons have all said that there is no cure or nothing we can really do except try and take it out whenever it comes back, which it has at least twice a year for the past 10+ years. I know people who have lived with cancer all of their lives, and they would smoke medical marijuana. Studies have shown that medical marijuana stops cancer cells from growing and spreading. Could smoking medical marijuana be beneficial to my mother while she fights this ongoing struggle with leiomyosarcoma?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion she can try medical marijuana, as nothing else is working well in her case.Its effect is decreasing pain,rather then decrease cancer cell growth.So this can give good feeling subjectively.She can also try transdermal patch of fentanyl. It is centrally acting opioid drug. Its action lasts for 72 hours. So better and longer pain relief can be achieved.So she can take medical marijuana. Also ask her to try transdermal patch of fentanyl."},{"Patient":"About 5 years ago I was told I had the beginning stages of cervical cancer. I was young and stupid and didn t do anything about it.

I don t want to call it a pain, because it doesn t really hurt, it just makes me uncomfortable.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Cervical cancer carries excellent prognosis if early detection and surgery is done.Since its been five years from the diagnosis, I think your cancer must have grown locally and spread to distal organs too.So your present symptoms are mostly due to local worsening of cancer. May be ulcer or mass or prolapse can cause you symptoms.In depth gynecological examination is needed to rule out local disease.You should also get done biopsy of cervix, abdominal CT scan,PET scan to diagnose staging of cancer.So better to consult oncologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"Hi there, my mother has had chemo & radiation treatment .. her last one was July 17th.

Nor do the medicines that you have written she is on. So, there could be a number of reasons for her paleness. First could be a poor oral intake. If that is the case then that would explain it. Otherwise it could be due to the tumor bleeding inside. in which case an endoscopy and ablation of the bleeding will be required. Also, in this case she may have black colored stools or blood in the vomitus. First, get a hemoglobin estimation done and if it low then follow the above algorithm."},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed this Thursday with Stage I uterine cancer (after a uterine biopsy). I have an appt scheduled with the cancer team at Bethesda Naval Hospital on Monday. On Tuesday of this week I was called in for spot mammography and breast sonogram sfter my annual mammogram came back suspicious for cancer in my left breast. The spot mammo and sonogram were rated BI-RADS 4 by the radiologist. The radiologist came in while I was still on the bed from the sonogram and told me I needed a biopsy. I am waiting for my consult for the biopsy on May 2nd. My question is IF I do have breast cancer, how are breast cancer and uterine cancer treated when they are present simultaneously? NOTE: I am 58 (59 on May 22nd) and post-menopausal since 2004. I had a D&C for fibroids in 2006, no problems since. My mother had bilateral masectomies at about age 60.","Doctor":"Both breast and uterine cancer will have to treated based on their respective stages. So, first we have to rule out any metastases from either of these tumors. For this you need to get an ultrasound abdomen, a chest x-ray and a bone scan. If both these tumors are localised and early then the treatment for both is surgery and both surgeries can be done at the same time. Further treatment will depend upon the biopsy report of the removed specimens."},{"Patient":"My daughter has been dealing with nodule in her neck and she just visited a dr bout ten weeks ago and they did an ultra sound and found that one of the nodules is now 12 cm big.

I m really concerned that this is taking so long and wonder what the odds are of i being cancer. She has also been having pain in her side and wont go to the dr for it but I talk to her earlier and its gotten worse and if she doesnt feel better in morn she is suppose to call her dr. sorry just a worried mom.","Doctor":"A nodule in the neck could mean a number of things including an infection, tuberculosis or cancer. However a nodule that is increasing in size should definitely raise suspicion of cancer. The best way out would be to get a needle test (FNAC) from the nodule. That will indicate whether there is any chance of there being cancer or if it is definitely cancerous or if it is entirely something else. It is a simple test done on outpatient basis at any lab."},{"Patient":"All most a year ago I had an infection in my left foot, which was extremely swollen and extremly painful to walk. Later the bottom left leg (under the knee) also swelled up. No swelling above the knee. My Vascular Surgeon was watching it as they found an enlarged lymph node in left groin. After watching it for several months he decided to do surgery as it was increasing in size. I am to have the procedure at a Surgical Center tomorrow. Can you explain what can I expect if the biopsey is cancerous. Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Cancer in the lymph nodes does not arise per se and comes from a neighbouring structure in this case your leg. So, if the lymph node shows presence of cancer, then it is likely that the leg also has cancer from where the cancer has spread to the nodes. In such a case, you would have to first rule out that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. If not, then you will need to undergo surgery of the leg (to take out the entire tumor--may result in amputation) and surgery for removal of all nodes from the groin."},{"Patient":"Hi I am a 33 year old male, have previously been diagnosed with thyroid cancer resulting in a total thyroidectomy. I currently take 200mcg thyroxine per day. Approximately 10 days ago an abcess developed on my neck which had a very hard lining. I took amoxicillin for 4 days which did not seem to have any effect. I then went to the hospital and they incised the abscess, let it drain naturally and used forceps to break down the hard walls. I have been changing the dressing daily and the abscess has not reduced in size and the surrounding area is still hard. I am due to go back to the hospital tomorrow for a follow up appointment and was wondering what the next step may be. I was also prescribed a stronger antibiotic, co-amoxiclav which I have now been taking for 3 days.","Doctor":"The abscess may or may not be related to the thyroid cancer. Possibilities are a simple pyogenic abscess (for which the treatment you are taking is adequate), tuberculosis or thyroid cancer in a node. I would suggest to continue the same treatment for atleast 10 days and if the abscess is not resolving, then to take a biopsy from the walls of the abscess cavity. That will settle the issue"},{"Patient":"my husband had radiation therapy in 1986 while in the military for testicular cancer and discharged due to adverse affects from the radiation. In 2008 he started having medical issues turning out to be multiple myeloma, plasma cell dyscrascia. could the radiation therapy contributed to this","Doctor":"Well, it is difficult to say conclusively. radiation therapy is known to cause certain cancers like thyroid, breast or lymphoma. Even amongst these cancers, radiation induced cancers form a small percentage. Only rarely does radiotherapy for a previous cancer lead to multiple myeloma. So it is almost impossible to ascribe it to your previous radiation although it is definitely a possibility."},{"Patient":"I was first diagnosed with 1 nodule on half of my thyroid (I had left side removed /tumor in thyroid had to remove to do biopsy in 1989) then it became 2 and now 4. Three are solid and 1 with fluid. Had biopsy done early in April of this year and they were benign. My question and concern is can they eventually become cancer if they are not taken care of?","Doctor":"Benign nodules of the thyroid if left untreated can become malignant over a long period of time. Roughly 10% nodules become malignant over 20 years. The features of they turning malignant are sudden increase in size, pain, appearance of other nodules outside the thyroid, change in voice, difficulty in breathing or swallowing. Any of these changes should prompt you to consider removal of the remaining thyroid."},{"Patient":"Hi, friend was just diagnosed with saliva gland cancer , they want to give him radiation and chemo. He is 64 otherwise in good health, good weight. Do you think that oxygen therapy would help ? Also, heavy doses of beet juice ? My Mom passed away one year ago today of this cancer and it took her in 4 months. So time is of the essence but she was 83 and not in great health. I wanted her to get hydrogen therapy and oxygen but she was not in a good place. Would you recommend them ?","Doctor":"First of all, the ideal treatment for salivary gland cancer is surgery and if required, to be followed up with radiotherapy. Surgery is not done only in cases where the disease is too advanced and cannot be removed. In such cases, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are given. Hydrogen or oxygen therapy has no role in curing any type of cancer anywhere in the body and i will strongly advise you against wasting precious time in this line."},{"Patient":"i have pain at the upper left quadrant of my abdomen, i have loose stool, fecalysis shows that i have yeast on my stool. i have upper back pain with left shoulder pain, my doctor told me that i have non alcoholic fatty liver grade 1 and kidney stones. i am also experiencing left butt pain but not really that painful. what should be the cause of all these pain?","Doctor":"Hi, the pain in the upper left quadrant might be due to the pancriatitis,kidney infection, stone in the ureter, colitis most probably, as you have loose stools. it may be due to amoebic colitis, or infection with the anerobic bacteria.

It has been close to three months now and I still have not been cleared for radiation. What are my chances of survival if I do not have radiation? I am also taking Aridimex. ER PR positive Her2 neg.","Doctor":"There are a few problems in the way you are being treated. First, Oncotype Dx is not for stage II breast cancer, only for stage I node negative cancer. Stage 2 patient should always get chemotherapy. Secondly, in patients who conserve the breast, radiotherapy is mandatory without which, the disease is bound to come back in the same breast. Thirdly, the radiation should be started as soon as possible after surgery and definitely within 2 months. So please start radiation asap else your disease will definitely recur. Lastly, Arimidex is started after radiation therapy and not before or alongwith."},{"Patient":"My husband was diagnosed with Stage IV colorectal cancer with metastasis to the liver. When he had a liver resection in July 2013 the surgeon found 3 cancerous nodules in the right diaphragm and removed them. He had a questionable small tumor that responded to folfox and avastin therapy. In January his ct scans of the chest and pelvis were good and his CEA was 3.2 so we decided to hold chemotherapy for 3 months to evaluate the lung tumor. In April the CT scan of chest showed an increase in size of tumor from 1.4 cm to 2.5 cm. The ct scan of the pelvis showed 2 tumors in the omentum that are 1.4 and 1.6 cm in diameter. The oncologist recommends chemotherapy with folfiri and avastin. According to the research systemic chemotherapy is not that helpful with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Is there any other treatment available for him?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problems.Stage 4 colorectal cancer has very poor prognosis .Life expectancy is less then 1 year.For peritoneal carcinomatosis systemic chemotherapy is treatment of choice. Another way is local instillation of chemotherapy drugs. Direct injection of chemotherapy drugs in peritoneal cavity can be done laparoscopy Cally.So discuss these option with oncologist."},{"Patient":"Hi, my friend is diagnosed with melanoma cancer metastasized to the liver.

Now I am seeing a white, flat, smooth spot surrounded by an irregular red smooth area on my nose. Is this something to worry about? It does not look like anything I have had before.","Doctor":"Normally, this would not be a cause for concern as it is not the usual description of a skin cancer. It is more in favour of a localized infection. However in view of the multiple cancers that you have had, kindly see your oncosurgeon if the lesion persists for more than a week. He may need to do a biopsy."},{"Patient":"My mother was informed last week (at University Hospital in London) that she had a pancreatic tumor that was cancerous & the doctor said (in brief) that unless she wanted to have a biopsy, she would not be referred to an oncologist even though he was sure it was cancer. I would like to have a second opinion on her situation.The doctor she saw said she had 8 to 12 months to live - we really need some help in getting her to an oncologist.Thank you, Kathleen Baker","Doctor":"First of all, it is important to know whether the tumor from the pancreas has spread to other areas of the body like lungs or liver. If it has, then he cannot be cured as it is last stage tumor and the only treatment option is chemotherapy which will prolong her life somewhat and make it more comfortable. In this case you need a biopsy or FNAC (needle test) before starting chemotherapy. If it has not spread and can be removed surgically then the ideal treatment is surgery which has the potential to cure her forever.There is no need for a biopsy in order to go for surgery."},{"Patient":"above my right areola, is a light brown discoloured area, and has been present about a week or less, please tell me this isn't CANCER!!! im so scared and only have male doctors around here. PLEASE HELP! other than this, im completely healthy! not on any current meds for anything","Doctor":"First of all, carefully examine your breasts standing in front of the mirror.You can visit any of the sites that describe self breast examination. If there is a lump palpable then immediately consult an oncologist even if he's a male. If there is no lump, then get an ultrasound or mammogram of the breast done.

If so I really dont want to spend the money to have something removed if its no longer there. Thank You","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should consult oncologist and start treatment. You are having nasal mucosal malignancy. And it will not fall of itself.If you don't take treatment, it will definitely spread in local area as well as distal organs. So better to consult oncologist and start treatment.  And surgical removal is infact good option. It will prolong the life expectancy."},{"Patient":"Hi..My mother has been diagnosed with signet ring cell cartinoma (Stage unknown ). It's spread to part of liver. We have been told that she has to get 6 weeks of Chemo done first before Surgery. We are worried that will delay the surgery. Any advice please?","Doctor":"You havent mentioned the site from where the tumor is starting. I assume it is probably the colon or rectum. If it has spread to the liver then it is stage 4 disease. However even in stage 4 colorectal cancer, there is 25% chance of cure. The standard treatment is chemotherapy followed by surgery and you shouldnt worry about the delay since the tumor is not unchecked in this period. However if the tumor is bleeding or causing obstruction then the surgery has to be done before the chemotherapy."},{"Patient":"I have had a sharp pain in my right side, for three days.

When I'm walking I sometimes get sudden stabbing pain in my right side and have to bend over with pain .","Doctor":"Hi ! Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.From you history of pain on the right side of abdomen specially after food accompanied with bloating sensation, the diagnosis goes more in favour of gall stones with infection of the gall bladder (Cholecystitis). Whenever there is intra abdominal infection, there will be pain which may be severe on movement due to inflammation of the local parietal peritonium. That is why you have got pain on movements. Apart from the cholecystitis, there are a few other conditions which can give rise to similar symptoms, but I do not want to confuse you by just telling you the names.If I would have been your doctor, I would first examine your abdomen followed by investigations like CBC, Blood sugar, LFT, S Amylase and Lipase, followed by an ultrasound abdomen to confirm my diagnosis.In such a provisional diagnosis of cholecystitis, you should avoid fatty food which may aggravate your pain, and you can go for an anti spasmodic for an immediate relief. But you have to consult a general surgeon to diagnose the condition by physical examination and investigations for further management.Thank you for using Health Care magic forum for your health query. I wish you an early recovery. Thanks and good luck."},{"Patient":"hi i am 50 year old and have stage one cancer on my tounge remove. Also remove lyum nodes from one dside which were negative.

It may not disappear completely and is not a cause for concern. If you ever develop any white or red patch or ulcer, then that is a cause for concern. Meanwhile never take any cigarettes/alcohol/chewable tobacco and take a multivitamin supplement.

Now this lump has me worried.....Wonder if its cancer?","Doctor":"The first line treatment for stage 4 prostate cancer is not chemotherapy but hormone therapy (unless you have already received it). This comprises of a small surgery to remove the testicles (the source of testosterone which stimulates the cancer) followed by Tab Bicalutamide 50mg daily till response lasts. response is assessed by monthly serum PSA estimation.

However it is better to be sure and the best way to do this would be to visit an ENt surgeon and get an endoscopy done."},{"Patient":"my father is diagnosed with bladder cancer 4 months ago, he refused to take bladder out or any treatment. he was told 10-11 months to live. he has continued to urinate blood and now it is everytime he urinates and he said it is alot of blood. how long can he bleed before something happens to him?","Doctor":"Blood in urine is one of the presenting symptoms of bladder cancer. This is common because the tumor is like a raw surface that can bleed spontaneously or with the passage of urine over it. It is not smooth like the rest of the bladder. I am afraid to say but with no treatment and with the blood that he is loosing not being replaced he will not even last the predicted 10-11 months. He will have a massive bleed someday and expire that very day. There are other options besides getting the bladder removed. This includes radiotherapy to the bladder area. This will stop the bleeding and also have a certain chance of cure. I think you should counsel your father about it. It is a painless procedure."},{"Patient":"My father is being treated for relapsed multiple myeloma. He is taking ecosprin 75, lenalidomide 15 mg daily, bortezomib 1.8 mg weekly through IV and des methadone 10 mg weekly. He has had several side effects including fever, cold, cough. Today he also developed a sub conjunctival haemorrhage I. His right eye. Should we review the dosage of medicines he is being given because his present weight is only 45 kg. what has caused the eye bleed? Pls advise.","Doctor":"The only reason I can think of for the hemorrhage is ecosprin since it is an antiplatelet drug. It should be stopped in consultation with your oncologist. Also, get a complete blood count done and see if the platelets are adequate. multiple myeloma can cause bone marrow suppression and fall in platelet counts and bleeding."},{"Patient":"i have pain in my left lower abdomen. on a scale of 1-10 it is a eight.and at times a 9/10. I feel and look bloutted amost all the time. I tire very easily..I had prostate surgery in 2010 for an aggressive type of cancer i had 28 tx of radiation. and did fairly well...I only got tired toward the end. Now I really don t want to eat the smell of food makes me sick. it causes back pain in my left side. I also take Lupron I have seen my doctor I have had blood in my stool and urine since I finished radiation therapy. I know that bone cancer is a possibility I did delay a shot by 2 months i thought about stopping jt all together. What do you think?","Doctor":"It is quite unlikely for you to develop bone cancer per se. however, there is a possibility of the prostate cancer coming back in the bones. Even this is not for sure and your symptoms may just be due to the surgery and radiotherapy as both these treatments can cause back pain. However, if you are in doubt and the pain is severe and persistent, then get a bone scan and serum PSA done. That will clear the picture."},{"Patient":"I received a letter from my dermatologist after he removed a mole on my back. The result of the biopsy came back as a moderately abnormal mole. The letter indicated that the mole appears to have been completely removed and a follow up appointment should be scheduled for 6 months. Does moderately abnormal mean a malignancy? Should I be extremely worried?","Doctor":"A moderately abnormal mole is not a scientific term and probably was translated by your doctor. However, even on the face of it, it does not indicate a malignancy. Also, since your doctor has booked you for 6 months later, it is highly unlikely to be a malignancy. It would have helped if you could get the exact medical terminology report. Even, otherwise i dont think you should be worried."},{"Patient":"I am a 45 year old female and had a gastric bypass 2 years ago. I lost 70 pounds and now am at a healthy weight. i exercise 2-4 times a week. for the last month my blood sugar levels have been drastically dropping down to 46. this is happening almost daily but i have never been a diabetic. i am trying to get into see an endocronologist but this is taking a lot of time. my doctor did some blood work and says my insulin levels are very elevated. I even had to go to the ER one night and he said all the initial labs that he could do in the ER came back fine so my issue was above his level. what do i do and what could be causing this? i heard a possibility could be insulinoma?","Doctor":"In your case, insulinoma is definitely a possibility. The symptoms that you have described plus the low sugar levels and high insulin levels, all point towards the possibility of insulinoma. It is a tumor arising from the pancreas from the cells that produce insulin in the body. The only definitive treatment is removal of the tumor surgically. For this, we have to locate the tumor first. For this, you should get a contrast enhance CT scan of the abdomen done. If it is normal ,then an upper GI endoscopy with endoscopic ultrasound should help locate the tumor. Meanwhile, always keep something sweet like biscuits or sugar handy and eat it as soon as you feel the sugar going down. Dont miss any meals."},{"Patient":"hi my girlfriend is having some abdominal pain ...its on the right side...she said it feels like its behind the ribs...like a swelling feeling feels like its moving....been to the er 3 times and they have said they have found nothing... have tried gas meds. they worked for a min but she feels the pressure build back up, and that s without eating.","Doctor":"Hi ! Good morning. If your she has gone to the ER three times and the doctors found nothing on clinical examination, apparently she does not have any palpable mass or organomegaly in her abdomen. But to be sure, because her complaint is persistent, I would advise her to go for an ultrasound abdomen to rule out any pathology in the gall bladder/liver. Till that, she can have a proton pump inhibitor, a prokinetic agent, and an anti spasmodic in case of pain. Further management will depend on the investigation reports. Thanks and good luck."},{"Patient":"Hi,We leave in Langley, BC. My husband has been diagnosed with skin cancer. He is going to Glover Medical, Langley, BC. His doctor is Dr. Matthews, Ronald Bruce. He had a little procedure - a peace removed from top of his head and sent for a biopsy. Today he went there for the results and to have the stitches removed. The doctor (was dr. Sumani today) told him he needs another surgery in a month or two because it s not clean enough. I think my husband needs to be send to see a specialist (oncologist) and get the full blood test and furder treatment, not to wait one or two months for the next procedure from the walking clinik. I am looking for your opinion!","Doctor":"If the result of the biopsy does show skin cancer, then you should not wait at all for the second surgery, leave alone for a month. The cancer will increase several times in this period and may spread to other parts when it will be beyond cure. So, time is of essence. Immediately show him to a cancer surgeon."},{"Patient":"I had a benign tumor on my leg and can t remember the name of it.Can it grow back?It was redish an it was itchy and I broke it open an bleed a lot,then just scabbed over.The doctor removed it an said it was benign.It was itchy again an noticed a sore,can it grow back?","Doctor":"The only difference between benign and malignant tumors is that the latter can spread to other body parts. Even benign tumors, particularly if removed incompletely and come back at the same site. It needs to be removed completely with a margin to ensure that it does not recur. Preferably get it removed by a cancer surgeon"},{"Patient":"I have a cyst on head of my pancreas. I have abdominal pain on right side that radiates to my back.some nausea but no jaundice or vomiting. I had gall bladder removal surgery 13 years ago so may be a result of that. Do you think it is cancerous YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Any lesion in the pancreas needs to be taken seriously even if it appears completely cystic on imaging. If the CT scan shows it to be cystic then get an endoscopic ultrasound done with aspiration of the cyst fluid. Send the fluid for malignant cells and CA 19-9 estimation. If any of these is abnormal then get a surgery done for removal of the cyst as it is likely to be cancerous, else dont worry. The above procedure will be done by a gastroenterologist with a good setup and experience. Also, get a blood CA 19-9 estimation also."},{"Patient":"I am 53 year old and a year ago I was diagnosed with duct carcinoma breast cancer, went through surgery and radiation and was on tomoxifen and now they put me on femara due to the fact that I had a hysterectomy in May 2011.  Besides taking vitamins and calcium these are the only medicine but when I go to sleep I fall asleep fast and then about an hour or two I jump out of bed and feel like something is wrong.  I usually walk to the bathroom and then go back to bed and usually I fall asleep right a way or within a few minutes.  Sometimes I sleep the rest of the night but sometime it comes back again within a few hours. What should I do. I","Doctor":"The treatment that you have undertaken appears to be scientifically correct and you need not worry about it. Also, none of the drugs that you have taken cause the symptoms that you have. It is probably a result of insomnia due to the stress of the disease and the treatment that has its toll on the mind. It is best you take a sedative at bed time for a few weeks. Meanwhile try to occupy your mind with activities during the day. Join a meditation group. Dont sleep during the day. Eat at least 1 hour before bedtime."},{"Patient":"hello.... In the past two years I had thyriod cancer and had my thyriod removed and radiation theraphy and now take synthriod daily, since going on the synthyriod I have developed a host of other problems, tias, high blood pressure, migraines like I have never had before, weakness and mental confusion.... my high blood pressure is the lower number , which I understand is the more dangerous one to have high, my question is, I have been told synthyriod is safe, but do some people ever hae problem tolerating it?  I am also on vit d theraphy for renal failure.... from lab work that was done..... I was told that was related to thyriod too?","Doctor":"Synthroid itself does not produce these problems. However a wrong dosage (over or under) can result in problems. The best thing would be to get a serum TSH done (a blood test) and if it normal then not to worry about synthroid being the cause of your symptoms. In that case you should consult a physician for your blood pressure and he will put you on medications for decreasing the same. If the TSH report is abnormal then you will have to adjust the dose of synthroid and repeat the TSH every month till it comes normal."},{"Patient":"My sister 3 years ago had breast cancer in 1 breast - was treated had her 2 breasts removed, - the 2nd breast just as a precaution.  4 months ago her scans and everything were clean/clear.  Last month they said it was back - 4 spots on liver, 1 on pelvic bone, 1 spot on rib bone and 2 spots on spine so they have said it's most likely in the bones.  What will be her chances of living through this.  Today is her 2nd chemo treatment again.  3 wks  on chemo (once a week for 3 wks) and 1 wk off for the next 3 or 4 months they've said.  Please tell me anything you can. She is 54, about 160 lbs. and has rarely been sick in her life other than this cancer!  Sincerely, Marilyn Morgan","Doctor":"You did not mention whether she took any chemo or radiotherapy after the surgery. Anyways, now it is stage 4 breast cancer and is quite unlikely to get completely cured. The treatment that has been prescribed to you appears to be correct and you should go ahead with it. This will prolong her life and make it more comfortable. If her hormone receptors are positive (ask your doctor), then she should start on hormone therapy (tablet therapy) after completing chemotherapy."},{"Patient":"Hi my dad has bowel cancer... He had it a couple of years ago, had surgery and chemo and then the all clear... But it's back - apparently he has some lumps in his intestine, they not operating and going straight to chemo.... He half way through his chemo and he is virtually bed ridden and not eating/drinking and has a tube from his stomach draining out dark green liquid - and they are pumping fluids into him like no ones business... The docs as the hospital say he may have an infection.... But I'm not so sure... I've not got rose tinted glasses - i think its the cancer.  I am just curious about the dark green liquid that they are pumping out of him... What is it?","Doctor":"The dark green liquid coming out is called bile. It is a liquid that is normally produced in the human body in everyone. It is coming out because it cannot go forward in the intestines probably due to blockage by the lumps in the intestines. It is not an abnormal fluid, nor related to his disease or infection or chemotherapy."},{"Patient":"Hello,my husband has multiple myeloma,and today has been behaving very strange,saying things that make no sense.He has fallen and broken bones many times,and when he fell,always hit his head.He is in a wheelchair,cause he can't walk anymore. Could the M.M. be in his head or brain now??","Doctor":"Base on your description, it is more than likely that the myeloma has spread to his brain. His treatment history would have helped. If he has taken treatment for the myeloma then his disease has become resistant and you need to consider second line therapy in consultation with your oncologist. If no treatment has been taken then you should consider taking some. Another possibility is that due to repeated trauma and weakened bones, there has been some bleed inside his skull leading to these symptoms. A CT scan of the head will settle the issue."},{"Patient":"Hi, my mother is a multiple myelomma patient with pathological fractures. She presently had completed her chemotherapy. She is presently prescribed Snepdol by orthopedics. She is now suffering from nausea and her creatine level has raised from 2.1 to 4.1. Her haemoglobin is also low - 5.9. We are thinking that the present inclusion of Snepdol is behind these, kindly advise.","Doctor":"The side effects that she is having are probably due to her chemotherapy and not snepdol. Snepdol side effects include dizziness, sedation and rarely liver toxicity or heart toxicity, but never any kidney toxicity or low hemoglobin. These however are side effects of the standard chemotherapy drugs used for multiple myeloma which i presume she has received."},{"Patient":"I have a possible sarcoma that was diagnosed as a lipoma in 2008. I was told because I do not have insurance that they would rather watch the lipoma and see if it grows to determine sarcoma. For 1 year i couldnt tell if the tumor was growing. It is going on 2 years and a lump that was 5mm in size is palpable from a standing, sitting and especially laying position. I was laying on my right side and felt the lower left abdominal mass sticking out. It is about 2\\" deep spaning around 3\\" across I cannot differentiate all areas of the mass. Over all I believe it is about the size of a raquet ball deep and 2 raquetballs side by side. I am afraid. I dont want to be turned away due to lack of insurance. I am a 36 year old female with 3 children. I have had 3 previous c-sections with no complications other than adhesions. I have had 2 adhesion removal surgeries from my c-section scar. This mass is from the level of the scar to about 2.5\\" above the scar and about 4\\" across. I have called my doctor but I do nt trust his team anymore. The last time I saw his recomended general surgeon she had not looked at my ct scan and told me this was really a CYA appointment. After I inquired what CYA meant she told me cover your ass. So my doctor could cover his ass in diagnosing lipoma. This surgeon did call after she reviewed my ct scan and told me this was just c-section scar tissue. I also have autoimmune chronic pancreatitis with a recent bout of diverticulitis, fibromyalgia and degenerative joint disease. Please point me in the right direction to go","Doctor":"First of all, you need to rule out a hernia since the swelling is in the region of the incision. A hernia is just a defect in the abdominal wall with resulting protrusion of the contents within. This can be ascertained based on an abdominal ultrasound. So, get that done first. If it is not a hernia but a soft tissue lesion, then get an FNAC (needle test) done from the lump. This will ascertain whether it is indeed a lipoma or something more serious. A lipoma can be ignored unless it is causing pain or other symptoms."},{"Patient":"My husband who is 53 has been having abdominal pain that is on and off for over a week. He has been taking antacids and Prilosec for two days. The pain is in the middle of his stomach and is getting worse at nite.  He does not have medical insurance and we try to stay away from Drs. unless its necessary. When he lies down its worse.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query to H.C.M.  Forum. Since pain is from the last 7 days i.e.acute gastritis or hyper acidity. As  diagnosis is clear so you will have to take few steps for this pain. Try raising the head of your bed about 4 inches with the blocks. It might also help to avoid eating or drinking fro two hours before your husband lie down. To help control the stomach acid one should not drink alcohol or drinks with caffeine in them or eat chocolates or spicy food or greasy food . As antacid & prilosec not providing complete relief get in endoscopy of upper G I . In such type of cases I usually prescribe  rebamipide 100 mg 2-2-2 for 10 days . 2nd reason of this pain may be due to acute pancreatitis , this can be confirmed by blood examination of pancreatic enzymes like lipase and amylase. More over this pain worse when patient bends or sits . Consultation of a physician will help. Good luck.

He is asking for morphine every hour and he is in severe pain. He finished his chemo and just finished radiation but he is in agony.Is there any chance for him to survive?","Doctor":"It is very difficult based on your description to tell the chances of his survival. It would have helped if you had mentioned which part of the body has cancer, what is the stage and ehe has undergone surgery. Pain, in a cancer patient can be due to a number of reasons like disease involving nerves, side effects of surgery/chemotherapy/radiotherapy. Most of these pains can be relieved by pain killers. If not then you can proceed to stronger pain killers like morphine. There is fentanyl 25/50mcg patch available that needs to be stuck on any non-hairy part of his skin and it will relieve his pain for 3 days."},{"Patient":"My husband has stage iv liver cancer metastic (feb 2011).  He has lost a lot of weight,  Lately he has not been eating only sleeping, but the last 2 days he has been eating.  Are thes typical signs or should i get him to the hospital. He says he is fine.","Doctor":"For a patient with last stage liver cancer, these are typical symptoms of end stage disease and you shouldnt be worried about them unless they are distressing to the patient or life threatening. As it is the entire treatment now is symptom based and palliative. I hope he is on some form of anti-cancer treatment as that will also extend the duration and time period of his comfort. This you should discuss with your oncologist based on his fitness to withstand therapy"},{"Patient":"I have non hotgkins lymphoma and am in pain at the moment. My cancer is located at the top part of my body in the pectoral region and under my arms as well as neck. I just took 800 mg of ibuprophen within the last 30 minutes. There is no relief. The pain seems to have gotten worse. I do have a prescription for oxycondone 5 mg but am hisitant to take it having just taken the 800 mg of ibuprophen. What would you recommend?","Doctor":"The pain that you have may be related to the cancer that you have or to the drugs that must have been given for it. Either way, only pain killers are going to help. You can take Tab. Tramadol 1 tab thrice daily after meals. If that also doesnt help then you can take the oxycodone."},{"Patient":"Hi There was only one biopsy taken fron one spot just inside the vagina. No other spots were taken Can you please explain the above?","Doctor":"If all the spots are similar looking then it makes sense to biopsy any one of them to reach a diagnosis. You dont need to biopsy all of them. However if they are different and all have a suspicion of cancer based on clinical examination then all need to be biopsied. This only your clinician can tell. The treatment of course will depend on the biopsy result which you havent mentioned."},{"Patient":"Had radiation for prostate cancer (44 treatments) ending in June 2013. This morning I had urinated a little and had blood in the stream. Several hours later I had a fairly full bladder and the urine was also dark. Since then no apparent blood when I urinate. Can this wait till Monday to discuss with my doctor or should I check in with an emergency room?","Doctor":"You dont need to panic as this is not an emergency. There are a number of causes for blood in the urine after radiotherapy and the most common is cysititis (infection of the urinary bladder). The treatment of this can wait for a few days unless it is causing a lot of pain and burning. Just drink plenty of water and consult your oncologist."},{"Patient":"patient has rcc stage four radiation with solumedrol he has now completed radiation for sic lesions he has been wheened off steroids . Symptoms are fatigue headache short term memory blood pressure is good. He is demonstrating symptoms just like he did before all this treatment. Is this to be expected? He was on 40mg bid then tapered off over two weeks. How should a patient be properly tapered?","Doctor":"For stage 4 RCC. the treatment is targeted therapy (a type of tablet therapy with few side effects, e.g. a drug by the name of sunitinib). If this is already on then fine, else meet your oncologist and start one. The symptoms related to the metastasis are treated by palliative radiotherapy but the symptoms can return since the disease is still active in the body. For, this you need to take symptomatic drug treatment. Pain killers for headache, multivitamins for the fatigue would be recommended."},{"Patient":"i m suffering from pvt last 1 year.i take warf 5 daily basis 10mg.what effect of body SGOT 50 and SGPT 56.& INR 2.91.Any chances of cancer or danger of my life in future.6month ago Dr. said to check up Thrombophilia profile but i not checkup. So pls suggest me or guid me","Doctor":"First of all, taking warfarin does not lead to cancer. So be rest assured about that. Secondly, your dose of warfarin is too high and so is your INR. Your INR should be between 2-2.5. For this you will have to slowly reduce the dose and repeat the INR every week till it comes in the desired range. Also, the only danger to your life right now is a bleeding tendency due to a high dose of warfarin. So, follow your clinician's advice and get the profile done."},{"Patient":"I have been coughing up green stuff for months. It was checked for infection and there is none. I have RA.

Had throat scope and sinus ct both ok. Had a lung ct and it showed alittle scaring and nodules. I m so scared I have cancer but I m just waiting around for my next dr appointment. I don t feel like I m getting anywhere with a diagnosis.","Doctor":"Change in voice along with lung nodules are not a good sign and may indicate cancer although this is not for sure based on the scanty information that you have provided. You definitely need further investigations in order to reach a diagnosis. The best will be to get a needle test done from the lung nodules if they are big enough (FNAC). This will be done under CT guidance. If they are not big enough, then a bronchoscopy (endoscopy of the respiratory tract) with lavage and cytology might help.Also, send your sputum for culture and cytology."},{"Patient":"I just heard from my lab tests and was scheduled for surgery tomorrow and I am a breast cancer patient and they told me my labs were all out of whack that my platlets were 569 and hy hemoglobin was 10.5 and that I needed to go see my oncologist to see what was going on and I was wondering what to expect...","Doctor":"Generally speaking, the altered counts are not associated with breast cancer except in the last stage when the cancer has involved the bone marrow. Since you were scheduled for surgery, i suspect you dont have last stage breast cancer. So, either you have an associated cause for your altered counts like nutritional deficiency, etc. or you have bone marrow involvement by the cancer. A bone marrow aspiration will settle the issue."},{"Patient":"Hello, I m a 58 year old women and has had back surgery on my L5-S1 5 years ago. I m the proud owner of 2 rods 4 bolts etc. I have recently herniated another disc. My Doctor is a very good at his job. He has recently had me go through a battery of tests. He has found a spot on my left rib and spine where the disk is herniated. He seems quite concerned about them and said he d like to do some more tests before I see the surgeon. He didn t want to alarm me but suggested it might be cancer. I was wondering if it is what are my options?","Doctor":"First of all, we need to confirm the nature of these spots. They may or may not be cancer. For this a bone scan and if required a biopsy from the lesions will be sufficient. If they indeed are cancer, then you need to ascertain whether they have come from somewhere else or they have started from the bone itself. If, from the bone, then surgery will be curative in most cases. If from elsewhere then the treatment is entirely different. Anyways, thats a long way on, just take the first step and find out what they are."},{"Patient":"My 37 yr old daughter had mirena placed in June this yr, she is a smoker and 2 weeks ago had sudden severe pain in left abdome with diagnosis of acut splenic infarct she was sent home with meds and follow up labs were done however she has no results yet, now admitted to hospital yesterday with the same symptoms could the mirena be the culprit for the clot?","Doctor":"Hi, spleen is present in the left upper abdomen, and the uterus and merina are at the pelvic area. So there is no direct relation to the pain, and marina. splenic infarct means that it is not recent, and have no relation to  the marina.

I did not know that I have to pay for an answer.","Doctor":"In a patient of breast cancer if one of the breasts is red and swollen then it is definitely a cause for concern and your friend should immediately consult her oncologist. It could possibly mean the return of her cancer. However it may be nothing but a localised infection. This issue can only be settled by seeing an oncologist and this needs to be done asap."},{"Patient":"hello just over the past few days i have found a lump in my upper scrotum. not attached to my testicle but above it and kind of beside it if that makes sense. I m really worried its cancer for some reason. i know cancer can happen at any age but I m 28. if this something to worry about?","Doctor":"The description that you have given is that of an epididymal cyst, although this can be ascertained only after examining you. These cysts are not cancerous and remain like that without causing any trouble. However, you should first see an oncosurgeon to be sure. If required, he will do some tests (FNAC-needle test) to rule out cancer or TB or other infections."},{"Patient":"Good day Dr, Ive had pain for a week in my throat, no whiteness (infection) just a lump thats very irritating and painful. Cannot swallow, sleep nor breathe well. Also facing a lot of uncontrollable anger at the moment. I am a smoker. Could this be cancer? I freaked out because google pictures match.","Doctor":"Smokers are always at risk for throat cancer and a variety of other cancers. The symptoms that you have described are suspicious for cancer especially in the setting of your smoking habits. However, this is not definitive and it may just be a throat infection which you cannot see with naked eye. All you need to do is consult an oncosurgeon and get an endoscopy done. This is an OPD procedure and will settle the issue.Also, try to quit smoking and a lot of your problems will be solved including the anger."},{"Patient":"Recently my husband was diagoned positive for Colon cancer.

Only thing we have had proceesed for 1-2 yrs is a drink with L-Glutamate and I wish we were not introduced to it:( and I read that glutamate can cause and fuel cancer calls:(","Doctor":"There is no concrete evidence to say conclusively that L-Glutamate causes cancer although there is emerging data in favour of the same. However, people will healthy life-styles and good eating habits can also develop colon cancer although their chances are much less. This can be ascribed to environmental pollution and bad genes. But mostly, there is no reason and one shouldnt waste time looking for it. Of course, from now on you should avoid these drinks as well."},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with lung cancer just a month ago having surgery to remove the right upper lobe which is now in my lymph nodes.

Reaching for straw THANKS","Doctor":"Well, you have actually put it best. You are actually clutching at straws. cannabis oil has never and will never cure any cancer in the human body. There is no literature or data to support this. You will always find people and sites claiming otherwise, but as an oncologist, there is no scientific reason for you to believe this. You should concentrate on the conventional forms of therapy that are tried and tested, namely, surgery chemotherapy and radiotherapy."},{"Patient":"I have been taking temaxafine for 3 years and my doctor has changed my medication to letrozole.

I would like to know what you think.Would I be better off to go back to temaxafine since the side effects were mimimul and ok?","Doctor":"First of all, you should be post menopausal (your menses must have stopped) for you to take either letrozole or anastrazole. If you are not postmenopausal then you should stick to only tamoxifen and no other drug. Also, your bones should be in a healthy condition before starting either of the 2 drugs. For this get a bone densitometry done and if normal only then start letro/anastrazole. If not then continue tamoxifen. By the way, all 3 drugs are equally effective in controlling cancer and any one can be taken."},{"Patient":"My 10 year old daughter has had blood checked twice.

I would guess it probably weighs 25 lbs","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. By your description and history I think he may have1. Multiple lipomas (lipomatosis)2. Neurofibroma sFirstly, he needs biopsy from the swelling, and histopathological examination to diagnose it.You should consult general surgeon for the removal of the swelling."},{"Patient":"well my mother in law has cancer and has under went several weeks of radiation everyday then chemo also once a week . her last chemo and radiation treatment ended last week , but she has had diarreah everyday since. she cant seem to keep anything in her stomache. she also has pain swallowing. i was wondering if u had any advice for us to give her.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Yes chemotherapy is known to cause diarrhoea. The common reasons are1. Alteration of bacterial flora of gut.2. Gastrointestinal infection. Along with the cancerous cells, chemotherapeutic agents also damage normal bacterial flora in gut. This can cause diarrhoea. Chemotherapy makes patient immunosuppressive so infections are more common in them. So gastrointestinal infection may be the cause. Better to start following treatment. 1. Plenty of fluids. Keep herself hydrated. 2. Start oral rehydration solution (ORS).3. Start probiotics to help flora.4. Start antibiotics. If not improve in 5 days,  get done stool microscopic examination."},{"Patient":"Hello,My roommate has been having pain in her, like lower abdominal area like right above her private area.

Thick lining in uterus can be due to1. Infection2. Atrophic changes post menopausal. 3. Uterine cancer. So you need to consult gynecologist and get done1. Transvaginal ultrasound2. Biopsy or scrapping of uterine tissue.To rule out above causes."},{"Patient":"I HAVE A NEICE JUST DIAGNOSED WITH FOURTH STAGE ORAL CANCER. 39 YEARS OLD HAS FAMILY HISTORY OF ORAL CANCER.

Stage 4 oral cancer has not very good prognosis. Life expectancy is less than 2 years.Because of decreased or absent oral intake,Malnutrition is the biggest problem in these patients. Feeding jejunostomy is the option for feeding in such cases.Treatment in such cases is palliative only. Palliative treatment is consists of1. Palliative chemotherapy2. Palliative radiotherapy3.

She has had pain for 6-8 weeks and presumed it was cancer related-They have since discovered that she has a twisted bowel and has spent several nights in hospital. She has quite a poor diet lately, in spite of our efforts, do you think this is relevant to the twisted bowel or do you think it is more related to the cancer, operations, chemo etc.?Kind Regards,Justine","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Ovarian cancer when spread to bowel and stomach can cause many adhesion s.And due to these adhesions, bowel movements are hampered. And can cause twisting. This is known as Strangulated bowels.And the first symptom of this is abdominal pain followed by vomiting and absence of stool.So twisted bowel can cause abdominal pain."},{"Patient":"Hello, my grandfather was diagnosed with stage IV-b pancreatic cancer with 9 confirmed cancer spots on his liver about 3 weeks ago. He started a combination of chemotheropies today (not sure which ones exactly) and is apart of a clinical trial using BBI608. He has also been to be upgraded to morphine for the pain as other drugs were not helping. My main concern is I feel his current doctor is misleading them into believing this can be sent into remission and beat. From all the research I have done it seems he is in a worst case possible scenario. I know the best thing any of us can do for him right now is stay possitive and I understand that, but I also think a patient should be fully informed of their situation. My question is basically how long would you give a person to live given this information? Most of my family thinks he can still make it another 5-15 years but I know thats highly unlikely and I don t want my family to be blindsided by him passing in the next 3-6 months. Any information would be greatly appreciated, I just want to know if I m misunderstanding something or if this doctors possitive attitude has unintentionally given my family a sense of false hope. Thank you for your time. Randall","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Stage 4B pancreatic cancer is very notorious in spread as well as prognosis. Life expectancy is less than 2 years. With hepatic metastases it will further decline to less than 1 year.And treating doctor is giving him palliative care, which is right thing.But you have to ask prognosis in detail.And by no means life expectancy is 10-15 years."},{"Patient":"Cut the end of my penis about 6-7 years ago... left a scar just inside the opening to my urethra... there is a white scar that doesnt heal and slightly inflamed skin around the area... it doesnt hurt but its annoying me, just want to check its not penile cancer.

I am having surgery wednsday and the plastic surgeon might do a skin graft. If I have it done will they admit me into the hospital? My insurance does not cover the machine they want to give me.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. For skin grafting hospital admission is must.And you have to take post operative chemotherapy to prevent local as well as distal spread. Skin grafting needs daily dressing and wound care for atleast 2 weeks.So 1 week hospitalisation is necessary and advised.So better to discuss these with your treating plastic surgeon before the procedure."},{"Patient":"Hello, I'm a 50 year old male.

From two months ago i found some big Taste papillae if we can say, on the back of my tongue, on both side on the edge. So i have white patches on both sides of my tongue since one year and enlarge papillae on the both side in the back of my tongue. Can you told me if this is a symptoms of cancer. Note : HIV test is Negative.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. There are few causes for white patches on tongue. The common causes are1. Fungal infection due to improper hygiene.2. Vitamin b12 deficiency3. Riboflavin, pyridoxine and niacin deficiency. 4. Leukoplakia due to tobacco use or dental problems. In my opinion you are having vitamins deficiency. So get done vitamin b 12 level.If deficient,  start supplements. Also give multi vitamin tablets containing folic acid, niacin and pyridoxine. Do take proper care of oral hygiene. So very less likely due to cancer in your case."},{"Patient":"I have a tumor in my backand I have 3 disc bulge. I also have peripheral neuropathy. I went to the er and that s what they found. Now my legs can,t move and I,m in severe pain. They told me to see my doctor in a week but his on vacation. What can I do to help my self?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should consult spine surgeon.Your disc bulging is causing compression of nerves, coming out from disc space.And this compression, when severe ,can cause loss of power (paralysis) of lower limb and neuritic type of pain.So at present you can take painkiller but for permanent solution you need surgical procedure to reduce compression. Also start vitamin b 12 as it is helpful in nerve repair and its function. So consult spine surgeon and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"A doctor has recommended a hysterectomy because of some cells found in my biopsy being irregular (cancerous).

I just don t think I can do it.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. But the treatment of choice for early uterine cancer is surgical removal of uterus (hysterectomy).This gives you best result in prevention of future malignancy, improving life expectancy and quality of life. So for you, hysterectomy is ideal option to cure your cancer.

But better to get done1. X ray of skull to know the extent of the lump.2. Ultrasound examination of local part to know the content of the lump.3. Biopsy and histopathological examination to rule out cancer. Mostly it is either lipoma or sebaceous cyst.

What does this really mean and what are the chances of this becoming cancerous...and if it is, is it treatable? Thanks! Lori Kiel","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. M spike on electrophoresis is the diagnostic criteria for multiple myeloma. This is due to high levels of immunoglobulin (protien s) , which gives positive spike on electrophoresis. But when the level of immunoglobulin s are high but not very high as seen in multiple myeloma, it gives non specific (non cancerous) M spike. It is seen commonly in infection and inflammation.  So this is not cancer.So no need to worry much for non cancerous spike. Very less chances of it to turn into malignancy. Regular follow up with electrophoresis and bone scan is needed to diagnose multiple myeloma in such cases."},{"Patient":"Hello, My mother who is 59 had a stroke last week which turned out to be a blood clot caused by a very small tumor. The neurologist says he scraped out most if not all of the abnormal cells he saw which were near her motor skill region. She has limited use of her right side and will be going for physical therapy tomorrow followed by radiation in 2 weeks and taking a chemo pill. The pathology reports showed the cancer was glioblastoma but it was not seen by an MRI or cats can just the report. I see the median life expectancy is 15 months. Is it possible for her to live a much longer life due to the tumor being so small and them getting most if not all out? I am really just looking for an honest answer of the possibility of survival or years she could possibly be with us due to them catching in in the early stages.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Glioblastoma is very aggressive brain malignancy and can rapidly spread in distal organs.It cause complications in brain too. Like haemorrhage,  infarct, seizures, infection etc.So the stroke, your mother had is mostly due to complication of Glioblastoma. So thos suggest poor prognosis. And life expectancy in such patients are less than 20 months."},{"Patient":"My father in law is 89 years old, has stage 4 cancer, is in renal failure, has a pace maker and has been given 3 to 9 months to live.

Chemotherapy drugs are known to cause gastritis.  And due to this there is gaseous distention of stomach which gives feeling of bloating. Another possibility is intestinal obstruction.  Due to this the food and gas does not pass further and produce bloating sensation in upper abdomen. So get done ultrasound examination of abdomen to rule out obstruction. If obstruction is not present then gastritis is the cause.Better to start proton pump inhibitor. Avoid stress and anxiety. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.

In order to have some idea of its nature, you need to get a blood test called CA-125. If its raised, then there are chances that it harbours cancer and you need to get the cyst removed. If it is normal, and the cyst is not increasing in size on serial monthly ultrasounds, and if there is no solid area within the cyst on the ultrasound, then you have nothing to worry about."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have been diagnosed with a desmoid tumour in my arm had another lump removed from my tummy although awaiting results.

Does this all point to having Gardiners Syndrome and if so does this mean pregnancy is ruled out?Thanks for your help.","Doctor":"All these symptoms do point to Gardener's syndrome although they are not conclusive. If it is indeed a desmoid tumor, then the only treatment available is surgical removal. Neither Gardener's syndrome nor surgery for desmoid tumor rule out a pregnancy and you have the same chance of a successful pregnancy as any other women.

However, vaginal and rectal bleeding in a patient who has had cervical cancer are not good signs. They could simply be the result of a local infection or a symptom of recurrence. If you have received radiotherapy then it could be one of the side effects of the radiotherapy. First, get yourself examined by an oncologist to rule out any obvious disease or infection. Also get an ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis to be sure."},{"Patient":"My boyfriend has just found out he has brain cancer and he is taking it calmly, he said that he is okay with it because everything dies sometime.

Also, be with him as much as possible unconditionally, and do things that he likes about you. Go to his treatment sessions if he is okay with it.

I want your advice & guide. if I will go for surgery. is there change for spread of cancer quickly in whole body.","Doctor":"Firstly, localised prostate cancer is not treated by TURP. It requires a much more major surgery in which you remove the entire prostate and part of the urinary bladder. Radiotherapy is another option which is equally good in terms of tumor control. If however, it is not localised and has spread already then the TURP is probably being done only to allow him to pass urine and not to control his disease in which case your concern of the tumor spreading becomes redundant. Either way, the TURP will do nothing to change the course of your father's disease and you should discuss treatment options for the same based on stage."},{"Patient":"My dad had a total gastrectomy in oct 2011 and had follow up chemo due to having eosphogal cancer. In the last few weeks he has developed severe back pain and stomach cramps along with being sick after some foods - however soups he can tolerate.

This lining regenerates after the chemotherapy is stopped but during it , these side effects are common. You need to do 2 things. First take anti-vomiting drug (Tab Ondansitron 8mg thrice daily or SOS) and maintain a sufficient diet to allow regeneration of the lining. Since his appetite will be down, try finding foods that he tolerates or likes and increase their amount and supplement them with vitamins and protein powders. He will  like sour foods better than sweet or salty. As to the back pain, it can only be decreased by taking pain kilers.

It began in 10/09 the size of a pea but was not painful. By 10/2011 it was the size of a marble and vaguely painful constantly. The general surgeon I saw wanted to biopsy my rib. I underwent a robotic hysterectomy 11/2011. The OB surgeon ruled out cyst, polyp or hernia at the location. Subsequent CT showed mass and thoracic surgeon ordered a ultrasound. The ultrasound shows ossification of the 8th and 9th rib with a palpable mass between these ribs. The mass is hard (bony), protrudes and shaped like an egg. Pain is constant and sometimes throbbing and sharp. What is this?? I'm afraid it is an osteochondroma or soft tissue cancer. The thoracic surgeon dismissed me and told me to take an anti-inflammatory.","Doctor":"Your concern is very valid as the description that you have given is that of a slow growing tumor. It does not seem to be malignant as of now based on the long history and slow growth. However, even benign tumors can undergo malignant conversion if left untreated. The best way to ascertain this would be to undergo a biopsy from the lesion. This can be done easily on out patient basis with a thick bore needle under local anesthesia. The biopsy report will conclusively state the nature of the lesion and you can take it from there."},{"Patient":"I m so paranoid of having cancer, I m to embarrased to see me doctor to check my testicles, iv always got stomach pains, but I has a blood test not long ago and they found I had iron defficiency anaemia, would the blood test show up if I did have cancer?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. There are certain tumour markers which if present in excess can suggest possibility of malignancy. Tumour markers are substances secreted by tumour cells. So can give us clue about malignancy.  They can not replace biopsy and histopathological examination. Routinely tested tumour markers are1. CA 1252. Beta HCG3. Alpha feto protien (AFP)4.

In my opinion you should get done repeat thyroid function test.1. TSH2. Free T33. Free T4.Possibility of hyperthyroidism is more.As your symptoms like sleeplessness,  excessive sweating , cramps in leg etc are seen due to high T4.So may be your synthyroid dose is more than required and this excess hormone causes symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

I can understand your situation and problem. Cancer once confirmed,  it is incurable.  No drug or surgery or radiotherapy can cure it completely.  Radiotherapy and chemotherapy can decrease the tumour size and thus reduce the sufferings. So better to accept the situation and fate regarding uterine cancer.

Does it really take longer than a week to get Pap smear results?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. There is no direct connection between skin cancer and cervical cancer. But if moles are present on skin and cervical mucosa then if in future malignant melanoma can affect both. But possibility of this is very very rare. So no need to worry much for this. And PAP smear is routine OPD (Out patient department) procedure.  It will take maximum 1-2 days for report to come.

Firstly, you can try opioids like morphine tablets. These can be taken from a dose of 5mg thrice daily to 30mg thrice daily. There is a fentanyl patch available that you can stick on any non-hairy area of the body and it will relieve pain for 3 days when it needs to be changed. Start with a 25mg dose and if required move to a 50mg dose. Also, bone cancer pain can be decreased with Inj Zoledronic Acid 4mg intravenous in 100ml normal saline over 20 minutes, given every month. Lastly, giving short course radiotherapy to the painful area will decrease the pain and chance of fracture."},{"Patient":"Hi, I m diagnosed with Bladder cancer of 0 stage, papillary carcinoma non invasive low grade. Already 2 tumors been removed thru cystoscopy. I am under my bcg treatment. After 2nd bcg bn put into bladder, I felt more burning sensation compare to 1st installation not only while urinating but also when I held urine for a longer period. I could feel immense burning sensation at d opening of urethral opening. Also I m feeling as neck is chocking, I ve bit of coughing then, sour throat. I took ziphi plus 200 for 5-5 days after every installation. While after having so much of knowledge about my situation I keep feeling as if is there could so thing else as well with body may b a metastasis or can my cancer proceed to next stage? I mean dying mentally everyday. I can t feel happy anymore. Am always sad and angry on others. I hate looking at people with healthy life. Is it true I ll not live more? My dr doesn t talk much with me. I also feel uncomfortable all the time as if something is moving in the urinary area I feel bit itchy at that part from within...This gives scary feeling...i don t know y it s happening to me?","Doctor":"Please dont panic. You have superficial bladder cancer which has a very good prognosis and rarely spreads to other parts. It may come back in the bladder later but even then it just needs to be removed through cystoscope and remains superficial. If at any of these resections it is seen to invade the underlying muscle, only then is it dangerous and needs more extensive surgery. The problems that you are feeling are probably due to the side effects of the bcg which causes urinary infections resulting in itching, burning, etc. Just get a urinary routine microscopy done and if it shows any infection, take a course of antibiotics in consultation with your doctor. Dont interrupt your bcg and take the recommended doses.You'll be fine."},{"Patient":"I live in Japan. Sentenced a life expectancy three months has also been in the intrahepatic bile duct cancer.

Intrahepatic bile duct cancer is very notorious for recurrence and distal spread. So palliative chemotherapy is  the only option available.

I just would like to know if you can give me some idea of life expectancy for something this severe. Also, her dr gave her hormones and told her that would keep the cancer from spreading and that she can do that for 3 months while she decides if she wants to do chemo. TRUE OR FALSE???","Doctor":"The reason that the cancer returned and in a more severe form is because your daughter opted for a non-scientific method of treatment and so was under-treated. Based on her stage and extent of disease now, she should immediately start on chemotherapy and not waste time thinking about it. Hormone therapy in her case will be inferior to chemotherapy. Of course, she should be fit enough to tolerate chemotherapy which only her treating physician can tell.With proper treatment and good response to chemotherapy, her chances of living 5 years is 30% and her median survival will be 18 months."},{"Patient":"I am fifty five years old and my doctor figures my prostate is enlarged.

I can understand your situation and problem. BRCA 1 positive patients tend to have multiple organ malignancy.  And esophageal cancer us common.They have incurable disease. So we can offer only chemotherapy and radiotherapy. When tumour advances it starts obstruction to the food pipe. So swallowing is very difficult and painful. In this kind of patients feeding jejunostomy should be done.Another way is parenteral nutrition.  In which nutrients like carbohydrates,  proteins and lipids are given intravenously.

In my opinion you are having stage 4 disease, thats why surgery was not done.For stage 4 rectal cancer, only palliative treatment in the form of chemotherapy and radiotherapy is given.Radiotherapy causes tissue destruction,  pain is inevitable.

I think you are having tissue necrosis as a complicationof radiotherapy. Radiation used in cancer treatment can affect normal surrounding structures too.In normal cells, radiation causes cell death and cell injury.So healing takes place in injured cells as fibrosis.This fibrous tissue is not smooth and soft as normal cells.So post radiation hardening is due to fibrosis and scarring of damaged normal tissue.So hardening of your breast is mostly due to radiotherapy side effect."},{"Patient":"I am a 57 year old female that had lung cancer ib 2000, given 5 years to live, but I am now considered cancer free.

Postoperative chemotherapy is adviced to prevent local as well as distal spread.During surgery, due to handling of tumour mass, possibility of spillage is high. And this is the reason for local recurrence.  So post operatively chemotherapy is given.Since your wife has not taken post operative chemotherapy with increasing CA 125, growth on plain CT, all these suggest local recurrence.

By your history I think your mother has recurrent pleural effusion due to malignant spread in pleura. Since this is incurable disease, we need to give palliative treatment. For recurrent malignant pleural effusion best option is pleurodesis.  This means iatrogenic adhesion of pleural layers and thus obliteration of pleural space.  So that accumulation of fluid is not possible. For this you need to consult pulmonologist and get done thoracoscopy and removal of all fluid. Then talc powder is sprayed on surface. This will cause intense inflammatory reaction and cause fibrosis and pleural adhesion. Thus space can be obliterated.

I can understand your situation and problem. I also think that your knee pain is mostly due to muscular injury.  No need to worry much for cancer spread.Breast cancer tend tohave bone metastases.  So bones are common site for breast cancer spread. Most commonly involved bone is vertebrae and long bones like femur.Joint involvement is very uncommon.  So no need to worry.

It suggest worsening of tumour which causes bleeding.Due to blood loss in stool, anemia is unavoidable.

He has just been told that it is back again at his six month check up. They are suggesting Imbruvica. In researching this new drug, I don t completely understand some of data in reports. What is the difference between ORR and Partial Response? The percentages don t add up. 65% ORR and 49% Partial response. We are over 100% without even considering the 9% that discontinued treatment. We are just wondering if it is worth the side effects with a median response of 17.5 months. Please help us understand the numbers used in research results a little better. Thank you - Laurie Saslow","Doctor":"Firstly, you have to understand that there are 2 types of responses to a drug--complete response (CR) wherein the disease completely disappears, and partial response (PR) wherein the disease decreases substantially but doesnt disappear completely. ORR is short for overall response rate which includes any kind of response (CR or PR). Thus the figure is higher than PR alone. ORR 65% means that out of 100 patients receiving the drug, 65 patients will have some kind of response (CR or PR) while 35 patients will have no response. This is the usual response rate for most chemotherapy drugs and in my opinion you should go ahead with it if you can easily afford and tolerate it."},{"Patient":"Hello.Actually, i have 2 questions. But let me start by telling you my problem. My mother is a cancer patient and has a number of other problems as well, she she suffered 3 interventions in the past 2 months do to intestinal obstruction (if that is the correct therm). I was wondering if an intestine transplant is an option for her and if so, what is the price for this surgery and is there a clinic in Europe that performes this type of intervention. I am from Romania and transporting her har would be impossible for her to manage.I hope you understood my problem.","Doctor":"First of all, intestinal transplantation is a very complicated and difficult procedure performed by a few centres and with very poor results even at the best of centres. Secondly, it is not done for intestinal obstruction. So, in the case of your mother, intestinal transplant is completely out of the question and you should not be thinking about it. It is an unfortunate situation in which there is nothing much to be done actively but to deal with it on an as and when basis. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I've gt pain in my gut had for few days went to doc n got checked out n all was ok but I've still got the pain n recently I feel like I need a wee all time and when I go wipe myself I have blood ther but only when I wipe myself iv also started sleepin with someone n started to bleed after that ino neither ov us has any stis as we bin checked recently so what can it be","Doctor":"HelloThanks for writing to us.As you have newly started having intercourse, you could be having mild vaginal abrasion / cervical abrasion, that could bleed every time you have sex.Also, it could be a small peri anal or peri urethral tear, as it makes you feel the urge to urinate all the time.Apart from STI testing, I would recommend a visit to a gynecologist for an internal examination.Rarely, a polyp in the cervix or uterus could be causing such bleeding.All the best."},{"Patient":"My husband is taking hyddromorphone Hal 2mg tablets for cancer pain.

Can he take the hyddromorphone to help with the pain, until the patch starts to work.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Terminal stage cancer pain is very excruciating in nature. Routine painkillers will not work. We need to give centrally acting pain killers. And  fentanyl patch is excellent in cancer pain. Its action starts in 6-7 hours and last for 72 hours.So you can definitely take other centrally acting pain killers like hydromorphone till fentanyl starts its effect.So no harm in giving hydromorphone with fentanyl patch."},{"Patient":"I recently got diagnosed with having precancerous cells in my cervix.

Thanks","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. There are few causes for altered mental status and confusion in lung cancer patients. 1. Spread of tumour in brain.2. Electrolyte imbalance especially hyponatraemia (low sodium).3. Acute psychosis from the fact of having incurable disease.So get done MRI brain to rule out brain metastases. Get done S.Na+ to rule put hyponatraemia. If both are normal than consult psychiatrist to rule out acute psychosis."},{"Patient":"I had the chemo drug cisplaten 11 years ago....it effected my feet and my cancer doctor told me that I have cisplatin feet.....it has effected the nerves in my feel. Of late they have started to bother me again and I started to take Gamapentin .....my question to you is is there any thing else I could do to relieve the pain????","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Cisplatin can cause neuritis and damage the nerves.It affect the mylin sheath of the nerve and cause demylination. Due to this neuritic pain occur.  Gabapentine is drug of choice for pain management. But demylination needs vit B 12. As vit B 12 helps in mylin formation on nerve.So better to take vit B 12 supplement for better symptomatic relief. You can also take tramadol Transdermal patch for sustained pain relief. Its action lasts for 72 hours."},{"Patient":"dear Doctor  my sister cancer treatment is going on i need help from your side .now it is under going radiation therapy. after 12 nos therapy is over it is full paining of body parts like uterus balder also  cut little  please advise some product of paining","Doctor":"HiI would advise her to take tablet morphine 10 mg thrice daily after food.She also needs to take syrup duphalac 15 ml at night as morphine causes constipation.RegardsDR DE"},{"Patient":"My boyfriend is 50yrs old, was diagnosed with HIV and Hep years ago and has been doing well on his meds....in Feb he had to have his right lung drained and some scar tissue removed.

The lower 1/3 of the right lung was a mass of legions which are still there....the biopsy was cancerous and we were told he had stage 4 adenocarcinoma...he did a round of 6 treatments of chemo every 3 weeks with good results and has since had 2 maintenance treatments of the alimta (the most recent one was this past Tuesday) He has started wheezing and is coughing up blood. It was dark when he got up this morning and very pail this afternoon...should we be concerned about this?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. But coughing out blood and wheezing are not good signs in stage 4 lung cancer patient.This indicates spread of mass in bronchi (endobronchial spread). This spread causes narrowing of the lumen and obstruction.  So wheezing and blood in coughing (haemoptysis) occur.So better to consult pulmonologist and get done CT THORAX and Bronchoscopy for proper diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hi, my father(60yrs) had oral cancer and he went throgh surgery in April 2014 and then after radiation and chemotherapy.he was getting quite well but suddenly he diagnosed with lung cancer 4th stage nw.Doctor says there is no way out other than chemotherapy which can add few months to his life.plz suggest me if there is any way out to save my father s life.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. But honestly speaking stage 4 lung cancer does not carry good prognosis.  And only treatment option is palliative treatment. Palliative treatment consists of1. Palliative chemotherapy2. Palliative radiotherapy (if major vessels are not involved)3. Multivitamins4. Protien supplements etc.So no definite cure for stage4 lung cancer. This above mentioned treatment is only to reduce  suffering.  Better to discuss end of life issues with him."},{"Patient":"I had a complete hysterectomy for Stage 1B uterine cancer.  It will be four weeks since my surgery next Tuesday.  It was suggested that I have radiation one day a week for four weeks.  Is it too soon to start next Thursday. I had laproscopic surgery.  I am 63.","Doctor":"The ideal time for starting radiotherapy after surgery is between 3-6 weeks. The earlier it is started the better it is from the point of view of controlling the disease. 4 weeks is the usual time when it is started. So, if you have completed recovered from the surgery as in all the stitches have been removed, and you are taking a normal diet and are up and about, then there is no reason for you to delay radiotherapy."},{"Patient":"I am only hearing parts of my mothers condition she is suffering from stave iv gallbladder cancer that has spread to her liver. she is in the h0spital now they have just placed a stint in her bile ducts and most of her liver is covered with the cancer. she is not producing urine but they keep giving her bags and bags of fluid. what can this mean?

She has stage 4 gall bladder cancer which as it is has a very poor prognosis and a survival ranging from 3-6 months. On top of that she is in kidney failure (no urine) probably as a result of her jaundice (for which she has been stented).

My mother who is of 52 yrs of age have been getting heavly bleeding post menopause. She underwent a test where the tissues are scrapped from the cervix. the attending doctor suggested it might be cervical cancer. The test results are pending and would be available only after a week. Can you suggest what can be done now? What better way we can prepare for diagnosis or teh treatment","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Cervical cancer is common in postmenopausal women. And heavy bleeding is the initial symptom of cervical cancer.  The most confirmatory diagnostic test is cervical biopsy.But this is contraindicated inactive heavy bleeding. So you have to wait for report of scraping.You can grt done CT of lower abdomen to rule out metastases in abdominal lymphnodes. Or get done PET scan yo detect hot spots.Better to consult oncologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"Hi; I have been having a sharpe pain in my stomach just below the rib cage.I had been on Tramadol and just went off of it this past week.

They found spot on my liver, spleen and lung nodule. The lung nodule is about 2.3cm. two days after the CT i had very sharp chest pain and had to go to emergency. The doctor said it could be pneumonia so i took two kinds of antibiotic for 15days and did another CT after i finished the antibiotics the nodule is still there. I also did bronchoscopy and the result came out negative for bacteria, virus and fungus. I will have another CT two month after.  My life is very busy and stress full on top of that i am also worried about my medical condition. Could this be cancer? What is the possibility?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should not worry much about malignancy,  as your age is small for it.Spots on lung, liver and spleen can be due to 1. Benign cysts2. Healed granuloma3. Fibrotic nodules 4. Rarely malignant nodules.And your reports are also normal. So no need to worry for this.  Get done repeat scan after 6 months. If lesions are static or improving than no need to worry.But if lesions are increasing than biopsy is needed for diagnosis."},{"Patient":"i am 74 years old male. for the last one month i had ocassional back  pain.i do not smoke.not a regular drinker.1-2 pegs once or twice a week.mostly vegetarian.general health good.diabetic under controll on medication when i did a blood test  for PSA the reading shows. total prostrate specxific antigen-PSA.observed value.8.08 what should i do. should i be worried.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Normal PSA level is less than 4. So you are having higher levels.In old age (more than 60 years) causes for higher PSA level are1. Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH)2. Prostatic cancer3. Prostate infection. So better to consult urosurgeon and get done clinical examination and transrectal ultrasound.  If needed transrectal biopsy of prostate is also needed."},{"Patient":"hi im 49 yrs old i have rectal cancer i have been seen at u.c.s.f. and will be schuled for surgery in oct my question is i was told today that from the biocops they took 2 weeks ago there is ahigh displashma im hoping i spelled it right can u break it down and explain it to me tks","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion it is DYSPLASIA.  It is histopathological term.Normal cells show normoplasia. This means normal division,  normal nucleus and cytoplasm. But when cells become malignant,  they will show abnormal division,  hugh nucleo cytoplasmic ratio with irregular borders. This is known as Dysplasia.  And this indicates malignancy when present.

This will not affect her life span but will decrease the chances of the spine fracturing due to the disease and also decrease the pain. The chemotherapy however, will act on cancer throughout the body and if there is response (which occurs in 60% patients), then it will increase her life span. Cost is difficult to say and will depend on which country you belong to, the drugs being used, etc. Your treating oncologist can give you a better idea."},{"Patient":"I just had a regular mammogram yesterday and got a call today that a small nodule was found on the left side, and they wanted an ultrasound done. I will go a wk from today...should I be worried about cancer or a biopsy or what should I expect? Thank you !","Doctor":"A nodule in the breast seen on mammogram is always a worrisome thing and it needs to be ascertained whether or not it is cancer. After the radiologist has done a USG, he will give an impression as to whether it appears cancerous to him or not on mammo+usg. If he categorically says it is benign, then you need not worry and just keep it under surveillance in the subsequent mammograms. If there is any doubt of cancer, then it need to be biopsied and preferably removed surgically."},{"Patient":"hello , im waiting for operation on upper arm its quite large and sometimes it painful , the consultant says it is lymphmina nodule which has to be taken out to be sent away and tests on it to see if it has spread , i had my MRI july 4th and have to wait till , WELL into the new year for operation , i think its quite a long time to wait as im quite worried about it , should i try another hospital , thankyou from jane","Doctor":"First of all, You should undergo a simple needle test from the nodule (FNAC).This will tell us about the nature of the nodule, whether or not it is likely to be lymphoma or is it some other disease. If it is indeed cancerous and needs to be taken out, then waiting on it till the new year is not a good option and i would strongly suggest that you see another surgeon for an earlier appointment."},{"Patient":"im a 48 year old female, 5ft 150lbs, just had bilateral mastectomy for BC, got a small embolism in my lung after surgery, they have put me on fragmin (heprin) for 3 months (injection), 3 questions will this be forever?, what are the chances of an embolism happening again? and can i safely take a multivitamin daily?, thanks for your time, Bev","Doctor":"Normally, a patient does not develop pulmonary embolism after surgery for breast cancer. If this happens, there has to an underlying predisposition to clot formation. Such people are always at risk for subsequent thrombus formation and embolism. Fragmin reduces this risk but does not negate it completely. Multivitamin usage does not increase the risk and can be taken safely."},{"Patient":"my dad is having advance prostaat cancer, he cannot work or even stand up . he sleeps a lot and was yesterdag night very sick that everybody was panicking. he did not respone to nothing and could not even talk to anybody till the next day. it is so had for me cause this is right now happening in gambia and living here in the nederlands. please help me out what does this mean","Doctor":"You have not mentioned whether he is receiving any treatment for his cancer. If he is not then it is quite likely that his disease is progressing. Advanced prostate cancer, or for that matter any cancer can spread to any other part of the body. In your dad's case, it appears that the disease has spread to the brain, resulting in all these symptoms. If you want him to get better, then he will need immediate hospitalisation with injections of antibiotics, steroids, and anti-seizure drugs. Also, he will need to undergo an MRI of the brain to confirm the diagnosis. If it is indeed cancer then he will need short course radiotherapy to the brain. All this will not cure him, but make him better."},{"Patient":"My mom is 56 years old and has never had a mammogram.  She has a sister who was diagnosed with breast cancer about 7 years ago, and my mom blames past drug use on her sisters cancer.  I tried to advise my mom to go in and have a mammogram, or at the very least to do self exams, but she refuses saying that it's not needed because she has never done drugs.  so my question to you would be... Does doing drugs up your chances/causes you to get cancer?  Also if drugs do impact the chances of getting cancer, is it still likely that it could run in your family?","Doctor":"Drug usage as a direct cause for breast cancer is not established. However, it does lower your immunity and so has an indirect effect on cancer risk. However, this does not mean that people who dont do drugs cannot have breast cancer. Also, one of the strong risk factors for development of breast cancer is family history. So, if one or more members in your family have had breast cancer, then your risk for developing the same is higher than normal. So I strongly suggest that your mother undergoes yearly mammogram and monthly self exams, and if there is any abnormality on mammo or self exam then to consult an oncologist immediately."},{"Patient":"My mom has been diagnosed with cancer due to the metastasis, that start on her overies going to her kidneys, liver, lungs, and brain, but she has no cancer cells. The Dr done a biopsy on the mass on her lungs and told her they couldn't say it was or was not cancer, they had not seen anything like it. How could the dr diagnose her with cancer if there is no cancer cells, and if not cancer what could it be?","Doctor":"A lesion in the ovary that has spread to the lungs, liver, kidneys and brain is in all likelihood a cancer. There are a few tropical infections that can rarely mimic such a picture like tuberculosis, but that would not be my first diagnosis. Also, a needle biopsy from the lung lesion can miss the cancer cells half the time as it is technically difficult. It does not mean that she does not have cancer. There is a simple blood test called CA-125. If that is significantly raised then there is no doubt that your mom has cancer. If it is not raised then you can get a CT guided needle biopsy from the ovarian mass. If that is positive for cancer then you dont need to biopsy the other lesions. They are taken as metastasis based on the radiological picture alone."},{"Patient":"For about five years I have experienced heavy palpitations and squeezing in my chest which is a result of sudden movement eg getting up very quickly from a sitting position. The symptoms are random as this doesn't happen every time. I have a history of stomach problems and experience a lot of bloating. Recently, these episodes which take about one minute to subside have become more frequent, sometimes being accompanied by pain in my calves which is a new addition to the symptoms. Can you please enlighten me as to the possible causes?","Doctor":"Hi and thank you so much for this query.Palpitations always result from the heart but they do not necessarily represent a disease of the heart. It could also be caused by other illnesses not related to the heart  especially stomach problems like gastritis, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, etc.It is difficult to tell what the cause of this is without a proper exam. Also, because the frequency is increasing and additional new symptoms showing up, i would suggest that you get consulted and be evaluated fully to idntify the cause and address it. I will suggest that you get consulted first by a general physician who would recommend seeing a specialist if it so warrants from more clues that he would gather during the encounter and some basic tests like ECG.I hope this answers your query and provides guidance on how to go about addressing this worry. I wish you well and feel free to ask me more questions if need be and I would gladly respond to them.Once ore thank you so much for this opportunity to exchange with you today.Dr. Ditah, MD"},{"Patient":"I am a  65 year old male and have had oesophagus cancer since 2007. prognosis was 4-6 months, had 3 lots of chemo, gave up.

The best option in such a case is to get an esophageal stent placed. This is a simply done procedure, done on OPD basis without admission, through an endoscope. It will clear the passage and improve the lumen, allowing you to eat food normally. The only flipside is that it has a limited time period after which it gets blocked again by the tumor.

I would have preferred a 2-3 drug regime rather than  a single drug one. For your stage, with complete treatment, the 5 year survival rate is around 65-70%.

Can you explain to me why I am receiving this pain and if it can affect me horribly and cause problems after the PICC is removed. Thank You","Doctor":"There can be 2 reasons for your symptoms. One is that you are having peripheral neuropathy (weakness of nerves) which is a known side effect of certain chemotherapy drugs and recovers slowly after the drugs are discontinued. Another reason could be that you have developed thrombosis (clotting) of your arm vein due to the PICC line. I suggest that you get a doppler ultrasound done of your arm and armpit region to rule out the thrombosis. If there is thrombosis then the PICC line will have to be immediately removed and anticoaugulant drugs started.

I don t know what to think/do about the rash.","Doctor":"Hi welcome to HCMI have gone through your query regarding rashes and swollen ankles and feet?I can understand your concern for your husband getting health problems one after another .  The cause for swelling can not be singled out ,as your body works as unit - a machine .If one part of it, is damaged  machine refuses to function . Machine can only function properly if our immune system is strong . Dear in fact,Your body is always fighting something -- an infection, a toxin, an allergen, a food or the stress response -- and somehow it redirects its hostile attack on your joints, your brain, your thyroid, your gut, your skin, or sometimes your whole body. Your immune system is your defense against invaders .But when the immune system becomes weak, the disease cells can grow out of control , the disease overpowersThe inflammatory process is a byproduct of the activity of the body's immune system, which fights infection and heals wounds and injuries.Under normal conditions, the immune system has other special factors that control and limit this inflammatory process. 95% of lung cancer patients are diagnosed because they develop symptoms muscle weakness with or without tenderness  edema (swelling caused by fluid  accumulation especially in the feet and ankles)  , itchy skin or rashes  , fatigue , loss of appetite and weight loss ,  altered sense of taste,  fever .It means that a low cellular oxygenation level in newly-formed cells are actually going to turn cancerous .In 1931 Dr. Warburg won his first Nobel Prize for proving cancer is caused by a lack of oxygen respiration in cells. He stated ithat “the cause of cancer is no longer a mystery, we know it occurs whenever any cell is denied 60% of its oxygen requirements.”Of course there are secondary causes of cancer but lack of oxygen seems to be the primeFor proper blood circulation & to oxigenation & proper assimilation ,gently  but regularly do walk , head to toe  exercises without jerks ,yoga , Kapalbhatti pranayam -deep breathing ,Anulom Vilom , Bhramari are help ful for soothing nerves inducing sleep and eliminating toxins from our body and help the natural hormones work . GULPING ON MEDICINES only WILL NOT HELP CURE UNLESS WE MODIFY OUR LIFE STYLE .Our health depends on 'what we eat ,when we eat .and how we eat .

Hence I will put the matter as what I have understood from the doctors Here are the details:- 1)     My father,age-68 years old, was facing problem of blood with stool. So I did colonoscopy which showed that he has Rectum Cancer & it is just 3~5 centimeters from the anus. 2)     Meanwhile, found the cancer is WILD TYPE & not localized & some nodes(which are doubtful)  are seen in the liver, lungs as well in the prostates. 3)     So doctors advised to check him for the targeted(Neo-adjuvant) therapy & sent the biopsy to the laboratory & found that he is suitable for ERBITUX-600mg doses. 4)     Now total 4 chemos (FOLFOX with ERBITUX) is done & patient’s health seems to be well responding. 5)     Again doctors are advising to have the Sonography. 6)     Doctors saying is that he will try to kill the doubtful nodes, will shrink the tumor which is present in the rectum & it will be easy to operate on it. My queries are below:- 1)     Are we on right track 2)     Will this therapy help to recover fully at this time though it may be a stage-4 cancer. 3)     Whether the cancer can spread to the others as my father lives with me & I have a small child. Will it be in danger or will all of us be in danger…? 4)     Will just sonography help to come to conclusion to see whether patient is responding or not… 5)     Depending on the above scenario, can you generally comment on the life span of such patients…","Doctor":"First of all, your father's treatment has been standard and correct. This is the standard therapy for stage 4 rectal cancer. The chances of cure in stage 4 rectal cancer with full treatment is 25%, i.e. 25% patients will fully recover while rest will not. Cancer is not a contagious disease and does not spread from one to another by touch or contact. Touching him, playing with him, eating in the same plate does not put you at risk. Sonography is not at all enough to detect the response to the chemotherapy. You need to get a contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. As to the life span, it will depend upon the response to chemotherapy. If he is a good responder, and all of his disease is subsequently removed by surgery, then he has a 1 in 4 chance of living his normal life. Else, his lifespan will be 6-12 months."},{"Patient":"my father is 88 and has  food pipe cancer,stent has been put,doctor advice that we should just  leave it alone so that he can have quality life for few months.any advice to make his suffering minimum at latter stage. what type of diet he should take.","Doctor":"The advice that you have been given, to not receive any anti cancer treatment, is probably because of your fathers' age or the stage of the tumor or both. Either way, the cancer is going to progress with time and block the stent gradually. When this happen you can switch from solid to semi-solid and then to liquid diet, both with adequate protein to maintain his body requirements. Another option is to get another stent placed within this stent if possible when this one gets blocked. That will keep him eating for a little while longer."},{"Patient":"Husband diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer, completed his radiotherapy and chemo....but cells spread to lumbar spine and liver.

Your immune system is your defense against invaders .But when the immune system becomes weak, the disease cells can grow out of control , the disease overpowers It means that a low cellular oxygenation level in newly-formed cells are actually going to turn cancerous .In 1931 Dr. Warburg won his first Nobel Prize for proving cancer is caused by a lack of oxygen respiration in cells. He stated ithat “the cause of cancer is no longer a mystery, we know it occurs whenever any cell is denied 60% of its oxygen requirements.”Of course there are secondary causes of cancer but lack of oxygen seems to be the prime .Well dear , though it is unfortunate to get diagnosed with any type of cancer on anywhere , but you can take the reigns of your life in your hands and tame this horse & take it on to right path .As you know , pervention is better than cure .Magnitude of the survival advantage from improved nutrition, can even be greater than the magnitude of the treatment effects being targeted in current clinical drug trials .Our health depends mostly upon 'what & how & when we eat '.

If there is a drop then you will need injections of antibiotics and to increase your counts. If the counts are normal, then you need not worry about the fever.

Had Cyberknife treatment for brain tumor in December and again in October. What can be the cause of burning sensation!","Doctor":"There could be several reasons for this burning sensation. First, it could be due to damage of nerve centres in your brain during the cyberknife treatment. Second, it could be due to chemotherapy drugs if you have received any for any of your cancers as these drugs can damage peripheral nerves and cause vitamin deficiencies, both leading to such symptoms. I suggest you take a multivitamin supplement daily and a nerve strengthening agent (Tab Neurobion Forte 1 tab daily).That should improve your symptoms."},{"Patient":"i am having abdominal pain for last two months.

I had to go to loo 2-3 times in the morning. Initial stool is ok and then it is very loose.

Irritable bowel syndrome may also cause intermittent abdominal pains and a bloated sensation.Since your blood test,USG,CT are normal hence you must refer to a gastroenterologist and get an endoscopy done as an ulcer is a big possibility.I sincerely hope this will help you!TAKE CARE!"},{"Patient":"Hi, My Brother has advanced stage lung cancer that has moved to his liver.

It will be once a week for 6 weeks. He wants to take a 4 hour flight to see a friend during treatment. Will this be ok? Thanks, Lisa.","Doctor":"Generally short duration flights are not contraindicated during chemotherapy or radiotherapy. But it all depends upon the general condition of the patient. Whether he is up and about and can take care of his routine activities without any help. Even then, there is the risk of contracting infection from other people in crowded places. So, unless absolutely necessary, it is not advisable to go to crowded places like airports and planes. Besides, you will need a fit to fly certificate from your treating doctor."},{"Patient":"my mother had diagnosed with 3b cervical cancer a year back, all treatment done including radiation, barchytherapy  but not done chemo as her kidney was not suitable for chemo . now she active but her leg ha swollen & become thick. what type of treatment to done now","Doctor":"swelling of one or two legs in your mothers' case warrants that recurrence of her disease in the abdomen be ruled out. It is quite common in advanced stage cervical cancer for the disease to recur, particularly since the treatment was suboptimal (no chemo was taken). It comes in the form of nodes in the abdomen which press on the veins draining the legs leading to swelling of the same. A CT scan of the whole abdomen will give the correct picture."},{"Patient":"my husband had renal carcinoma 2 years ago and they removed his left kidney - the tumor was very large and some entered the renal vein.

I assume that the x-ray done at the time of surgery was normal. However, it is quite possible, considering the advanced tumor (entered the renal vein), that the tumor has come back in the lungs. Lungs as it is is the most common site of metastasis for kidney cancer. A contrast enhanced CT scan of the chest or a PET/CT will determine whether this shadow is really the tumor coming back or something else. If it is indeed the tumor, then your husband will need to be placed on targeted therapy (tablet therapy for cancer)"},{"Patient":"I have a patient aged 49 years with mucoal primaries. in tongue (Malignant Melanoma).

Your treatment so far appears to have been correct and scientific. My only concern is to rule out that the cancer has not spread to other parts of the body. For this, a PET scan will be ideal as it will scan the whole body.

Is this normal or an indication of an underlying issue?","Doctor":"Chemotherapy does not cause fall in body temperature. Infact, if anything it can lead to rise in temperature. However, fall in temperature is a common menopausal symptom. Also, chemotherapy is known to accentuate menopausal symptoms in women approaching menoapuse. It is nothing that you should be concerned about.

We understand that this is a slow growing cancer but can b very painful if it can get into the nerves so we thought we should go ahead with surgery taking the heart risks involved .Can u advice if it would b worth taking the risk ?","Doctor":"You have been advised correctly. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a tumor arising from salivary glands anywhere in the oral or nasal cavity. It is indeed a slow growing tumor but it can spread to other parts of the body when it becomes curable. If it hasnt spread, then the only curative option is surgical removal. Radiation has no role. However, I would suggest that you get the surgery done by a cancer surgeon and not an ENT specialist as complete removal is essential else the tumor will come back.

The biopsy report you have mentioned is suggestive of malignant recurrence. The cells in histopathology termes as dysplastic when they are malignant.

So desired site can be targeted with out harm to other tissue.To prevent distal spread chemotherapy is needed.She can also have other palliative treatment like nutritional support in the form of multivitamins and protien powder, Painkiller drugs for subsiding cancer pain."},{"Patient":"I have a tumor at the base of my neck..it moved to the side of my neck and is now formed a oozing pocket. When I went to the Doctor and had a hospital stay the test came back no cancer. I went to go get the oozing pocket taken care of an they told me it now may be cancer. I am getting to a cancer dr asap. if it is not cancer and the tumor is non cancerous why is it oozing","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you are having cervical abscess. Neck area (cervical collar) is full of lymphnodes. And these nodes can sometimes infected and become enlarged.If proper treatment was not started, the center of the node becomes necrotic and liquifies and produce pus like material. It is known as cervical abscess.It can be due to malignancy also.So best way to confirm is aspiration of fluid and get done cytology,  routine microscopy and culture and sensitivity. If cytology shows atypical cancerous cells than you are having malignancy. But if cytology is negative and culture grows bacteria that means this is infective abscess.So better to get done aspiration of fluid and its tests."},{"Patient":"Hi there. Today I was hearing a clicking in my head. I got an ear ache and my nose started bleeding and now I feel completely wiped. Searching my symptoms didnt help my anxiety much because a symptom analyzer said it could either be a Nasal Polyp or Leukemia!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Nasal bleed can be seen in a lot of conditions.  And leukemia is not that common. So no need to worry much for leukemia. Common causes for nasal bleed are1. Nasal polyps2. Local trauma3. Chronic rhinitis4. Hypertension (uncontrolled)5. Foreign body in nose6. Rarely leukaemia. So no need to worry for leukaemia. Other sign, symptoms of leukaemia are1. Weight loss2. Decrease appetite3. Abdominal pain4. Hepato speenomegaly.5. Anaemia6. Cervical lymphadenopathy. Etc."},{"Patient":"My boyfriend just finished radiation for tonsil cancer and he has excess phylem. Every time he eats a little something he can t stop spitting/coughing up phylem. He has been having chicken brith with noodles & scrambled eggs. Tried protein shakes because he lost 20 pounds but those gave him even more phylem. Can you suggest anything?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should first consult pulmonologist and get done chest x ray and CT THORAX (if needed) to rule out lung infection and radiation pneumonitis. Radiotherapy makes person immunosuppressive,  so chances of lung infection ( pneumonia ) are very high. So chest x ray is needed.Another possibility for your cough is radiation pneumonitis. It is not infection but inflammation produced in lung parenchyma by radiation. So tissue edema develops and this causes coughing.CT THORAX is needed for diagnosis. And steroids are the only treatment for this.So better to consult pulmonologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"My 17 year old daughter who is not & has not been sexually active, informed me last night she s had bleeding going on for 2 weeks and its not from her periods which are regular.

Very concerned, we lost our 34 yr old cousin in October to stage 4 colorectal cancer.","Doctor":"HIWell come to HCMI really appreciate your concern this could be menses blood only and nothing to worry about this, looking to age of your daughter this is not the cancer and this is just out of question, hope this information helps, take care."},{"Patient":"I have poly cystic ovaries ( sugery 4 years ago to remove 5 lb cyst) and had a pap smear 12 months ago that I just found out had precancerous cells. I am 23 y/o and had been told it was fine but PA said changes have occured and now precancerous cells are worse ( not sure what that means so looking for info. I don t have HpV as I had a vacine in high school. Symptoms:I have back pain, weight gain, nausea, cramping and fatique. I will call OBGYN in am to request an ultrsound. Do you have any suggestions ?","Doctor":"Poly cystic ovaries is not something that you should be worried about since they are not precancerous. As far as the PAP report is concerned, it is something that should be taken seriously since the degree of pre-cancer cells have increased. I would suggest that you undergo a colposcopic examination (in this they put a dye on your cervix and examine it carefully. Any suspicious area is biopsied). This will settle the diagnosis beyond doubt and start appropriate treatment."},{"Patient":"hello, my father is suffering from ITP, he is also a patient of diabetes and taking insulin since two years. He is in hospital now but after giving steroids and IViG there is no improvement in platelets counts? some says it is the symptoms of blood cancer,is it true?","Doctor":"It is rarely a symptom of blood cancer and had your father been suffering from blood cancer it would have shown in other tests. A small % of ITP patients do not respond to steroids and IViG. These patients need to undergo a surgery for removal of their spleen (splenectomy). That cures them forever of their condition and corrects the platelet counts."},{"Patient":"My husband was diagnoised with Stage III A, Non small cell cancer in lung with 2 lymph nodes showing signs, after 4 months the tumor had grown .7 cm and lymph node .9cm.

In my opinion it is mostly benign tumour. Either Neurofibroma or schwannoma or ganglioma. Chances of malignancy are very rare.The only treatment for this is surgical removal. So better to get done surgical removal and histopathological examination of tumour. This will give us confirm diagnosis. And the surgery for this is very simple. Done under local anaesthesia.  So very less chances of complication."},{"Patient":"what r the effects of long term domestic animals (cat and dogs) urine and feces, inside the houselold?there r alot of animals and the people are older on of which is going through radiation treatments every day. there are 6 or7 dogs and at least 3 cats.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Domestic animals are usually safe and does not cause much problems.  But in susceptible patients they can cause allergic diseases like asthma, contact dermatitis etc. And parasitic infection through faeco-oral route is also seen if hygiene of pets are not maintained. So better to take proper hygienic care of pets, to avoid such diseases. So if pets are properly taken care, they will not creat any problems to radiation patients."},{"Patient":"I have pain in my abdomen, it comes an goes, in intensity, my xrays show no stones, and although there is a little blood in the urine the 24 hour doctor I saw said I have no infection, she thought rather I might have stones.

In the beginning I also pulled/ stressed my dorsal muscle picking up a little bundle of joy! which confused the issue. This happened about Thursday morning last week .Regards  Lynn","Doctor":"hello dearif you had mentioned how much RBCs were there in urine examinaton, i would have helped you more. some stones are radioluscent mean they are not visible on xrays. you can pick them on ultrasonography or IVU. you should also have your renal profile get done.Regards"},{"Patient":"I have just been told I have fatty atropy of pancrease and I have rheumatoid arthritis and my sister had cystic fibrosis is it serious I did get very black stools and had endoscopy in stomach but can t find any thing there am worried about pancrease cancer and I get very bad abdominal pains where I feel like I am going to pass out and get palpations in my stomach at the same time","Doctor":"Dear friend, I guess you should first wait for the complete investigations to be over as one cannot tell from these symptoms or investigations whether you have pancreatic cancer or not. Best is to investigate further in  form of CT abdomen with contrast and know what is causing abdominal bleeding do let me know if you have any more questions."},{"Patient":"I HAD A POLYP RFEMOVED THAT WAS HYPERPLASTIC, THE BIOPSIES SHOWED A PATTERN WITH ISCHEMIA. wHAT DOES THIS MEANS? HOW DID IT COME ABOUT? THANK YOU, EAP/SALEM","Doctor":"I assume that you had a polyp removed from your intestine through an endoscope, since you havent mentioned the site. A hyperplastic polyp is simoly a raised area in the intestine that is very commonly seen in individuals. It is not cancerous nor does it convert into cancer later on. All you need to do is maintain follow up with a gastro-enterologist at 6 monthly intervals and whenever you get any symptoms."},{"Patient":"I have had 3 P/E s I am on 18000 units of Fragmin. I have cancer as well. I have been on Fragmin for well over a year. I consider my latest P/E as a fragmin failure. I will consult with my hematologist but I want to switch medications to better manage my clotting.","Doctor":"The reason for your P/E s could be dual. One it could be a failure of Fragmin, or an increase in your cancer load since the cancer is the probable cause of your increased coagulability state. If the cancer is increasing, then you need to step up whatever anti-cancer treatment you are taking, if that is possible. Otherwise, it might be worthwhile checking the dose of Fragmin. It is given at 1mcg per kg body weight. If the dose is correct then you might should switch to Tab Acitrom starting at 1mg per day, and checking your INR report after 1 week. thereafter you have to titrate the dose to keep the INR at between 2-2.5"},{"Patient":"My father passed away from AML (Acute Melogenist Leukemia) at 63 years.

Both involve blood and bone marrow as far as I know, correct? Thank you much. No disrespect, but I am on Unemployment right now and have no money to pay for my concerned question. Thanks anyway.","Doctor":"Dear friend, I am terribly sorry to hear about your father and friend. AML is a highly malignant disease with poor survival. but there are different types of AML. I guess the most important step for you to know is, whether it is Type 3 or not( ACute promyelocytic leukemia). This disease has a specific treatment in form of ATRA drug that is orally available, but needs to be taken care under proper supervision. Rest of the AMLs have worse prognosis and are usually treated with very toxic drugs like cytarabine and doxorubicin. bone marrow transplant is also an option. please let me know the type of AML your friend has and I will guide you accordingly. Also let me know if you have any more questions."},{"Patient":"Hi Doc, My mother was diagnosed having a squamous carcinoma large non keratinizing, her age is already 51 years old, what is the best treatment we can do to fight this cancer, Also she is having a problem regading the white liquid discharge in his genitals, how can we prevent/ or lessen the discharge so that she will be comforted on the situation. thanks in advance","Doctor":"Dear friend, I am sorry to hear the diagnosis about cancer. Squamous carcinoma large cell non keratinzing type have a slightly aggressive course. however what we need to know here is how far has it spread. I believe its the cervical region you are talking about, then whether it has reached uterus or pelvis or any lymph nodes. Ask the doctor to get a ct scan done of the pelvis and we will be in a better position to answer the question. also about the white liquid discharge, can have many causes. the best way is for a gynecologist to examine it and see if it is infectious or tumor related. meanwhile she needs to maintain good genital hygiene in form of proper bathing, luke warm water cleaning of genital area and wearing clear tampoons. and regularly changing the tampoons. Please do not use unsterilized clothes as it can cause dangerous systemic infections.

My hemoglobin was 7. I was sent for a colonoscopy and they removed polyps and I was deemed to having a very twisted colon. I had my CT Scan on Thursday and it will take 2 weeks before my results are sent to the doctor. My doctor called and wants me to begin iron intraveneously weekly because my iron is low and my hemoglobin levels has lowered since my transfusions. Unfortunately, I am in constant pain and by the end of the day I am so bloated and uncomfortable. Is this a concern for colon cancer?","Doctor":"Low hemoglobin and bloating pain does  not cause colon cancer. However, they may be the presenting symptoms of colon cancer as the cancer continues to bleed until treated. Since your hemoglobin continues to fall despite transfusions and there were polyps inside your colon, there is a definite concern for the same. The biopsy report of the polyps that have been removed and the CT scan will clear the picture."},{"Patient":"Following is my Biopsy report. Is it normal or is there something to worry about? Sections examined from incisional biopsy show fragments of fibrocollagenous tissue with focal salivary gland tissue. Heavy acute and chronic inflammation with focal foreign body type gaint cell reaction is seen. Fibroblastic proliferation with ectatic blood vessels are also identified. Few blood vessels appear thrombosed and congested. Surrounding areas of fibrosis are also present. Diagonsis: Incisional biposy: Acute and chronic non-specific inflammation, granulation tissue and fibroblastic proliferation","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should not worry much about cancer as per this report. I guess this report is from salivary gland. And it clearly mentioned acute on chronic inflammation and fibroblast proliferation. This is characteristics of chronic infection like TB.So no need to worry for malignancy,  treat infection.  You may need antibiotic and anti inflammatory drugs."},{"Patient":"They found a. 9.5 cm lymphoepithelial cyst on a part of a ovary left from a hysterectomy when I was 27.

Could it be cancer ?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should not worry much about cancer.  Torn tendon does not suggest malignancy. It may be due to mal union or non union of the injured tendon.And pain is also due to this.So better to get it removed surgically. And send the sample for histopathological examination to rule out malignancy. In my opinion it will not come malignant lesion. So no need to worry much."},{"Patient":"Hi I have a flutter below my belly button, had stretching feeling in lower abdomen, cramps of course, light blue veins in my breasts, sharp pains in my vagina every now and again, backaches, runny nose, and this is all 3 days before my period is due.

Yes, you can definitely use colour in your hair.

It is very common complication after whipple's operation. In whipple's operation many of the abdominal organs are resected,so the total surface area of gut which is important In absorption also  decreased. So orally given nutritional  supplements are not absorbed properly. So deficiency occured.Best treatment in this patient is parenteral nutrition.  In this intravenous infusion containing carbohydrates,  lipids, aminoacid, vitamins and trace elements is given.

End stage lung cancer with brain metastases carry very bad prognosis. In her case emergency should be considered when1. She becomes unconscious and not responding to pain or verbal command.2. She is drowsy and not following command. 3. Her chest movements are diminished and hardly taking 1-2 deep breaths like gasping.4.

The common ones are1. Chronic cystitis (chronic infection of bladder)2. Senile changes due to progression of age.3. Malignant involvement of bladder.etcSo in my opinion if he is not having any bladder symptoms like lower abdominal pain or blood in urine or painful urination, than no need for further investigation. Just get done repeat MRI after 6 months.And if he is symptomatic than get done cystoscopy and biopsy to rule out malignancy."},{"Patient":"My mother has bone cancer.

It is not normal at all.It is common side effect after chemotherapy and radiotherapy especially in end stage cancer in old age patients. It is due to weakness from1. Disease itself2. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy3. Decrease oral Intake. So better to start nutritional support in the form of protien supplements,  multivitamin containing zinc,  folic acid and vitamin b 12.

Many chemotherapy drugs are toxic on kidneys and actually damage them.Ultrasound finding of renal parenchymal disease suggest renal toxicity only.The first and foremost step is to stop chemotherapy.  Drink plenty of fluids. Low dose diuretic is given to stimulate urine.Avoid fruits and fruit juices. Avoid over the counter pain killers as they are nephrotoxic too.Repeat creatinine every 3rd day to see for decreasing trend.And start new chemotherapy agent after normalisation of creatinine,  which is not nephrotoxic."},{"Patient":"i has sugercy remove pancreas tail tumor and slpeen both i become weak and hurt my bones on my arm both and my leg on right side and knee and usually to dizzy and low iron how be cause come from ? and my doctor told me that I has little high from CEA .. can u explian to me ?","Doctor":"Although a high CEA is not specific, but it may denote that the cancer that had been removed alongwith your pancreas, has come back. That could be the reason for your bone pains and dizziness. I suggest you get a contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and a bone scan. That will confirm or refute the suspicion.

I really feel defeated.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. But end stage lung cancer is not having good prognosis. And since you are saying that now cancer had spread to other lung and nodes, this means worse prognosis. The aim of chemotherapy is not to cure cancer. It is given to slow down progression and reduce the suffering. So if you are not taking chemotherapy now, your life expectancy will be less than 6months. But with chemotherapy your life expectancy is less than 1 year and that too with reduced suffering.  So better to start chemotherapy and no need for such negative attitude. You need psychiatric counselling for end of life issues."},{"Patient":"I am 20 years old and have a two year old son. I have a petite body build and have not gained much weight lately.

No need to worry much for cancer.  As your age is too young to have cancer. Cancer lumps are generally not painful so again less chances of malignancy in your case.In my opinion you should first get done mammography of right breast.This will tell you about your breast lump.

Last stage pancreatic cancer cannot be cured and has a very poor outcome and short life span. I am sorry to be the bearer of bad news but your mother doesnt have long to live. So i suggest that you give her the minimum possible discomfort and do not think of any active anti-cancer treatment."},{"Patient":"My son has terminal bowel cancer. He has a perforation and has an infection. This is being treated with Iv antibiotics. There is no chance of surgery. Is this course of treatment likely to work? If antibiotics don t work is there any further course of action to be taken.","Doctor":"If there is a perforation of the bowel through the cancer your son is suffering from, then it is unlikely to heal with antibiotics alone. The treatment is only surgical repair of the perforation. I hope there is a very strong reason for not operating upon him, since the situation is life threatening in the absence of surgery. The infection also will continue to spread as long as the perforation persists. A remote possibility is that the perforation seals on its own and then the antibiotics take care of the infection, but that scenario is very rare."},{"Patient":"mom just had a biliary stent for pancreatic cancer stage 2. No mets but the distal common bile duct was obstructed. She is healthy except for thyroid disease (Hashimotos). She has had excessive belching causing a lot of pain in her belly prior to being able to release the air. What is causing the belching?","Doctor":"A lot of belching means that the pancreatic cancer, besides obstructing the distal common bile duct has also started to obstruct the duodenum (the part of the small intestine that drains the stomach). This can be ascertained by an upper GI endoscopy. Also, if it continues or progresses to vomiting, she may require a duodenal stent. At the same time, i Hope she is undergoing some form of anti-cancer treatment for her disease since pancreatic cancer stage 2 is potentially curable."},{"Patient":"I recently went to the er with stomach pain. I thought it was my ventral hernias. The doctor did a ct scan and said I have a slightly enlarged liver and spleen as well as bilateral l5 spondylolsis. My report for ct reads hepatomegaly/hepatic steatosis 25.7 cm craniocaudal dimensions. Splenomegaly 14.7 cm in greatest dimension. Gallbladder, pancreas and adrenal glands are within normal limits. Kidneys are grossly within normal limits. No focal gastric abnormalities. 2 central hernias similar to prior study the more superior of which measures 11.9 c mon greatest dimension and contains normal appearing transverse colon. No obstruction or gross incarcerations. The more inferior fat-containing hernia measures 6.3 cm in greatest diameter without interval change. Bilateral L5 spondylolsis. What does all of this mean. He told me to see my doctor the same day. But they are all booked up for a week. My health history is as follows I have high blood pressure, diabetes ( I take metformin), morbidly obese, fibromyalgia. Past history of seizures as a child I had 1 grand mal seizure and ovarian cysts, cyst in left follopian tube that burst and required emergency surgery. I don t drink, smoke or do drugs. I am hsv positive","Doctor":"This simply means that you have 2 hernias (ventral) in your abdominal wall. into the defect of these hernias, part of the large intestine has entered. Presently, they are not causing any problems except the pain that you felt, but there is a possibility of several complications that might occur in the future if left untreated. These could be irreducibility of the hernia, blocking of the intestinal passage, gangrene of overlying skin etc. It is highly advisable that you undergo laparoscopic hernia repair with mesh at the earliest."},{"Patient":"My 14 year old daughter was admitted to hospital last wk with pain in right side of tummy, scans were taken but everything came back ok also bloods were taken every two hours and that was fine. Due to the painshe was given paracetamol and nefapam and sent home the next day. I was told it could be a cyst on the ovary  maybe lymph nodes around intestine infected but they just weren't sure. Now a week on and she's been double up so back to hospital they felt her tummy and said there's no serious problems. My worry is what do I do if this continues as she is in a lot of pain when this happens","Doctor":"Hi, it appears that she has an urinary tract infection, or a small stone in the ureter, or may be the iliocaecal tuberculosis.                         So i advise you to consult a gastro enterologist for diagnosis and treatment. You may need to have M.R.I. for confirmation. Thank you."},{"Patient":"i was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the endometrium and ge junction leiomyoma fro which I had radical hysterectomy - not followed by radiation or chemo. After 20 months an ultrasound indicates mildly dilated right pelvicalyceal system. How is this going to impact me? Is it something complicated?","Doctor":"The mildly dilated right pelvicalyceal system could be because of the previous surgery. It is possible that the ureter of the right side has partly gotten blocked due to the surgery. Another possibility is that there may be a recurrence in the area of the ureter. Lastly, it may just be the result of a mild urinary infection or stone. I would suggest that you get a contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen. That will settle the issue."},{"Patient":"My sister was diagnosed with thyroid cancer this past Summer, she had surgery to remove her thyroid in Aug and we were told that it was caught in time and it had not spread nor was it in her bloodstream. Well she had her annual pap and now they are saying they found C2 level cancer cells...she is only 30 years old. They haven't said were the cancer is, but how serious is C2 level and could this in any way be linked to the thyroid cancer?","Doctor":"Your sister probably has a condition called CIN2 which is a condition of the cervix (the last part of the uterus) which if left untreated can progress in half the cases to cancer of the cervix. you have 2 options. Either get a PAP smear repeated every 6 months to see if the CIN2 is progressing. Or, she can undergo a colposcopic examination done along with biopsy of any suspicious area. This will ensure that she does not have anything sinister. Also, this has nothing to do with her thyroid cancer."},{"Patient":"I am having chemotherapy as my CEA was 65 and Petscan indicted that some liver cysts that have been there for 2 years, may have become cancerous. After 4 sessions of chemo the CEA is down to 10 but my gamma GT is up from 33 to 65. Could this be due to the chemo? I had a 5th session today (Wed) and after the 6th in 2 weeks I will have another Petscan to see if surgery is necessary. Should I be worried about the gamma GT as I drink wine most days but below the recommended maximum levels.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should not worry much about this much rise in GGT.GGT is the enzyme raised when there is obstruction in the billiary tract. But in this rise of GGT is many folds. So GGT of 65 is nothing to worry about.It has nothing ti do with chemotherapy.  This may be a laboratory variation. So get your chemotherapy as per schedule and get done follow up PET scan to see for improvement."},{"Patient":"Hi my mother metastatic cancer to liver brain. Dr told us to cut the chemo she s terminal. She uses keppra and kordexa. Willit be correct if i had her drink daily wheat grass juice. Would it interact negatively with her medication? Or would it damage her liver even more and lessen the effects of keppra kordexa","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Terminal liver cancer has worse outcome.And no need to worry , you can give wheat grass juice. This will not interact with drugs she is taking.If she is tolerating and liking wheat grass juice , you should give it. It has no bad effect on liver, as wheat is easy to digest and recommended in liver diseases. So you can give this without fear."},{"Patient":"my father aged 75yrs old a small node his left side of neck....he go to scanned......in scan report told well defined heteroechoic lesion areas of necrosis noted in the left side of neck measuring 3.9 *3.2cm with diffuse surrounding inflammatory fat stranding noted. The lesion shows increased peripheral vascularity. intra luminal echogenic thrombus noted in the left internal jugular vein measuring 2.3*1 cm pls u r advice to further treatment.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In old age any neck node with size of 4×3cm, should be investigated for malignancy. Possibility of metastatic node in his case is more, due to following things.1. Age more than 60 years.2. Size of the node is quite large.3. Associated with heterogeneity and increase blood supply. 4. Associated with thrombus in jugular vein.So better to get done biopsy from the node and get done histopathological examination. If it turn out to be malignant to be malignantthan we need search for the primary site. Most common primary organs are1. Lungs2. Liver3. Gastro intestinal tract4. Lymphomas etc.So get done biopsy of the node first."},{"Patient":"Hello. My husband has gone to the doctor a number of times and they ve told him he needs to get a bone scan. They found something in his hand after he had a MRI. His should hurst all the time and his in constant pain. Bone cancer is on their minds. We have have found a hard lump on his elbow. It looks and feels like his bone is sticking out. What do you have in mind?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Bone cancer can cause following symptoms. 1. Constant bone pain.2. Swelling (hard, painful)3. Pathological fractures due to osteoporosis of involved bone.4. Typical x ray findings of demineralisation and fracture and mass.So your husband's all symptoms are suggestive of bone cancer.  So we need to rule out this first.Bone scan is must before biopsy.  So get done bone scan first and than biopsy to confirm the diagnosis."},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed july 2013 and had surgery, chemo and brachytherapy for uterine cancer which was clear cell and adenocarcinoma.

I was diagnosed at stage Ia.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. But vaginal spotting can be the early symptom of local recurrence. You had completed your chemotherapy since November 2013. So not on any treatment since 12 months. This duration is sufficient enough to produce recurrence at local site. So wait for CA125 and PAP smear result. You may need CT abdomen and PET scan to rule out local recurrence."},{"Patient":"I am 69 years old and have high blood pressure that I have been taking meds for since I was 25. both parents had it as well as my brother. it is well controlled at this time.

There are several factors (environmental- excessive smoking,alcohol intake, excessive sun exposure, fatty diet, dye exposure, industrial wastage). Hereditary- runs in families. survival rate depends on the stage (stage 1- live longer, stage 4- less survival due to  metastasis (other organs involvement).   early detection, early stage, early treatment - survival is good.

My question is how bad can this be?","Doctor":"There are basically 2 types of colon polyps. One that have a very low risk of turning into cancer and the other that have a high risk. Severe dysplasia is the pre-cancerous condition that precedes the formation of cancer. It always develops into cancer if left to grow. Hence it needs to be removed either endoscopically or surgically.

I can understand your situation and problem. Breast cancer when metastatize to liver and nodes, it becomes stage 4 cancer. It is inoperable and incurable disease. The only treatment available is palliative treatment which includes,  palliative chemotherapy,  palliative radiotherapy, painkiller drugs and nutritional supplements.

Now her lymph nodes are suspicious on U/S and they are reporting vascularization in some cervical nodes..also suspicious ...what does this mean? they want a needle bx i","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Any cancer can spread by three routes.1. Lymphatic route 2. Hematogenous route3. Direct spread.So lymphatic spread is very common in gastrointestinal tumours and thyroid tumour. So if your ultrasound report suggest increase vascularity in enlarged node, you need to rule out malignancy first. And for this needle biopsy is needed.So get done Needle biopsy."},{"Patient":"Hi, my mother of 72 years old was diagnosed with mesothelioma stage IV and since then she ve received 8 rounds of chemo and had a laparoscopy to removed some organs but now they are gonna stop the chemo treatment and probably she will have another surgery, not laparoscopy tho. I d want to know, and appreciate your honest answers, how long is the life expectancy in this specific case?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Mesothelioma is very rare kind of malignancy involving peritoneum and pleural layers. And it is aggressive too.So whenever it is detected, it is stage 4 (inoperable) disease only.So only palliative chemotherapy is needed.Average life expectancy is less than 2 years.Since she was not on chemotherapy and  her general condition is worsening too, so in my opinion life expectancy is less than 6-7 months. Discuss end of life issues and give her pain relief and nutritional support."},{"Patient":"Hi, I was diagnosed with an ovarian cyst a little less than a month ago. I have my first OBGYN appt on Friday. I am 21 years old. I have been doing research and I am very nervous. Sometimes I have found to have no appetite, however not all of the time. I am not sure if this is because I am worried about the chance of cancer or related to the cyst. The pain is bearable and comes and goes, but is still there.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should not worry much about cancer.  You are too young to have cancer.Not all ovarian cysts are cancerous. So no need to worry much. At your age due to hormonal imbalance, ovarian cysts can be seen. And no treatment is required as they are benign mostly. Only regular follow ups with ultrasound every 6 monthly is needed.And if you still want to rule out malignancy,  better to get done biopsy from cyst. Otherwise no need to worry for cancer. This cyst will not harm you."},{"Patient":"My father is 83 and has had previous large b cell lymphoma that he recovered from. the other day during a scan by his heart m.d. a large mass showed up on his liver. he has had nausea and vomiting the last several weeks. he was told he has lymphoma again and a biopsy of his liver is to be done next week. What is the possible prognosis and survival rate. Thanks so much!!!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Lymphomas have two phases in all patients. 1. Remission2. Crisis. Your father is having crisis phase right now. Appearance of new  lesion in liver indicates worsening of disease. And biopsy is must.Usual five year survival with B cell lymphoma is 60%.

What are the chances of having cancer?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should first get done biopsy of the thyroid nodule (largest). Recurrent thyroid nodules and multiple lung nodules indicate cancer mostly.So for tissue diagnosis biopsy and histopathological examination is must. Thyroid cancers especially papillary cancer is notorious in lung spread and causing hyperthyroidism.

I would suggest that you reconsider. There are new tablet therapies available for advanced incurable liver cancer that can be easily tolerated by most people with minimal side effects and that relieve a lot of the symptoms of the cancer like pain and loss of appetite. Sorafenib is the name of the drug and you should consider taking it in conjunction with your oncologist. For the pain, you can take Duragesic Patches 25mg/50mg.

Rectal cancer when metastatize to liver is staged as end stage rectal cancer ( stage 4).So full recovery is not at all possible. Chemotherapy is givrn to reduce the tumour size and burden.

Bladder cancer with metastases in other distal organs carry very bad prognosis. Usual life expectancy is less than 1 year.

My pancreatic cancer has now metastasized in several spots in my liver and one spot in my left hip. My Oncologist wants me to start Gemzar again. Do you know much about 2nd coursed=s of the chemo?","Doctor":"It would have helped if you had mentioned the time passed since the first course of chemotherapy. If more than 6 months have passed then your disease did respond to chemotherapy and it would be worthwhile to take another course if your general condition is good enough to tolerate the chemotherapy. If less time has passed then your disease is probably not responsive to these drugs in which case you should either take a different line of chemotherapy or consider taking targeted therapy. Targeted therapy is a form of tablet therapy which has fewer side effects but with lesser effect on the tumor than chemotherapy.

What is that enzyme test not an alt or ast. The word cancer was mentioned. It s upsetting to say the least","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion enzymes other than ALT and AST , which suggest malignancy are1. GGT (Gamma Glutyl Transferase)2. ALP (Alkaline Phosphates).GGT is elevated if tumour in liver causes obstruction in the billiary system.ALP is again raised in liver cancers as it is produced by liver.So mostly these two enzymes are responsible for probability of malignancy in your husband's case.Better to get done CT or MRI and guided biopsy.  As biopsy is the diagnostic test for malignancy."},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with a cyst in the left breast 2 years ago. I have recently had a mammogram and ultrasound. the new radiologist does not think this is a cyst and wants me to have a needle aspiration biopsy to check for cancer. I am getting a second opinion and having another ultrasound done first. A cyst cannot turn cancerous right??","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Breast cysts are usually benign in nature.But can turn into malignancy in future.  Though the chances are very less, but possibility can not be denied. That's why follow up mammography is always indicated for early detection of cancer.So new radiologist might find something unusual in cyst appearance,  so he order needle aspiration to rule out early malignancy. So in my opinion you should get done Needle Aspiration to rule out malignancy."},{"Patient":"Please help as I m really scared. History of endo. Thought I was peri menopausal as over past year periods changing. Getting closer together also lasting longer. Went to Gp as bleed for 25 days and he put me on norethisterone with no break pending investigation. Went for scan and have urgently been referred to gyne oncology as uterus lining 44 mm thick . Does it definitely mean I have cancer or can there be another explanation. I am 46 and don t want to die this early","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should not worry much about malignancy. As menopausal women tend to have thicker endometrium. After menopause hormonal changes occur specially estrogen  decreases , so the effects of estrogen are also lost.Estrogen causes secretory endometrium and absence causes dry, atrophic and thickened  endometrium.So mostly 44 mm thickness is due to loss of estrogen effect and not malignancy."},{"Patient":"I have a constant scab in my nostrils, at the top, which affects both sides of my nasal cavities, sometimes making it difficult to breath through my nose. When I clear the scab I can breath properly again. Is it cancer? It obviously emits a smell, as my dog goes mad when I blow my nose, trying to get near my face.......","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you are having chronic sinusitis or polyps.So clinical examination with ENT surgeon is needed.You may require CT scan of paranasal sinuses and endoscopy of sinuses.Less chance s of malignancy. So consult ENT surgeon and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"I am 32, 340, 5\\"7. I have been diagnosed with anemia and my sed rate is high, the dr says that shows inflammation in my hody but they don't know where it is.

This has been going on for almost 3 years. And my back and thighs are itchy,  a real deep itch. Do you have any ideas?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for using healthcare magicESR or erythrocyte sedimentation rate checks for non specific inflammation.An increased ESR is indicative of inflammation/infection but it does not specify where the problem is located.Fever and night sweats can occur in infections such as TB but can also occur in other conditions such as leukemia and lymphoma,  among others.The CT scan would determine if there are any lesions in the abdomen or pelvis that may be contributing to your symptoms.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I have an itch at the tailbone and when I wipe it it is bleeding only on the paper but enough to scare me. And the is always pain in the lower back. I did have a fall about 2 years ago and bec. It was workers comp it went untreated also I id have anal cancer in 2008 can this be related","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should first get done local examination of anus and rectum by surgeon. As possibility of recurrence of anal malignancy is high.So get done proctoscopy and biopsy if mass like lesion is visualised. Your chronic back pain can also be due to anal malignancy."},{"Patient":"What happens when you stop taking the mood stabilizers and anti-psychotic medication and starting menopause with no hormone trxeatment due to breast cancer (ductal incarcineria) and on ahigh doses of pain medication. I have stop taking my bi-polar due to loss of health insurance and can not afford to pay full cost of bi-polar meds","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. If you are on mood stabiliser and antipsychotic drugs and you suddenly stop all these, there will be withdrawal symptoms. The symptoms are1. Mood swings from hypo mania to hyper mania2. Hallucinations3. Negative thoughts4. Palpitations5. Headache and giddiness6. Too much hunger or loss of hunger7. Involuntary bowel habits.8. Violent behaviour etc.And you are also in menopause.  So this can also affect your cognitive function if you stop these drugs suddenly. So better to continue these drugs. Consult psychiatrist and ask him for cheaper alternatives."},{"Patient":"Yes. My GI doctor is worried about my fatty liver, which I ve had for years (40). I am also anemic and have had gold-colored stool for years. They have found cysts in my liver, so far. I am a 67 year old female. Does it sound to you like I may have cancer? They also found 6 polyps in my stomach and colon, recently.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should first get done stool microscopic examination to rule out occult blood.Since you are anemic I think you have chronic slow blood loss in stool.And if occult blood in stool is present than possibility of cancer is high.You may need CT ABDOMEN and colonoscopic biopsy of the polyps to rule out malignancy. So consult your gastroenterologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"Hi, I ve just been diagnosed with an intraosseous lipoma in the femoral neck of my hip. I have been discharged and have been told I need no further MRI imaging in the future. I was just checking this was appropriate as I have read on the Internet that these lesions need periodic imaging to keep an eye on it as they pose a rare but real threat of malignant transformation?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should not worry much about cancer. Lipoma is benign soft tissue tumour mostly containing fat tissue. It is painless and harmless. Rarely it turned into malignancy , liposarcoma. But the chances of this is very very rare. Only 0.0001%. So no need to worry much abput malignancy. But, yes you should definitely get done follow up of this lesion annually by MRI. Look for size and contours of lesion in follow up scans.But at present no need to worry much. No possibility of cancer."},{"Patient":"A friend has been diagnosed with throat cancer, an small tumor has been removed...I don t know the area of the larynx involved. My question is: would it be normal not to follow up with chemo or radiation? Also, his hands have been red, swollen and the nails have been looking like a fungal infection... could this be a side effect of the cancer and indicating it is still there?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Treatment of any cancer depend of its stagging. And for stagging we need to know exact size of the lesion, lymphnodes involved or not and Metastases to distal organs present or not.So in your friends case we need to get done CT neck and PET scan to know the exact stagging.And usually chemotherapy and radiotherapy is needed to prevent local recurrence and distal metastases.  So better to consult oncologist and start treatment."},{"Patient":"I am having radiation done on my forehead for melanoma in sashu and wondered when the 6 weeks of radiation is finished I know the radiation will not irradicate the melanoma what happens if it reappears on my forehead since radiation cannot be done again on the forehead? Also I assume the redness will dissipate after a while. Thanks for responding, Morris.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM, Recurrent melanoma has to be treated by surgery and radiation only. Proper margin clearance is required after each surgery. Along with treatment, the cause of recurrent melanomas has to be found out. Most probably the recurrent melanomas are associated with certain genetic syndrome. Thus consult your treating doctor to investigate for genetic disorder associated with the recurrent melanomas.

I am going for a followup on 29th with my G.P. Anything I should ask him? He gave me a digital and I nearly went thru the roof before he last prescribed the antibiotic. This all started when the PSA level in my blood tests kept going up. Biopsy said no cancer. Don t ride a bicycle or indulge in anal sex (or any sex at this point). I m sixty one and otherwise active.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should consult urologist rather than GP.Since you are having erection and ejeculation problem after prostatic biopsy, I think during biopsy nerves were damaged and due to this you are having difficulties in sex.And prostatic infection needs thorough evaluation for organism and specific antibiotics should be given for atleast 1-2 month according to the culture report.So better to consult specialist and start proper treatment."},{"Patient":"hello doctor my FIL has been detected colon cancer stage 4 now they provided stent for smooth motion going he is taking chenotherphy and tablets also if small kids has close contact whether any injection to 2 month baby will get by these medicine they are taking (chemo theraphy tablets )","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion no treatment required for kids who are in contact with your FIL. Since colon cancer is not contagious and it is not spreading by skin contact,  no treatment required for contact persons including kids.And stage 4 colon cancer is inoperableand palliative treatment is the only thing we can do.Palliative treatment consists of1. Nutritional support in the form of multivitamins,  proteins,calorie and carbohydrate supplement. 2. Palliative chemotherapy to reduce pain and tumour size.3.

She vomitted bile today and was very weak after. Appetite is very poor. I am worrried, have we much time left with her? Thanks","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Stage 4 cholangiocarcinoma is inoperable cancer and prognosis is not good. Overall life expectancy is less than 14-15 months.Old age and symptoms of vomiting with weakness, decrease oral intake arenot a good sign for prognosis. In my opinion you mom is having poor prognosis and life expectancy is less than 7-8 months.If vomiting persists than start TPN ( Total parenteral Nutrition) for palliative care."},{"Patient":"my mother in Law is undergoing Chemotherapy for small cell cancer.

In my opinion it is something else other than ensure plus powder, which causes dizziness.Ensure plus powder is commercially available protein preperation.So it is safe and usually no side effects are noted. So I don't think dizziness is due to ensure llus protien powder. Small cell cancers are prone to spead in brain. And due to malignant involvement she may have dizziness.

CML is blood cancer which is havibg excellent prognosis if proper treatment is given.Life expectancy is more than 10 years with five year survival rate almost 70-80%. So strict follow up and proper chemotherapy should be administered.It is having remission and crisis phases. So chemotherapy drugs are given to keep patient in remission phase.So for your mother , I advice you to consult oncologist and start the chemotherapy.  She may be in the crisis stage.

In my opinion you should get done PET SCAN to rule out positive uptake (hot spot ) in bladder and prostate, as you had prostate and bladder cancer in past.Biopsy may be false negative if sufficient tissue was not biopsied or biopsy taken from non cancerous part of the lesion.So better to check this by PET scan and guided biopsy from the hot spot on scan.If still no cancer in biopsy report than urinary tract infection should be the cause.Better to get done urine microscopic examination and urine culture.Also look for malignant cells in urine."},{"Patient":"last year my 15 year old daughter had redness and swelling in her right breast.

She is in pubertal age. So many hormonal changes are occuring at a same time.And this changes can cause benign breast swelling which is having on and off appearance. Your biopsy report is also negative so no need to worry much.Mostly this swelling will subside by its own once hormonal imbalance settle down.Mostly after 17-18 years all the female hormone s are becoming normal and so the changes due to them are also getting normal.So no need to worry much for your daughter's breast lump."},{"Patient":"hi, been on oxcodone 30 mg ( after the new formulation of oxcontin op) i have been on Ms Contin 60 mg 3x day, prn and oxcodone 30ms (IR for breakthrough pain) (ms contin Extended release 4x q. 6hrs. prn for the past 17 yeasrs. in Oct 2011 I was diadgosed with staage iv cancer and active heo c and the pain is intolerable. the doctor i was seeing cut me off when he leaned of the cANCER and hep c. now my life is miserable. i am 60 years old and just am AMBULATORY BECAUSE OF THE PAIN.

Why are my ALT and AST higher than before, 18, 21?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should not worry much about your slightly elevated SGOP ( AST) and SGPT (ALT). Since you are obese, possibility of fatty liver is more. This is due to excess body fat which is accumulating in the liver. And cause fatty liver. This can give slightly alteration in liver function and cause slight elevation of ALT and AST.No treatment is required except weight loss and exercise.So continue exercise and avoid oily, fatty  and junk food.

Small cell lung carcinoma is very notorious in spread as well as behavior.  It secrets hormones and cause paraneoplastic syndromes.  So we need to treat it as soon as diagnosed otherwise it will be rapidly spreading.

Sometimes there are post operative adhesion formation at the site of operation which might stick to a part of your intestine, causing it to twist and get obstructed causing pain. It might be of sub acute nature giving rise to intermittent pain or it could be acute giving rise both to pain and acute intestinal obstruction resulting in absolute constipation and inability to pass gases as well with distension of the abdomen. I feel that in your case it could be sub acute in nature because of the long duration of your pain since the operation more than six months before.However, there are many different pathological processes which could give rise to such pain in the abdomen, which if could not be diagnosed clinically, warrant for further investigations like plain X ray of abdomen, ultrasound of abdomen, and a urine culture and sensitivity test to exclude various other conditions giving rise to such abdominal pain.I do not want to confuse you by giving all the details of these conditions , but you can always discuss with your treating doctor on these points. If nothing is conclusive, then a diagnostic laparoscopy may be helpful.Wishing you an early recovery. Thanks and good luck."},{"Patient":"I have a very distended abdomen.

Could I have cancer of the stomach or esophagus? I just had some tests done.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. It is normal to have adhesion after ectopic pregnancy surgery or any other abdominal surgery.So adhesion does not indicate cancer.And reflux disease and heart burn are due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter.

So surgery for any cancer will be extremely risky.In my opinion you should first get done PET SCAN to stag his malignancy.  Treatment of any cancer is based on staging.  So if stage 4 cancer is found which is more likely in his case, than palliative chemotherapy should be given. No harm in this with diabetes or low cardiac function. So palliative chemotherapy should be started."},{"Patient":"I had a dome shaped pink bump on my inner lower lip, it stayed the same size and shape for about 2 weeks.

Do you think its something serious like cancer?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. It may or may not be cancerous.  But better to get done few investigation s.1. X ray of local part2. Ultrasound of local part.The appearance of lump on x ray and ultrasound will give us some differential diagnosis. But ultrasound guided biopsy will be the confirmatory to rule out cancer or any other etiology. So get done above mentioned tests and biopsy to rule out cancer."},{"Patient":"I have a mole on the back of my neck. It isn't painful or anything, but sometimes its gets enlarged and if I squeeze it, thick white stuff comes out of it. This has happened twice now, I have had moles removed in the past and have had them biopsied, and they all have come back benign. I have a few spots that I am to watch to see if they get any bigger. I have fair skin and skin cancer runs in my family. Should I be concerned with the mole that has white stuff in it?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion it is nothing but sebaceous cyst and white fluid must be sebum.But better to get done clinical examination first.Since you are having strong family history of skin cancer, I advice you to get done skin biopsy again.

Tongue cancer are usually having good prognosis.  And five year survival rate is 70-80%. Since your wife has already completed 5 years after treatment and at present having large protruding tongue, I advice you to consult oncologist again and discuss about palliative surgery ( debulking surgery) and palliative chemotherapy. At this moment I think life expectancy in her case is less than 2 years."},{"Patient":"Hello my name is Denzil. A friend had stage 4 brain cancer. She has since had an opperation to remove the cancer from her brain- well, what about the other parts of the body it spread to. She is doing fine now but she had no treatments to help the part of her body the cancer spread to. I am wondering if she really had brain cancer. Does brain cancer usually return?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Brain cancer can spread to other organs of body too. It spreads locally as well as distally by either lymphatic route or hematogenous route.Common distal organs for metastases are1. Liver2. Lung3. Bones4. Intestines etc.So brain tumour can recurr again in brain also as well as in distal organs.So brain tumour can reappear."},{"Patient":"I have been told I have fibroids. I get very heavy bleeding that last up to 10 days and after the bleeding I get this very watery discharge till the next period. I have to wear panty liners everyday till the next period is this normal. The discharge does not stink it has the normal smell.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. .In my opinion you should first get done biopsy of the lesion and confirm that it is thyroid only.Once it is confirmed,  the treatment for fibroid with excessive bleeding is surgical removal.If you have completed your family and approaching menopause than hysterectomy ( complete removal of uterus) is advised.And if you are young than selective removal of fibroid is indicated. So better to consult gynecologist and discuss these therapeutic options."},{"Patient":"I have white/yellow shots on the back of my throat/tonsils however its been like that on and off for a very long time.

I was looking online and throat cancer images came up and in concerned this could be the case?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. White spots on throat can be due to1. Infection either fungal or bacterial2. Malignancy. So better to consult ENT specialist first. And get done clinical examination and if needed biopsy from the lesion.This will tell you the confirm diagnosis of the lesion, whether it is infectious or malignant. So local examination is needed by ENT doctor."},{"Patient":"Dear Dr.Samuel My nephew had an operation because of cancer of tongue .

I have pains in my joints, abdominal pains that I cant explain and I also bruise very easily when I scratch my body. I have also been feeling dizzy. I have had blood tests done over a month ago and been told my vitamin d and iron is level is very very low. It is under 10 but I don't know how low that is. I have been put on vitamin d and iron tablets a month ago. I never had the symptoms I have described a month ago. Can u give me any advice please.","Doctor":"Hi ! You can continue to have the Vit D and iron supplements as advised by your doctor. Based on your history of tiredness over the past few months, if I would have been your doctor, I would have advised you for a thyroid function test. Hypothyroidism which is very common does cause aneamia and tiredness. Vit D deficiency has also become common due to dietary deficiency and lack of sunlight in closed flat culture. If the thyroid deficiency is proved, then it is easily treatable with thyroid supplements and you will feel well. So get a thyroid function done and show the reports to your family physician for further treatment. Thanks and good luck."},{"Patient":"So I was checking myself and I ve just noticed a tiny lump almost like a really small spot. I have looked online and I m worried it could be cancer however there are also a lot of things indicating it to be a cyst or something else. So I was wondering what I should do?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should first get done clinical examination of cyst.Most of the times it is benign cyst either1. Sebaceous cyst2. Dermoid cyst etc.So clinical examination is important.  Size, site, contents,  tenderness on palpation present or not, hard or soft etc all are important in deciding further line of investigation and treatment. If any doubt than biopsy should be done to confirm the  diagnosis."},{"Patient":"I have a grade 2 cystocele.

Do you think I should have the op before I go or would it be safe to wait till I get back. We re thinking of going in 3/4 months time?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Since you are having 3-4 months of time before journey, I advice to get done operation.Cystocele grade 2 is usually not harm much. But chances of infection and testicular torsion are more if you delay the surgery. And both of these are acute emergency conditions for which emergency surgeries are required. So if you have time of 3-4 months, my advice is to get done with surgery and enjoy your travel with out fear."},{"Patient":"How long does it take to find out if someone has cancer in their female parts my pap smear came back with abnormalities and I have better than double the number of cetain markers.

In my opinion you should consult gynecologist and get done1. Cervical biopsy2. Ovarian biopsy3. CT SCAN OF PELVICYou are at higher risk of malignancy as1. PAP smear is suggestive of abnormal cells.2. Higher markers.3. Bilateral ovarian cyst.So better to get done CT pelvic and biopsy of cervix and ovary to confirm the diagnosis.

I had it checked only to find that 2 more lumps have appeared in my breast (one in the left and a second in the right) since my last mammogram just 6 months ago . The lumps under my arm are painful......should I be concerned??","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should first get done biopsy of the1. Breast lump2. Axillary swellingSince you have strong family history of breast cancer,  chances of malignant transformation of breast lump are high.So we need to rule out malignancy first.Even if lumps are benign,  I would suggest to remove the lumps surgically to decrease the future chances of malignancy.

There are few causes for unilateral (right) sided edema of lower limb in renal cancer patients (post nephrectomy).1. Spread of tumour in right lower limb lymphatic s and cause obstruction and edema.2. Renal failure can also cause lower limb edema.3. If you sleep on right side than dependent edema can also occur.4.

Oral cancer patients are more prone to weight loss as their oral intake is very low due to oral surgery,  radiation etc.Another reason is chemotherapy and radiotherapy.  Both decrease appetite and so oral intake is less. Tumour cells produce chemokines,  which also reduces hunger.So oral cancer patients have more weight loss. Better to start nutritional supplements like multivitamin,  antioxidants,  proteins and calorie rich food. You can also try TPN (Total parenteral nutrition)."},{"Patient":"Hi my Grand mother is 86 and has advanced lung, bowel and spine cancer she has chosen no treatment due to age she is losing her appetite, very tired but often says her chest hurts is this just a advanced cancer symptom? she takes medications am wondering if just a matter of time for her.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. But metastatic stage 4 lung cancer has very poor prognosis. At her age five year survival is almost negligible. And life expectancy is less than 7-8 months.Better to start palliative treatment for pain relief and nutritional support. Discuss end of life issues.In my opinion life expectancy in her case is less than 6-7 months."},{"Patient":"Hello, I just had a total Da Vinci hysterectomy on 4/10/14 because of endometrial cancer, stage 1b, grade 2. They took 59 lymph nodes and they were negative. The Doctor is recommending radiation to the upper area of the vagina only as a precaution to lower the risk from 15% to 1% of the cancer coming back in the vagina. My cervix wasn t affected. I would prefer not to get radiation unless a pap smear shows there are cell changes or cancer in that area. Would you suggest that it would be a good idea to avoid radiation for right now. I would like to avoid radation side effects and the radiation effects on lymphedema.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should take radiotherapy (radiation) in upper part of vagina.The reason is to decrease the local site recurrence. In hysterectomy surgery, due to tumour handling chances of tumour spillage are high in lower part of peritoneal cavity. So due to this chances of local recurrence are high. So to prevent this radiation is needed. Now a days brachytherapy is newer option of radiation.  In this small pallets of radioactive matrial are locally inserted at desired site. It will release radiation to the specific site. So by this technique side effects are reduced. So discuss this with your oncologist."},{"Patient":"my father has rectal colon cancer for 3.5 years. he went thru chemo and radiation but cancer was found in the lymph nodes in 2013 and lungs February 2014. recently he has suffered from short of breath and back pain. What treatment is available at this point and what is the prognosis?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Since your father's cancer has already spread in lymphnodes and lung, I advice you to get done chest x ray first.The causes for breathlessness in his case are1. Malignant pleural effusion.2. Extensive pulmonary parenchymal involvement due to metastases. So get done chest x ray and if needed CT THORAX to rule out above causes.Only treatment available is palliative chemotherapy and nutritional support. If malignant pleural effusion is present than pig tail catheter insertion is needed.So better to consult pulmonologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"Please answer the following question Histopathology report 1-Stomach antral(gastric lesion) biopsies An area showing features of reactive gastropathy noted ( see comment) Thase gastric biopsies show areas with prominent foveolar hyperplasia In view of the above statement do I have cancer","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should not worry at all  for gastric malignancy. Your report suggest hyperplasia.  Which is not suggestive of cancer.Dysplasia is disorganized growth of cells and it is suggestive of malignancy. Hyperplasia is not indicator of cancer. So no need to worry much. You are not having cancer."},{"Patient":"I am a 63 year old male; I have had a quadruple bi-pass ten years ago. I am still very active physically and I am very sexually active, i.e. average 5 times a week or more. Three months ago I had test done, urine, full blood work up and ultrasound to investigate a sharp, short duration reoccurring pain in my lower left abdominal quadrant. All test indicated no abnormalities. Two weeks ago I began to get the same pain, but induced by foreplay when my girl friend would gently massage my penis and testicles. When she stops the pain subsides, once I am fully stimulated and we have intercourse the pain is not present. The pain feels like a knife jab, and will also occur during the day for no apparent reason. The pain will at times occur with pressure to the area but rarely. At first the pain was not associated with sexual stimuli, but now there is a direct correlation. Oh one other thing, I have been having unprotected sex with my girl friend for over four years and have not impregnated her, she is 24 so I assume I am the one that cannot have a child, I don’t know if it is related to the pain or not, but I already have 4 children and one was after the bi-pass surgery. I live in the Philippines where the medical system is archaic and totally profit motivated. I hope I can find an answer, the frequency is increasing and I am concerned about a more serious cause, but I don’t want to slip into the do every test to make money system here, I need to know a direction to have them check. Anyone with an idea would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Welcome to health care magic. 1.There are two possbilities after going through the history. 1. Inflammation of the testicles 2.

In my opinion you should get done biopsy from the pubic symphisis region.Sarcoid is an inflammatory lesion. So on PET scan it will show positive (hot spot).And malignant spread will also give positive uptake on PET SCAN.So if PET scan shows positive result on pubic symphisis than it can be due to either sarcoid or malignant spread.So to rule out between these two biopsy is must.

Any other treatment available to cure Cancer in brain?","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to HCM I have gone thru your query regarding brain cancer grad III of your mother , I can understand your concern .Dear in fact,Your body is always fighting something -- an infection, a toxin, an allergen, a food or the stress response -- and somehow it redirects its hostile attack on your joints, your brain, your thyroid, your gut, your skin, or sometimes your whole body. Your immune system is your defense against invaders . everyone of us has  cancer cells  forming all the time. But normally their strong immune system .kills the cancer cells fast enough that a person is never “diagnosed” with cancer. But when the immune system becomes weak, the cancer cells can grow out of control , the disease overpowers . Illness or stress can trigger cancer cells growth because hormones produced to combat illness or stress can also cause your cancer cells as well as blood sugar to rise.  . Constant stress ,illness ,worry , anger . lack of nutritious food & lack of exercise do cause cancer and diabetes .Our health depends on 'what we eat ,when we eat , & how we eat 'and our life style .Gulping on only medicine & antibiotic will not help cure unless you modify your life style and your food habits .So ,when daignosed and treated , care should be taken so that reccrance can be evaded .The tumour can put pressure on the brain and may cause headaches and seizures (fits). It can also prevent an area of the brain from functioning properly, which in turn , can cause problems with coordination in walking, trouble with precise movements of hands ,arm, ,feet and legs .Use of supplements full of antioxidants can be helpfull in strengthening the immune system which is very effective in alleviating and even avoiding the unpleasant symptoms of the diseases .1. Take balanced diet & nutrients such as fish oil - omega 3 , vitamin C, vitamin D, and probiotics which includes all essential nutrients in natural form - protiens ,fiber , fruits , green veges , vitamins , minerals and lot of water to eleminate toxins from body .2. supplements full of antioxidants as mixture of ginger , garlic , lemon juice , vinegar of coconut water , bark of mooringa tree & honey . Mix ,all 6 ,in equal quantity ..Take 25 ml with equal quantity of water,for 3-4 days . And for next 25 days without water . it is great antioxidant helps allay bacteria on mass basis3. Juice of bitter gourd 25-30 ml helps kill becteria on mass basis is great antioxidant .4. Aloe vera juice 30 ml + Amla juice 2 spoons helps kill becteria on mass basis is great antioxidant .5. Turmeric powder a level spoon with a cup of hot milk at bed time serves as great antioxidant .6 . Avoid fried , fast foods tea ,coffee ,alcohol ,smoking ,mental stress ,worry anxiety 7. most important is to clear you bowls . as constipation is mother of all ills .8 . Because stress worsens the problems To strengthen immune response naturally , exercise regularly -- it's a natural anti-inflammatory.For proper blood crculation , proper regular walk , exercise -legs & hands , yoga , pranayam-deep breathing proper rest & sound sleep , meditation , massage , helps in detoxifying and strengthening the immune system to enhance resistance from diseases and pave way for healthy , happy ,disease free life . It is to be taken as life long commitmentIt’s important to check with your physician before adding herbs to your existing medications,regarding the herbs that are antioxidant ,have no side effects and go with any therapy of treatment .Take Homeopathic Carcinocin 200 / fortnightly / 3 doses .Apply north pole Magnets to hands morning & feet in evening for 5 min to start with & drinking Water,30-35 ml every 3 hours , prepared on north pole magnets also plays as a potent tool in treating cancer by killing bacteria on mass basis. slower the chances of  reccurance .But neglecting your own health does not work in the long term.

No other symptoms that I ve noticed. I just want to know if I can still get tonsilitis after having them removed or if it may be strep or at worst case, throat cancer? I don t smoke but did dip for a few years (never swallowed the spit and recently quit) so obviously I m hoping it s not that... Just a little scared and looking for some advice. Thanks","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should not worry much about cancer.As these are not symptoms of throat cancer. So be relax and calm.You are having throat infection.  Mostly bacterial as yellow phlegm is there. May be due to streptococcal infection but not due to cancer for sure.So take antibiotic and antihistamine drugs.Drink plenty of fluids. Warm water gargles 5-6 times a day. Don't think too much about cancer. And quit all habits."},{"Patient":"My Godchild had a rare form of liver cancer when she was 12...she recieved chemo and radiation and had half of her liver removed. It has been 3 years and she went for a 6 month scan and they found 3 lung nodules each 3mm big. What are the chances that they are cancerous? They said they are just going to wait to see if they grow at her next six month scan.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion we should get done repeat PET scan after 6 months.If nodules are same or decreasing than no need to worry about malignancy. But if nodules are either increase in size or in the number than we should rule out malignancy by biopsy of nodule. So better to wait at present and get done repeat scan after 3 months."},{"Patient":"My PSA levels have gone up and down in the past year. Whenever they go up, th Urologist always wants to do a Biopsy. There are risks associated with this procedure, so I think getting bloodwork done every couple of months would be better. There is no history of prostate cancer in my family, so even though I could be a first, I don t know why the DRS wouldn t want to just keep monitoring my psa levels. I am just worried that they all just want to do certain tests that may be unnessary","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should get done prostate biopsy. PSA is only screening test. It is not confirmatory for prostate cancer. So high PSA level does not indicate prostate cancer, and low PSA level does not exclude possibility of it. But if you have high PSA level than chances of prostate cancer are high. So we need to rule out this. And for this biopsy is must.And no need to worry much for biopsy related complications.  As it is very safe procedure. And by this we can detect prostate cancer at earliest.  So that timely treatment and surgery can be done. And life expectancy can be prolonged. So better to get done prostate biopsy."},{"Patient":"My son was diagnosed with Metastatic Ewing Sarcoma of the Bone in August 2013 that was later changed to Metastatic DSRCT and then after further studies it was determined to be an Undifferentiated Small Cell Malignancy of the Pelvis with multiple metastases up the Spine. He recently completed his initial treatment protocol. Treatment included 14 alternating cycles of VDC and IE every two weeks and 30 proton treatments. He just had his followup scans including a MRI of his pelvis, a MRI of his L-spine and a Chest CT. The MRIs were explained to us but not the CT so my question stems from there. In the CT findings it states, No pericardial or pleural effusion. Few scattered subcentimeter in short axis nodes and nodes containing fatty hila in the chest without significant enlargement by size criteria. What does that mean and is it something we should be concerned about?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. .In my opinion you should not worry much about this CT THORAX report.Because report says only few scattered subcentimetric nodes are seen.The size of these are less than 5 mm. So nothing to worry. And hilar lymphnodes are also not much enlarged. So no possibility of malignant spread. But better to get done follow up CT Thorax after 1 year. If same finding than nothing to worry."},{"Patient":"My mom was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer last February with no chance of surgery. She has been taking chemo for 3 Mondays on then 1 Monday off. Mom has lost a lot of weight (down to 112) and she is really sleeping a lot. Now in the past couple weeks she has developed a slight cough but yesterday she had a cough that sounded like it had a lot of fluid in her chest and her temp got up to 101. She says she s fine but I think she should get checked out. What do you think?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should first get done chest x ray to rule out chest infection and pleural effusion.Since your mother is having pancreatic cancer and on chemotherapy,  chances of lung infection are high because chemotherapy makes person immunosuppressive and more prone to infection. Another possibility is malignant pleural effusion due to spread of tumour in pleurae.So better to rule out all these by chest x ray first."},{"Patient":"Dear sir,i am 25 years old unamrried lady....................i get this pain during my menses which extent to my lower abdominal n back ,sometimed to ankles also.so i take meftal spas 2 tablet per day for at least least two day.i just want to know how can i reduce the pain n also is there any side effects of meftal spas 250mg","Doctor":"Hi thanks for your query.Pain and malaise during menses is a normal thing unless it gets unbearable. It is fine to take Meftal spas. It contains mefenamic acid & dicyclomine hydrochloride .Dicyclomine can cause anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth, nausea, even deliriant effects at higher doses.

I looked at the interior diagram and it would be in the descending colon area. I am 49 and have not had a colonoscopy yet an am a non Hodgkin lymphoma survivor of 13 years. Should I be concerned there?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should get dpne following tests.1. Chest x ray to rule out pleural effusion as a cause of your pain.2. Ultrasound examination of abdomen to rule out any abdominal pathology as a cause of your pain.If both are normal than no need to worry much , It might be a simple muscular pain.So take painkiller and muscle relaxant.  Avoid strenuous exercise and heavy weight lifting."},{"Patient":"I m 48y, in 2006 I had surgery of DCIS on right breast with parcial mastectomy. After surgery I had 6 week radiation therapy and was taking Tamoxiphen 5 years. Currently mammogram found another small nodule suspicious on malignant and I had vaginal ultrasound. Last period was in November 2013, ultrasound shows endometrium lining 14mm, not homogenous and cyst on cervix diameter 10mm. miometrium also not homogenous. Do I have to do surgery on breast and hysterectomy simultaneously, what would be your recommendations? Thank you,","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should first confirm that the nodule in your breast is malignant or not.  Also the changes seen in uterus are malignant or not.So decision of surgery should only be after biopsy reports.So get done biopsy of the breast lump and also from the uterus.If malignancy is found in both than first operate for breast and than for uterus."},{"Patient":"I absorbed the mercury from a broken thermometer through my finger about 30 years ago. Could this have caused the Spinal Meningioma that I have had removed from C1. I f not, what causes them? Are they inherited as my mother died froma Malignant brain tumour, as has a 1st cousin and a niece has a tumour on her Pituritry gland?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Mercury is known carcinogen but Single time exposure of any carcinogen can not produce malignancy. Repeated, chronic exposure can cause malignancy. So I don't think that single time mercury exposure before 30 years can lead to cancer.And yes, meningioma can have genetic cause and transmit by hereditary and seen in family. So possibility of hereditary cause is there for your spinal maningioma."},{"Patient":"I am undergoing testing for breast cancer. On 01-27-14 the doctor removed my nipple, areola and some tissue under the skin. The results showed cancer. Another surgery on 03-10-14 resulted in removal of lymph nodes and a lumpectomy and removal of additional tissue. The surgeon thinks it is early stage 2. I saw an oncologist today, and we are planning a Pet-scan. She said I have lobular breast cancer. I also discovered a small lump on my left breast, and 2 different colleagues concurred that there was a lump. Depending on the outcome, maybe mastectomies on bone breasts followed by chemotherapy. A lot to take in one sitting.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Lobular carcinoma of breast is notorious to spread in opposite breast. So better to get done biopsy from left breast lump too, to rule out malignancy. And yes PET scan is needed to rule out distal metastases. As bones are most common site to metastases. In early stage 2 breast cancer treatment of choice is enblock resection of breadt tissue with resection of involved lymphnodes.Post operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy is necessary if lymphnode s are positive for malignant spread.Also get done ER (Estrogen Receptor) and PR (Progesterone Receptor) study to guide hormone therapy (tamoxifen). So discuss all these with oncologist."},{"Patient":"Had colorectal cancer resection. since it leaned more to rectal cancer, they have suggested chemo and radiation, I am 67 years old. Took out twenty lymph nodes, they were all negative for cancer. The radiation will only be a 10 percent benefit. This only for preventive recurrence. They said rectal cancer has more of a chance to reoccur. I want to do whatever would be beneficial for my survival. Do you think it would be worth the treatments. I will deal with the side affects if it will prolong my life. Would like your opinion.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should take chemotherapy and radiotherapy both.In abdominal surgeries high chances of spillage of tumour cells in peritoneal cavity during handling of the tumour. So local recurrence is high. So better to give chemotherapy and radiotherapy both. Radiotherapy acts locally and prevent local recurrence while chemotherapy prevent s local as well as distal metastases. So my suggestion is to start chemotherapy and radiotherapy."},{"Patient":"my husband is bleeding under skin .He just has to rub against something and it comes up like a big purple mark .He has a new one inside arm .He says he didnt brush anything .He is 69 years old and been told old age .He has had lung cancer most left lung removed on sertide and asmol spray It seems more than old age what do you think thanks","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should consult dermatologist and get done detailed clinical examination of skin lesion.As many cancers can involve cutaneous vessels and cause bleeding. Lung cancer is mpst common cause in this. Especially small cell carcinoma of lung. So chances of cutaneous vessels involvement are more by tumpur.So better to consult dermatologist and if needed biopsy of the lesion is also recommended."},{"Patient":"i m 42 years old and delayed for 2 mos. myob gyne askme to have a transvaginal ultrasound. here are the findings, cyst in left ovary about 2.1, no fluid in cul de sac, and thickened endometrium. is there a possibility that i m pregnant? or the cyst found is cancerous? or i mgoing to menopausal stage.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion you should not worry much about the cancer. And ovarian cyst looks benign mostly. Get done repeat ultrasound after 3 months and if cyst is same or decreasing in size than no need to worry about cancer.And about thickened endometrium,  I think it is due to menopause only. Your age is also approaching menopause,  and delayed menses with thickened endometrium,  all suggest menopause only.So no need to worry for malignancy.  You are mostly having starting of menopause."},{"Patient":"My son was told that his ankle doesn t look good. He had a MRI done.

I hurt them as I continuously strained them before two months by playing. I also reckon not warming up properly. The pain is not normal soreness after a hard workout as it is ok when i cough or sneeze but when I shoot a football or try to change direction quickly from stationary position, it pains a lot.","Doctor":"Hi! Due to irregular exercise by an unprepared or non warmed up body, possibly there is a repeated tears of muscle fibers with accumulation of small amount of ooze at places of unsuspected trauma. You have to give sufficient rest for these to heal and have to have some anti inflammatory drug for some time so that the inflammation is gone and you are relieved. If this does not solve your problem, then you may have to go for an ultrasound of abdomen to rule out any other organic problem.

Appreciate any information. Thank you.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Liver is the most common site for metastases.  The reson for this is reach blood supply of liver and suitable environment for tumour growth. And to find liver metastases is an accidental thing.After this we need to search for primary.  For this PET scan is best. So the radioactive injections you are talking about must be PET SCAN only. This will tell you the primary site of tumour. Possible primary sites are1. Lungs2. Kidneys3.

I can understand your situation and problem. Honestly speaking stage 4 pancreatic cancer is having very poor prognosis. No question of five year survival rate as it is very negligible.

I want to ask you few questions first.1. Does your husband on chemotherapy? 2. Does your husband have fever?His total WBC count is on slightly lower side. And this is seen when patient is taking chemotherapy.  As chemotherapy drugs are immunosuppressive in nature, low WBC count can be seen.

Usually genital warts are brnign viral infection.  So mostly not malignant.

Can this question be answered.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. There are few reasons for swollen legs in her case.1. Spread of cancer in lower limb lymphatic system can cause obstruction to the flow and cause edema.2. Liver metastases if not treated can cause liver failure and thus protein (albumin) produced by liver is low. Hypoalbuminemia can cause lower limb edema. 3. Liver failure also cause severe anaemia. Low Hemoglobin can also be the cause for this.But in any of the reason, prognosis is very poor. She is running towards end stage disease.

Both are correct.Stage 4 cancer can cause great impact on psychology of patient and this start reflecting in motor behaviour.  So patient becomes very roudy, irritated and depressed.

How often do people survive Cancer treated with chemo. Have you ever known any one to be cured and live past five years or more?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Complete cure is out of question as lung tumour can be slowed down but never be cured. So we can only give treatment to slow his progression of tumour and give him symptomatic relief with increase in five year survival  rate.We can not free him completely from cancer.And in non small cell tumour life expectancy is less than 10 years. And five year survival rate is 70%. Bur if tumour is encasing aorta and esophagus than chances of five year survival is only 20-30%. Life expectancy in such patients are less than 1 year even with chemotherapy.

So it is inoperable.  And patient usually offered only palliative treatment.Usual life expectancy of stage 4 bladder cancer is less than 15-16 months.Bladder cancer can spread by hematogenous route and lymphatic route.So practically it metastatize to all organs of the body but common ones are liver, lung and brain.So in your sister's case life expectancy is less than 12 months as tumour is already metastatize in lung."},{"Patient":"My 71 year old brother was diagnosed in Jan with stage IV kidney cancer. We found out last week he has 11 percent kidney function and the cancer has spread to both lungs and his bladder. Today he is so exhausted he can not get out of bed. His hands are so swollen the skin is breaking. He has an appt Wed at the VA Hosp (140 miles away) . Should we wait till Wed. Or try and convince him to go to the ER today? Is this just a normal progression of the disease?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should definitely take him to the hospital. As he may any time go in renal shut down since only 11% kidneys are working. Bilateral upper limb edema suggest worsening of renal function and spread of tumour in lymphatics.So he may need renal assistance and renal replacement therapy.  And thid can only be done in hospital. So take him immediately to ER.And yes, this is usual progression of the cancer."},{"Patient":"My dad is 7 years into pancreatic cancer, none aggressive form, and is currently off chemo. With his doctors blessing we are trying Rick Simpson Oil (hemp oil). He is on day 5 of taking the oil, less than a 1/2 gram. He is tolerating it okay with the exception that his blood pressure is staying low. He is on medication for low blood pressure already but we want to know if there is anything else he can take to help to raise it naturally?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM..Ask him to drink plenty of water. He can also take fruit juice and other liquids like soups etc. Any form of liquid will helrising blood pressure. He can also start oral inotropic drugs.These drugs  act on myocytes ( cardiac muscles) and cause forceful contraction. By this forceful contraction blood pressure rises.So you can discuss these options with your cardiologist before starting."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor. My husband was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma one year ago. He has had hep c for poss three decades. It was inoperable. He has had two chemoembolizations and is now on nexavar. The chemo resulted in two tumours dying and another grew resulting in 5 now. Is this palliative care and what lifespan can be expected approximately?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Hepato Cellular Carcinoma(HCC) is very notorious and aggressive cancer. It carries worst prognosis and even more worse when hepatitis c is positive. Life expectancy in stage  4 HCC is less than 1year and with Hepatitis C positive it is less than 6-7 months.So for him palliative care is the only option. Give him nutritional support like multivitamin, anti oxidants and high protein diet. Give centrally acting pain killers for pain relief. Discuss end of life issues."},{"Patient":"After experiencing post menapausal bleeding, it was recommended that I have a hysteroscopy and uterine biopsy. However the doctor was unable to insert the scope past the cervix. He also tried to do a biopsy, but that came back as not enough tissue to determine if cancer is present. Is it a sign of cancer that he was not able to get into my uterus?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In postmenopausal women due to hormonal imbalance,  uterus, cervix and vagina tend to show atrophy and dryness. So due to this reason, doctor was not able to pass scope. But we can not deny possibility of malignancy at the same time. So detailed evaluation is needed.I advice you to get done CT scan of lower abdomen to rule out uterine cancer.Also get done multiple biopsies from cervix. This will give more yield than single biopsy.So discuss these things with your gynecologist."},{"Patient":"My husband was diagnosed with cancer in October 2013. He had chemo and radiation for 7 weeks. He was recently hospitalized for severe malnutrition for 3 weeks. He will try to eat but does not swallow his food. All he is getting is tube feedings through the night. I am worried that the same thing is going to happen again from not eating. What can be done.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.If your husband is not able to swallow than Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is the only treatment we can give him.In TPN all the nutrients are given through larger veins of the body. Mostly through external jugular vein. So hospitalisation and central venous catheter is must . In TPN infusion contains1. Protiens2. Carbohydrates3. Lipids4. Multivitamins5. Minerals and trace elements. You can also give fruit juices, water, mashed food through naso gastric tube."},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer two years ago, and have undergone 38 radiation treatments each treatment targeting 6 locations in my lower abdomen.Also i will complete hormone injection therapy August 22nd 2014. I have rectal bleeding that is sporadic and appears to be from my hemorrhoids","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should consult surgeon and get done local examination of anus.If haemorrhoids are present than bleeding is mostly from it only. So start its treatment. But if haemorrhoids are absent than you need to get done Colonoscopy to rule out internal problem. Radiotherapy can cause ischaemic ulcers in bowel lumen. And these ulcers can cause sporadic bleeding.Recurrence of tumour in gut lumen is also possible.  For this too, Colonoscopy is needed.So better to get done Colonoscopy first."},{"Patient":"I recently discovered a large, none painful lump in my lower back. It can not be seen just by looking at my back but if you put enough pressure, you can feel it. It is about an inch wide and is shaped slightly like an oval. It moves under my skin and i suspect it is a lipoma. I do, sometimes, feel like a nerve is being pinched and it feels like the pain spreads down to my lower thigh. The only think that is making me thing that it is not a lipoma is that is is hard all around. Can lipomas be hard or are they always soft?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Lipomas are always soft as it contains fat tissue only. So if you are feeling hard swelling than lipoma is unlikely. The site you are describing is also unlikely for lipoma. Lipomas tend to occur more in flexor surface of forearm, upper back etc.In my opinion you are having bemign tumour of nervous sheath (Neurofibroma). It is hard, mobile and benign tumour. And it is on the nerve so when you press it, you can feel pain on area supplied by the nerve, same in your case.So Neurofibroma is more likely. But clinical examination and ultrasound is needed."},{"Patient":"hello doctor, i am of 30 years of age and for last 2 years, i get a choking of my throat, i have gone to almost 13 doctors they prescribe me the same medicine such as parit-20, roseday-10, beplex forte tablets, i do get relief, but for sometime only, now i am beginning to think that i may have some sort of cancer and i am fed up of my life due to this diease, so if you can help me, i will be very greatfull to you.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.You are taking parit which is rabeprazole(antacid), roseday which is rosuvastatin (lipid lowering drug) and beplex forte which is multivitamin. So if you are not having high lipids than no need to take roseday at your age (30).In my opinion you should consult gastroenterologist and get done1. Upper GI scopy2. Esophageal manometry and motility study3. Barium swallow4. CT neck.This all are needed to rule out esophageal pathology. And if everything is normal than no need to worry as you are not having any disease."},{"Patient":"hi.my dad is 83 years old.suffering from esophagus cancer which has already spread to liver,kidneys ,stomach and lungs.he is having hiccups most of the time,especially after sleeping.is there medicine for it?-is it any dangerous as far as his health is concerned.?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Esophageal cancer is very difficult to treat and when it spread to lung, liver etc than the life expectancy is less than 1 year.Hiccup in these patients suggest aspiration into trachea.Due to mass in esophagus and abnormality in peristalsis , food often not travel smoothly on lumen and this causes persistent irritation to larynx and causes cough and hiccups. So better to put nasogastric tube to prevent all these. This tube prevent aspirationand irritation in larynx this minimize hiccups and coughing."},{"Patient":"My stomach contantly is in pain.i have acid so need to eat at regular times or food runs straight through.doctor says i don t have chrones or ibs. Bloats alot causing pressure pain too. Been going on for years. I take a PPI in the am. Some days worse than others.","Doctor":"HiThanks for your query.Continuous pain in abdomen, acidity needing regular eating otherwise the food turns straight through, bloating causing pressure pains, going on for years need proper clinical evaluation, investigations and management.I would advise you the following:Investigations of blood, urine, stool, CT scan of the abdomen, Upper GI endoscopy and Colonoscopy.If all the investigations are normal, you should take treatment on the basis of having IBS, control stress and anxiety as these are the major contributing factors."},{"Patient":"Hello, im female age 33, my query relates to the fact that in the early hours of this morning I experienced severe lower abdominal pain/cramps which were continuous with no break for a couple of hours and then have experienced lighter cramps (similar to period pains) and lower back ache all day today, however my period is not due for another week to 10 days at least. I do not normally suffer from bad pmt. I do know that I was ovulating last weekend around a week ago but my husband and I are using protection as we are not trying for another baby just yet, therefore am quite concerned at the severe cramps and the reason why. Many thanks for any advice that can be offered.","Doctor":"Hi, Cramps during ovulation and prior to the menstrual cycle is normal which generally lasts a day or two. Protection such as pills/ condoms do not cause cramps. To rule out pregnancy a simple home test can be conducted. Sometimes cramps can also be due to a urinary infection. Any burning / painful sensation during urination ? If yes you will need medication for the same if no and the pain is bearable you could avoid any medications or else a pain killer for the moment should surffice. Thanks"},{"Patient":"My sister has been fighting bile duct cancer for 3+ years. She has been retaining fluid in her abdomen, which I believe is called ascites. She has been to the doctor and has had her abdomen drained twice, 5.1 liters and 6 liters respectively. She has lost a lot of weight, is fatigued, and seems very uncomfortable. She has recently had a home health nurse drain 1.0 liter (twice) from a drain in her abdomen and is on schedule to have it drained every other day. I m sure she is nearing the end, and was wondering how much longer she may have considering the fluid can not be drained fast enough. Thank you","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Bile duct cancer most commonly involves liver. Almost 90% bile duct cancer metastatize to liver by the time of diagnosis. And it start deteriorating liver function.So synthetic functions of liver like albumin production decreased dramatically.  This is the main reason for ascites in these kind of patients. Another possibility is malignant spread in peritoneum.So in both ways ascites can develop. And both carries worst prognosis. Life expectancy with ascites in bile duct cancer patients is less than 1 year."},{"Patient":"I hope so my son had a colonoscopy last week where the go doctor found 4 ulcers he is on warfarin cuz of blood clots also he had cancer of the colon wher most of colon was removed Today he was going to the bathroom and he is getting long string type blood stool out should I take him to the emergency room or could we wait until Monday when he sees his doctor","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Since your son was on warfarin chances of altered coagulation profile are high as a cause of bloody stool. But at the same time we need to rule out recurrence of malignancy as he is having ulcers too.So you should definitely take him to the ER. Stop warfarin immediately.  Get done PT (Prothrombin Time) to see for any alteration in coagulation profile.Also get done colonoscopy to rule out recurrence of colon cancer.If PT is altered than he needs vit k injection to stop the bleeding."},{"Patient":"My grandfather is in hospice for terminal stage 4 brain cancer of the lower left lobe. He has not eaten or drank since 6 days ago. He is 88 years old and not over or under weight. what should his pulse and bp be? He is breathing two breathes per minute.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem. Stage 4 brain cancer cause severe cerebral edema and rise in intra cranial tension (ICT).This high ICT can compress vital part of brain which regulates blood pressure,  pulse and respiration.  Brain tumour itself compress vital centers and cause symptoms. So if your grandfather is taking only 2 breaths per minute than he has lost all his control. He must be unconscious and not responding to deep pain. He may die at any point. His pulse and blood pressure must be unrecordable."},{"Patient":"I have currently survived breast cancer and possibly have skin cancer on my right earlobe...so now I think everything is cancer. A really large egg shaped lump came up on my right butt cheek. It seem like an abcess to me. Could it be possible cancer?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your fear. But every skin lump is not always malignancy in your case. Yes, chances are high but skin lump can be due to other causes like infection or allergy.In your case at present I think you should first get done clinical examination of your lump. Than ultrasound examination and biopsy from the lump.Biopsy is needex in any lump for confirmation of diagnosis. In my opinion it seems abscess mostly."},{"Patient":"My father got diagnosed with small cell lung cancer ( extensive ) last July 13,2014. The mass on his right lung measured 10 cm. cancer metastasized already to his bones, liver and lymph node. He will be starting chemo maybe tomorrow. Can nutrilite double x help him with the ca tx? Thanks","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Small cell carcinoma of lung is very aggressive and notorious cancer. It can rapidly deteriorate patient and succumb him in death.And it is highly responsive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. So start chemotherapy as soon as possible. Any cancer patient needs nutritional support. So it is better to give him multivitamins,  anti oxidants and protein supplements for symptomatic relief and subjective well ness.So you can definitely give nutrilite double x. But start chemotherapy as soon as possible."},{"Patient":"Hi, my husband aged 42 yrs is diagnosed with liver cancer with cirrhosis(ihcc)...after taking the first chemo last to last week he developed jaundice and cannot be given anymore chemo...now he is under palliative care...what can be our next move...when can he recieve the next chemo or is it that he won t be getting chemo anymore? which is better for him Prosure or Amway protein powder?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your problem and condition. Chemotherapy drugs are very toxic to the body especially liver and kidneys. So we need to be very cautious in cirrhotic patient as chances of acute liver failure are high.And your husband has already developed jaundice after chemotherapy , so we can not give further chemo. His body will not withstand it.Better to start palliative treatment in the form of multivitamins,  anti oxidants, protien powder and painkillers. Discuss end of life issues with him.And both the powder are good. You can use either of them."},{"Patient":"My brother is a recovering alcoholic of 7 months and was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma 5 weeks ago. Anything that can go wrong has. He had adverse reactions to the medicines prior to chemo, chemo went not well, and now he is extremely angry, makes up stories, breaks into houses at night, goes drinking, yells and grunts at us and makes very irrational decisions. It started 1 week ago and is steadily getting worse. Could this be a psychotic break or a reaction to the new pill he started 2 weeks ago, Klonopin? I need to keep him and his family safe","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your problem and condition. In his case following are the possibilities for his symptoms. 1. Alcohol withdrawal can lead to similar kind of symptoms. 2. Spread of non hodgkin lymphoma in the brain and this causes similar symptoms too.3. Sever liver damage either by alcohol or by metastases and this can produce early hepatic encephalopathy.4. Any malignancy itself produce sudden psychological shock and behavioural changes.So better to admit him in hospital and discuss all these with doctor."},{"Patient":"I experienced a very bad radiation recali when put on Gemzar. I think I am beginning the same experience after three sessions of Halaven. Know anything about this and what I could use to lesson the symptoms? I can not go through what I did in March. It was a total reburn of the area.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Radiation recall is unavoidable complication in some patients.  But you should follow these to reduce the severity of reaction.1. Drink plenty of fluids. Keep yourself hydrated. 2. Start antihistamine drugs.3. Start anti inflammatory drugs.4. Start oral steroids if you feel above drugs are not working well.5. Start multivitamin and anti oxidant drugs.6. Avoid sun exposure after radiotherapy. Try all these, you will not have radiation recall."},{"Patient":"Hello, I am 32 y/o female on hormone replacement therapy (estrogen transdermal patch and progesterone 1 week per month.) I have been diagnosed with premature ovarian failure 6 years ago. Recently I skipped my progesterone because my period came the month before this past month and the month before that. This month I have not had a period but I have had 2 occasions of spotting 3 weeks apart. The spotting is light pink, watery and only when I have wiped on 2 separate occasions. So in total I have not take. Progesterone for about 4 months although I have the estrogen patch on daily. I took a pregnancy test (thinking/hoping the first occasion of light spotting (3 weeks ago) was implantation bleeding) a few days ago and it s negative. I have been feeling very mildy nauseous off and on for 1 week. The second incidence of light pink spotting while wiping was this evening. I don t have abdominal or pelvic pain, fever, bloating, urinary frequency or any other symptoms besides the very mild nausea and occasional indigestion (which I never usually get) I do not usually spot between periods and I am concerned. I will make an appt with my gyn MD next week but I wanted to run it by an MD tonight. Of course my concern is uterine cancer or something like that. Thanks for reading!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should not worry at all for uterine cancer. Your age is too young to have uterine cancer. Plus you are on estrogen which is protective against uterine cancer. This is the reason why uterine cancer is common in postmenopausal women and not in child bearing age.So avoid stress and tension about cancer.You are having hormonal imbalance.  So get done hormone levels and consult your gynecologist. Don't worry for uterine cancer."},{"Patient":"Hello. Here is my question. I recently had a CT of chest with contrast. Findings: right upper lobe mass cented at approximately image #32 measuring l.2 x 0.9 x 2.4 cm in its cephalocaudad, AP and transverse dimensions. This mass corresponds with the noduar opacity seen on the chest x-ray. No other masses or suspicious lung nodules are identified. No significant hilar or mediastinal adenophathy. Impression: There is l.2 x 0.9 x 2.4 cm right upper lobe mass. I favor this representing a primary lung carcinoma rather than a metastasis. This X-ray and CT were ordered by my otolaryngologist who removed a cancer from my tongue 5 years ago and was doing a follow up. I have not seen a pulmonologist as yet. From this information above, can I tell what type or stage this lung carcinoma is? Thank you. Dolores","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In your case It is very difficult to say whether this lung mass is primary or it is secondary due to spread from previous tongue cancer.But in my opinion it is secondary from tongue cancer only. And you should get done PET scan to rule out metastases in other organs too. If only lung nodule is there in PET scan than you can go for lobectomy of involved lobe.This will cure your nodule."},{"Patient":"I'm a 16 year old female and, I've never noticed this before but about 2 months ago I noticedI hve a indent on my left side of my stomach by my belly button, it don't hurt to touch but I sometimes get a dull pain where the indent is. so my question is, could it be gas pains?

Im sorry she has stage 4 cancer and is currently on hospice care also.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Stage 4 cancer patients have metastases in their body. This means cancer cells are dividing very fast and enormously.  These dividing cells release great amout of cytokines and inflammatory mediators.These all substance act on brain and cumulatively decrease appetite,  decrease oral inake and loss of weight.This is the time when most of the patients succumb to death."},{"Patient":"Hi- I went for a mammogram and an ultra sound today because I found a large hard lump in my right breast on Monday. They did the mammogram and ultrasound and then decided to do a biopsy today. The lump found was 4.5cm and was described as a rubber golf ball. They had a very difficult time getting the biopsy because the lump was so hard and they couldn t get into it. I am very worried that this is cancerous and I am worried about how long I have had it since it is so large. Any input would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.There are many causes for lump inthe breast.But the description you provided points towards either fibroadenoma or malignancy. Hardness you described seen most commonly in malignancy.  But biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis of breast lump.And no need to worry much even if this turns out to be malignant, as breast cancer treatment is very effective and life expectancy is very high. Newer surgical techniques and improved chemotherapy and radiotherapy make breast cancer a treatable cancer. So no need to worry much. Just get done biopsy."},{"Patient":"46 yr old brother diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer with Mets to liver & lymph nodes in November 2014 He has had radiation & oral chemo with mixed response.

He appears yellow and has blood in his urine. My mother plans to take him to the ER in the morning for a transfusion. This may be the last transfusion. Any guess as to a timeline?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.CLL is chronic lymphocytic leukemia.It is blood malignancy.  Involves mostly bone marrow and liver.It causes blood haemolysis and decrease blood production due to bone marrow infiltration.So his hemoglobin is reduced with low platelets. Due to hemolysis, he is having high bilirubin and this causes yellow appearance of him.Low platelets can cause spontaneous bleeding so his urine is having blood.And sever anemia (Hb 3) can cause pulmonary edema and pleural effusion.So all these are definitely not good signs for survival.In my opinion he has less than 1 month."},{"Patient":"my mother is undergoing chemotherapy for gall bladder carcinoma,she underwent a surgery 34 days back,she s 54 years old ,height around 5.7 feet,weight around 78,an established case of ulcerative colitis since 30 years,are nutrilite protein suppliments helpful for her plz advice for a proper diet for her","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCmit wont have any direct effect on cancer but it may improve her general condtiions and be good nutritional support for her future fight against tumor. gallbladder ca is serious condition with generally poor prognosis but it is owrth to complete chemotherapy to raise chancer of long survival  Wish you good health.

Poor oral intake.2. Excess loss in urine.3. Excess loss in stool (diarrhoea).Cancer patients tend to have poor appetite. So their oral intake is low.If cancer has spread in kidney than this csn alter the function of kidney and cause excessive loss in urine.Cancers patients are prone to gastrointestinal infection as their body defence is weakened.

I haven't been on one in years. The day before yesterday was the first time. Afterward I felt as though I had been punched in the stomach. My actual stomach just below my ribs. My lower abs felt fine. I found it difficult to breathe as a result.I thought maybe it was the workout and I was just sore but the pain felt internal.The pain subsided. I rode again today somewhere and shortly after (maybe 45min) the pain returned until I ate something. After riding back today, I had no issues. Then suffering from a mild heartburn hours later (which I often get) I took some alkaseltzer. Then I had yogurt with granola and some chips with mild salsa. I didn't over eat. The pain returned worse than ever about 30min later. My bowel movements have been regular.My stomach is inflamed and I am bloated with difficulty breathing. I am worried it may be a hernia. But I'm wondering if a dietary change could be to blame?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.This sounds more like a peptic ulcer. The pain usually appears after a meal. Nausea can be present and chest burning. If it is about hernia, it can be hiatus hernia ( a kind of internal hernia where a part of stomach gets to the chest cavity).I suggest you to visit your doctor, have blood work and abdominal ultrasound. Gastroscopy should be next. During this test also Helicobacter Pylori infection will be verified. In case of its presence, antibiotics are necessary.In a meanwhile please avoid fatty foods, spicy foods, coffee, alcohol.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"Had single mastectomy 2 weeks ago for Pagets disease with an underlying tumor that was also removed.

But chances of this os very less.During surgery, due to handling of tumour mass, there is great risk of spillage and peritoneal seeding by tumour cells. This is unavoidable. So this can give rise to recurrence.  So in modern era this is the reason for which post operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy is given. The basic principle is to kill seeded malignant cells.So peritoneal seeding during surgical handling can be the cause for your recurrence."},{"Patient":"My 14 year old son has a hard lump on top of his shoulder.

Or could they test some nodes to see if cancer is present. I am scared. I need another option.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Yes there are other ways to diagnose lung cancer. They are1. S.CEA level.2. Sputum cytology3. Bronchoscopy and BAL (Broncho Alveolar Lavage) examination for malignant cells.4. PET scan to look for metastases in cervical lymphnodes and other organs like liver, spleen, bones etc.If any of the above are positive for malignancy than we can start treatment for lung cancer.But the best and gold standard is biosy and histopathological examination. So discuss these things with your doctor and try to work out best possible way for you."},{"Patient":"the gyn found a 5 centimeter mass in my mom s uterus. she s 66. She was sent for a ct scan which showed no infected lymph nodes with cancer. she had a CA 125 test done that came back normal and her pap came back good. could the mass be something other than cancer? wouldn t the Ct scan have shown if it was cancer? we re all a nervous wreck in waiting!thanks","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Since your mother's CA 125 is normal, PAP smear is normal and CT shows only mass without lymphnodes,  I think it is benign tumour of uterus like fibroid, dermoid or lipoma.But the 100% sure test to rule out cancer is biopsy and histopathological examination. So to rule out malignancy and fear of cancer get done biopsy.If this comes normal than no need to worry about cancer. You may have above mentioned benign tumours."},{"Patient":"My name is nancy w I am 70 years old and have many medical conditions including Common Variable Immuni-deficiency. I am courrently having a fever ranging form 99.5 to 100.4 and have this fever for 12 days or so. My white count was 16,000 last week on CBC. Dr has me on 2 antibiotics: Ceftin and Zpack. the fever continues and I am concerned with possible more serious condition. I had a chest x-ray and showed possible pneumonia and urine sample with possible infection (waiting for culture) Would this be possible other more serious indicators of leukemia or other cancer? My email is YYYY@YYYY thank you cannot pay . sorry for your time","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you should not worry for cancer.As blood cancer show count in lakhs usually more than 1 lakh. And you are having clear cut infection in lung and urine.This is the reason for your fever and 16000 count.You may have chronic resistant infection in lung and urine which is not sensitive to routine antibiotics.  So get done urine culture and sputum culture with sensitivity to guide antibiotic therapy.So no need to worry for leukaemia or any other cancer. Be relax and calm. Treat infections and you will be alright."},{"Patient":"My husband was recently (6/20/14) diagnosed with prostate cancer. He also has nodules on his lungs and most recently they did a procedure and withdrew 2100 cc of fluid from his lungs. It is a week later and we are back in the hospital with the lung full of fluid again. Oh and his Gleason score was 9. What should I expect?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion your husband is having malignant pleural effusion due to metastatic spread in pleura from prostate cancer.So get done pleural fluid cytology to rule out this. Your husband is having stage 4 prostate cancer as he is having  lung nodule. So only palliative treatment is advisable.  For malignant pleural effusion, pleurodesis should be done. In this both pleural surface are make to adhere by talc. It is done through either pleuroscope or thoracoscope.So better to consult pulmonologist and discuss about pleurodesis as cure for pleural effusion."},{"Patient":"Hello my physician recently advised after a consult I have irritated keratosis with mild squamous atypia what does this mean and she advised cryotherapy. I have been addressing this issue to physicians since 6-7 years ago and finally a new physician was able to tell me what this was. I am a little worried she told me within the next 20 years it could turn into skin cancer. Is this true","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Squamous cell atypia with keratosis can be a pre malignant condition for skin cancer. So if your report suggest this ,than you should get done complete removal of involved skin lesion.Atypia has 50-50 chances of skin cancer. It is disordered growth of cells. Not malignant growth. But if persistent stimuli like ultraviolet rays or friction or chemical exposure is there ,than atypia can turn into malignant growth and produce skin cancer.So better to remove it surgically."},{"Patient":"hi doc, i am a mother of 7 years old child she is suffering from rectal ulcers which initially bleed ed with looses stool, for two month there after, it stopped with some antibiotics , she is still suffering from gas and stomach ache , her stools are two color always constipated initially then normal in color, also she got lymph nods in her tummy.. please suggest the correct medicine","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In pediatric age group infection is the most common cause for lymphnode enlargement. So in my opinion your son is suffering from gastrointestinal infection.But rectal ulcers and alternate bowel habits are something we should investigate.Children do not show rectal ulcers commonly. So I advice you to get done CT abdomen and colonoscopy to reach the diagnosis."},{"Patient":"My 90 year old uncle and fallen and fractured the tibia and fibula. He also has advanced prostrate ca which is not being treated. He had surgery on the leg and it is casted . Now I m worried about poor circulation and infection. Is bone cancer a common complication of prostrate cancer?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Prostate cancer can commonly metastatize to bones especially thoracic vertebrae and long bones like femur, tibia, humerus etc.Metastases from prostate causes osteoblastic secondaries in bones.This makes bone weaker. They causes osteoporosis and demineralisation of bone. So bones become highly fragile and prone to fracture. Even slightest force can cause fracture. Bone metastases are very common after untreated prostate cancer."},{"Patient":"hi. i am experiencing pain around belly button for a week. it comes n goes, just above belly button part is very tight n hurts when i press my belly there and i can hear a heavy pulse. and this happens mostly when i lift up heavy weights and back pains. There's this burning sensation in the abdomen with grumbling sounds","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM,Pain around the belly button and hearing heavy pulses at the same site is suggestive of a vascular pathology.Aorta is the big blood vessel which runs from the thorax to the abdomen before dividing into renal arteries.Any abnormality of the vessel especially aneurysm will cause turbulent blood flow and loud audible pulsations.You need to get a MRI of the abdominal area to know the status of the aorta and other structures.Consult a cardiovascular expert for clinical examination, ordering investigations and hence management.thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"hi my name is gloriann and I have cancer and low platlet count was 50.000 might be lower will find out thurs when I go to my oncologist( spelled it wrong0 I think so he has stopped all cancer treatment my question is will the cancer grow faster now ?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Yes, definitely cancer will grow fast, infact flare up if you stop chemotherapy.

They can rapidly grow in brain and compress the surrounding structures. They akso cause edema in the brain and cause high intracranial pressure (ICP) . Due to this blood supply of brain is hampered and patient looses consciousness and talks irrelevant. So your friend may had all above consequences. So immediately take him to the hospital.  He needs urgent MRI to rule out brain edema and compression. He may need operation too, to decrease iCP."},{"Patient":"My doctor ordered an ultra sound for both breasts after my mammogram showed density in my right breast and a nodule in my left breast.

I worked until my 80th birthday and retired, not because I wanted to but because my health just wouldn t let me continue. I just don t know if I can handle having cancer again. What percentage of dense breasts and nodules are cancer?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion, high possibility of cancerous nodules. Reasons for this1. Known case of uterine cancer2. Not completed chemotherapy as advised by oncophysician.3. Old age is the risk factor for spread in breast.So I advice you to get done biopsy of the nodules and rule out malignancy. So first get done ultrasound and than giided biopsy is required in your case to rule out malignant breast nodules."},{"Patient":"hi, my name is Pam, I have had bladder cancer for 8 years and have had 16 surgeries to remove bladder tumors. I also had my right kidney removed because of the disease. My diagnosis has always been stage 1 non-invasive . Doctors are talking about removing my bladder. I also have had 12 BCG tx. Do you think there is any chance i could have chemo or radiation to kill the cancer cells???","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.If you are having stage 1 non invasive bladder cancer and not imrove with BCG than surgery is the only option. This will increase your life expectancy and decrease chances of metastases. So get done enblock resection of bladder and sampling of lymphnodes.If lymphnodes are positive than post operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy is needed to prevent chsnces of metastases."},{"Patient":"Hi..my boyfriend woke up yesterday morning with a cluster of 5 dark brown flat spots on his chest. Today 3 of the spots have joined together and all of the spots have opened up into sores so they are now dark brown with holes in the middle which are red and sore. He said it was itchy yesterday but not today. His doctor isn t too concerned as he says if it was skin cancer it would take weeks/months to appear, not overnight. He has been referred to a dermatologist in a few weeks. Is the doctor right in saying that it can t be skin cancer as it doesn t appear overnight? It very much looks like flat moles that are spreading rapidly and are bleeding (small amount) and getting scabby. Thanks.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion, no need to worry for skin cancer. As skin cancer does ot appear overnight. It is gradually progressive in nature.I think it is erythema mostly due to friction or insect bite.So no need to worry for skin cancer.Consult dermatologist and get done clinical examination and if needed get done biopsy from the lesion.So be relax and calm"},{"Patient":"I have bladder cancer and about to have surgery. My liver enzymes are high and the doctor wants me to have a bone scan before he does the surgery. Should I be worried. My onconogist wants me to also have a cat scan of my head because of extreme nausea.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Bone scan is done to rule out bone metastases if present. PET scan is done to rule out metastases present in other organs like liver, lung, brain etc or not.And surgery is indicated or advisable only if cancer is localised or not having distal organ mets and bone mets.So if either in bone scan or in PET scan, metastases are found  than surgery is contraindicated. So get done bone scan and PET scan before surgery."},{"Patient":"My father was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon with mucin-secreting signet ring cells with malignancy, at the age of 63 and was immediately advised to undergo surgical resection, but unfortunately passed away 3 days after surgery due to cardiac arrest.

However I have this morning noticed that my bone on the right hand side of my collar bone has grown. I am really concerned and worried. Could it be cancer ?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion no need to worry much. You are not having cancer as your endoscopy and scan is normal. So forget about malignancy. In my opinion you are having inflammatory enlargement of right cervical lymphnode due to sore throat.Most common cause of sore throat is infection. So may bd this infection gives you enlarged nodes.Better to start antibiotics. If not improve in 5 days than get done clinical examination of swelling."},{"Patient":"Hi my name is kathleen , and I had breast cancer in 2009 and had the right breast removed..

But I have a thickness and its hurts only when I touch it. Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion no need to worry much for hard feeling of breast tissue because your ultrasound examination is nagetive.This because of radiotherapy you had received. Radiotherapy damages surrounding fat tissue and overlying skin too.So due to this fibrous healing occurs in fat tissue and this gives hard feeling.Overlying skin also becomes rough.So no need to worry much as these are routine side effects of radiotherapy."},{"Patient":"Hello,I have a friend that just expressed a concern for her health. She said she is experiencing pain under her ribcage on the left side shooting through to her back, her vision is blurry and she is extremely fatigued and had noticed sensitivity in her lower left leg accompanied by slight swelling.

As I don't think it is cancer. But better to get done some investigation s to rule out other causes.First get done ECG to rule out cardiac cause for left sided chest pain. If this is normal than get done chest x ray to rule out pulmonary causes for chest pain.If this is also normal than no need to worry much.

How close to the end do you think he is when this starts happening?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.HCC is Hepatic Cell Carcinoma.  It is having poor prognosis and rapid worsening. There are many causes for lower limb swelling in HCC. But common ones are1. Hypoproteinemia2. Anemia3. Lymphatic obstruction due to spread of cancer in lymph nodes.Liver synthesize blood and proteins. So in advanced stage of HCC functions of liver are poor and so Hypoproteinemia and anemia can develop. Blister on shin can be due to infection of skin.HCC itself has life expectancy of less than 1 year. But when liver start loosing its function life expectancy is less than 6 months."},{"Patient":"I was recently hospitalized for five days due to anemia and had to be given 3 pints of blood. my hemoglobin level was 6.5.

Cystic malignancy. Pseudocyst can be due to trauma of abdomen. And it is usually subsided over time.Infection can cause inflammatory cyst too.And rarely malignancy can be seen as cyst.So better to repeat MRI after 3 months.

Since your sister has kidney metastasis,  involvement of distal organ, she is in end stage (4) disease.And no harm in takin morphine and other narcotics.

Papillary carcinoma typically arises as an irregular, solid or cystic mass that comes from otherwise normal thyroid tissue. This cancer has a high cure rate with 10-year survival . It  is the most common thyroid cancer .Thyroid cells are unique in that they have the cellular mechanism to absorb iodine. The iodine is used by thyroid cells to make thyroid hormone. No other cell in the body can absorb or concentrate iodine. Physicians can take advantage of this fact and give radioactive iodine to patients as a treatment option for papillary thyroid cancer . Suggest your doctor take his expert advice for that .Your body is always fighting something -- an infection, a toxin, an allergen, a food or the stress response -- and somehow it redirects its hostile attack on your joints, your brain, your thyroid, your gut, your skin, or sometimes your whole body. Your immune system is your defense against invaders .In fact, everyone has cancer cells forming all the time. But normally their strong immune system .kills the cancer cells fast enough that a person is never “diagnosed” with cancer. But when the immune system becomes weak, the cancer cells can grow out of control , the disease overpowers . Our health depends on 'what we eat ,when we eat , & how we eat 'on our life style .Gulping on only medicine & antibiotic will not help cure unless you modify your life style and your food habits .Illness or stress can trigger cancer cells growth because hormones produced to combat illness or stress can also cause your blood sugar to rise. Same is the case with cancer . Constant stress ,illness ,worry , anger . lack of nutritious food & lack of exercise do cause cancer and diabetes .Use of supplements  full of antioxidants can be helpfull in strengthening the immune system which is  very effective in alleviating and even avoiding the unpleasant symptoms of the diseases .Meanwhile I will suggest you to give spplements to strengthen immune system1. Take balanced diet & nutrients such as fish oil - omega 3 , vitamin C, vitamin D, and probiotics which includes all essential nutrients in natural form - protiens ,fiber , fruits , green veges , vitamins , minerals and lot of water to eleminate toxins from body .2. supplements full of antioxidants as mixture of ginger , garlic , lemon juice , vinegar of coconut water , bark of mooringa tree & honey . Mix ,all 6 ,in equal quantity ..Take 25 ml with equal quantity of water,for 3-4 days . And for next 25 days without water . it is great antioxidant helps allay bacteria on mass basis3. Juice of bitter gourd 25-30 ml helps kill becteria on mass basis is great antioxidant .4. Aloe vera juice 30 ml + Amla juice 2 spoons helps kill becteria on mass basis is great antioxidant .5. Turmeric powder a level spoon with a cup of hot milk at bed time serves as great antioxidant .6 .

Became very weak .was taken to hospital . While there I had several episodes of urgency to go to the loo which produced blood with lots of blackish clots . CT scan was clear . Bloods ok . Haemorrhoids we re suggested but I am very sceptical as there was so much blood . Going for colonoscopy on Wednesday . What do you think ?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Since your CT abdomen is normal, possibility of mass is less likely.But bleeding from rectal and that too large suggest malignant involvement only. In early cases mass has not formed but mucosal irregularities can give rise to bleeding and mass in future. And this can not be identified by CT scan. We need to do colonoscopy for this and biopsy from suspicious lesion will confirm the diagnosis. So you may have early malignancy.Get fons colonoscopy."},{"Patient":"yes , just found out today my uncle has just weeks to live , he has pancreatic cancer and blood clot . how long can he actually live , he can not eat has not eaten in 10 days. he had bile duct cancer 23 months ago and has really never gotten better from the whipple operation","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Pancreatic cancer is very aggressive in nature and notorious to produce blood clots. These clots can travel in blood and reach to lungs and brain and cause symptoms. So presence of blood clots made your uncle stage 4 pancreatic cancer patient. Only palliative treatment is required.Usual life expectancy is less than 6 months.But since your uncle has stopped eating, I think in his case life expectancy would be less than 2 months."},{"Patient":"I had a partial hysterectomy, uterus only, in 2009.

Since that time I have experienced an absence of sex drive; not low sex drive, NO sex drive . I ve seen gynecologists that prescribed estrogen and even testosterone therapy, but nothing has helped. I am wondering if this condition is permanent or if there is a doctor who specializes in this area and can help.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Radiotherapy damages normal part of body too.And nerves are highly sensitive and easily damaged by radiation.So you may damaged nerves by frequent radiotherapy sessions.Nerves are important in sexual drive. And also important in sexual excitement and all.So due to damaged nerves of pelvic region you have loss of sexual drive.You shoukd take multivitamins containing zinc and b 12. Both are needed for nerve function."},{"Patient":"I took 42 radiation treatment for prostate cancer. and now I have cold feet all of the time.

THANK YOU.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Radiotherapy can damage normal tissues too. And nerves are very much sensitive to radiation. And due to this damage functions of nerves are hampered and sensation they carry are altered.Radiation for prostate cancer can damage pelvic nerves. This nerves supply lower limb. So damage to these can cause cold feet. No specific treatment except vit b 12 should be given.Wear soft shoes to prevent further damage."},{"Patient":"I have had 8 hernia surgeries and over 20 related surgeries trying to relieve pain and other issues.

Is there any relief for me?","Doctor":"hi i had gone through your query and understand your concerns.i advise you taking Homeopathic medicines gives  safe and permanent  cure for your complaints without any surgery and recurrence.The difference between homeopathy and allopathy in the conception of disease is that whereas homeopathy considers the phenomenon of disease  as a part and parcel of the sick individual as it is vitally connected with his life, while the allopath considers disease as independent and universal phenomenon, each disease   having its separate and specific existence in nature.The body is born as one, functions as one, reacts as one, and dies as one. It is  a unity.When affected by sickness, it reacts as a whole. the symptoms  ,which represent this reaction, areFound all over the body and also in the patient mental state.Thus if we want to get a true and complete picture of the sickness, we  must not only consider the chief complaint of the patient  but also the symptoms of all parts of the body and the mind. All troubles of the patient arise from one basic disorder.for the selection of similimum on the basis of causation,location,sensation,modality and concomitants,you should consult your local homeopathic physician for correct diagnosis of the case and remedy to fit your complaints. or mail me at drravib4u@yahoo.co.inI hope this is helpful for you, thank you"},{"Patient":"my mother was diagnosed with peritoneal cancer stage 3. The doctors never made it clear if this was mesothelioma or not. Doing research peritoneal is never listed as a cancer in itself but it is listed under mesothelioma. If her biopsy says she has peritoneal stage 3 cancer does this mean it is mesothelioma or could it be another type of peritoneal cancer? thank you","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Peritoneal malignancies (primary) are very rare. Malignant spread in peritoneum can occur in other organ malignancies.  But primary peritoneal cancer is very rare. The most common one in this is mesothelioma.Mesothelioma is the only peritoneal cancer known. It is also affecting pleura. So if your mother is also having pleural involvement than this must be mesothelioma only.Prognosis is not very good. Chemotherapy is the only treatment available.  Rarely radiotherapy given."},{"Patient":"I need an anti nausea prescription .

And the most common side effect is nausea and vomiting. This can also contribated by general debility of the patient.So patient on chemotherapy needs special attention for nausea and vomiting. Ondensetrone is the drug used specifically for chemotherapy induced vomiting.  It is 5HT receptor blocker. Mouth dissolving tablets are also available for quick action.So try this too. And you can get this prescription by any medicine doctor."},{"Patient":"I am an 87yr old lady and when I had to have my appendicitis out last summer a small cancer was found onn one of my kidney s i chose to leave it alone, and tthe Dr agreed with me, this year when I had a ultra sound it had grown about a centimeter again I chose to leave it alone , wondering if I did the right thing/ ,","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you have done correct thing.At your age it is not advisable to diagnose malignancy and start chemotherapy and radiotherapy as these will not improve your life expectancy. Any treatment or work up is worth doing if it improves life expectancy and reduce suffering s. But this is not true for your age.Infact chemo and radiotherapy will harm you more as theyare not rouine medicines,  they are highly toxic drugs.So I advice to leave it as it is and if you are symptomatic in future than go for palliative treatment."},{"Patient":"hello dr i recently had a colonoscopy they found 2 ployps i got the results yesterday from the lab my dr said i had good news A acending polypecyomy /Tubular adenoma B Rectum polypecyomy/ Tubular adenoma with focal high grade dysplasia THE COMMENT The cauterixed resection margin is negative for dysplasia ,my question is this cancerious? my dr told me ido a follow up in 6 mpnths to a year i decide to follow in NOVEMBER 2014 What is DYSPLASIA? Thank you dr","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Dysplasia is pathological term and related to morphology of cells seen under microscope. And it is used for all cells of the body.Dysplasia means abnormal cells in morphology. Most common is malignant cells. So any cell with malignant potential show certain morphological changes like high N-C ratio (nucleo cytoplasmic ratio) , granular cytoplasm etc. This termed as dysplastic cell (likely to malignant).So presence of dysplasia means high probability of malignancy. And absence of dysplasia (as in your report) means less probability of malignancy. So no need to worry. Your report is good. Get done follow up after 10-12 months."},{"Patient":"Hi....

I just need some encouragement for my wife daughter and I.....really scared","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your condition and problem.There are two possibilities in your case.1. Infective enlargement of lymphnodes as skin lesions are due to psoriasis only. Since you are on immunosuppressive therapy for psoriasis this canbe the cause.2. Malignant lymphnode and spread of malignancy in skin.So better to consult pulmonologist and get done CT Thorax with contrast. CT gives clear cut idea about the lesion.If necessary get done biopsyfrom the lymphnode to confirm the diagnosis."},{"Patient":"I have a friend who is a 50 year old male who was diagnosed with kidney cancer in Novemeber. The tumor was large and there was indication it had moved to one of his lungs lymph nodes. They recommended surgery to remove the cancerous kidney and start chemotherapy. My friend declined. He thinks there is some kind of snake oil cure out there. Actually, he just shelled out about 600.00 for CBD oil. He says his urine is rusty in color which makes me think blood obviously. He absolutely refuses to go back to his doctor. They told him to contact hospice. Based on this little bit of info, do you think he could still hae a chance if I can make him go and have the kidney and tumor removed and maybe there is an alternative treatment besides chemo? I got mad when he got this CDB oil, and finally asked him how he was doing and he said he feels oily . He can t eat. Will the kidney tumor cause his kidney to shut down?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Untreated kidney tumour will definitely shut downhis kidneys. So better to start treatment. This will increase life expectancy and reduce his suffering s.Since he is having lung nodule, he is having stage 4 kidney cancer.The only treatment modality is palliative treatment. This consist of debulking surgery and chemotherapy.  This is done just to reduce suffering s. And no role of any oil or any herbal substances. So better , you should take him to other oncosurgeon and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"My mom 60 years old obese women had a car accident and she was in severe back pain. The back CT revealed there is nodule in the lung. So she had chest CT and the report says there is 8 mm nodule in each lower zone along with D12 compression fracture indicating lung and dorsal metastases. The question, the fracture is a result of cancer or oestoporosis or the accident. Is chemotherapy the treatment for her cancer?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Lung cancer is very notorious in spread. It can spread by both, blood and lymphnodes.Bone involvement is very common especially thoracic vertebrae.  And bone metastases from lung cancer are usually osteolytic in nature. So they produce demineralisation and osteoporosis both. So these bones are highly prone to fracture even by slightest force.So your mother had osteolytic bone metastases in thoracic vertebrae and fracture after accident.Bone metastases made lung cancer stage 4 disease (inoperable). Only treatment option is palliative chemotherapy and nutritional support in the form of multivitamins,  calcium and vitamin d."},{"Patient":"Hi i am a 17 year old black teenager and i haven t had sex before and i have a this kinda shiny lump/bump before it looked like a pimple so i popped it.

Testicular cancers usually occur after age of 45-50 years.

Any help understanding what this is would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Metastatic appendicieal adenocarcinoma is the malignant tumour involving appendix.It is rare tumour to occur. But very agressive in nature.It spreads by blood and lymphnodes.And presentation is similar as you mentioned like abdominal pain, vomiting etc. And this can be diagnosed only on histopathology examination.And this give rise to metastases in liver, lungs etc.So metastatic appendicieal adenocarcinoma means malignancy of appendix which has spread in liver, lung and other distal sites.It is not a good malignancy.

But it is not 100% true. Not all moles are going to develop in cancer.Moles on face are more prone for malignant transformation due to constant exposure to UV rays of sun.Same thing is true for moles on high fruction area like in inner thigh, under arm, belly buttin etc.So no need to worry at present.

Lung cancer when spread in pulmonary artery and gives tumour thrombi, this suggest worst prognosis.  Your mother soon develop massive pulmonary embolism (tumour thrombi) and pulmonary hypertension.  Infact she may started this as you are saying that she is puffed up. Lower limb edema is the earliest sign of pulmonary hypertension.

Lipoma is benign soft tissue tumour containing fat tissue only.It is harmless, non tender, non itchy. So ideally no treatment is required. But in some cases it grows in number and size.

It can metastasize to all organs of the body. Liver and lung being highly vascular organs affect more.Liver and lung metastases points towards worse prognosis.And disease like cancer has great impact on psychosomatic behaviour of the patient.

The common ones are1. Progression of disease. HCC can affect liver function and worsen this in end stages. So high urea can cause hepatic encephalopathy.  And this in early phase can cause tremors and dizziness 2. Due to chemotherapy.Many chemotherapy agents are known to cause tremors and dizziness.3. Poor oral intake and generalised debility. Tremors and dizziness can be due to this.So better to give him nutrition support and discuss end of life issues."},{"Patient":"hip pain i got a lump on my hip not painfully unless hit hard it been there since i was pg 2010 i have had alout of doc and er doctors look at it and they tell me it nothing to worrie about four days ago the doc say it he still tell me he dont feel it cancer . so he did a x ray of my pelvis it came out normal i am waiten on my ultersound to come back in i meet with a surgon on wednesday i aint sick just have pain all the time what do u thnk it is do i got cancer","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion you are having infection in your swelling.

They tend to have frequent fluctuations. And in terminal stages only palliative care can be given. Surgery is contraindicated. Give her nutrition support in the form of multivitamins,  iron, blood transfusion etc.If pain is there than you can give transdermal patch of centrally acting pain killer.

And chemotherapy is the only solution in multiorgan disease patients. As surgery and general anaesthesia are life threatening for you. Only chemotherapy is given.

Do you have weight loss or low grade fever?If you are having any of the above than chances of malignant polyp are more.So in my opinion you should consult ENT surgeon and get done clinical examination of polyp.

After about 10 days he saw his Dr. stating he must have pulled a muscle (something experienced more than once through his life). Muscle relaxers and prescription Advil didn t help. Prior to seeing the Dr. and for a few days after, he had painted our entire condo inside and plowed driveway snow. He then had an X Ray, followed by a lower spine MRI which showed lesions. Then came a nuclear bone scan which showed Metastatic lesions needing more identification. A Pet Scan was scheduled but by then he was on the sofa all day unable to sit or stand. The scan never took place. He went by ambulance on 2/23/14 to the hospital, in pain but with his usual sense of humor. He spent 12 days in the hospital. A biopsy and full body MRI confirmed lung cancer which had spread to his liver and spine. It was too far gone for radiation. On the 13th day he was sent to a hospice where he spent 29 hours, then died. When dealing with his sudden death I feel he was cheated by not having more of a warning during the prior months or was he just too strong to recognize it? Maybe this cancer (adenocarcinoma) is just so aggressive and we should be glad he went quickly with minimal suffering but my grief is expressed more in anger than in tears of emotion. Can you comment to help me understand? Thank you.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your feeling and anger. But lung cancer can deteriorate rapidly.BronchoAlveolar Carcinoma (BAC) is a variant of adenocarcinoma of lung. BAC is rapidly progressive in nature and patient dies within a week of diagnosis.It is the nature of the BAC which spreads not only through blood and lymphnodes but also by continuous spread in bronchi.So by the time we reach the diagnosis cancer spreads to the entire lung.So he may have BAC variant of adenocarcinoma."},{"Patient":"Symptoms: Right Flank Pain: is a dull aching, throbbing pressure on a regular basis but flares to a pretty intolerable stabbing pain. It is located mainly right at the base of my ribs. It occasionally radiates into my lower back and kidney area on my right side. Additionally I have very tender spots to palpation on my lower rib cage front and back and just below my rib cage on the front. I often feel like my kidney is achy. The flares in pain seem to be avoided by minimal activity. Night sweats/hot flashes: I have been experiencing hot flashes mostly in the late evening/overnight period. I feel like I have a severe fever, I have checked several times and have no fever. Additionally I find myself very sweaty at night, I awake and find my pillow damp and my shirt soaked with sweat. The night sweats and hot flashes are not normal to me. Extreme Fatigue: I feel tired and unrested upon awakening and desire to sleep in the afternoon as well as go to bed much earlier than normal. Initially while off work I was sleeping 12+ hours each night and napping 1-2 times during the day. Now that I have had to return to work I find myself feeling unrested upon awakening in the mornings and desiring a nap when I get home. Additionally, I am going to be earlier that I would normally. Nausea w/o vomiting and appetite reduction: While I do think my appetite is better than it was just a few weeks ago I still do not see it as normal. I am a 27 year of female who I would consider to be healthy. My past medical history includes a C-Section 2 ½ years ago and a Cholescystectomy in October of 2009. I also smoke less than half a pack a day. My recent problems began a little over a month ago with a diagnosed UTI in the ER. My urine labs came back rather bad. I was prescribed a 7 day course of Cipro, told if my symptoms worsened to return, and sent on my way. Two days later my pain was just as bad as before but it no longer hurt to urinate. So I like my discharge instructions stated returned to the ER. They ran a urine test, blood test and gave me a liter of fluids. They said that the urine tested negative this time and there was nothing remarkable about my blood work They gave me meds for the nausea told me to continue the Cipro and sent me on my way, this time telling me it could possible be pyelonephritis and to follow up with my PCP. So the next morning I did just that and was seen by my PCP. She too ran a urine test and it was still negative. She said she wanted to rule out a pyelo so she scheduled me for a CT of my abdomen and pelvis. I had the CT scan done and the findings were: small umbilical hernia, normal appearance of the appendix and small mesenteric lymph nodes right lower quadrant, otherwise normal unenhanced CT pelvis. Following this she gave me a diagnosis of Mesenteric Lymphadenitis. I was basically told to rest and given a work excuse until further notice. I was given Vicodin for the pain and told to continue the Phenergan as needed for the nausea. After about two weeks I was starting to feel better, not as tired and not having flares or attacks of extreme pain. After several follow up visits and three weeks total off work my PCP released me to return to work. I did just that. On my second day back however my pain once again worsened. I called my PCP and she said that the Mesenteric Lymphadenitis doesn’t flare and wanted to see me. So I once again returned to see her. This time she paid careful attention in palpating my abdomen checking all areas and organs. My pain upon palpation in the kidney area has greatly improved but now I have pain around my rib cage, front and back. And some tenderness just below the rib cage in the front. She is stumped and told me so, she does another urine test in the office which comes back negative. She decides to send me for a chest X-Ray, blood work up and stool sample. The X-Ray is normal, stool samples came back good and blood work as follows: High HGB, HCT, MCH and Low RDW-CV. Now I have been referred to a Gastroenterologist which I see next week.","Doctor":"Welcome to health care magic. 1.The CT report suggest there is evidence of hernia - which can give the pain and abdominal discomfort especially when you work or lift any weight.2.The lymph nodal enlargement is seen due to any infection / inflammation, which can be localised or systemic.3.In this case my recommendation will be to take basic diet - Non spicy, junk and excess fat content. Avoid alcohol.    4.Take more of fibrous content of food, more of salads and fruits along with a briskly 20 min walk - the things should be normalise in couple of weeks.5. If you do not feel any change - you need to get further evaluation with ultrasound for the hernia and gastroenterology consultation.

Therefore, you should go to ER and talk to a surgeon for the right treatment. Although your periods might be missed, this does not mean you are pregnant.

We have noticed that his testicles have gone a dark colour. Would this have anything to do with the chemo, or could it have something to do with a blood infection. He actually passed away on Friday 22/8/14.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion he might be having infection and decreased blood supply in testis. Chemotherapy makes patient immunosuppressive and prone to infection. And many chemotherapy drugs are toxic to blood vessels. They actually damage them and cause poor blood supply to the affected organ.So he may have chemotherapy induced infection of testis and poor blood supply, which lead to blackening of skin over testis."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr. Grief, my sister was diagnosed with cervical cancer less than a year ago. She received chemo which ended in Dec.. Last week she went for her check up and the cancer had spread to lymph nodes near her liver. I ve always heard that once cancer has spread to lymph nodes it is really difficult to treat. Is this true? Also my brother said that since it s so close to the liver, it may spread to her liver which may cause her liver to fail.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Local lymphatic spread of cancer can be removed by dn block surgeries ( removal of whole uterus, ovaries and draining lymphnodes). But once distant lymphnodes are involved like in your sister's case hepatic nodes, than chances of cure are decreased and one can not do surgery as tumour has spread in the body.So involvement of liver nodes suggest distant soread in cervical cancer.And yes, chances of liver involvement are high if surrounding nodes are involved."},{"Patient":"Hi.

The hospital remains closed on Sunday.Can you help in any case?Thanks a lot,Phani","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Diarrhoea in chemotherapy patients can be due to1. Gut infection2. Side effects of chemotherapy drugs.Chemotherapy makes patient immunosuppressive and more prone to infection. So infection is first probability. Chemotherapy drugs are cytotoxic. They may change and kill normal bacterial flora of gut. So this can also lead to diarrhoea. Treatment consist of1. Plenty of fluids orally. ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution).2. Avoid junk and outside food.3. Eat only freshly, properly food. Avoid uncooked food.If not improve in 2-3 days better to get done stool culture."},{"Patient":"My cousin is hospitalized due to a collapsed lung that has not reinflated with the drainage of the fluid. They have done a talc pleurodesis procedure that failed. She has heart damage due to previous radiation tx associated with breast cancer 10 years ago. She has had a bronchoscopy with results pending. Why is the lung not reinflating? And would you feel that lung cancer may a pending dx? Would she be discharged at some point without getting the lung reinflated on supportive measures? I wish I could provide more info but I am not the one with POT.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion there few causes for non expanding lung in breast cancer patients. 1. Malignant bronchopleural fistula (BPF)2. Thick fibrous adhesions which prevent lung expansion. 3. Chronic infection of pleura causes pleural thickening and this can prevent lung expansion. So better to consult thoracic surgeon and get done repeat CT thorax. Thoracoscopic technique called VATS (Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery) can be useful in this case. In this technique pleural cavity is seen under vision and if BPF is present than we can seal the fistula, if thick adhesions are there we can break the adhesion. More over pleural biopsy can also be taken for diagnosis and rule out pleural metastases. So consult thoracic surgeon and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"I am a 5 years in remission from Hodgkin s disease...They found a 6 mm nodule on my left thyroid that has grown 1 mm from 9/2012...I am going for a biopsy next week...what is the % chance that this is thyroid cancer...Hodgkin lymphoma again, or nothing?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.in my opinion it is nothing but a thyoid nodule only. As it is grown only 1 mm in more than 2 years.And 1 mm change can be due to technical errors ,mostly in the reporting and interpretation. So this 1 mm variation can be due to radiologist error.But better to rule out other things like thyroid malignancy or hodgkin lymphoma.I think the biopsy will come only as benign lesion. So no need to worry. Get done biopsy."},{"Patient":"hi i have just been diagnosed with breast cancer, operation showed clean margin an nothing in the lymph node, i have found a dark round pea sized lump on my forearm that is darker than the surrounding skin. could it be the cancer has spread. it has been 4 weeks after operation starting kemo next tuesday.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Clinical examination of your forearm swelling is must.And I don't thick it is due to malignant spread as your lymphnodes are clear for malignancy. Breast cancers travel mistly through lymphatic system.  So once lymphnodes are clear for malignancy chances of spread in skin is less likely.So I suggest you to first get done clinical examination of forearm swelling. It may be due to allergy or insect bite etc. If suspicious biopsy is needed."},{"Patient":"Hello, I started having an uncomfortable feeling in the middle portion of my stomach mostly around my belly button.

I dont know if its connected to the cancer or not but im freezing, extremely nautious and parts of my body feel like they are on fire.

Are you on temoxifene or other breast cancer drugs.If you had chemotherapy and radiotherapy for breast cancer than due to skin damage tanning is very common. And nausea is very well known complication of chemo and radiotherapy. If you are on temoxifene than this can be a side effect of this drug.Another possibility is deficiency of vitamins due to tumour itself.So start multivitamin tablets."},{"Patient":"Hello, A few months ago, my belly button became itchy and flaky. When I scratched it, it became red. Also, I don t really clean it as often as I should so there is a lot of black build up in my belly button. However, there is no discharge; just itchy (when I aggravate it) and flaky. I ve just read an article saying that a dermatologist had a flaky belly button and it ended up being cancer. I have set up an appointment with my doctor but just wanted to ask someone on here first what it could be. Thank you for all your help!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Yes, you are right. Continuous irritation of any skin part can lead to skin malignancy.  But chances are very rare.Belly button is common site for this. As alot of perspiration accumulate in that area. Ans you told that your hygiene for this part was not good. Which again is a risk factor.And constant rubbing, friction, blackening, irritation lead to skin infection mostly and rarely malignancy.So I advice you to check1. sugar levek as diabetes can cause similar skin condition.2. Wear cottin clothes. Avoid tight clothings.3. Maintain proper hygiene of this part.4. Consult dermatologist for proper clinical examination."},{"Patient":"Hi my mom has squamous cell carcinoma, she s 82 & will not undergo radiation or chemo therapy.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells, (also known as accessory cells) of the mammalian immune system. Their main function is to process antigen material and present it on the cell surface to the T cells of the immune system. They act as messengers between the innate and the adaptive immune systems.Hyperthermia used locally can liquify tumours .But no guaranteethat , they will not reoccur again , In fact, everyone has cancer cells forming all the time. But normally their strong immune system .kills the cancer cells fast enough that a person is never “diagnosed” with cancer.

The doctors said that with out the chemotherapy he would die within a two week period.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Lymphoma is very agressive malignancy and life threatening too. And risk is high when patient is old age and having advanced stage malignancy.  Your father is having both risk factors, age 91 and stage 3 disease.So he is at high risk for mortality.And lymphomas are highly sensitive to chemotherapy. With single dose lymphoma start regression. So we should start chemotherapy as soon as possible once patient is diagnosed with lymphoma.So no need to wait, start chemotherapy.

In my opinion you are having malignant pleural effusion due to spread from your primary cancer.Pleural involvement is common in many cancers and thus can produce malignant effusion.So get done pleural fluid aspiration and check it for malignant cells and infection."},{"Patient":"My Fathers Prostate Problem This is Bharath Duvaj My father(N.Govindarajan) was detected Prostate Cancer they didn’t give any stage for his cancer.

And can run in family. But is not 100%. Like not every male child will develop prostate cancer. Better to do regular screening by PSA test (Prostate Specific Antigen). It is recommended to do PSA every 6 monthly and rectal ultrasound for prostate every yearly after age of 50 for hereditary prostate cancer.No need to get done biopsy if your PSA level is normal."},{"Patient":"They found a 1cm by 2cm spot on my pancreas during a routine CAT scan that I have done every 6 months, to see if my liver cirrhosis turned cancer...liver was clear, but this spot has me very concerned.

In your opinion what are the odds it is cancer and if not what else could it be.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Liver cirrhosis is a precancerous condition for HCC (Hepatic Cell Carcinoma).So if in CAT scan liver is clear than no need to worry for liver malignancy.But you should investigate further for spots on pancrease.This can be calcified nodule or enlarged lymphnode or infective foci.Better to rule out these by endoscopic ultrasound.

I have a family history of colon cancer and have read the colorectal cancers can metastasize to the apical lymph, although nothing that i read has been specific on left or right.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Yes, you ars right. Colorectal cancers can spread in cervical lymphnodes but not as a primary symptoms.  It spreads some what late in the course of disease. First patient develops intestinal symptoms like pain, blood in stool etc and than patient can have distant metastases like in lymphnode.So in my opinion you should not worry much about malignant lesion as you are not having abdominal symptoms. But you should definitely get done biopsy of this lymphnode to reach the diagnosis. You may have infective lymphnode. So get done biopsy and don't worry about malignancy."},{"Patient":"I have a pituitary adenoma, beign, its size is 5.mm . I ve been getting terrible h/a behind ears n bilateral at base of skull.

And in stage 4 disease surgery is contraindicated. Only chemotherapy and radiotherapy is indicated. In rare cases if renal tumour mass is too big and compressing vital organs like aorta and ureter than debulking surgery is done. Better to consult oncosurgeon and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"My daughter had an MRI and ws told that her bone marrow count was lower than last year.  She is scared as to what this could mean.  She was instructed to have another blood test done tomorrow and to see an oncologist.  Does this mean she has cancer?

But the common ones are1. Viral infection like dengue and chickengunya2. Maleria fever.3. Chronic bacterial infection like TB.4. Fungal infection5. Side effect of drugs etc.So we need to rule out all of the above first.Anything which causes bone marrow supression can cause low bone marrow count.Most of the cancers have high count.

Lymphatic obstruction due to lymphatic involvement of tumour. (Possibility is high in your mother's case)4. Cardiac failure due to high turnover rate.So start protein supplement and blood transfusion if they are deficit.Start diuretics to remove extra third space fluid. Restrict fluid intake to 2 liters per day.Keep foot end elevated in bed."},{"Patient":"My father was recently diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma of the left kidney.  He had a test (some sort of MRI) to check his pancreas due to lesions believed to be from prior pancreatitis and they found a cortical cyst on the right kidney.  Is there a possibility it could also be cancerous or should it not be a concern?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.Yes, cortical renal cyst can be a precancerous lesion for renal cell carcinoma (RCC).But it is not 100% true. If patient is smoker or having prolonged chemical exposure than chances are high. And detailed examinationof cyst is needed to stamp it as pre malignant lesion. Like its border, shape, content,  association with renal structures etc all are important.  And most important is biopsy. At the time of pancreatitis your radiologist might missed these things. So renal cortical cyst can present as pre malignant lesion for RCC and can develop in RCC if risk factors are present like smoking."},{"Patient":"my mother in law aged 67 has been diagnosed with stage 4 bladder cancer.

Edema or Oedema is a kind of swelling due to fluid retention in the body. It can be due to physiological or pathological causes. Edema generally occurs on the hands, arms, ankles, legs and the feet. Since you are undergoing traeatment for CLL , this may be the main cause of your swelling .

When you’re relaxing in the evening, prop your legs up on some pillows. Ideally, you want your feet above your heart. Take THAT, gravity!Magnesium deficiency can contribute to edema, Excess salt is a big contributor to swelling, and upping your fluid intake can help dilute the salt in your system. Aim for 8-10 glasses of water per day to flush things out. Even better? Try making cucumber-lemon water! Just drop a couple of cucumber and lemon slices in your glass, and enjoy!

It was stage 3 because it spread to both sides of my neck into the lymph nodes. The mass on the right side of my neck was very large but after chemo, then radiation and chemo (33 treatments of rad) the primary tumor in my nasopharynx is gone but a PET scan revealed a lymph node with a 4.4 uptake in my neck where the large mass was. My oncolologist and radiologist suggest removal of the lymph nodes in that area because they do not trust a needle biopsy because they are known to give false negatives . My ENT suggests a needle biopsy and to monitor the lymph nodes in that area with a sonogram. My next PET scan is scheduled for 12/11/2014. Should I get the surgery or have the needle biopsy. I am worried about a false negative but at the same time neck surgery isn t something that is routine or easy and comes with a lot of risks. I appreciate any advice.","Doctor":"hi... my advice is to undergo a neck dissection if PETCT showed an uptake of 4.4 in the previous gross nodal disease region.. as a surgical oncologist i can tell that neck dissection is not a morbid procedure...yes, i accept post radiotherapy there may be healing issues but overall its safer and best way to control neck residual or recurrent disease.. please follow the advice of your oncologist.."},{"Patient":"I am a hairdresser and I have a client who after thyroid cancer surgery noticed a dent in her forehead it is over the left eye about 1 inch above the eyebrow.

I have had depression mt whole life.  Possibly inherited from my mother and grandmother.  In the past my psychiatrists have been able to stabilize my depression with a combination of drugs.  My current psychiatrist has not been able to find any combination of drugs or dosages that have been able to solve my depression.  He and I both tend to believe that my problem might very well have something to do with my endocrine system and my thyroid system. I have had hyperthyroid problems my whole life. In November 2011 my internist in Tulsa discovered that I had a parathyroid tumor.  When they operated they discovered that it was 40 times larger than it should have been they removed it and it was benign. In about 2012 I had a breast mammogram and it discovered that I had abnormal cells in my left breast.  I live in Oklahoma City and have currently found a doctor in endocrinology at the Integras Baptist Hospital. when he walked into my examining room his first question was \\"I don't know why you're here to see me, an endocrinologist, you should be seeing a psychiatrist. He evidently had not read any of his files on me. You see in Atlanta I had a great internist who thought out of the box. He sent me to a world-renowned endocrinologist who tested me for my thyroid and found that there were problems so he changed my medications and he resolved my depression. his nap I am desperate.  I have gone from worse to worst over the past 4 1/2 years and I really can't take it much longer. Please help","Doctor":"Hi welcome  to HCM I have gone thru your query  .I can understand your concernThe parathyroid glands are part of the endocrine system, so these tumours are also known as endocrine tumours.  This is a rare condition that is caused by a faulty gene. It can be passed on from one generation to anotherThe parathyroid glands are small, but their function is very important. They maintain the correct levels of calcium in the body. Calcium plays an essential role in controlling muscle and nerve function.A tumour of the parathyroid gland may cause overproduction of the hormone that controls the level of calcium in the body. This hormone is called parathyroid hormone (PTH) or parathormone. As you agreed for Surgery  ,It  involves removing all of the parathyroid gland and part or all of the  nearest half of the thyroid gland, as well as some surrounding tissue. After the operation, the calcium levels in the body can go up and down. Your doctors monitors your calcium level by taking regular blood tests.No matter what the reason of depression is, one can manage or handle it effectively. Conversely, if ignored, depression can become devastating and unmanageableOn top of this, our lifestyle and food habits make our nerves week from both structural as well as functional point of view. The safest way of coming out of such a situation is to nourish our nervous health so that it responds constructively to otherwise difficult situation in life.In general, successful treatment for depression involves both counselling therapy and medication. Meditation and rest and Medication for two to three months while orally taking traditional Ayurvedic / herbal medicine - Giloy , Shilajeet , sarpgandha   Bramhi ,Almonds , Ashvgandha  strengthens the Nervous System and specifically the Para-Vertebral muscles of the BACK.

In fact your fear is relevent as this disease is so dreadful . there are many veiws aboutRecurrence is common, although the recurrence rates for block resection followed by bone graft are lower than those of enucleation and curettage. Follicular variants appear to recur more than plexiform variants. Unicystic tumors recur less frequently than \\"non-unicystic\\" tumors. Persistent follow-up examination is essential for managing ameloblastoma . Follow up should occur at regular intervals for at least 10 years. Follow up is important, because 50% of all recurrences occur within 5 years postoperatively. Recurrence within a bone graft  does occur .Seeding to the bone graft is suspected as a cause of recurrence. The recurrences in these cases seem to stem from the soft tissues, especially the adjacent periosteum. Recurrence has been reported to occur as many as 36 years after treatment.I suggest you to go thru a  check up  and get relieved  .Why to keep worrying ,keeping your self in suspens .It is always 'stitch in time save nine '.Follow a regimen of balanced diet including  fibers  and all essential nutrients  & antioxidants  proper rest and exercise  to strengthen your immune system  to get resistance from diseases .Avoide fried ,fast ,foods ,tea, coffee, alcohol  ,smoking  , worry  ,anxiety ,anger and constipation  Hope this helps solve your query .

After breast amputation still bad cells are found however the rest off the body seems clean.

No insurance so I went home on strong antibiotic s, bed rest and no food for several days. Resolved it self. ( I bleed for approximately 30 days prior to that, figured it was a very long period.) Don t said I could be starting menopause. Then I started having pain on both right and left sides and doctor put me on a regiment of antibiotic s to get the jump on any possible infections early and cut back to clear liquids until the problem passes. ( my suggestion) cause I still do not have insurance. I get extremely bloated during these times. I have noticed in the last six months that I get the same pain on the lower left side each month around the same time. (pain on the right is gone). I asked for an pelvic ultrasound to see if my ovaries are the problem. Came back Right Ovary measures 1.7x1.46x2.11 cm w/a volume of 2.74cc. The left ovary measures 2.46x1.93x2.37 cm w/a volume of 5.88cc. Please note that I had just starting taking antibiotics two days prior to this test being done due to left pain starting again. The pain last for about 3-4 days while on antibiotics and then goes away. Is it because I am taking antibiotics or because that is my normal cycle each month but I no longer have periods, haven t for about a year now. I am afraid to not take the antibiotics when I get the pain because if it is my bowels again and I do not want to put myself in the same situation I had 2 years ago. I also have trouble having bowl movements when I am having the pain as well. I have altered my diet (more fiber)...I now take a bowel medication daily to help keep my bowels normal. and about 1 week a month I feel good. The rest of the month I am bloated, cramping, and struggle to have regular bowel movements. I take blood pressure medication linsinopril (low dose) ,and a Prilosec pill daily ( which I had chronic heart burn for 2 years before I finally gave in to Prilosec verses tums. I have also had a bowel test for cancer...came back normal. Had a colonoscopy, came back diverticula present nothing alarming...some inflammation. I had just finished taking a 20 day regiment of antibiotics when I had the colonoscopy done, so I was feeling good. Should I have a C125 test done or a trans vaginal ultrasound?

This type pain occurs due to contraction of tubular structure, however, there is no tubular structure at this site.An ultrasound abdomen needs to be done.Any organ enlargement or organ abnormality can be detected on the ultrasound.To rule out ulcers, an upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy needs to be done to look for an ulcerative lesion, growth, and to take biopsy from these lesions.Thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a question My partner is having a treatment with chemo and radio rx for cancer.

People who have more than 50 common moles have a greater chance than others of developing a dangerous type of skin cancer known as melanoma. Most common moles do not turn into melanoma. The only way to diagnose melanoma is to remove tissue and check it for cancer cells.It’s important to check with your physician before adding herbs to your existing medications,regarding the herbs that are antioxidant ,have no side effects and go with any therapy of treatment .Gulping on only medicines or pills will not  help cure unless you take care of your lifestyle , food habits and regular exercise yoga and proper rest sound sleep . Add  antioxidents like lemon juice , coco nut water.Aloe vera juice 25 ml +Amla juice 2 spoon ,bitter gourd juice 25 ml ,turmeric powder a level spoon  with a cup of hot milk at bed time , to your diet . All have quality to kill bacteria on mass basis and give us resistance Avoid fried , fast foods tea ,coffee ,alcohol ,smoking ,mental stress ,worry anxiety and most important is to clear you bowls . as constipation is mother of all ills .Last but not the least for proper blood crculation , regular walk , exercise , yoga pranayam-deep breathing proper rest & sound sleep , helps in detoxifying and strengthening the immune system to enhance resistance from diseases and pave way for healthy , happy ,disease free life .

Then my husband found something on-line about chia increasing the risk of prostate cancer. Is this true? His dad died of prostate cancer.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for your query. I can understand your concerns.Chia  seed is rich in omega-3 fatty acids & yield 25–30% extractable oil, including α-linolenic acid (ALA).Alpha-linolenic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, an omega-3 long-chain fatty acid  are considered good for the heart.The oil of chia seeds  rich in alpha-linolenic acid, may be problematic if you're at risk of prostate cancer. A study published in the “Journal of Nutrition” in April 2004 explains that high dietary intake of alpha-linolenic acid could increase the risk of prostate cancer in men. The same is true for blood levels high in this essential fatty acid. It appears that alpha-linolenic acid plays a role in carcinogenesis.Epidemiologic studies show that the risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer increases by a factor of two if one first-degree relative (in this case your husband's father) is affected and by four if two or more are affected.

I would like to suggest you  ,for  her further follow up of her treatment keep in touch with her treating doctor .As per studies , Most stage II and III sarcomas are high-grade tumors. They tend to grow and spread quickly. Even when these sarcomas have not yet spread to lymph nodes, the risk of spread (to lymph nodes or distant sites) is very high. These tumors also tend to grow back in the same area after they are removed (this is called local recurrence).High grade tumors behave more aggressively meaning they have a higher tendency to grow faster , surgically removing the tumor is still the main treatment. Lymph nodes will be removed as well if they contain cancer. If the tumor is large or in a place that would make surgery difficult, the patient may be treated with chemo, radiation .Magnitude of the survival advantage from improved nutrition, can even be greater than the magnitude of the treatment effects being targeted in current clinical drug trials .I will like to suggest you to modify lifestyle to fight cancer is one of the most effective treatment options in my view .

She has been having symptoms such as: fatigue, stomach pain, some bloody mucus stools, nausea, dizziness, loss of appetite. She is adopted and the only health information we had on the birth mother's was that the birth mother's mother had stomach cancer. Could this possibly be my daughter's problem.","Doctor":"Hi ! Did your daughter frequently have food from outside like fast and fried food ? This could have caused some stomach and intestinal infection resulting in the bloody mucus stools, nausea, and loss of appetite. The fast food from outside also may contain some ingredients in them to which she might be intolerant like gluten/lactose sensitivity. This can be known by trial and see after which kind of food she is getting these symptoms. I would suggest you to first go for a routine stool test for ova and cyst, and then go to your family physician with the report. In case of infection, he may advise you for some specific antibiotic/antiamebic drugs which may cure your daughter's condition. It is not necessary that the grand daughter will also develop stomach cancer specially at this age. But one  has to be watchful also and in case the symptoms increase or persist, you can discuss out this with the treating doctor about some special investigations which may clear your concern.I wish your daughter an early recovery."},{"Patient":"my husband was diagnosed with lung cancer withspread tobrain. the brain tumor was removed. has had chand radiation. after eight months has had right lung removed. now we have new cancer in his bile duct. astintwas placed to releive symptoms. is there any thing that can be done at this point","Doctor":"there is treatemnt but only in people who dont have any other sign of tumor in body. so tumor must be located opnly in bile duct. even then,prognosis ispoor but surgery could lead to com'plete tumor removal if this is well localizated. wish you good health.

Well I am alarmed -- please tell me exactly what a lyphoma is, whether it is cancer or not (son has since told me he has had this rather smooth-looking cyst, about the size of a golf ball but not protruding at all but it is a little pink which is why I noticed it next to his dark hair -- for about ten years which shocked me as he has never mentioned it and I never noticed it before (he has lived away since gradutating from college, is now married w/three children).  The bothersome thing is every time I look it up on-screen, \\"Lymphoma\\" comes up w/it even more prominently and I can't seem to find a clearcut explanation of it.

Likewise, taking probiotics or eating fermented food such as Juice of  Bitter gourd ,& Aloevera eliminates toxins in the body and boosts the immune system, which also cleanses the lymphatic system  I must tell you that our health depends mostly upon 'what & how& when we eat and our life style .Natural supplements also serve as an important defense mechanism against cancer. Iodine, artemisinin and green tea extract are three of the most beneficial natural supplements for debilitating cancer of the lymph system. These supplements support immune health while fighting cancer cells to offer recovery from the disease.Magnitude of the survival advantage from improved nutrition can even be greater than the magnitude of the treatment effects being targeted in current clinical drug trials .A diet full of processed foods will produce biochemical and metabolic conditions in your body that will decrease your immunity, so avoiding processed foods is definitely the first step in the right direction.Take proper diet containing essential nutrients proper exercise & proper rest at right time .One of the important strategies to achieve healthy body  is a diet rich in fresh, raw whole foods .More of Fiber, fruit, egg fish ,fish oil for Omega 3, green leafy veges .   quality, organic, biodynamic, locally-grown food will naturally increase  immunityTo keep metabolism on right path to increase the strength of immune system , take all supplements full of antioxidant serve as antibiotics  .coconut water , Lemon juice with water twice before meals , Turmeric powder , level spoon with with a cup of hot milk at bed time ,all these antioxidants maximizes natural minerals so that your body has the raw materials it needs , to do what it was designed to do.

Uncertain for malignant potential means pathologist is not 100% sure of malignant cells in specimen. There are certain cells in your specimen which are not clear cut of malignancy but at the same time they are not normal also. And your age is also 76 so possibility of malignancy is always there. So your report is not of confirm malignancy, you may need repeat DNC and some blood investigation like tumour markers.

There ate many causes of swollen lymphnode.  Most common causes are reactive lymphnode and tuberculosis.  Other are rare like lymphoma. If you don't have other features like liver and spleen enlargement then chances of cancer is very very low. You should go for fine needle aspiration cytology to search for the cause.

I can understand your concern. Ovarian cancer limited to ovary only doesn't cause this much high wbc count. But if it spread to the bone marrow then it czn produce leukoerythroblastic reaction and can cause it. However possibility is very low. Somevother cause like severe infection can leads to this.

Moles may occour due to potassium deficiency, faulty food habits, lack of exercise  worry ,tention , anger   Eat foods that contain potassium like apple, cider, vinegar. A balanced diet high in vitamins A, vitamin E and vitamin C can improve and will boost the immune system and fight off the skin wart.

I had the hospice nurse check it, and thankfully she did not feel that it was pressure sore, but a blister that I has broken open.  The sore is painful when he sits down, and the ointment and bandages don't seem to be helping.  the bandages and ointment come off easily because it is on the inner part of the cheek.  It constantly gets wet or dirty when he goes to the bathroom.  He is also wearing depends which doesn't help.  It is now red in the center and the edges are raised and white/yellowish and appears to be slothing off according to the nurse.  Is there anything I can do to help alleviate the pain or to help pad the area?  Also, is there anything that would expedite the healing process?","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to HCMI have gone through your query regarding sores on buttocks with terminal liver cancer of your father . It is a matter of concern .Liver flushes and special nutrients may be required to deal with these microbes and parasites. But the fact is that many natural cancer treatments do very well without dealing with these special microbes. But the patient should be aware of these issues.By getting rid of the microbes in the organs, plus doing the normal cancer treatments, the balance (i.e. a strong immune system and a low number of cancer cells) is restored enough to keep the cancer from coming back. The patient is cured because their immune system has been fixed and the number of cancer cells (by using special protocols) has been reduced!! The cancer will not come back as long as the patient watches their diet and immunity .To try ,IT IS NEVER TOO LATEI really want to help  you by suggesting a few remedies --1. clean the sore , with cotton ball dipped in Homeopathic Calendula Q , 1/2 spoon ,mix half cup water . Pat dry and apply  SEVERAL TIMES , a day  ,Caledula Ointment liberlly on the sore  and cover with cotton  and band aid  - avalaible on Homeopathic store .  Apply aloe vera jelly , at night  .  Give him Aloe vera juice 30 ml in the morning . If he is weak ,give 20 ml ,to start withOrally give him turmeric  a level t spoon  with a hot cup of milk at bed time .

Prepare with fresh inredients , a jug  and store in fridge .Constipation should be adressed regularly . Make him do some  exercises ,walk ,deep breathing  to detoxify the system and strengthening the immunity. Don't let him think about his illness much . let him do some meditation , sing , listen to any music . induce positive thinking . Worry ,anxiety ,anger  should be avoided as they hamper the progress of healing Never give up hope .

The only condition I can think of after going through the history of symptoms of your mother who had an appendicectomy in 1978 is possibility of an adhesive band which is giving rise to symptoms of sub acute intestinal obstruction in her case. You may discuss about it with your family physician, and during an attack, apart from a clinical examination, she may be advised to go for a plain X ray abdomen in upright posture. This may help in diagnosing the condition. Apart from this, the only other investigation one can think of in her case is a diagnostic/therapeutic laparoscopy to see if there is any adhesive band or any other pathology which could be the cause of her symptoms.

I am Dr Asanghanwa Carlson. The diagnosis of prostate cancer is one of great concern that has to be arrived at after thorough examination and other complementary examinations. Signs and symptoms of prostate cancer include difficulties in urination, painful urination, blood in urine, pelvic mass, repeated urinary tract infections, weight loss and many other signs. These signs would generally guide you to consult a physician who after clinical evaluation will request for other test such as Prostate specific antigen, pelvic ultrasound amongst others. When an enlarged prostate is found on examination, a biopsy of the prostate is performed and the diagnosis of cancer is confirmed on the biopsy. This is generally done by a urologist. So I would advice you to take your father to a urologist in in Gurnee area for proper evaluation if he presents with any of the signs listed above. Good luck and take care.

Kindly give me the answer i will be very thankful to you. ananda sankar chakraborty","Doctor":"Thank you for your question Ananda. Firstly I would say it is not a normal thing to have a tumour in the lungs as the lungs are the site of exchange of gases between the environment and the body. Secondly a tumour in the lung at her age could probably be benign meaning it is not cancerous or malignant meaning it is a cancer and has chances of sreading to other parts of the body. The fact that she is in good health now, it does not exclude that the tumour could be dangerous to her health in the long run as the tumour could start compressing other organs in her chest. I would advice you visit your consulting physician so that other necessary test are carried out to confirm the exact nature of the tumour so that an appropriate treatment is undertaken as waiting allowing time to pass might cause the tumour to increase in size to an extent where little or nothing could be done. Better still I would advice you seek the opinion of another specialist a thorcaic surgeon or a pneumologist. Goodluck and my regards to your niece.Keywords: Specialist consultation, confirm nature of tumour"},{"Patient":"Hi My wife had thyroid cancer, she had a goiter,several nodules and Hashimotos, she had the thyroid removed, followed by radiation, she has had total body scans for ten years and now 14 years later she takes Synthroid once a day, should she be considered cancer free?

Once the whole thing is removed, histopathological examination of specimen will give exact diagnosis."},{"Patient":"What are the criteria used to determine abnormality and possible malignancy in an ultrasound of an axiliary lymph node? When a scan leads to a biopsy, what factors typically were observed in the scan to suggest further testing? Should a doctor consider how long the lymphadenopathy has occured when considering if a scan or biopsy should be done? For example, if a person has lived with frequent episodes swollen nodes for the last 17 years and has no health issues other than the node soreness, would this fact eliminate the suspicion that the current episode of inflammation is due to malignancy? Do doctors regard client reported information such as length of occurance as irrelevant hearsay? How can a normal node have an adjacent blood vessel or be vascular if these traits are indicitive of malignancy? What causes vascularity in a non cancerous node? Do do doctors err on the side of unnecessary biopsy to protect themselves against litigation? Can one tell from an ultrasound what type of cancer might be present in a lymph node? For example does metastasized cancer appear different from lymphoma, etc? Would breast implant related ALCL typically be present in nearby lymph nodes? Should a late onset seroma cause chronic (lasting 17 years)lymphadenopathy to be suspect for malignancy? If a person had a late onset seroma that resolved spontaneously after 4 weeks should a dr be less suspicious of ALCL in a subsequent seroma? Can sports activity related irritation in an implant capsule cause lymph node inflamation?","Doctor":"Lymphadenopathy is best evaluated with a biopsy when suspicious.it can be due malignancy, histiocytoses, granulomatous disorders, and storage diseases. Specific infections can be diagnosed if tissues are appropriately stained.Ultrasound features can be distinguishable for benign and maligant nodes but its not always accurate.Vascularity can occur in benign and malignant nodes but the features and pattern of vascularity varies.Complex nodes like central necsrosis or cystic regions are highly suspicious but again not 100% for malignany. Most chronic inflammatory condition increase the risk of malignancy.Breast implants and related irritation of tissues leads to lymhnodes.But again ruling out malignancy is essential as missing out on the suspicion can be life threatening later on.Ultrasound cannot differentiate cancers lymphomas etc they only guide the doctor for s biopsy or further imaging modalities.

I had a question. I have been witnessing some pain on the top right side of my stomach, infact its towards the back, rather than the front. The area is just to the right of the right side (on my back). I do not feel this pain when I am sitting in one place, but when I move, this pain intensifies. It might just be some muscular problem, for which I am getting concerned, but the main reason why I am asking you is that this pain has been there for the last 20-25 days. Its not very severe, definitely manageable, but its still there. Also, since today morning, I have been experiencing a sharp piercing pain near my belly button. If I try pressing that area (my belly button), the piercing pain intensifies. This pain was not there earlier. Its just started today morning.

The peritoneum is then seeded with mucus-producing cells, which continue to proliferate and produce mucus. The progressive accumulation of copious amounts of mucinous fluid gradually fills the peritoneal cavity and then it leads to intestinal obstruction, which is fatal without treatment.there is two types of treatment,1.best suggested one is aggressive type; it includes cytoreduction and intraperitoneal chemotherapycytoreduction means removal of as much as cancerous growth .intraperitoneal chemotherapy means administration of heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy after surgery.the survival rate is 5 years in 70-80%.i hope this information is helpful."},{"Patient":"Hi DR XXXXX, i would like to brief you shortly about my mother's cancer.

Appendicitis is more of a clinical diagnosis and sonogram may be a corroborative investigation in arriving at the diagnosis. However, once you are being examined by your treating doctor and the sonogram also shows that you have got acute appendicitis, then the right treatment for this condition is emergency surgery after doing all other routine investigations like blood and urine test. Not infrequently some physician treat this with antibiotics to control the infection without surgery, but this carries the risk of perforation and other complications related to appendix and so I as a surgeon would not advise you for the same. The Blood Pressure checked for you does not need any treatment for the time being as the upper (systolic) level could be due to the pain in abdomen. The vibration in your body is also not related to your present symptoms of pain abdomen. This might be due to the anxiety factor if no other neurological problem is faced by you.I would suggest you to consult a general surgeon at the earliest for management of acute appendicitis.

Also the nutritional demands are high as the cancer cells have rapid turnover. swelling is because of compression over blood vessels draining blood and lymph from lower part of the body. Also low intake of protein causes body swelling. Her condition can be improved by 1) good nutrition including high calorie and high protein diet. Certain medications can help improve appetite 2)  If the tumor regresses in size, pressure effects would decrease and limb swelling would decrease. This can be achieved by chemotherapy"},{"Patient":"Last night I woke around 4 am because I had what I thought was a spasm in my lungs.

Everything I ve read says it is the start of the end, is there anything I need to watch with his medications that could help or make things worse?Regards, Mark","Doctor":"Hi Mark,How are you? I am so sorry to hear about your father's diagnosis. Vomitting in pancreatic cancer can occur due to two reasons -  the tumor has grown sufficiently big to close of the lumen of the intestine and hence causing a mechanical blockage of the intestine or that it has affected the nerves supplying the stomach causing it not to clear the contents efficiently leading to vomiting. But by reading your description it looks more like the first scenario where there seems to be a mechanical blockage. The green colored vomit is due to the bile which is refluxing back into the stomach. This can cause severe stomach pain and also bitter taste in the mouth. Certain medications will help control the symptoms - antacids (pantoprazole, omeprazole etc) and syrup sucralfate has helped a lot many of my patients get relief from the symptoms. Also if there is indeed a mechanical obstruction, you should explore the possibility of getting a stent placed into the blocked portion of the intestine. This will help him a lot especially allowing to eat normally.Hope this helps and hope your dad starts to feel better.

Sliding hiatus hernias - Hernias that move up and down, in and out of the chest area. Over 80% of hiatus hernias are this type. 2. Para-oesophageal hiatus hernias - Where part of the stomach pushes up through the hole in the diaphragm next to the oesophagus. They're sometimes called rolling hiatus hernias. About 5-15% of hiatus hernias are this type The type of hiatus hernia can usually be diagnosed using an X-ray or an endoscopy (where a long, tube-like viewing instrument that contains a video camera and light source) is used. Treatment for sliding hiatus hernia usually focuses on relieving the symptoms of GORD, such as heartburn.Lifestyle changes and medication are the preferred treatments. Surgery is usually only recommended as an alternative to long-term medication or if other treatments haven't worked.Lifestyle advice may include:•eat smaller, more frequent meals - rather than three large meals a day •avoid lying down (including going to bed) for three hours after eating or drinking •remove any foods or drinks from your diet that make your symptoms worse  If a hiatus hernia isn't causing any noticeable problems, then it doesn't usually need to be treated.Para-oesophageal hiatus hernias are repaired surgically if there is a risk of serious complicationsHope this helps"},{"Patient":"My Father has a combination of both hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma and as a result has esophageal varices.

Please advise if we can use additional dosage of the syrup.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for writing to HCM. My Name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a liver cancer specialist and I will attempt to answer your question.First of all I am so sorry to hear about your fathers diagnosis. I hope he is comfortable and not having any acute problems.Constipation can be due many causes. In your father's case, I hope he is not on any opiod drugs (morphine etc) which can cause constipation. But the good thing is that it is very easy to treat.I would advise plenty of liquids (4-6L per day - water, milk, tender coconut water, juices etc). In addition to this try to get him on a high fiber diet which includes a lot of green leafy vegetables. Also let him eat a mango, papaya or a banana in the night which helps in curing constipation.Syp Cremaffin is also very helpful. Since 10 ml in the night is not working, i would advise increments of 5ml every 2 days till a total dose of 30 ml. If even this does not work, he can take 30ml in the morning and 30 ml in the night. But beware of diarrhoea and you can titrate the dose according to his needs.IF he has not passed stools for a week, the stools might have become real hard and cremaffin might not work. He might need an enema or high bowel wash to clear his colon. So if increasing the cremaffin does not work, I would suggest taking him to a physician to get the enema administered.Hope this helps and hope your dad starts to feel better.Please do not hesitate to contact me for further detailsDr Suresh Raghavaiah"},{"Patient":"Im 27 i was diagnosed w stage 2 hodgkins lYmphoma went thru 8 chemo ABVD infusions n 18 radiation treatments the lymphoma is gone..

It was very sudden- over about an hour- it was not painful and caused no problems- no fever. Went to the doc the same evening and got a prescription for antibiotics ( milixim) and chymoral plus- for lymphadenitis. The doctor repeatedly asked me if i was febrile any time around this attack- no!. The ESR showed 58mm/hr and so I also assumed it is some sort of an inflammation. Did a hot formentation for comfort. After about 4 days I noticed this swelling to be hardened but no other symptoms and so the doc referred me to the surgeon and he asked for an FNAC which showed non specific reactive lymphadenitis of the left jugular lymph node. He had parotid adenoma and tuberculosis also in his mind. The swelling has not reduced but remained hard and firm but is painful now. A second opinio  was taken and again an FNAC was done ( result awaitd) and u/s suggesting paortitis. It is almost 10days now and the pain is severe and is causing discomfort in the left side around the ear and neck but have to wait till the results. Doctors are thinking of lymphoma, tumor etc etc. I always thought tumors were painless.? Will tumors just pop up suddenly over an hour? should i take some anti inflammatory drugs over the counter for the pain? Will a hot compress help in reducing the inflammation? Pls advice","Doctor":"In cases of sudden swellings and rapid increase in size ruling out malignancy (cancer) is very important. Your doctors approach is right.If you are having fever it can be a viral / bacterail parotitis. Tuberculosis also has to be ruled out.If your fnac is inconclusive even the second time , meet a surgical oncologist.Antiinflammatory and hot compress will help but only temporarily.

Read and understood that your sister is already suffering from lupus and is on warfarin. Now have got a letter stating that she has moderate dyskaryosis.Having lupus and on Warfarin may not cause any difference on the treatment.o not worry about it as the Doctor would definitely consider facts before giving any treatment to your sister.

However, he had a CT scan and it proved to be negative.  He continues to have pains periodically (sharp and constant for short periods of time).  Is there anything else that could masquerade itself as an appendicitis?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.While the clinical diagnosis may be straightforward in patients who present with classic signs and symptoms, atypical presentations may result in diagnostic confusion and delay in treatment. Helical computed tomography (CT) and graded compression color Doppler ultrasonography (US) are highly accurate means of establishing the diagnosis.If appendicitis has been ruled out on CT scan , it is almost certain that he does not have that condition.Other conditions presenting like acute appendicitis include the following:1. Mesenteric adenitis has been reported as the second most common cause of right lower quadrant pain after appendicitis.2. Infectious enterocolitis can cause mild symptoms resembling common viral gastroenteritis.3. Epiploic appendages are small adipose protrusions from the serosal surface of the colon. An epiploic appendage may undergo torsion and secondary inflammation, causing focal abdominal pain that simulates appendicitis when located in the right lower quadrant.4. Omental infarction has a pathophysiology and clinical presentation similar to that of epiploic appendagitis, with the infarcted fatty tissue being a right-sided segment of the omentum.5. Right-sided colonic diverticulitis may clinically mimic appendicitis or cholecystitis, although the patient's history is generally more protracted.Clinical examination by surgeon is most important to differentiate causes of the pain along with CT scan findings.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"My mom is sick with cancer and malnutrition and is in the hospital now for blood clots.

Since you have a history of being operated for Ca Tonsil, it would be advisable, in my opinion, to get an OPG xray done for your jaw as a primary screening. Screen yourself for diabetes as well.

Thanks","Doctor":"Hi,How are you? Thanks for writing into HCM. My name is Dr Suresh Raghavaiah. I am a liver cancer specialist and I hope to answer your question today.I am so sorry to hear about your mother's diagnosis. I know that dealing with cancer can be difficult but hopefully we should be able to provide her with the correct treatment. The treatment of Liver cancer depends on various factors. The physical condition of the patient obviously is the primary factor - if she is too weak to tolerate a big surgery or if she has a heart condition, then this would be a relative contraindication for surgery. The next important thing to consider is the condition of the rest of the liver. If the rest of the liver is healthy i,e no cirrhosis, hepatitis or tumors , then the size of the tumor by itself is not a contraindication. I have personally removed tumors as big as 20cm from the liver without any problem. if the tumor is too big, then we routinely use techniques which shrink the size of the tumor before surgery and also techniques to increase the size of the liver which will be left behind after surgery. But all of this can be done only if it is going to help the patient. The best person to judge your mother's condition is obviously the primary physician who is taking care of her. It would be a great help for me if you could upload some of her scan images so that I can guide you better. Also please let me know where you are located so I can refer you a specialist doctor in your area.Hope this helps and hope your Mother starts feeling betterDr Suresh Raghavaiah"},{"Patient":"Hi I just turnt 16, I have been smoking since i was 14 and For the past few days I've been worrying If i have lung/mouth cancer because I was been coughing continously, sneezing, got ulcer in my mouth and have a back pain in the middle of my spine. what does this mean? what shall i do?","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to HCMI have gone through your query and found you to be wise enough to  understand & worry  that your smoking  may have lead you  to cancer .Dear, you are too young to do all that and fall into this ditch .

I have been on these new tablets for 2.5 days now & I am still in agony with my back. I have a fever, headache and my skin is flushed & blotchy. I have a swollen stomach which is painful but the burning sensation whilst peeing & the need to pee so frequently has passed. How long should it take for these antibiotics to work? I'm on strong over the counter painkillers also but I can't take these for longer than 3 days which is up tomorrow. Can you please advise?","Doctor":"Hi ! For the UTI to get cured, the antibiotic has to be taken atleast for 10 - 14 days to eradicate the infection. After48-72 hours of completing the course of antibiotics, one has to go again for a culture sensitivity test of the urine to be sure that the infection has been eradicated completely. If after the eradication of the infection, the back pain persists, you should consult your family physician for the possibility of an ultrasound abdomen to exclude renal stone, and also other allied investigations to exclude any orthopedic problem for the pain in the back. Further management will depend on the reports. In the reports are negative, I would suggest you to pay attention to your posture while at work and otherwise, and also see a physiotherapist if need be, Wishing you an early recovery,"},{"Patient":"i am 12 years old and i was freaking o8ut about the circumvallate papilliae!i can stick my finger in the back of my throught, and i can fell them! please help me understand this..........i thought i had toungue cancer at first,but i am a hiporconriact!!!","Doctor":"Circumvallate papillae are normally enlarged and can be felt if you put your finger quite towards the back of tongue. Tongue cancer causes an ulcer or swelling/ growth on tongue which may or may not be painful. It can be felt as an ulcer, usually with a hard base and is not symmetric in shape or soft like a papilla.The treatment depends on the site and includes Surgery/ Radiation or both."},{"Patient":"hi doctor. my father has been treated with cancer surgery in his left cheek in feb 2006. but 15 days ago we found reccurrence in his jaw.his lymph nodes and necks are appears to be normal. now he is being treated with chemotherapy. so i just want to know how do you see this case???? n wats ur suggestion???","Doctor":"Recurrence of cheek cancer after 6 years of surgery without any nodal involvement  isnt that bad a prognosis. Chemotherapy or re-surgery might be helpful depending on size and site of the recurrent cancer."},{"Patient":"My brother-in-law is going through chemo and he refuses to eat or drink anything.  He has lost weight and we had to take him back to the hospital twice because he became dehydrated and he had to be forced fed.  When asked by his doctors he lies and says that he eats 3 meals a day.  Is this a part of his chemo treatment that is making him act this way?","Doctor":"Yes, chemotherapy is a big stress on the body and affects the taste buds and general appetite. U might want to give him a lot of fruits and juices with a digestive enzyme syrup to increase the appetite. Try to give him light salted food as well if he feels tired of eating sweet bland food, that mostly happens with patients under such therapy.Hope it was helpful!!"},{"Patient":"I came off the pill towards the start of the year, lost some weight. Also I am a smoker, I have two lumps on both sides of my neck, they dont hurt, but they are there. I have been driving myself crazy with worry, but have been eating properly and a lot. I still dont seem to be putting on weight. Is it throat cancer, I am so scared doctor.","Doctor":"I suggest getting the lumps examined by an oncologist or surgeon as being painless is not necessarily a good sign. Painless nodes can be a sign of cancer, but thats not the only reason. It could also be due to some old infection or active tuberculosis. Even the weight loss could be connected to that. Dont worry yourself without getting examined."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...
