I can understand. The symptoms of depression are not necessarily manifest openly. Your child is approaching adolescent and she, I think, is cleverly disguising. Yes. Depression is up to one extent disguisable during adolescent period.Suicidal ideation is to be treated with the help of medicines as well as psychotherapy. The counseling team or person will be able to provide more insight into the whole episode. Your duty is to talk to your child and try to know more about her behavior. Do not be upset, angry or irritated. If you show these emotions, your child will not be open.Be patient and talk to her. Not with the intention to know what happened, but with the intention of understanding and helping the child. You should know she is in trouble and you are the right person to walk her out of it.You may take the help of the counselor or a psychologist to get the guidelines. Please do not worry.

IQ below 60 is considered mentally retarded (Intellectual disability). As your child psychiatrist diagnosed him as MR (Intellectual disability), that could be surely it. Mental retardation (MR) is a condition diagnosed before age 18, usually in infancy or prior to birth, that includes below-average general intellectual function, and a lack of the skills necessary for daily living. The causes could be Genetic conditions, problems during pregnancy, Exposure to certain types of disease or toxins, problems at birth like not enough oxygen, Iodine deficiency, malnutrition etc.Intellectual disability is more accurately considered a disability rather than a disease. No treatments are available specifically for cognitive deficiency. Although the pharmacologic enhancement of cognition is possible. I request you not to get alarmed. There are many treatment options a dn management options. You should work with the child psychiatrist. You may have to take the help of counselor, psychotherapist, speech therapist and occupational therapist. Most of all, your motivated positive approach is going to be the key.

This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put  the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If  still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea.

From your symptoms this seems to be due to the bleeding from the internal wall lining of the intestine due to the trauma caused by jumping of your son on the abdomen. What happens in such case is that small blood vessels lying within the intestinal mucosa wall may rupture and bleed within the intestine which presents as blood in the stool. You should monitor your stools closely for the amount of blood in the stool with each bowel movement.

I have tried 3 different shampoos. i honestly do not see any flakes..not sure if it is just her long hair and sweating.","Doctor":"Hi... by what you quote I feel that it could be seborrhea. There need not be any visible flakes over the scalp. Sometimes the only presenting feature can be severe itching like this. I suggest you use selsun shampoo thrice a week for 6 weeks. Do not apply hair oil during this period. If still not getting better I suggest you consult a paediatric Dermatologist regarding this.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi, may! I am mother of a 3yr old boy,weight 26.2. I took him to a doctor after he has been vomiting for 3days.

Can it be tonsils that burst in red form.","Doctor":"Hi...it is unlikely that tonsils have burst and there blood in the vomitus. Blood in the vomit is a serious symptom which needs to be evaluated immediately. I suggest you take him to the nearest emergency room immediately.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hello Sir, My brother is 18 years old. He had a bad stomach-ache yesterday and we consulted a doctor today. The Doc asked us to conduct an Ultrasound test and the report was fine except one line:-Minimal hydronephrosis/ Extra-Reneal pelvis is seen on Lt. side. Can you please tell me what is this? Can it be dangerous for him? What should we now (except the medicines precautioned by the doctor)? What are the cares to take? Please....Thanks, Sandeep","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. Minimal hydronephrosis - is simply dilatation of the renal pelvis. Such situation appears when the urine flow is obstructed or impeded due to urinary tract stones or narrow ureter, or compression of the ureter. As your brother has only minimal hydronephrosis, most likely it wont be necessary to do anything with it, however urologist consultation and observation is recomended. Extrarenal pelvis - means that some part of your brother pelvis lies outside the kidney. If no obstruction is present, no correction is necessary. Depending of where the pain is located, your brother may suffer from urinary tract stones (lower abdominal pain, radiating to the one side back, frequent urinating, burning while urinating), peptic ulcer (upper middle abdominal pain - upper GI endoscopy is necessary to rule it out), appendicitis (upper middle abdominal pain which after few hours migrates to the lower right abdomen). I suggest you to consult urologist, have urine analysis and blood work performed. Hope this will help. Regards."},{"Patient":"my 5 year old has been crying through the night complaining of arm pain.

I suggest you consult your pediatrician or pediatric orthopedic surgeon regarding this. Pain is actually a protective reflex which prompts us to take necessary action. Please do not ignore it.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Dear sir,My daughter is 10 months old, all of sudden last night when she slept she started vomiting after every 25 mins and that continued for atleast for 6 hours and after that she started having losse motion, Dr. Please advice me what should do and what could be the reason of it?Age 10 months, weight 9.05","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.It seems your kid is having viral diarrhoea.

Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment.

Other reasons are parasitic diseases of children, like giardiasis, liver and kidneys function disorders, bone marrow diseases etc. Foods can't complete all the needs of iron when the level of hemoglobin is 8.6 so you have to take supplementary iron like iron drops.

I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Usually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age.

Then the cycle repeats itself.","Doctor":"Hi thanks for your question. Felling pain while hungery is a symptom of acid peptic disease.This is classical presentation of dudenal ulcer.I would suggest you to consult a physician who may be able to perform upper G I endoscopy on you to rule out duodnal ulcer as a cause for your symptoms or pick up any other disease responsible  for your pain.Accordingly he/she may prescribe you appropriate treatment.You can take antacid and proton pump blocker like pantoprazole Hope this answers your question."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, my 5 month old baby has a rash on the lower right side of her cheek and behind her right ear. She keeps pulling at her ear. Is it an allergic reacting to a solid food (she had some butternut squash for dinner) or is it an ear infection? Or is it something else entirely?","Doctor":"HI...I have just read through your query. The possibilities could be - 1. Eczema2. Food allergy3. Skin and soft tissue infection there...but unlikely as you have not mentioned about any fever.I Suggest you get the consultation of your pediatrician regarding this as - Skin conditions are best diagnosed only after seeing directly.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hello. My 3 year old son has developed fissures on the foreskin of his penis. He did have phimosis as diagnosed by his pediatrict urologist however, we were prescribed betaderm 0.1% and since using it, his foreskin has loosened enough to expose the glands. All was great for the past 6 months. Yesterday evening, our 3 year old son came to us and showed us that there were fissures on the outside of his foreskin and it is too painful to pull the foreskin back. Is it ok to apply the betaderm to this location?","Doctor":"HiThank you for asking HCM. I have gone through your query. Decreasing in moisturization can be the reason for the fissures. Avoid soaps and irritants to wash the area and instead you can use saline or warm water. You can also apply moisturisers based on liquid paraffin. Applying betaderm ( betamethasone) will be helpful to reverse the phimosis again. If there is no improvement then approach your doctor. Hope this may help you. Let me know if anything not clear. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My 21 month-old son weights 20.1 lbs and our dr ran several tests. They want to redo the bmp because he was slightly dehydrated according to the results.

Initially it should be semi solid consistency and gradually increase the consistency depending on tolerance or palatability. If child develops vomiting after having a particular food,  just withhold that food temporarily, continue with previous food which child was tolerating.  Presently Start your child with an anti emetic medication domstal drops / Ondem Syrup orally according to baby weight.  Withhold oral intake till 15 - 20 minutes of giving medication.  If still not controlled better to consult your Paediatrician for  an Injection. Which will solve the problem"},{"Patient":"My daughter fell and banged her head pretty hard on a concrete floor.

We have plans to fly Tuesday to Disney he wants to know if he can fly and if the rides will interfere with his fun... Will it cause vertigo? Puking?","Doctor":"Hi...by what you quote - as burst ear drum - I assume that your son should be having a perforated ear drum. When there is a perforated eardrum, the air pressure in the middle ear can balance out more easily with the pressure of the surrounding air, as the air is able to pass through the hole. This means flying with a perforated eardrum may actually cause less discomfort than usual.He can fly - no problem.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"i m a mother of a 5year old girl my daughter hairs are falling rapidly i di her cbc test n the report is normal doctor said lack or vitamins n minerals could be the cause i m giving her fruits n multivitamin tonic but still so worried abt her hairfall plzz help me out i would be gr8full to u","Doctor":"Hi...if CBC is normal then I suppose that hemoglobin level is normal in your grand daughter (low iron content which reflects as low hemoglobin is a risk factor for hair loss).Some medical conditions — like hypothyroidism (a thyroid disorder) or hypopituitarism (an underactive pituitary gland) — can also cause hair loss all over your the child's head, although this is uncommon.I suggest you approach a pediatric dermatologist regarding this.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 4 yr old son may have ingested a. 5 mg Xanax - it is missing from the bottle and he insists he didn t take it.

If he is crying by just touching them it can be testicular torsion or epidymoorchitis. Both need immediate medical attention.

Viral illness2. Urinary tract infectionViral illness - Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.UTI - there will be other symptoms like - pain and burning sensation during voiding. Vomiting and pain abdomen.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"I just noticed that my baby has a hole under his tongue. He has always been quite fussy and a horrible eater.

Firstly whats need to be considered is your present symptoms due to chronic appendicitis. If the symptoms are appearing from time to time and causing severe abdominal pain, then surgery is the option to go for. However if that is not the case, considering that you already have a handful of other previous medical and surgical history, which has to be taken into account, surgery would not be the most ideal option and the symptoms due to chronic appendicitis can be managed with medications. Your doctor would be the best person for the advise considering that the doctor can take into consideration the results from the 3rd CT scan. Feel free to ask for further queries.

I would also prefer to get an echocardiogram done.

I have just read through your query. Coming to your questions directly - 1. Duplex system means I understand that it is bifid collecting dust or duplex of renal pelvis which could be a normal finding in many kids. We need to worry we only if there is vesico ureteric Reflux (VUR). In other terms the urine which has to come down from the Kidneys might sometimes revert back and flow up wards from the urinary bladder to the Kidneys.  This requires daily antibiotic therapy, but duplex system of the renal pelvis does not require antibiotics. 2. If VUR are found out after doing micturating cystourethrogram (MCU) then the kid needs to be on daily antibiotics for at least 2 years of age. If MCU test is normal then antibiotics can be stopped immediately.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Yes my granddaughter went for her checkup and her Dr., noticed one side of her neck was swollen so she wanted a scan and the scan shows a problem and is making plans to send her to children s hospital in Dallas just wondering what it could be she will be 13 in August and has high functioning Ash burgers","Doctor":"Hi.... swelling on one side of the neck could be due to enlargement of lymph nodes in that region.

The pain dulled off and disappeared within 24 hours and I was told unless it gets worse then I will be right. Ever since this happended the area rumbles and grumbles from time to time with very slight occasional pain, I can push on the area at times and feel stuff moving around in there while it grumbles. Twice in the last 5 days I have had diarrhea to the point of not being able to go to work without taking immodium and last night while laying on my back, each time i went to lift my right leg I would get a slight bit of pain in the area again followed by waking up with diarrhea ahain this morning.

From the description of your symptoms this can be related to your previous diagnosis of appendicitis. This condition presents with diarrhea, however apart from this symptoms other symptoms to look out for are fever, chills and vomiting. This could also be viral gastrointestinal infection leading to diarrhea since this can also provoke inflammation of appendix.

This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put  the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If  still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

There may be days when you feel overwhelmed, stressed, or discouraged. Parenting isn’t ever easy, and raising a child with special needs is even more challenging.

Using a surgical mesh in hernia operation is become a common practice among surgeons presently. Reason being that mesh gives additional strength to the muscles in the abdomen after the surgery for better healing and recovery. The pros of using a mesh are much more than its cons. The surgeon also has to consider your age and the type and size of the defect. As we grow older our muscles also become weaker, therefore without mesh, risk of recurrence of hernia increases.

All these assistance and information is available at any good eye hospital. wearing glasses should not be a concern and you should motivate your kid to wear glasses regularly along with regular eye check ups.Regarding the MRI finding you were  concern, that means the thing which connect left and right brain is not developed properly.

Usually the digestion system of a child is considered developed enough when the child turns at least 6 months. In the initial months, child can accept only little amount mainly because of the satiation threshold. Nothing to worry about that. You should keep it in mind that, when children start solid food, they should treated with reasonable amount several times a day as in the case of liquid food.

Appendicitis presents with pain in the right side of abdomen, vomiting, fever,  lethargic and specially in a child where he/she cannot sit up or walk.

I take this opportunity to tell you certain scientific facts and relieve your distress - 1. An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5.

On approximate time, you should introduce her into the toilet itself. Introduce the potty there. Be there with her and never allow her to get up or leave the potty even if she cries. Once she starts crying, she should evacuate, because pressure does the trick. Make the toilet appear like her play room.

The parents have been worried for several years that their son is not progressing, but rather is regressing in what he s learning. He struggles with retention and basic comprehension, both verbal and written. If I ask him to use the glossary to write definitions for all of his vocab words, and also to choose to words to use in a sentence, he can t seem to understand that there are 2 separate directions so he only does the work for 2 words. He already has an IEP, receives services in Reading, Math, and Speech (I can t understand how he didn t qualify for Writing, though). The only advice he got from the doctor recently was to start his son on coconut oil. His vision and hearing are fine, he does not get headaches, he is very active and athletic (he does great at all sports), but he struggles so much in school and because he is labeled as Special Ed, he keeps getting passed on even though he s really not meeting the grade level indicators. I really feel for this dad and wish I could find him the help he needs...he and his wife almost divorced so that she could qualify for welfare to have more testing done because right now, he makes too much money (which isn t a lot as a city bus driver) to qualify! I suggested that maybe he needs to see a neurologist, or at least have some sort of look at his brain to see if there is something going on that we can t see on the outside. Clearly I m not a doctor, but can you please help me with some advice of how to help this man help his son? I really need to find a way to help him so he doesn t go through yet another year hearing we re doing all we can; he s progressing slowly; he ll catch up - because I don t think he will catch up. Please. Help. Us...","Doctor":"DearWelcome to HCMWe understand your concernsI went through your details. You are a teacher. You must have known about learning disabilities. If he is labelled special Ed, you should be able to determine in which area he lacks his skills.Please consult a child psychologist for assessment of the child's learning disabilities. Only Learning disability assessment will be able to pin point the areas in which the child is deficient in development. Then with the help of psychologist, you can take the remedial corrective measures.If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.

Some months later an incisional hernia appeared, and a few weeks later repaired, but no successfully. Over many years I have suffered abdominal pain and chest discomfort under both arms and upper chest. I ve had a number of ECG s and no heart problems were detected. The pains under the arms are getting more frequent, and the abdominal pains are still a problem, The pain usually starts 4-5 hours after eating food, and has caused sinus tachycardia . Any ideas as to possible causes of the pain?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for using this forum. There are number of symptoms which do appear after the removal of the gall bladder. The main symptoms persist with upper abdominal discomfort due to increase in gastritis due to the increase in reflux of bile into the stomach, specially after the meals. This can either present as heart or chest burn or just a discomfort within the chest.  Other reasons is due to change in the body posture, due to repeated surgery , leading to muscle cramps which leads to shoulder pain. Sometimes even traces of small amount of carbon dioxide gas used during the key hole surgery is persistent within abdomen, under both the sides between chest and abdominal cavity which can also lead to pain under the arms and discomfort.

I have read your question in detail and I know that you are very concerned about your child but don't worry. By what you quote it seems that your child probably has got tick bite.

Before going to school, she rarely had cold or coughs episodes. A month ago she started to have stuffy nose and mild morning and evening coughs, which had lasted for some weeks. She didn t cough when sleeping though. Eventually, when the cough got bad, she was put on antibiotics and cough expectorant. She got better but then the stuffy nose and morning coughs came back slightly. We saw an ENT specialist. She was given some Actifed and Solupred for 3 days last week. The stuffy nose is gone but the morning coughs have come back. She was given Foracort inhaler but this does seem to help. Your advise would be highly appreciated. thks","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic. Greetings from Chennai.By what you quote I feel what your kid is having is asthma. Please don't feel that I am being blunt, but rather than using frequent steroids it is better to have a label and follow up with simpler alternatives than using steroids which are associated with complications. I have a few questions and suggestions for you -Questions:1. How many days per month do the kid cough or feel breathless?2. How many nights per month do the kid’s sleep get disturbed due to above symptoms?3. Does the kid feel breathless when running around or plays with other kids?4. Are the symptoms when there are seasonal changes?5. Is there any family history of asthma or any other sort of allergies like skin allergy etc.?Suggestions:1. There are certainly alternative management therapies in allopathy now-a-days. Medicine has advanced a lot and not asthma is 100% controllable.2. Inhalers are the newest management strategies for this. If I were your paediatrician I would have suggested the use of Budecort metered dose inhaler (100mcg) 2 puffs twice a day through a spacer and this is for regular use for 8 weeks. Another metered dose inhaler is Levolin and this can used as rescue therapy whenever the kid is having severe cough in spite of regular usage of Budecort. The technique is very important and very crucial for the drug to be delivered correctly to the lungs. Regularity of medicine usage also matters a lot. So do not discontinue abruptly after you notice some improvement. The technique of administering an inhaler using a spacer has to be taught to you by your doctor and these are prescription medicines. So I suggest you consult your paediatrician for this.3. Triggers can be environmental changes/ dust/ talcum powder/ seasonal changes/ un-cleaned a/c vents/ cold weather etc....we can specifically say this is the cause - unless we observe the kid closely - best person is the parent.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

However since the appendix still remains, its prone to repeated attacks of inflammation and causing symptoms which you are having over and over. Complications such as bursting of appendix can occur considering the appendicitis progresses to further stage. Advise would be to consider a near date for surgery, since avoiding it would pose more problems for you rather than a solution. Only taking Augemtin would not help fully.Feel free for further queries.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi..My son is 2 months and has cradle cap..His paed had suggested the Candid lotion for a similar thing that appeared on one of his eyebrows..she also said to apply the same thing on his head..but she had not written it on the prescription and hence,i am confused..the paed is out of country and i am unable to re confirm the same. kindly let me know if candid lotion can be applied..","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM.

I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Usually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age. I request you to keep me posted about the recovery of the baby and follow of the case.Regards – Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"hello,my 7 month old baby was on lactogen 1 till six months ,after 6 months doctor said to give her toned buffalo milk. the problem is that when i give her buffalo milk even for one single day ,from the next day she does not drink milk at all,nither sweetened buffalo milk nor shakes and not even formula feed,right now i m using lactogen 2.","Doctor":"Hi...sometimes there wont be an reason why some babies do not like the taste of the milk. The best way to feed the baby will be to feed what the baby likes and palatability is very important.

This will require anti seizure medications according to the seizure type which will be evident on the EEG. He will require an MRI of the brain. The most commonly used medication will be either Valproate or Levetiracetam. I suggest you consult you pediatric neurologist regarding this.regarding cure - usually after starting the medications, if the kid is seizure free for at least 2 years then the medications are usually tapered and stopped.

Urine analysis (if possible culture and sensitivity test performed), abdominal ultrasound (specifically look at the kidneys), blood test (CBC, urea, creatinine, BUN etc) will be needed in order to confirm the kidney diseases or exclude it. If that be the case, you will require another course of antibiotics, take antispasmodic drugs, drink much water and consult a urologist. Other possible causes might be from the GIT such as diverticulitis (like you rightly said and being on antibiotics does not mean you receive specific antibiotics for diverticulitis), severe abdominal colic due to intestinal infection ( i suggest stool exams + colonoscopy to be done). If pains are severe, I suggest you consult immediately or go to the ER.

As per your history, your child might have acquired molluscum contagiosum ( A pearly white viral lesion).This condition is viral in origin , and resolves on its own without causing any symptoms. Sometimes it gets infected in which cases it needs to be treated.

She can move her eye in all directions as normal but she will look head on for 5 mins maximum and after that she will always look from the corner. The only time she looks head on is when watching tv and she is right up close to it. My gp has said this may be keratoconus but there is no bulging. She has been refferred to the eye hospital but i am awaiting an appointment. Do you think this is as my gp said or possibly something else? If so what can i do in the mean time??","Doctor":"hi,I am Dr.Richa Sharma , a pediatric opthalmologist. I understand your concern .Children usually adopt a face turn/ tilt or look from the corner of the eyes( as in your kid's case) in situation in which vision in that particular field of vision is better than the straight gaze.This can happen in many cases.First if all, to ease your worry let me tell you that it can be habitual in some cases.In other cases, it is because of the astigmatic/ cylindrical refractive error or in common language..glass power. keratoconus as you are worried of is a cause of progressive glass power / cylinder power but I doubt is present in your kid's case as she is very young though she can have cylindrical power for which she might require glasses. Most importantly, the reason can be nystagmus ( shaky eye movements) which lead to such problem . As you have not mentioned any such shaky movements in your query..so dont worry. For the time being you get an appointment, just try closing one eye of your kid with an opaque cloth patch for 10 mins and observe if she looks straight. If this doesn't happen and she continues to look in the same way, there is no eye muscle related/ neurological problem. She just might have refractive problem. all D best.Take care"},{"Patient":"My 3 year old daughter has a large (bigger than an egg) cyst like object on her neck that is hard as a rock.

I can understand. Your son do not need a psychiatrist. He needs an understanding parents. All these behavior issues are due to lack of proper training. I will not blame you. Some how, you could not impart the required behavior training. These things happen mainly because of ignorance. There is nothing to worry.Your son is just 9 and he is always in the mood to play. School and education has become a burden in his thoughts and that is what you have change with the help of positive and compensatory approach. For that, you need to see your child as a human being, just a human being. You know how you train your 2 year old child for toilet training, to have food while playing, eating alone, playing with pets etc. At that age, if you could train a child to be positive, why can't you do it to a 9 year young child?You say he is crazy about computer games and tv cartoons. These are progressive leisure. Unless you allowed him to do these when he is adamant, this habit cannot have been formed. That is the problem here and you should see that problem positively. These all happens. Not your fault, just happens.From now on, change your approach. Love him, pat him, appreciate him, nurture him and reward him whenever he does a good deed and use these same technique to make him do good deeds. When there are wrong doings, do not punish him immediately. Instead, use the above technique to positively motivate to correct the mistake. I am sure you will be able to change his behavior within a month. Be patient. He is a child and a human being and not an animal (you can train an animal with the help of punishment.

I am sympathetic with the child as well as with you. Please understand, training and training alone can make a child successfully stay alone, especially at night. There are many irrational lies, like ghosts and aliens, injected into the child's mind knowingly or unknowingly by family members as well as society and media. Due to these, children always has a fear for darkness, because according to those irrational information, ghosts and aliens come out and hung during darkness and at night. These irrational thoughts make them anxious. They, the children, do not have the maturity to differentiate between irrational and rational knowledge. Parents, care takers and teachers are suppose to teach them the differences between rational and irrational information. Parents need to train them regarding these. Your child needs training on these aspects as well as the \\"sleeping alone at night\\" aspect.First he need to build confidence within him. Then you need to assist him to have self faith and he should say \\"I will try to do it today\\". Slowly and steadily, you will see the change in his behavior.

This is collection of smegma underneath the skin and it is called smegmoma. Usually it will subside by itself. Sometimes steroid creams at the penile tip by stretching the skin will help open the tight skin there an help in its expulsion.

Developmental disorders is a group of psychiatric conditions originating in childhood that involve serious impairment in different areas. In this case your child could be troubled from communication disorder. Young children with communication disorders may not speak at all, or may have a limited vocabulary for their age. There are many areas required to be tested. Communication disorder could happen due to autism spectrum disorder, Aspergers, expressive language disorder, mixed receptive-expressive language disorder, aphasia etc.For every communication disorder, effective treatment is available.

Thank you for the query. Bright red stool is most likely caused by blood in stool which can appear due to hemorrhoids, anal fissure, inflammatory bowels disease, rectal polyps or even colon cancer. Lower abdominal pain can be caused by diverticulitis (mostly left abdominal pain), large intestine polyps or cancer, inflammatory bowels disease. As the pain appears periodically, partial bowels obstruction is possible. I suggest you to do not wait anymore and visit your doctor.

It is quite common for kids to pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated.When the kid takes feeds, the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastro-colic reflex. Do not worry.

My boyfriends daughter of 5yrs has peho but becuase it s such a rare desease there isn t much information on it. I m curious to know if we have a child that our child might be born with this syndrome as well.","Doctor":"Hi...coming to your query directly - PEHO syndorme might have a - Autosomal recessive inheritance. For you to be clear I will explain what a autosomal recessive inheritance is - a characteristic or condition that appears only in individuals who have received two copies of an altered gene, once copy from each parent.  People with two copies of the altered gene are called homozygotes.  Their parents, each with a single copy of the altered gene, appear normal and are called heterozygotes or carriers of the altered gene.A person with an autosomal recessive condition must have inherited one gene alteration from each parent.In autosomal recessive inheritance, people with one copy of the gene alteration do not have the condition.  They are said to be carriers for the autosomal recessive condition.So if you do not have that gene mutation in you - then it is unlikely that the kid born to you and your boy friend will get this PEHO syndrome.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"baby age 11 months,weight 9 she is continously suffering from motions past one weak recently mother feeding was stopped one month back and feeding heritage milk.....previously when she is six months baby she suffered same problem she is keep on facing the problem conti.........solution ol.","Doctor":"Hi...It seems your kid is having viral diarrhoea.

I have been having localized pain in my lower left abdomen on and off for a year and it has recently gotten more uncomfortable. No other symptoms are present.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for using this forum. Well the diagnosis of incisional hernia on an ultrasound can be quite challenging and difficult one to make. It depends on various factors ranging from size of hernia to the experience of the ultrasonographist. You should look out for symptoms such as swelling in the line of incision while standing up, while coughing or while picking up any heavy items. If any  swelling is seen, its a sign for incisional hernia. Sometimes such hernias are also hidden which means they dont reveal to the naked eye. As for the pain in the lower left abdomen, this pain could also be related to the c-section operation specially the suture line due to the fibrosis. Also get a urine exam done to rule out any Urinary tract infection and a consultation with a gynecologist would certainly help. Kindly feel free to ask if you have any further queries.

They usually occur form 6 months to 6 years of age and usually are self limiting after 6 years of age. They usually do not leave any focal neurological deficits also. Rather than the height of the temperature the rapidity of rise of temperature is more important. In general, antiepileptic therapy, continuous or intermittent, is not recommended for children with 1 or more simple febrile seizures. Parents should be counseled about the relative risks of recurrence of febrile seizures and recurrence of epilepsy, educated on how to handle a seizure acutely, and given emotional support.If the seizure lasts for longer than 5 min,buccal or intranasal midazolam may be used and is often preferred by parents.If the parents are very anxious concerning their child’s seizures, intermittent oral diazepam (0.33 mg/kg every 8 hr during fever) or intermittent rectal diazepam (0.5 mg/kg administered as a rectal suppository every 8 hr), can be given during febrile illnesses.Such therapies help reduce, but do not eliminate, the risks of recurrence of febrile seizures.Regards – Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, My son Ryden is 22 weeks old, weighs about 17 lbs his little eyes are red, watery and puff.

Fainting, also called syncope (pronounced SIN-ko-pee), is a sudden, brief loss of consciousness and posture caused by decreased blood flow to the brain.You may suffer from a simple fainting spell due to anxiety, fear, pain, intense emotional stress, hunger, or use of alcohol or drugs. Most people who suffer from simple fainting have no underlying heart or neurological (nerve or brain) problem.Simple fainting may not last for more than 10 minutes.

I feel that your baby is having milk protein allergy. Usually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age. I request you to keep me posted about the recovery of the baby and follow of the case.Regards – Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My baby just turned one year old last week.

Now her counts are around 33000. how long it may take to reach the normal level?","Doctor":"Hi, welcome to HCM. Low platelet count In a 2 and half year child could be due to ITP (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura). You must have been given steroids to increase platelet count. Platelet count should be repeated 2 weekly and further treatment depends on the platelet count. It usually takes 1 month time if the acute crisis is over. I hope this will help you.

Since, the child is crying while moving neck, it could be due to muscular injury or could be fracture. In my opinion, x ray neck ap and lateral view should be done immediately to rule out fracture.

There is also history of emotional stress, peptic ulcer, stapler in esophagus which had to be removed to improve the breathing and it did. But hte pan remained. This looks to be due to hiatus hernia with associated symptoms.I would advise you to undergo an upper GI Endoscopy to confirm the diagnosis, take a few months course and if this does not help, get ready for surgery as a permanent cure. Continue PPI or Ranitidine, antacid get, small frequent meals, soft bland diet, no anxiety or stress at all as it increases all the problems ."},{"Patient":"Yesterday, my stomach hurts because its the first time I eat as much as i eat before.

This can happen if you are allergic to certain food items. Food poisoning is another possible cause of stomach pain after eating. Severe upper abdominal pain experienced instantly after eating a heavy meal or pain experienced six to twelve hours after a heavy meal can be caused due to pancreatitis. Make sure that you consult a doctor if the problem is experienced repeatedly. Remember that stomach pain after intake of food must not be ignored. If you develop such problems, do get yourself examined by a reputed doctor.

This occurs due to poor supplementation of iron rich food as per the required amounts of growing infants. So, you may give him iron rich food along with iron supplement such as Syp Ferronia XT or Tonoferon.

The child could have got the dizziness onto his head and is obsessed with it. Unless he is fully satisfied, he will be showing the signs of anxiety.

Your child has pain in arms and legs and she is also playing less, it seems that your child has probably got calcium deficiency. In calcium deficiency, child usually gets tired easily and has pain in arms and legs which subside on taking rest.

Your child has bleeding in stools and lab report suggests 20 to 25 pus cells and amoeba cysts, this signifies that your child has probably got amoebic dysentery. This is not liver abscess, it's an infection of gut. In my opinion, you should give metronidazole tablet to the child.

He d wake up in the middle of the night crying. Thought it might just be growing pains . But last few weeks it has gotten progressively worse. I have to give him ibupropron 2-3 times/day. Tylenol just doesn t work. His pediatrician did x-ray and blood work, nothing looked abnormal. Then, 2 1/2 wks ago, he got this bad rash all over his legs and eventually on his elbows. Almost looked like blisters, big & puffy. Took him to dermatologist, thought it might be a viral infection. This rash is almost cleared up with steroids (both oral & cream). Then took him in to a pediatric orthopedic who also did x-rays, still nothing showed up. He does have an appt for a bone scan next week. But, now he has developed another rash all over his body. This rash looks different than the one before, little, tiny pumps (what I normally see rashes look like, compared to the other rash he had). Now today, he has been complaining his stomach hurts. He s not running a fever, just doesn t feel good. The pediatric orthopedic thought possibly these 2 symptoms were related (he doesn t know he now has another rash or stomach ache). Should I be overly concerned right now? Or is o.k. to wait till his appt next week?","Doctor":"Hi.... all your kid's symptoms fit into a common problem which is most probably vasculitis. This could also be a connective tissue disorder like Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or SLE.  I suggest that you work up the kid in the line of Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis as the pain abdomen along with rash and joint pains are definitely fitting into this diagnosis. This requires further evaluation and long-term follow-up.  I suggest you consult a paediatric rheumatologist.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"MY 18 MONTH OLD HAS A RED SPOT LOOKS LIKE A SPOT OF BLOOD ON THE WHITE OF HER EYE THAT SEEMS TO BE GETTING BIGGER.

By what you quote it seems that your child has probably got cold. Due to cold, the child has blocked nose and cough. There are chances that he could be having fever and thats why he is feeling tired.

He doesn t act like he s in pain or anything but now Im worried something is wrong. Can you help?","Doctor":"Hi, since your child has fracture skull at 11 days of life and you have neurological visits at that time this doesn't seems alarming. It may be an old impression of the fracture. If the child has achieved all the milestones normally and there is no history of recent trauma, it will not be a matter of concern.

The most likely reason for these symptoms is a viral illness which easily spread amongst children. They do not need antibiotics unless and until blood or culture reports suggest a bacterial infection.Repeated antibiotics should be avoided.

The doc said only to use some tylenol for fever.but we are moving to europe on monday and im concerned she will be still sick. Is there anything else we can do?","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 3 year old daughter has been having fever ranging from 101.2-103.7 since friday.

In my opinion, you should give syrup oflox (5ml =50 mg) 5 ml three times a day for 3 days, paracetamol syrup for fever and syrup domperidone 4 ml for vomiting.

They will be resolved as soon as you stop the drug.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My daughter is running high fever 102. We gave her calpol didnt have anmy effect so after 45 minutes we gave her Meftal P the fever has now come down. What do we do if it goes up again? After how long can we give her the Meftal again. She has a slight running nose as well","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.MEFTAL-P CONTAINS MEFENAMIC ACID WHICH IS A NSAID. IT CARRIES THE RISK OF GASTRITIS AND RENAL PROBLEMS IN THE LONG RUN. PLEASE DO NOT USE MEFTAL-P.

Your child has stomach pain, fever and 1 episode of vomiting. It seems that your child has probably got acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. In my opinion, you should give paracetamol syrup for fever, and antibiotic like oflox for 3 days. This doesn't look like dengue, however if rash appears on baby then you should give more liquids to the child and do NS1 Antigen test and complete blood count to rule out dengue. I hope this will help you. Take care.

Your 18 month child has cough, fever and is on azithromycin and ascoril but the cough is not relieving. This could be due to development of wheezing episode in child or lower respiratory tract infection. If the child has wheezing episode then you have to nebulise the child for 2 days. Since  it's only two days on azithromycin so you should wait for 1 more day and if child don't respond then antibiotic needs to be changed. I hope this will help you. Take care.

Typhoid fever may take up to 10 days to fully recover or to become afebrile. But, while on antibiotics, the fever should decrease in intensity. If fever is not decreasing or the child develops complications like jaundice, altered sensorium, then the child needs hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics need to be given. Take care.

Ceralac is not a milk substitute, it's used as a weaning food.If you want to substitute breast milk then you should start lactogen 2. You should also continue other food that you are giving, it will be more helpful to the child. I hope this will help you. Take care.

Since, the montoux test in child is positive and there is history of tuberculosis in family, there is very much possibility of tuberculosis in child. I suggest you to do x ray chest, complete blood count with esr, sputum for AFB to confirm the diagnosis. If suggestive of tuberculosis then child needs to be given ATT drugs without delay.

Your child has blood in stools and is complaining of pain in abdomen for 2 weeks, this could be due to dysentery. Dysentery usually occurs due to bacterial or amoebic infection, at this it's mostly bacterial. In my opinion, you should give tablet oflox-ornidazole half tab three times a day for 3 days and give tablet albendazole once at night before sleep. I hope this will help you. Review after 2 days.

When food is stuck in a babies’ throat, he or she is probably unable to breathe and it is therefore very important to remove the item as quickly as possible. This is one of the reasons that it’s so important to never leave a baby unattended while they are eating, even once they are a toddler. If you see the food, and you can retrieve it without forcing it further down their throat or by cutting off their oxygen supply, do so right away. Now you should not try to give rescue breathing. Immediately you should call for medical help.As a first aid measure, the toddler can be held upside down and firmly pat the child's back blow the neck and upper chest three or four times. See the food particles to come out. If not please rush the child to a hospital or to a nearby health center.If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.

Don't confuse yourself about the infant's hunger pangs. Midwife's opinion is general and general opinion depends mainly on their own experiences. In the first few days of postnatal life, the baby requires very little milk. However, as the baby grows, the capacity to consume milk increases from 1 oz. on the first postnatal day to up to 15-20 oz. daily by week 2 and 3. By the end of week 4, the baby can ingest and digest up to 25 oz. to 30 oz. of milk daily. One Oz is around 30 ml. In your child's case, the child consumes around 90 ml every feeding. I don't say that is normal but that is definitely not abnormal. Don't worry. Child asks for milk because it is hungry and it has the capacity to digest it. I suggest you to consult your pediatrician for further confirmation.If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.  Make sure that you include every minute detail possible.

Could this be from the scoprion sting?","Doctor":"Hi.... I do not think that Scorpion sting can cause fever after one week. This could be an unrelated illness and most probably a viral illness. If the kid is well when the fever is down, you need not worried about this. I  suggest you give Paracetamol in the appropriate those after checking temperature every four hourly once and that too only if the fever is about hundred degrees Fahrenheit.In scorpion sting rather than fever, heart rate and palpitations and profuse sweating are more significant symptoms.

You will need your stools examined in the laboratory to determine the cause. Antibiotics and deparasitation might be required. You will also need an antispasmodic or analgesia for the stomach pain. If pain is too severe, it is advisable that you get consulted by a doctor as soon as possible. An acute abdomen might the problem you are having and the cause might be more severe than you present it on this forum (e.g appendicitis). Hope this helps Dr. Bernard"},{"Patient":"Hello.

This is a quite common condition in this age group and will be acquired by contact. The Other possibility is a blepharitis of the eyelids which is related to infection and inflammation.

The main symptoms of malaria will be very high grade fever with chills and Rigors. Cough is usually not a prominent symptom in malaria.

Usually for cough and fever Malaria drugs are not indicated.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"I have a son who suffers with enursis. We have used the usual methods of the alarm and desmopressin.

Any specific food will not induce enuresis in an otherwise normal kid. I do not think for this reason you need to take up a food allergy panel testing.

The urine culture report showed that she is resistant to Cephalexin (which is present in Sporidex).

This scans are done for the following purposes - DMSA scan to find out if there are any renal scars or inflammation in the Kidneys.MCU scan is done to find out if there is any upward reflex of urine going on.If this is the case then the kid will be required to be on prophylactic oral antibiotic till at least 2 years of age.I concur with your pediatrician and I too suggest that you go ahead with both scans.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"i am 12 years old am having fever from 4 to 5 days along with vometting my blood reports r showing normal ranges except the neutrophils have struck 84 %.wht could be the reason behind this .i also dont feel like having any thing be cause of  vometting","Doctor":"Hi.... keeping in mind your fever symptoms and vomiting I feel that you might be having a viral prodrome of gastroenteritis.

The three year young children are always like this. It is not that they do not have appetite, it is because they are already eating what is required for their body.

Secondly they see eating as a duty because what ever they get, they don't like it. In these senses, it is natural they trick mother. Over and above, you should notice, they will eat when they are hungry. Once they are satiated, they refuse to eat more.In my suggestion, the best method is to provide food when they are hungry and ask for food, and stop when they say enough.

A 4 week baby with rapsy chest on taking lactose milk formula is definitely an allergic reaction. This could be cow milk allergy.

I have him tested and his Paletelet count is 131,000 and ALT level is 46 where as Lab normal range was 40. One other thing is him Hemoglobin is 10.3. He is not eating much, vomit when eats some thing. What more tests should I do to diagnose the cause of fever?","Doctor":"Hi...NO NEED TO DO ANY FURTHER TESTS. Seems like a viral illness by the tests and by what you quote.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My niece is 13 years old and was dx w/ Gilberts syndrome.

Hes always been a sweaty baby but theres never been a smell, and the sweat on his body has no odor at all,even now. Should i be worried?","Doctor":"Hi, welcome to hcm.Your child is 1 year of age and the sweat on his head is smelly like vinegar, this is probably body odor or osmidrosis. Usually the sweat is odorless, but sometimes it becomes smelly because of breakdown of sweat by bacteria on skin into acids. To prevent body odor or osmidrosis, you should bath the baby daily with warm water, clothing with natural fibers should be done as it allows better evaporation of sweat. I hope this will help you.Take care."},{"Patient":"I just picked up my 2 1/2 years old daughter and the nursery teacher showed me a rash that had developed on he thighs.

Im taking her tonight to the night time physician but I am worried. Any preliminary suggestions of what could it be?","Doctor":"Hi, welcome to HCM. Constant shaped lesion of 3 inch diameter on both legs could be a fungal infection. In my opinion, you should apply antifungal cream like zole-f at the lesions for one week.

What would cause that particular odor?","Doctor":"Hi, welcome to HCM.Fever with vomiting in a 6 year old child could be due to food poisoning or gastroenteritis. This could be due food that he ate 1 day back. This seems unlikely due to XR ADHD because if it is due to this drug then it would have happened immediately. In my opinion, you should give antibiotic like syrup oflox (5 ml=50 mg) three times a day for 3 days, syrup domstal 5 ml three times a day for 2 days.Review after 2 days.I hope this will help you.Take care."},{"Patient":"I have a son year 10 days old have a lose motion and he is going 5-6 times a day .my mother says home remedy that give the boy water separated from milk and o.r.s please advice further what are other thing that can work and food s requires in this case","Doctor":"Hi, welcome to HCM. Your child has loose stools five to six times a day, this suggests that your child has probably acute gastroenteritis. In acute gastroenteritis, we need to take care of fluid content in child and look for dehydration. So, you should give ORS solution about 250 ml each time the child passes a stool. Also  antibiotic needs to be given in acute gastroenteritis like tablet oflox-ornidazole two times a day for 3 days. You should also do stool routine microscopy test in child. Review back after 2 days. I hope this will help you. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello,I had a baby 6 months ago and ever since I have been having strange symptoms I have never had before.

I suggest you see your pediatrician and get a rapid streptococcal antigen test done. If it is positive then she will require antibiotics. if it is negative then it might be viral illness and doesn't require antibiotics at all.Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do.

I am Dr. Prasad Akole (Critical Care Expert-  and am glad to address to your query here. Since you say it is different than heartburn of reflux disease, the possibility is gall bladder inflammation if on the right side. Bowel, stomach, spleen can be other organs of origin of pain. Sometimes early lower lung pathology can cause pain. Could you describe all the symptoms in details? Like what brings it on, how long does it last? What is it like? Increasing in any position? Relation to food? Did you have fever, nausea, vomiting, breathlessness? Would be glad to advise more precisely after you tell us these details.

I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Usually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age. I request you to keep me posted about the recovery of the baby and follow of the case.Regards – Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My five year old son has been vomiting about once a week for over a month. He throws up until his stomach is empty and then he is fine again. The doctor thought maybe he had a dairy allergy so we took him off of all dairy, but he got sick and threw up again last night. It was only a small amount, not until his stomach was empty, but he has felt sick on and off all day today with no more vomiting.","Doctor":"Hi...once week vomiting need not be worried about if the kid is otherwise active and in-between episodes normal. This is definitely not diary allergy keeping in mind the age and frequency of symptoms.You need to worry about vomiting only if following symptoms are there ,- 1. Green or bilious vomiting.2. Severe headache.3. Double vision.4. Weakness or restriction of movement of any body part.5. Seizures.6. Altered behavior.7. High blood pressure.If these are there, it requires further evaluation. Otherwise be rest assured.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My son was born with a cystic hygroma, which we did not know until he was a day old when it became noticeable on his neck. It came up again after that when he was 3 years old and now he is 14 and it has started to come up again. What would make it come up noticably now?","Doctor":"Hi....cystic hygroma can grow back from remnants. It is not very uncommon to have recurrent cystic hygroma in the same region. The treatment is surgical if the lesion is symptomatic or producing compression symptoms.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My daughter is almost 3 she has been getting abseces in between her legs and outer thighs since she was a baby all drs say is warm compression helps it drain and give me amoxicillin they come back she gets a bunch weekly what are they what can i do i have taken fried greasy.foods away and candy i feel like nothing works","Doctor":"Hi....recurrent abcesses are not related to food. Your daughter needs evaluation for immunodeficiency. Recurrence of abscess anywhere in the body warrants that work up for immunodeficiency. I suggest you consult your doctor regarding this or a pediatric immunologist or hematologist.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 1 year old grandson has a knot in his left thigh and will not bend his left knee. He can walk but keeps his leg straight. He will push your hand away when you touch the knot in the thigh but doesn t cry unless you try to bend his leg. He had a Rocephin shot almost 3 weeks ago. Took him to Urgent Care and they took x-rays and said he may just have a contusion. It hasn t gotten any better and there are no signs of a contusion.","Doctor":"Hi....by what you quote I feel that the kid might have developed a fibrosis over the area after a contusion. This is what you are as able to feel like a lump. Sometimes these fibrosed tissue can entangle with the tendons and restrict movements. I suggest you get an orthopedic surgeon consultation and in my Opinion an MRI if the leg will be conclusive.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my two year old daughter fell and hit her head (by her hairline) on the edge of pavement 2 and a half weeks ago. i noticed tonight that the bump is still there, although there is no bruising. is this cause for concern that there is still a fairly large bump?

I have a question for you, I am experiencing pain on the right side of my stomach , like a burning sensation, a sort of acid reflux , I believe I have gastritis , I m taking omeprazole 20 mg....is been 2 days of pain, right now is night time and I want to be able to sleep, can you tell me what can I drink to easy the pain, can I have a glass of fat free milk or chamomille tea?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. From the description of your symptoms, it appears that you are having a gastritis / acid peptic disease. Omeprazole is a medication which can reduce the excessive acid production and thereby provide relief. For symptomatic relief, you can also take an antacid syrup like Mucaine gel or Gelusil. Alternatively you can drink a glass of cold milk, which also has antacid properties and hence can provide some relief. It is better to avoid tea since, it can sometimes be a gastric irritant. Wish you all the best.

Do not worry. it is physiological. What your kid is having is not a diarrhea and is only a gastro-colic reflux. It is quite common for babies of this age group t pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated.When the baby takes milk , the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastro-colic reflex. Do not worry. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.Even if the kid is vomiting after feeds if his activity and development is age appropriate you need not worry. But if his weight is less than 5th centile then it might be gastroesophageal reflex and needs evaluation.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

Most common cause of headache is refractive error, so you should get your child eyes check for refractive error. Other causes could be hypertension so get the blood pressure checked.

I suggest you see your pediatrician and get a rapid streptococcal antigen test done. If it is positive then she will require antibiotics. if it is negative then it might be viral illness and doesn't require antibiotics at all.Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F.

If the pain comes up when you have not eaten or immediately your eat or if you have over-eaten or with some spicy meal or on eaten 'hard' food, then it can be GASTRITIS or PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE especially if it is relieved by eating in general or jelly-like or milky foods in particular.

I just noticed that his knees makes some cracking sounds when he bends them.... he expiriences no pain or discomfort. He is an active child,I was wondering if this is normal or are there any concerns I should worry about? Thanks","Doctor":"Hi, cracking sound at knee joints while bending in a 9 year old child can be normal or due to calcium deficiency. In my opinion, you should do calcium and phosphate levels in child with x ray wrist to look for rickets. If calcium deficiency is found than child will require calcium syrup for 3 months.

I look forward to hearing from you, many thanks Leigh-anne","Doctor":"Hi, your child has fever for 2 days and sore throat with complaint of passing stools since 1 day, this is suggestive of throat infection or stomach infection. In throat infection the child probably needs antibiotic like amoxyclav for 3 days and a cough syrup. I think that your child has throat infection due to which he must have taken less diet which resulted in difficulty in passing stools. In my opinion, you should start antibiotics, cough syrup and syrup for fever like paracetamol. I hope this will help you.

Is this normal with a dx of a bone bruise?","Doctor":"Hi, your child fall 1 week back and there was no fracture but just a bone bruise, and he is not able to fully extend the arm at elbow region. Actually, whenever there is a trauma, the muscles and ligaments beneath the skin might get injured and it takes upto 3 weeks to get completely healed. It's good that your child doesn't have fracture of bone. I think that you should wait for 2 more weeks and till then apply local anesthetic gel or spray at the affected area.

Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.It seems your kid is having viral diarrhoea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 10 yr old daughter had developed a mottled redness on her inner thighs (been there for months, but seems to subside with hydrocortisone creams).

Se is also suspected as having a cow s milk protein allergy as she was getting blood in her poop. She is due to have an allergy test in Jan 2012. I have been instructed not to give her any diary and that I stay away from dairy as well as I am still breast feeding her. She has not had any dairy since birth and is refusing to drink allergy management formulas from a bottle. She is now underweight for her age. Can you please advise if I can continue giving her something rich in protein like meat, lentils etc. as these are causing a rash on her face as well. Thanks","Doctor":"Hi...I went through the history points you have provided - I was expecting that there should have been a history of cow's milk and formula feed (this too contains cow's milk protein) given to the baby. I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Usually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age. I request you to keep me posted about the recovery of the baby and follow of the case.Regards – Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my daughter 13 year old,had last year right leg red bruise goes from knee to down towards ankle,clyndamycin work,now she had on right arm ,ist small nodule appear with disesness ,then red bump swollen and spread in arm,took clindamyc,get little clear and then she get on left arm after 4rt day .what is this?","Doctor":"Hi...by what you quote I feel that your kid might be having Pyoderma or skin and soft tissue infection in the region.

It is quite common for babies of this age group to pass small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated.When the baby takes milk , the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastro-colic reflex. Do not worry.

An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4.

With the available described symptoms, there appears to be possibility of acute viral gastroenteritis. Presence of foul smelling watery diarrhea, abdominal pain and body ache suggests the diagnosis.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.

So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Some amount of cough and cold is common during viral infection and is self limiting.

Nothing to worry.The foreskin moment part is to be addressed. Your child should learn to make the moment forward and back with the foreskin and to clean the inner area of the foreskin. If he is reluctant, you must try to do it. You can do it easily. Once you compel him, and say, if he don't do it, you will, your son will agree do it himself. that is the right approach.

Within the last few weeks intermittently I ve been feeling like I ve been kicked in the stomache. I don t have rebound tenderness . The pain is in the upper middle abdomen . Also, I pass gas frequently which is normal but lately it smells so much worse than before. Also, I do have a very small amount of blood in my stool , almost not noticeable, which i have had for at least a yr and was diagnosed as hemorroids. I am a 33 Y/O male healthy otherwise. Any ideas what could be wrong.","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. Upper middle abdominal pain is most likely caused by peptic ulcer. The pain usually appears 1-2 hours after a meal, nausea can be present. If the pain radiates to the back, gallstones are also possible. Bad smelling gases can appear due to bad diet or intestinal bacteria overgrow. Blood in stool, if is fresh, on the surface of the stool (not mixed with it) is most likely caused by hemorrhoids. I suggest you to have upper GI endoscopy performed with Helicobacter Pylori test. This is also very important in cancer ruling out (as your symptoms can appear due to stomach cancer as well). Avoid fatty foods, spicy foods, alcohol, coffee, chocolate, fruit juices. Increase fiber rich products and mineral water intake. Probiotics should be also used. If such treatment wont give any help, you should visit gastroenterologist for further examination. Hope this will help.

You should follow some precautions like :- 1. Avoid spicy and oily foods. 2. Donot miss a meal. 3. Avoid emotional/mental stress. 4. Avoid doing self medication especially with pain killers and steroids. 5. Drink lots of pure water daily. You can take antacid like Omeprazole 20 mg daily along with Domperidone 10 mg for relief from your symptoms. Antacid in gel or liquid form is also beneficial as it forms a protective layer over the damaged mucosa of the stomach. You can get yourself investigated for :- 1. H. pylori infection. 2. Endoscopy.

Nothing to worry about it. If he is active otherwise do not worry. The anemia is not related to appetite.

She stopped taking the bottle at about 10 months old, but will not take to any sippy cup at all, nor cups of liquid. She eats baby food and oatmeal with banana pretty well, but will not drink, not even an ounce of liquid at all. I am getting concerned. Our pediatrician told us as long as her diapers are wet, not to worry, but she is not getting any calcium from milk or such liquids. I was wondering if her adenoids would have any relation on her not wanting to swallow liquids?

Only lasted 24 hours and followed by a cold. Wondering if she could have the same thing or something more serious.","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My sister is 3 years old and has a history of poor appetite, ear infections, and poor immunity. 3 weeks ago she began having bloody, foul smelling diarrhea containing mucus.

Doctor prescribed and anti-biotic. She stopped throwing up for about two days and now it is back and worse than ever. Doctor ran a CBC and ordered a stomach x-ray it they were normal. Anyone have an idea on what this could be?","Doctor":"Hi, tahnk you for posting your query here. Forom what you ve described, it seems like your child has GERD (reflux). they tend to vomit when going to bed or after a heavy meal.My advice would be to give smaller meals, a little more frequently, avoid chocolate/tea/coffee which increase reflux. To make her walk around a bit after her meals, not immediately lie down. keep her bed reclining at a 30 degree angle (you could put some blocks under her head-end side of the bed).Ask your doctor about starting domperidone which helps reflux. ondansetron half hour before food will help the vomiting.Hope this helps you, take care.Regards,Dr. Vaishnavi"},{"Patient":"my 13 month old son has developed over the last several days little red dots. there are currently 6 over different parts of his body.

What you are describing seems to be mosquito bites, especially since they are on exposed regions like the cheek and hands and have occurred over a few days( which doesnt happen with measles or chickenpox).

The doctor did second culture because first showed nothing.","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for posting your query here. Recurrent perirectal abscesses could be due to colonisation with a bacteria called staph aureus in his body, which may be a resistant strain.

He is also very sensitive to smell (vomits right after eating most of the time when we go out to eat). I don t know if this is related. Please help!","Doctor":"Thank you for using Health Care Magic. Elevated alkaline phosphatase is a marker of rickets so I would advise you get his Vitamin D levels checked. His liver enzymes are only mildly elevated and are not a cause for concern. Is he on any medication like for seizures or anti tubercular drugs? Also, how much is his hemoglobin? Some forms of anemia can cause higher LDH levels.The vomiting only when going out to eat seems to be more of a social anxiety situation, the stress of which makes him vomit. If he is not vomiting when eating at home, and happens only on going out, that is the most likely cause. Not likely to be related to the elevated alkaline phosphataseDo let me know his hemoglobin and medication history and we can narrow down the causes for his elevated ALP levels.

The symptoms of rat fever are high fever, severe muscle pain, red eyes, stomach pain, jaundice. The test for rat fever normally done is Microscopic agglutination test (MAT) which can be falsely positive. So even if it is positive, if your child has not played in puddles or been near rats urine and does not have muscle pain/red eyes, it is very unlikely to be rat fever.  Widal test is done for typhoid, it is best done in the second week of illness. If it comes >1 :160 positive, there is a good chance that it is typhoid.     I would suggest you not to give cold towel wiping as that will cause a lot of discomfort to the child and reduces only the surface temperature.

It can be that your child has gastroesophageal reflux disease wherein food from the stomach goes back to the esophagus. Esophagus is the tube that connects the stomach and the mouth. This may cause heartburn, nausea and vomiting. Patients with this will benefit from medicines such as omeprazole.

Do you think they could be gnat bites? He is outside at daycare for a couple of hours each day. I know that they are NOT mosquito bites.","Doctor":"Hello there, thanks for using Health Care Magic.From what you ve described, it seems like your baby has furunculosis or a small abscess. It should settle on its own and if it is very painful, causes fever or large, may require an incision to drain it.     I would advice you to wait aand atch unless he develops spots around his mouth or under his nose, in which case he will need antibiotics.     Another thing to keep in mind is that if he gets furuncles often, he may have a bug called Staph aureus in his nostrils or armpits and will need a decolonization regimen with mupirocin ointment in both nostrils for 7 days, and a chlorhexidine body wash for 10 days.

First x-ray showed enlarged lymph nodes on her right side of abdomen. Second tests showed that dye stayed in her kidney for 30 minutes. Second Ultrasound showed debris in bladder and an a enlarged liver now. What could be some of the causes?","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for posting your query here.     First, debris in bladder and dye staying in bladder for a longtime means she has dysfunctional voiding, that is she does not pass urine well. Some of the causes are constipation, urinary infection, toilet training issues or habitual.I would advise you to:1. get a routine urine examination done, to check if there is urinary infection. 2. address constipation issues, if any. Lots of fluids, fibre like oats and bran, fruits and vegetables. Lactulose syrup if she has hard stools3. Make her do 'double voiding', that is after she urinates, take her to the bathroom again in ten minutes and ask her to pee. If any residual urine is there in the bladder, it will be emptied now.Second, enlarged liver can occur with viral infections or typhoid. Along with jaundice it could be a marker of liver disease. If she does not have fever or jaundice, there is nothing to be concerned about a mild liver enlargement if her liver function tests are normal ( if not done, kindly do so) . You could repeat the ultrasound in a month and take a call."},{"Patient":"My three yr old daughter woke up from her nap Sunday around 5pm and vomited the entire night until there was nothing left in her stomach. She had no fever or coughing or anything related to a cold, by the way. Monday morning she woke up and said she was hungry but to be cautious we only gave her crackers and water. She kept those down and except for being more tired than usual, she played normally the rest of the day. She s had no bowel movements for three days either. She woke up today, Tuesday complaining of her stomach hurting again and promptly threw up. Still no fever. Now she complains of her stomach hurting and has a little gas but cannot have a bowel movement. Should I take her in to be seen or give her a suppository to induce a BM??","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for choosing healthcare magic.I'm sorry to hear that about your daughter. Before her nap last sunday, was she well? How was her food intake before that incident? Is she the only one in the family who is vomiting? The most common cause of vomiting in children is still infectious gastroenteritis caused by virus or what we call stomach flu. It usually begins suddenly and resolves with in 1-3 days. For this case, you just have to monitor for dehydration. For mild cases of dehydration like feeling thirsty and slightly dry mouth, you can give oral rehydrating solution or pedialyte. Give this in small frequent sips because we don't want to induce vomiting especially if the stomach is still recovering from the infection. For persistent vomiting with moderate to severe cases of dehydration like dry mouth, sunken eyes, decrease in urine, or lack of tears, you have to bring your child to the hospital immediately for intravenous hydration. Viral infection, changes in diet and dehydration can cause stools to be hard thus there's difficulty and pain in passing it out.Have you noticed if your daughter's tummy is getting bigger or bloated the past days? For cases of vomiting with no bowel movement, we would also want to rule out any intestinal obstruction. Is their relief of the stomach ache after the vomiting? If the stomach ache is getting worse I suggest that you have her examined by your doctor first before giving her any suppository or medication.

I also contact with ENT but they advise use the nasal spray or gel. Please Doctor advise me what will do. Regards, Rehan","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for choosing healthcare magic.Nosebleeds are common in childhood. There is an area in the nose wherein the blood vessels are covered by very thin membrane. And this area is prone to exposure to trauma or injury and dry air. The usual causes of nose bleeding in children are when the child touches or pokes it with his finger, foreign bodies, dry air or when there's upper respiratory tract infections, or allergic rhinitis. There's also often a history of childhood nosebleeding within the family.During nosebleeding, you should compress the nose and make your child sit upright with his head slightly tilted forward to avoid the blood to drip to the back of his throat. You may also apply cold compress to the nose. If this simple measures did not help, some patients are given Oxymetazoline nasal drops to stop the bleeding or nasal packing. For repeated cases of nosebleeding, it would be best to consult your ENT so he can identify the area in your child's nose that is bleeding. He will also investigate further other probable causes such as bleeding disorders.I hope I was able to help you.Regards, Hannalae Dulay-See, M.D.Pediatrician"},{"Patient":"My son 5 years old is suffering from high fever around 103 def F and complaining throat infection .

Im sorry to hear that about your son.Did the fever only start today? How is he after you give the fever medicine? Is he active and eating well?Fever can be due to a viral or bacterial infection. Aside from the throat pain, does he have colds or cough? For most viral infections, the patients appear well after given antipyretic (fever medicine like Ibugesic or Paracetamol)  in between fever episodes. The throat infection caused by viruses is usually accompanied by colds. Viral infections are not given antibiotics like Clarithromycin or Crixan. It is mainly supportive like giving fever medicine, lots of fluids, antibacterial gargle. Fever caused by viral infections can last from 3 days to a week. After 3 days, you will notice the fever to go down and the patient will show improvement already.You may try to check his throat to see if the tonsils are red and swollen sometimes with streaks of pus. If you see this, chances are the throat infection is caused by a bacteria like streptococcus or what we call as the strep throat. Patients who have strep throat can also have severe headache, difficulty swallowing, sometimes with rashes. Bacterial throat infection will be more sick looking compared to that caused by viruses. For this you will need antibiotics that is properly computed based on your child's weight.I hope I was able to help you.Sincerely, Hannalae Dulay-See, M.D.Pediatrics"},{"Patient":"My daughter has 3 dogs who ran into to house after being sprayed by skunk.

Observe if she has a reaction like rashes, swollen eyes or in worst cases difficulty of breathing. If none, you may give mashed vegetable like potato  for the next 3 days.

Further treatment will depend on above reports, please revert back with above reports. I hope this will help you. Wishing your child good health.

It is above my groin but in my lower tummy area on the right hand side, if I rub it is a bit sore, a very different sensation to the rubbing the other side. Weirdly I have also had a ‘burning’ pain in my right breast for three weeks, I don’t know if these can be linked in any way but it is all a bit strange. (its like a burning sensation in my right nipple ) I look forward to hearing from you. Aoife","Doctor":"Hello Aoife and welcome to HCM. Thank you for your query. The location described in your query is where your appendix is located. A few more symptoms you could experience if this condition is indeed related to your appendix is tenderness over the exact location, a belt like radiating pain across your waist, vomiting, nausea, etc. The burning sensation in your right nipple might not be associated with the abdominal pain. Although further description of the appearance of the nipple/areola might help. Do you notice any cracks? Dryness? Change in color of the areola? Any nipple discharge? etc. In my opinion the best option would be to visit a doctor at the earliest for an elaborate physical examination and if required further non-invasive investigations. I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for. Please feel free to write back to me for any further clarifications. I would gladly help you. Best wishes."},{"Patient":"My 5 month old baby began having frequent (8-10 per day) green mucousy bowel movements for about 1 week. He is exclusively breastfed and has been taking rice cereal for about 3 weeks. He has no fever, is happy and content and is not dehydrated (he is drooling a lot and has tears)...he is also teething (he got his first 2 bottom teeth last month). Today, his bowel movements went from being green and mucousy to a mustard yellow colour but very runny/watery. What does this mean? Could this be a virus that he is getting over and the bowel movements are returning to normal. He usually has 1-2 mustard yellow curdy bowel movements with some seeds per day - normal for breastfed babies.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,More than the color, its the consistency that worries me. Especially if the baby was started on top feeds, so there is a possibility of infection in gut which can be due to unhygiene feed or may be just a viral gastro enteritis. Good thing is that this can be managed very easily by you by making sure you keep giving adequate milk and liquids orally. Ors is a good substitute to prevent dehydration. Watch for any blood in stools. If yes, then need to see a doctor and start antibiotics. Make sure child is active and feeding well and no evidence of dehydration.

On the third day took her to her Pediatrician who tested her for strep stating it could be scarlet fever or allergic reaction to soap or lotion. She began feeling itchy so I took her to the hospital where they said it was a prickly heat rash. Suggested I give her benadryl and keep her cool. The rash looks almost like goose bumps that don t go away. Day 5 she has a low grade fever of 100. Please help","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,I understand your concern but unfortunately without having a look at the rash, just by description a clear cut diagnosis cannot be arrived at. However, description makes me think of possibility of scarlet fever especially with fever coming up. I would suggest you get another consult with a pediatrician and sought treatment. If it looks like scarlet fever then child needs to be started on antibiotic . hope child recovers soon.

Detailed answer:Hi, welcome to HCM. I have read your question and i know that you are very concerned about your child. Gardenal syrup is given as maintenance therapy in seizure. Duration of gardenal varies according to the cause of seizure and neurological assessment and development of child. Usually, a repeat EEG is done and if the EEG comes out to be normal with satisfactory neurological examination, then gardenal is tapered and then stopped. I hope this will help you.

Detailed answer:Hi, welcome to HCM. I have read your question in detail. Your child has high grade fever for almost 8 days, TLC is high and composed of mainly neutrophils this suggests that your child has active infection. In my opinion, you should do some tests like typhidot Igm, malarial antigen test, x ray chest and ultrasound abdomen. Sometimes, there is pus collection beneath the diaphragm which requires an ultrasound to detect it. I suggest you to immediately do the above tests and revert back with reports.

A 15 months child is totally dependent on the caretaker for everything. If you take the child along with you at the party, then you have to take care of the child at every moment. Children at 15 months of age have a habit of putting everything in the mouth, so you should be more cautious till the party ends. In my opinion, its not safe to take the child to the party.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment.

Thank you for the query. Your symptoms can be caused by urinary tract infection or stress. Lower abdominal pain radiating to the back and burning sensation especially during urinating is quite characteristic for uti. You may also suffer from frequent urinating. Stress can also give many different digestive tract symptoms like constipations, vomiting, etc. If you connect this symptoms with some food intake, gastroenterocilitis can be the reason. If you do suffer from constipations for a long time, diverticultitis should be also considered. I suggest you t try mild diet, probiotics and Magnesium supplementation. You should also have urine analysis and blood work done. If symptoms will be present for few more day you should visit gastroenterologist for further examination. Hope this will help.

Is there anything wrong with him?","Doctor":"HI...there could be two possibilities in infants crying like this suddenly - First and foremost being - Otitis media or middle ear infection.Secondly could be due to excessive gaseous distension int he intestines.For the fist - I suggest you see your pediatrician and for the second I am giving an explanation here which might help you - This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put  the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If  still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 9 year old son has had a reoccuring fever off and on every week and a half for the last month or so.

Since you have normal investigation reports you need not worry, do not take stress, try to relax and concentrate on recovery. To have normal bowel movement keep yourself properly hydrated, try to resume to normal life, take fiber rich food and laxative with a glass of milk at bed time. Antacids will help the bloating feeling get better. Take small quantities of food 3-4 times, take vitamin and mineral supplements. Avoid spicy oily food. Dizziness and low BP are due to weakness and low HB%, haemoglobin levels in your blood. You will recover soon, You need rest. However if  you feel too low do contact your treating doctor.

All organs found to be clear and Consultant advised me to take Movical regularly as chronic constipation was probable cause. OK for two months then same syptoms began. Trying Lactulose in place of Movicol and after various effects including explosive BM I have tried different doses which now seem to be helping with constipation. However burning still there on and off and has never really gone away. GP seems as baffled as me. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello, almabegg, You state that your virtual colonoscopy was negative. I also take it you have had all the blood work . Especially Thyroid ,Celiac and also lactose intolerance tests. It is important to rule these out. If you have no alarm symptoms such as blood in the stool, anemia, weight loss etc. the symptom of constipation, bloating, gas and abdominal pain indicates IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome-C). Your doctor prescribed Movicol which is called an osmotic laxative. It contains Polyethylene glycol along with Sodium bicarbonate,Sod. Chloride and Potassium chloride. It makes your colon to get more fluid or water to soften up the stool. It is effective . The dosage initially should make you have diarrhea, and after that you start slowly tapering the dose down till you have normal stool. Initially you might experience some bloating which is part of IBS anyway. If you changed to lactulose , which is related to lactose, may make symptoms worse if a person is lactose intolerant. I hope you are also following a high fiber diet and drink enough liquids. Cabbage family of vegetables can give more gas. But if they are steam cooked , it will reduce the gas effect.

She has been diagnosed with allergic rhinitis. She is on Singulair 4 mg, Osonase spray, Junior Lanzol (15mg) and Relent (5 ml) once a day. She is on this medication for more than a week. Her Rhinitis has been there for almost 2.5 months now. She is not showing any major improvement. Her IGe test showed 33 points. Is it safe to continue these medicines for more than a month? Please help!","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for posting your query here. Allergic rhinitis is a condition that with proper medication can be controlled and the child can have a good quality of life. My suggestions are the following:1. switch from Relent to a plain cetrizine containing syrup, which can be safely given for 6 weeks for allergic rhinitis2. I would advise against osonase spray as there are no guidelines for use in such a young child, first try the cetrizine for 6 weeks. Fluticasone nasal spray can be used in children more than 4 years of age3. Singulair can be given safely. Give it in the evening time betweem 4 to 6 pm as it will be absorbed best at that time4. Junior lanzol need not be continued unless she has pain in her upper abdomen. 5. Most important of all are to avoid triggers such as duuust, do wet mopping insted of sweeping, clean bedsheets in warm water once a week, wash curtains regularly, clean AC filters every fortnight, avoid use of agarbattis, perfumes, mosquito coils. She should improve in the next few weeks.Keep an allergy diary with her symptoms and show your doctor at the next visit so that he/she can change medications accordingly.Hope this helps, and she feels better soon."},{"Patient":"My fourteen year old son has a chest cold but no fluid in his lungs according to his pediatrician and he claimed gasping for air and not being able to breathe which is the worst at night. Last night he woke out of a sound sleep gasping for air and not getting any. he was able to start breathing slowly in a minute but I have never seen all air cut off from a chest cold. What are my options? Is there an inhaler I can buy until I can get him to an ENT DR. which is 2 weeks away? Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for posting at Health Care Magic. From your post, I surmise that your son has a wheeze which will make breathing at night or early morning harder, and possibly a nose block due to drying up of secretions in his nose overnight. My suggestion would be:1. Put saline nose drops to clear the secretions and do steam inhalation (works beautifully to relieve stuffy nose)2. Get him an inhaler like Salbutamol or Levosalbutamol if he is having excess cough or fast breathing/difficulty breathing. He should get relief from that. Learn how to use it and give 6 puffs(with a minute between puffs) three times with a 20 minute interval between each set of 6 puffs in case of difficulty breathing. 6puffs--(20 mins)--6puffs---(20 mins)-----6 puffsHope he gets better soon.

Detailed answer:Hi, welcome to HCM. Since, CT scan has already been done and only scalp hematoma is reported, there is no need to worry. A scalp hematoma may take 3 to 4 weeks to settle down.

Thanks ----Arpita","Doctor":"Hi...normal diet is the best immune stimulant. Cough and cold are viral 95% of the times in children. For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F.

He has been also taking a lot longer naps than normal like 3+ hours....suggestions?!","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

After the regular checkup, the doctor mentioned that my child was virtually done growing based on his stage of puberty. A few weeks later, at an orthodontic appointment, his ortho took a hand and wrist x-ray film. His estimate was for two to four years more growth based on an examination of his growth plates. We are getting two different opinions, here. Obviously, growth is difficult to predict, however, I am curious which analysis is typically more accurate: puberty stage or growth plate evaluation? Thank you.","Doctor":"Brief answer:Growth plate evaluation is more reliable. Detailed answer:Hi, welcome to HCM. Growth plate evaluation is reliable method of predicting growth in a child. Growth plate evaluation exactly tells that is there any chance of more growth or increase in height. At 14 year of age in boys pubertal changes occurs and there is possibility of growth for 3 to 4 years. I hope this has helped you. Wishing your child good health. Take care.

Detailed answer:Hi, welcome to HCM. Hematocrit of 34.3 means that hemoglobin is around 12 mg/dl, which is normal for this age. WBC of 16.5 indicates infection, normal WBC count is between 4 to 11 thousand. CT scan is showing free fluid in abdomen which also suggests infection.

Detailed answer:Hi, welcome to HCM. Scabies develop due to contact with a person who has scabies. A 3 weeks baby can develop scabies if he comes in contact with a infected person who has scabies.

Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment.

I think you should give hydroxizine syrup PO 5 ml three times a day for 3 days. Take care."},{"Patient":"my 20 month old appeared with several small spots on her arms and legs this morning. One of them resembled a mosquito bite the others resembled possible spider bites. the spots have become larger and there is a defined splotchy lighter colored center and severe swelling around the area. What could be causing this?","Doctor":"Hi, this is insect bite. In insect bite the skin becomes red with a dot at centre which occurs due to sting. In my opinion, you should give hydroxizine syrup 5 ml three times a day for 3 days to prevent itching. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello. When changing my beautiful 5 week old boy, I noticed he had developed a small red bump inside his belly button. I have never noticed it before. The only thing I have noticed is a little dried mucus on the belly button here and there, but very minor. Should I worry?","Doctor":"Hi, this red bump could be due to skin tightened in cloth or could be a insect bite. If its due to pressure of cloth then it will disappear in few hours. So, you have to watch the bump for few hours. Take care."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 5 years old. She has had a white spot on top of her tongue since birth, I was told it was a blocked duct when she was 2 months old that would eventually go away. It s still there.

I thought it was my period but when I check its clear fluid and it s a lot that comes out","Doctor":"Hello, Jkhandb, You have had pains in the lower stomach area and I assume it is located in the lower quadrants of the abdomen. You do mention that you are on a high fiber diet and now you are having clear watery stools now. I am not sure whether you had any kind of blood work , X-rays , sonogram or CT-Scan . Depending upon your age , these are necessary to have before making a definitive diagnosis. Your stool needs to be tested for hidden blood. If that is positive, you may have to undergo Colonoscopy to rule out colitis or polyps. I wish you well."},{"Patient":"My 15-month-old has had a bump on his face for the past 8 months.

The pediatrician gave us acne cream but it does not work. We are seeing a dermatologist but they can t see us until Jan.","Doctor":"Hi...bumps over face could be a dermoid cyst.

I do not know if the 2 are related. Vitamin A and E are a little higher than normal. Any ideas as to what might cause Allergic Laryngitis would be greatly appreciated.....","Doctor":"Hi.I would taik of proven Ayurveda wisdom as per time tested principles. 'Kapha' Dhatu (i.e. one of the three Humours viz Vata, Pitta, Kapha) is vitiated. In my clinical ayurveda career, Kapha has been balanced by herbals where antiallergenic and antibiotics have not worked. Is natural but little slow. It's harmless.If your child was my patient, I would have recommended Chitrak Haritaki avaleha ( to be licked). It's little bitter being natural but best. Alternatively Amastha, Agastya Haritaki are more palatable. Intra cranial pressure is also released. Ayurveda relates it with Kapha too.Once it starts acting, the intracranial waste mucous will start liquifying and come out. In few weeks the freshness felt by the child will sustain for much longer time. It creates immunity in body too. Main ingradient is chebulic myrobalan and other simple herbals. Total non synthetic.Hope it helps. Medicines are commonly available in India but can be ordered online."},{"Patient":"hello there,,, I recently stopped breast feeding my 10 week old daughter,, she is currently on similac sensitive formula... she is very gassy and uncomfortable and has bowel movements every 3-4 days and now i am starting to get worried... do u think i need to change her formula.... do i need to get soy milk","Doctor":"Hi.If I were your family doctor, I would recommend that she continues with breast milk for some more time. If there's any deficiency in qty of breast milk, mother may eat/ gulp with water, 1/2 to 1 tsp of Cumin seeds daily once or twice. It's natural and harmless. If not interested in breast feeding, pl change formula.For child chebulic myrobalan paste by grinding it on hard surface with drops of water may be given. It's infant friendly, classic Ayurveda wisdom. May give twice.

I am worried! Do I have reason to be if I keep her indoors and clean? What about liquid band aid? Would that help or hinder?","Doctor":"Hi.I  would recommend to apply turmeric mixed in clarified butter and make a paste. Apply it on blister.

It may take few days before it heals properly.Hope it helps.

There is no skin dimpling only slight redness when inflamed.Could it be an infected cyst","Doctor":"Hi...I feel that it is a boil or an abscess which is localized there. He might have a fever too. As of now it will require an antibiotic therapy. I would prefer to use either Amoxycillin Clavulenate or Clindamycin. If it doesn't settle then he might require an incision and drainage.

This always occurs early morning (around 4 - 5am) and lasts about 30 - 60 minutes each time","Doctor":"Hello, gab.xx, Severe lower abdominal pain,nausea, chills and possible fever symptoms are suggestive of some infective process in the abdomen. If you are also experiencing urgency and some diarrhea , we will have to consider the diagnosis of Acute Diverticulitis. An infected \\"Pocket\\" or pouch called diverticulum that arises from the wall of the colon. More common on the left side and lower part of the colon called the sigmoid colon. The condition is more common after the age of 40-45 , but can happen in younger individuals with family history of same. Also, you have to rule out other bacterial infections and you may need to have your stool for culture. If you have been on any antibiotics recently we also have to think of C.Difficile infection. That can be ruled out by testing the stool for Toxin A & B. It can be treated by medications. Viral infection , either Roto virus or Noro virus can cause GI symptoms. Keep the hydration good by drinking electrolyte containing drinks and stay on a bland diet. But you do need tests including blood count(Complete), stool studies and possibly a CT-Scan of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out Diverticulitis. If this is confirmed , you need intravenous antibiotics, fluids, and close observation in a hospital setting.

Thank you for the query. First of all you need to know that as you are on antibiotics right now, any inflammatory disease in the abdomen can give less symptoms than usually. Moreover, WBC can be in normal range if the antibiotics are used. Lower right abdominal can be caused by appendicitis, urinary tract infection, ovarian cyst, pregnancy. Appendicitis should be ruled out at first. As the pain is still present, you should visit your doctor again, have blood tests repeated (WBC and CRP) and abdominal ultrasound.

Does it seem that she is urinating less compared to other days?  What do you mean with irregular breathing? Is it faster than her usual breathing? Does it seem that she is gasping for air? The diarrhea and the fever can make her dehydrated. Severe cases of dehydration can bring about deep and labored breathing.

Frequent burping can be caused by too much air in the digestive tract.

Frequent burping and stomach ache can be signs of Gatroesophageal Reflux Disease or what we call as GERD.

With the available described symptoms, there appears to be possibility of acute gastroenteritis or peptic ulcer disease. Ultrasound imaging is not only advised for pregnancy but also for intraabdominal pain and appendicitis and cholecystitis etc. Presence of curling pain along with abdominal pain suggests the diagnosis. You should remain in touch with your treating doctor and should go for prescribed medications. If your conditions improves then you can stop treatment after 5-7 days.

I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Usually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age.

This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced.

Cord thickness present on left side. What should I do?","Doctor":"HI...there are different suggestions for phimosis and hydrocele...1. For Phimosis - I suggest you ask your doctor whether this can be relieved by a steroid ointment applied at the glans penis with pressure from top to bottom. 95% of the times it will get relieved by this itself. 2. For suspected Hernia -  I suggest you get an ultrasound abdomen done and confirm the diagnosis and go ahead with further management.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor my baby is 4 months old and is completely on formula milk, he keeps making cough type noises through his throat. Sometimes i hear these sounds and sometimes there is no sound as a result i am confused whether he is having flum. I got him checked through my doctor he said that babies do make such flum type noise till the age of 6 months, is he right when he says so?","Doctor":"Hi...by what you quote I feel that it could be congenital airway anomaly. Congenital airway anomaly - this causes noisy breathing (both inspiratory and expiratory noise, actually inspiratory will be more than expiratory noise). But the child will not struggle to breath and there will not be fast breathing and in-drawing of chest wall. The sound will be more heard during sleeping and feeding.This may get better as the kid grows up and usually by 6 months of age.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my baby(girl) is 17 months old she will only take water and some qty of lactogen milk is this sufficint to her health. wat will i do for offer some solid food . if forcebly we will give to her , immediateltly she will omits all the food which was taken","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.I take this opportunity to tell you certain scientific facts and relieve your distress - 1. An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5. I suggest you not to use appetite stimulants on long run as they may cause drowsiness.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hello. My two-months baby was scratched by our indoor cat on her foot. The cut is small and not deep. I sprayed it with a desinfectant and it looks fine for now. The baby was not vaccinatedyet (due tomorrow). Is this dangerous? Should we go see a doctor right away? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi...you say the baby is yet not vaccinated. I suggest you take her to the doctor immediately. It will require immunization with TT. But as the baby is due for her regular DPT vaccination which will have TT in it I suggest you go ahead and give the vaccination to the baby.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My boyfriend had a celiac arterial dissection in June 2010 and before they were able to diagnose it, his spleen was cut off blood supply...so half his spleen is dead. In the last month he has had two stents put in...LAD and Right artery (around the back). He has complained of sharp pains in his spleen area and has described it as feeling like spasms. I don t believe it to be related to the stents because he said they were present before then. Is this a common symptom of having a partially dead spleen?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting your query. Is he getting watery diarrhea/ nausea and vomiting/ frequent urge to use washroom? Is he able to pass stools and flatulence? Is he getting bleeding per rectum? With the available described symptoms, there appears to be possibility of acute gastroenteritis or blockage of stents. Presence of spasmodic pain  suggest the possibility of gastroenteritis. You should consult with internal medicine specialist and should go for thorough check up. presence of abdominal sounds may helps in ruling out possibility of blockage of stents as intra abdominal pathology may be associated with absence of bowel sounds. He should go for ultrasound imaging studies of abdomen along with color doppler for evaluation of blood flow in stents. treatment depends on the diagnosed disease. Meanwhile he should take antispasmodics along with tramadol for relief of pain. take care, Dr. Mayank Bhargava"},{"Patient":"hi, my daughter is about 8 years and every after 1 or 2 months she suffers from stomach problem like vomiting and have intestinal pain. Doctors suggested to do anti tranglutiminase test which has come negative as she had severe vomiting and diarrhea and was not eating wheat for one week.But still she has celiac disease symptoms like short height,very slim body ,bloting, constipation,low heamoglobin, vomiting or diarrhea problem.So doctors suggested to give her gluten free diet for 2 months and check if some change come as i am not willing to do biopsy.But now she is having severe allergy on her body like redness itching and some mosquito bite pimples on her body and then they disappear after 25 min.I dont know whether she has celiac and change of diet has done allergy or its cause of medication during her vomiting problem.","Doctor":"Your doctors are doing the best but allopathic science has its limits here.To my own such patients, I recommend to give some naturals like curcumin, margosa powders and Sugarcandy powder mixed together equally. These have the blood cleaning, anti allergic action with anti infective action on intestines. Works to balance 'vat pitta' vitiation (Ayurveda principle) which causes allergies/ rashes.Deworming by herbals is another tool to be added to regime. Beauty is that these are all harmless with no side effects. No interaction with other drugs.  For the time being Haridra Khand - a coarse powder of herbal ingredients may be started immediately. It may not be so palatable but may be given with honey or water or milk. It's commonly available in India but can be bought online too.Once you give for a week, you ll start realizing benefits.For any further query or any directions, pl write direct question through HCM.Hope its helpful."},{"Patient":"hi my daughter is 1yrs old, and she jus randomly had a nose bleed...not a very heavy flow of blood...when i was younger(but not 1yrs old young) I used to have nose bleeds when it was hot but we have the a/c on so im not sure if its the heat that could be causing her to have the nose bleeds...please help me with any information you can help me with...thank you.","Doctor":"As per Ayurveda principles, Rakta Pitta vitiation is responsible for random nosebleeds which you call heat.For one year old the best n safest bet is to instill one or two drops in nostrils of Durva grass (Bermuda grass) - Cynodon dactylon -extract. 60 mg of Trinkantmani pishti (kaharva pishti - Amber of succinite)) may also be given with honey.These are harmless.Hope it helps.For any further query pl ask through direct question on HCM platform.If you are in India, you can get easily or order online.

She had a bad flu and a sore throat. Even after medication she hasn't stopped breathing normally. We are thinking she has adenoids since her Dr said she had them before. Will she need to have them removed or will she start breathing normally again sometime.","Doctor":"Hi, adenoidectomy is done when the adenoids are so large that there is difficulty in breathing, difficulty in swallowing. As the child grows more than 8 years the size of adenoids starts to decrease by itself. In your case, i think you first need to complete full course of antibiotics and then decide as during infection the symptoms increase due to inflammation of adjoining area.

She has not been molested that we know of and of course they tested her for STD and it was negative. She keeps askin if she stuck somethng inside of her and she always states no. She is very embarrased about it. It leaves foul odor smell on her shorts or pants in the crouch area.","Doctor":"Hi, this is clearly vaginal infection. In my opinion you should give metronidazole for 7 days and doxycycline for 1 day, however for precise dosage exact weight of child should be there.

Breath holding spells occurs when child is crying for any reason like not doing what he wants. Seizures has no relation to crying, it occurs with or without crying. I suggest you to get the child examined once by a doctor. An EEG should be done to rule out seizures. Else, you can make a video of episode and ask on this platform. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, My son, 5 year old, is on Metatop nasal spray (2 puffs in each nostril) every night for about 1.5 months now.

Can asthalin inhaler be given during theday for cough specially when metatop is given (of course only at bedtime)?","Doctor":"Hi, yes asthalin inhaler can be given along with metatop spray.

We have tried Calpol (paracetamol) for temp and corex/wikoryl for cough with not much help. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi, since you are already giving calpol and corex syrup, and still your child has fever and cough. I think that your child probably needs antibiotics. If I was your treating doctor, i would have given syrup moxclav 5 ml three times a day for 3 days. However, since this is a prescription medicine, i advice you to meet the local doctor to confirm the diagnosis. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi just enquiring my 5yr old was complaining of slight stomach pains. We took her to doctor. They did a urine test and found pus. She has no temp or no temp has been detected she is not complaining of it hurting when urinating. We have to go back tomorrow after they analyse the urine. They said they may have to perform a ultra sound. I am worried should I be alarmed like this","Doctor":"Hi, this is not abdominal abscess but this seems to be urinary tract infection. Since, pus cells have been found in urine, therefore a urine culture test and ultrasound kub should be done to know the cause of urinary tract infection. Sometimes, urinary tract infection can present without fever. I hope this will help you.

What is going on with me? I just got my tubes tied 3 weeks ago the doctor had to almost do another c-section on me to do the procedure.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting your query. With the available described symptoms, there appears to be possibility of acute viral gastroenteritis. Presence of diarrhea and neck pain suggest the diagnosis. Myalgia is a prodromal symptom of viral infection. As such there appears to be no correlation between past c-section and tubes ligation. You should consult with internal medicine specialist and should go for thorough check up. You should avoid milk and all milk products. You should take complete antibiotic therapy, probiotics, antispasmodics and muscle relaxants. You should also apply hot soakings in neck for soothing effects.

You have been given wrong information. Since, you are HIV negative so there are maximum chances that he is also HIV negative. To rule out HIV disease, you can do HIV test in child as he is 2 year old. This will clear all your doubts.

Looking at his rectum, it appears mildly beefy red/inflamed and has a single satellite mildly red bump measuring approx 3mm about 1 cm to the right of his rectum. It is very sore to him as this has awakened him from sleep. Putting even routine hydrocortisone on it hurts (per his words). He doesn t have any fever/chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Maybe some mild constipation though. I ve been trying to figure this out on my own. I ve come up with either UC/Up (proctitis) or anal fissure (though cannot actually see it). He has h/o mild intermittent asthma taking flovent seasonally which controls it well. Your thoughts???? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi, by what you quote, it seems that your child probably has anal figure, anal tag or proctitis. Proctitis seems little unlikely as in proctitis inflammation is more, pain is more and sometimes fever and loose stools are also present. In my opinion, proctoscopy should be done to confirm the diagnosis. Sitz bath should be given and local anesthetic cream like lignocaine might help. Take care."},{"Patient":"My toddler has red bumps and his bottom and legs. These bumps have white heads and don t seem to go away. He also has small little red bumps with no heads on his cheeks. The doctor s have prescribed tons of creams and nothing seems to help. However, the bumps on his bottom and legs are new and look different than the ones on his cheeks. Can anyone tell me what this is?","Doctor":"Hi, if you have applied so many creams and still the lesion persists than a skin biopsy of the lesion is must. Skin biopsy will confirm the diagnosis.

You need to give antibiotic like oflox syrup for 5 days and enterogermina ampule (bacillus clausii) once a day for 3 days to increase gut immunity. Also, a stool routine microscopy test should be done.

Some people tell me aggression is a side effect of valproate. Is that true? What can I do to help?","Doctor":"Hi, this doesn't seems to be a side effect of valproic acid.

I have tested for infections and it all have been negative. I am 43 and I am suffering from this pain for 3 years. I have done Laparoscopy , but nothing was wrong. I took two Mintec capsuls 3 times a day. It reduced the pain for a while but then pain has returned. I appreciate your help. Regards, Kerry.","Doctor":"Hello, magh7546, You mention that you have had this pain for three years. I am glad that infection has been ruled out. I suspect that you have had upper GI-X rays and also either a Barium Enema or a colonoscopy to rule out any problems such as gastritis, ulcer or colitis or diverticulosis. If these have been ruled out , you may have Irritable Bowel Syndrome. If you have abdominal bloating, constipation associated with pain , this supports the diagnosis. When you mentioned Mintec did give you some relief , peppermint oil has been helpful in reducing the spasms associted with IBS. Minor heartburn is one of the side effects of peppermint oil capsules. You need to be on a high fiber diet, drink plenty of fluids, relax and excercise regularly.Avoid excess caffeine, alcohol, fatty and greasy foods. If you need , you can take a stool softener daily. If you have stubborn constipation, take Miralax (PEG solution) or similar to get your bowels to move. I want you to make sure that you have had Celiac blood tests and also your Thyroid levels checked. I wish you well."},{"Patient":"My niece just had a full term baby girl.

They have just started treating her for low sodium levels, so my question is what causes low sodium levels in newborns?","Doctor":"Hi, in your case the reason for low sodium appears to be sepsis.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.

But if there is any blood streak in the vomiting or if she develops recurrent diarrhoea then this requires further evaluation.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my baby was born 34 weeks preterm due to abruptive placenta we had to undergo emergency lscs. my baby s heartreate had gone down to 50 in the uterus. doctors said he had seizures after he was born along with many other complications. my baby was kept at ventilator for about six days and after that had fungal infection too. we had to stay at hospital for 40 days. my question is what medical treatment should be done so as to find out whether my baby is fully cured.","Doctor":"Hi...I  have just read through your query. I understand your concern. If the baby is active and feeling well and is free from seizures then you need to wait and hope for the best. There are no specific treatment or tests that can be done in scenario like this to be hundred percent sure about the cure.If the kid is have not having any symptoms at least 6 months then I would suggest doing an EEG to rule out seizures and also I would like to follow up the development of the baby. This is more important than any other specific test.The main issue in such cases would be development which has to be followed up as the kid grows up. other important thing is to make the child seizure free. I hope this helps. I would be glad to help if there is any further query regarding this.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Looking for some insight regarding my 16-year old son. He is 6 0 and weighs 200 pounds. He has a bad habit of lying in front of the television playing Xbox live for hours and hours on end. A few days ago he started complaining of a rapid heart rate, and having a hard time breathing. I took him to the ER, and the doctors said there was nothing physically wrong with him, and that it sounds like he was having a panic attack. It s been a few days, but there has been no improvement. He feels clamy, says he feels hot and cold at the same time, head hurts, nose hurts even though he says it isn t stuffed up, and has been running a slight fever around 100. Not sure if it s some sort of viral infection or what s going on, only that he has been afraid to go to sleep at night because he is scared he won t wake up. Any thoughts? Other than being lazy during the summer, he is a normal healthy kid. But he says he feels out of it, hard time thinking, and has quite a bit of shortness of breath.","Doctor":"Hi... the initial heart rate and palpitation could as well be a panic attack. But the other symptoms which he is now experiencing do not fit into any known clinical picture or clinical syndrome to diagnose any specific condition. You may be right in considering a subtle viral infection. But I strongly feel that it could also be a conversion reaction. I suggest you consult your pediatrician regarding this.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My six month old son has had diarrhoe for about four days . No vomiting but seems to have cramps and seems very uncomfortable and cross . First i thought it was teething but now i think it is a tummy bug. Nappies are wet . I have stopped his solid food and am just giving him formula . Is this ok?","Doctor":"Hi...you need not stop solid food and give only formula.  This seems to be a viral diarrhoea. Once this starts it will be there for 4 to 5 days. Most importantly you should prevent dehydration. Unless the kid is having blood in the motion or green or bilious vomiting are extremely lethargic and having low urine output you need not worry. Regarding diet - only thing which you need to avoid is fruit juices as this might cause osmotic diarrhoea.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"I have a two year old daughter who came home from the nanny today with a really swollen lower lip.

This could be a starting stage of a allergic reaction. I suggest you take her to the nearest Emergency Room as soon as possible. I am suggesting this keeping in mind her previous history of allergic reaction. I suggest you keep an injection of epinephrine at home always and also learn when and how to administer it in case of an emergency.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"HI, my daughter is 1yr old.

Her lower part of the body remains cool but upper part of the body heats up. what symptom this would be?","Doctor":"Hi.... seems to be a viral fever. Whenever there is fever there will be some amount of peripheral vaso constriction which will cause cold peripheries. The Other possibilities area lower ambient temperature and also an impending shock. If the kid is active otherwise and having good urine output you need not worry about shock. But if the kid is dull and lethargic you need to rush to the nearest Emergency Room.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"About a week ago I was trying to get comfortable to go to sleep and as I was turning in bed something kinda like snapped inside my stomach area, I freaked out but didnt think much about it because it didnt hurt much.

Whats wrong with me?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.Something snapping in the abdomen while turning in bed followed by stabbing pain in the upper abdomen in the morning, now the bumps in outer lip of vagina and inside the skin below the rectum, all indicate that there is a septicemia or bacteriamia may be due to an intestinal infection or so. I would advise in such a case you need to be seen by a Doctor to for your vitals and more important are the investigations like Blood -CBC as this may indicate towards the urgencyUrine and stoolUltrasonography / CT scan of the abdomen The treatment:May be broad spectrum antibiotics and regular follow-up and may be admission to the hospital and surgery if required. Better to check up for blood sugar too"},{"Patient":"hi. a week ago i got bad pain in my lower right abdonen, the next morning i woke with pain in my right hip that went around to my back.this has continued for a week now. the pain comes and goes and is worse when im standing or walking. today i have had sharp pains in my left side aswell... im wondering what it could be and what i can do for it or if i should see a doctor? thank you","Doctor":"Hello, hailey, Right lower abdominal pain may indicate inflammation of the Appendix. Especially if you have nausea, vomiting, fever, we have to rule this out. Pain in the right hip area may also indicate radiation of pain from the inflammation or formation of an abscess. If you press on the lower right abdomen when you are lying down , that should be very painful. If that is the case, you should see your doctor or be seen at a medical facility ASAP. The only other thing I can think of is sudden pinched nerve from some activity you did. If the area of the spine or disc is sacral four or five , that could give you right and left sided pain. I wish you well."},{"Patient":"my daughter is 5 and she has had a fever and stomach ache for the past two days. she has had no appetite and some throwing up not much. the no appetite has been for five days and two days ago she was complaining about her head hurting. I live in joplin mo where the tornado was and was trying not to make a trip to the er tonight. pls help","Doctor":"Hi.... by what you quote I feel that your kid might be having a viral illness. Fever without any localising signs like this could be a viral illness or a starting stage of diarrhoea. Even if she is not throwing up because of the pain in the abdomen she might be having a nausea. This is the reason she is not able to eat well. You can give any over the counter antiemetic medication if you have in hand. For fever you can give Paracetamol in the appropriate dose.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"hi doctor, i have a 6 month old baby girl.in a day she is mostly on breast milk and ragi.Two weeks back i started on stage 1 ceralac. for the past 5 days her stool is very hard she does the process with lot of effort. one day she had even bleeding while putting stool.what can be done so that like before her stool is loose.","Doctor":"Hi.... she might be having this constipation because of ragi in her diet. Ragi is very rich in calcium which predisposes to constipation. I suggest you reduce the ragi and her diet and also include papaya and banana in her diet. I do not suggest using laxatives at this tender age as it might cause severe diarrhoea or it can become habit. I also suggest you restrict the milk intake to maximum 400 ml per day till this constipation is relieved.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi. My 10 year old son recently had his blood tests (ordered by his pediatrician, because he s a bit overweight- his weight is 55 kilos). His fasting blood sugar is 5.64 mmol/L, his lipid profile, uric acid, sodium, creatinine and cbc are all normal. His SGPT is slightly elevated at 109 U/L. Is his SGPT result alarming? He is an asthmatic, and drinks vitamin C and Fish oil for Kids everyday.","Doctor":"Hi.... the level of SGPT alone being high without any other associated clinical problems or liver related clinical Symptoms and Signs does not mean anything. I do not think you should worry about it. IF  his other liver function tests are normal except for elevated SGPT like this you need not worry about this.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"HI, I HAVE A FIVE MONTH OLD BABY SHE STARTED REFUSING BOTH BREST MILK N FORMULA SINCE A MONTH....

I FEEL SHE DOESN GET PROPER NUTRITION PLEASE SUGGEST?????","Doctor":"Hi.....At this age according to WHO only exclusive breast feeding is indicated. But as you say the baby is completely refusing milk of any sort,  you can start giving Cerelac stage one rice or Nestum rice stage 1 etc. All are same in calories and energy. Only thing is palatability which is subjective for each kid. Other home-made food options will be - 1. Daal and rice well cooked and made into a porridge along with ghee2. Boiled apple or banana and mashed into a paste.3. Any made cereal porridge preparation with additional ghee added.Remember certain principles like -1. Add one food material / cereal or fruit per week. This will be useful because if he develops vomiting or diarrhoea, we will know what to avoid.2. Add vegetables and fruits made into a paste surely to avoid constipation.3. Do not add too much sugar as it may cause diarrhoea.Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time.

Starting from Yesterday he s had high fever that fluctuates between 38 and 40 dc. He repeatedly lost his normal state of mind and says somethings as if he saw a dream. He has bloody watery stool. I took his stool to the laboratory and diagnosed amoeba cyst and nothing else. My question is that can amoeba alone cause fever in children? Or is there any complication other than amoebasis?","Doctor":"Hi.....amoeba cyst will not cause fever. Only amoeba trophozoites needs to be treated. I feel your kid is having an bacillary dysentery. It requires antibiotics and I would suggest Cefixime. This is a prescription drug and visit your pediatrician regarding this.Losing normal state of mind during high fever could be due to these possibilities - 1. Febrile delirium.2. Febrile encephalopathy3. Meningitis.I suggest you take him to nearest emergency room immediately.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"hello, I noticed my 10 year old had a ring worm like rash on her left shoulder blade about a week ago which I began treating with thuja ointment. On friday she had a sleep over at a friends, and on sunday I noticed her torso was covered with red, raised, swollen itchy marks. Today I noticed that her left nipple was red and a firm pea size lump was sitting behind it. Are these all related or is the breast lump the beginning of puberty?? She has no pubic hair anywhere. Thanks","Doctor":"Hi....with history of sleeping at a friends place and with itchy rash, I would first think about insect bite allergy or bed bug related rash, rather than pubertal changes. The small bud behind nipple could be puberty related, but not the rash.I suggest you consult her pediatrician regarding this.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hello, last night (2:30 AM) I took 300mg of ibuprofen. This borning I breastfed my 7 month baby and right after that his cheecks and nose turned bright red. It s been three hours but the redness has not gone away. There are no other red spots on his body, only his face. Could he be having an alergic reaction? Is there anything I should do? Thank you very much.","Doctor":"Hi..this could be an allergic reaction. But another important point you need to recollect is that if you had fed the baby any cow's milk product recently. This also could present like this. Even cow's milk products in your diet - the cow's milk protein will get secreted in breast milk and can affect the infant like this.My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age. I request you to keep me posted about the recovery of the baby and follow of the case.Regards – Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Dr. my son is 17 months old and since his birth he s been healthy. This morning twice he had loose motion am a bit worried as this is the first time. His two upper and lower grinding teeths are slowly appearing. He hasnt had anything from morning except for two bottles of milk. We live in Colorado and are Indians by origin.","Doctor":"Hi...when the kids start teething - to soothe the sensation of teething they keep what ever they can in the mouth and sometimes the impurities will go in and cause diarrhea. Usually this will be viral diarrhea.Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 25 month old daughter is having cold.

For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (max ceiling dose 500mg) every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.These are prescription drugs and I suggest you get in touch with your pediatrician regarding this.YOU NEED NOT GIVE PEDIALYTE FOR ONE EPISODE OF VOMITING.

These causes are hardly due to bacteria (so antibiotics would not be helpful). Those specific diseases will require specific treatments.

Congenital airway anomaly - this causes noisy breathing (both inspiratory and expiratory noise, actually inspiratory will be more than expiratory noise). But the child will not struggle to breath and there will not be fast breathing and in-drawing of chest wall. The sound will be more heard during sleeping and feeding.2. Wheezing - Here the sound will be predominantly expiratory; the kid will be struggling to breathe, might turn blue and require oxygen and may have chest wall in-drawing.But both are associated with recurrent cough and cold. But these might not always be bacterial infections which require antibiotics and usually are predominantly viral and are self-limiting.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

I gave him a tylenol and put chammomil around the head of his penis. It calmed the redness and pain down and he was able to sleep. This isn't the first time he complained of this, what could this be I am so concerned???Thank you,Momma","Doctor":"Hi,It seems that due to collection of smegma and not cleaining might give rise to some infection on the ring of penis.Clean local part with warm water and apply antibiotic cream locally.Make a habit of cleaning smegma by averting fore skin while giving shower.Ok and take care."},{"Patient":"hi, my son is 4 years old and for the past week he has had an itchy bottom.  it is slightly red with broken skins patches but he now has spots dotted around it and on his bottom cheeks.  ive tried sudacream but its no better.  ive checked for worms but cant see anything.","Doctor":"Hi,It seems that due to friction and perspiration there might be having some skin problem and itching might have produced some infection.Apply triple action cream for few days.Ok and take care."},{"Patient":"If Cefixime(3rd Generation Cepholosporin) Oral suspension has not worked in a 3 year old child, then will it be appropriate to give Azithromycin 200 Syrup? The child is having a fever upto 101 degrees Fahrenheit. A mild dry cough too. Is on Cefixime oral suspension for last 2 days. Have taken Cefixime Oral Suspension even 6 months before due to fever as prescribed by the Paeditrician. Please guide.","Doctor":"Hi...by what you quote (as there are both fever and cough) it seems like a viral illness. Both Cefixime and Azithromycin are antibiotics used for Enteric fever or Typhoid. Cefixime specifically doesn't act for upper respiratory illness like this.I SUGGEST YOU NOT TO USE BOTH CEFIXIME AND AZITHROMYCIN AS THEY ARE ANTIBIOTICS AND ARE NOT INDICATED FOR VIRAL ILLNESS LIKE THIS.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My son is 12 years old. with 50 kg weight. He had pain in abdomen and frequent loose motion 6-7 times a day.

If I were your pediatrician rather than using a combination antibiotic like this I would prefer using Cefixime at 200mg twice a day for 5 days. This is a prescription drug and I suggest you see a pediatrician regarding this.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my daughter aged 1 year 4 months is under treatment for loose motion and doctor priscribed syrup aristogyl and syrup aizylac for five days. today is the fifth day and my duaghter is not well and still passing loose stool. she is 9.5 kg in weight.

I still have to discomfort in the abdomen now and if i sit down to hard i feel it. Do you have any idea what it can be?","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. Such symptoms are most likely caused by urinary tract infection. Intercourse can trigger such infection. Frequent urinating, burning while urinating and lower abdominal pain sometimes radiating to the back are characteristic for this conditions. I suggest you to have urine analysis, blood work and abdominal ultrasound performed. Antibiotics seems necessary. You should also drink more mineral water. Hot baths should ease the pain.

I cleaned out the part that I could see around the outside of the ear canal and it was definately the source of the smell. It smells bad and was very goopy. Could it be an infection?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, it certainly seems like he has an infection in his ear. i would advise you to see a pediatrician/ENT specialist and do a culture of the sticky discharge to see what organism grows. They could also look into his ear with an otoscope and see if there is a hole in his ear drum. Usually bacterial infections are accompanied by pain in the ear, fever and yellowish pus.If he had just a mild amount of brown discharge that was not so smelly, we could have attributed that to ear wax, but lets not take chances in this case.Hope this answers your query"},{"Patient":"hi my name is allison mackey i am online to find what my 13 year old dauther tanya has wrong with her throat her tonsills are red with little ball patchs on and she finds it hard to sawoolow anything she has a frever or somtimes even ends up having hot or cold flushs she also get bads head aches with her throat aswell as a runny or stuffy nose somtimes it makes her feal sick or she does not eat alot because her throat herts her so much so can you please tell me what she might have and if their is more than one what one is the most likely for her and the symptoms she has been getting","Doctor":"Hi Allison, your daughter seems to be having either an EBV infection (infectious mononucleosis) or a Strep throat. Other possibilities which seem less likely are diphtheria and bacteria apart from strep.I would advise you to get a throat swab done for RADT to see if strep bacteria is present. If the RADT is positive, start her on Amoxicillin for 10 days If RADT is negative, she should get a throat C/S done, and an EBV VCA antigen (or a MonoSpot test) to check for mononucleosis.  For her symptomatic relief:1. Warm saline gargles 5 times a day (very good relief with this)2. Lozenges to suck on3.  Warm fluids like soups and porridge to nourish her if she cant take solid food4.

Your child seems to be having multi triggered wheeze (it is too early to label as asthma). If she has cough for so many days like you described, your doctor was right in starting her on these puffs to decrease her cough and improve her quality of life.Fluticasone (flohale) is safe for children >4 years old, and levolin is safe even for infants so nothing to worry. It is much better to give her these puffs than getting unnecessary antibiotics or multiple cough syrups each time. Montek Lc is also safeFew things to keep in mind:1. Use flohale and levolin puffs with a spacer and baby mask to maximise the benefits2. Use them daily and don't skip or stop the puffs once she gets better as the cough will come again if you stop ahead of time3. Maintain an allergy/wheeze diary where you note her symptoms each day, and when you go for checkup 2 months later it will help your doctor decide whether he can reduce or change the medicine. (search asthma diary template in Google images)4. Avoid triggers like smoke, agarbattis, coackroaches, perfumes, face powder, and wash bedsheets, curtains regularly. Do wet mopping and not sweeping especially if your child is around. Clean AC filters once a week.She will most likely outgrow this once she is about 7 to 10 years of age (unless there is a strong family history of wheeze/asthma) , so life long medications will not be needed. We have seen many children requiring flohale or budecort for about two years only. Levolin puffs can be used whenever she has increased cough/fast breathing/wheeze.Follow the above advice correctly and she will do well. Wishing her the best and good health.Regards,Dr. Vaishnavi"},{"Patient":"my child is vomiting.Actually she had stomach pain and fever.our doctor told to give colimex and meftal. now she is telling she is having throat pain.she slept off yesterday night without eating.so i think medicine which i gave gets reacted in vomiting.i gave her bread/oats.she vomits within 20 mins.now what i can give?","Doctor":"Hello.

I went to a doctor today and he said that she had a viral infection but I asked him about her tongue and he said he don t know so I was wondering if you could tell me","Doctor":"HiMost common reasons for tongue with black pigmentation are multivitamin supplements containing iron. So, if you are using it then hold it for few days. It Will improve. Other reasons can be natural pigmentation especially when they have dark complexion, allergic, or bacterial infection.Hopefully it will be of help.Take care"},{"Patient":"My daughter is 3 years old and she was complaining that her clitoris was hurting so I took a look and it seems to be closing up. When she was an infant they told me to put medicine on it and I can t remember what it was called to help spread it. Do you know what it was called and if it s over the counter.","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for posting your query on health care magic. It seems like your daughter is having synechiae, which is when the clitoris fuses around the opening to pee, and can cause urinary infection. The treatment is hydrocortisone cream which you apply once a day in the part where it is fused to the side and around the opening to pee (ask a nurse to show you), once a day for 6 weeks. It is available over the counter. Hope this answers your query."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr. Samuel, I have a friend, that has a grand baby girl in the hospital, with loss of balance and rapid eye movement. they have done an MRI, there is not tumor in the head or stomach, what could be causing this??? the baby just turned 1 yr. and she started about a month ago with the symptoms.","Doctor":"Hi....By what you quote I feel that it could be a acute cerebellitis. This is inflammation of the cerebellum.... This is a part of the brain concerned with balance and smoothening of movements of limbs. The rapid eye movements you are describing is called nystagmus in medical language. These both symptoms exactly fit into acute cerebellitis. This is a self limiting condition and gradually the kid will recover. I am glad that an MRI has already been performed and tumours have been ruled out.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My son accidentally got a hold of the rubbing alcohol.

He doesn t seem lethargic or upset in any way. Should I call emergency back or do you think he s fine?","Doctor":"Hi....as you have already visited the emergency room and the kid has been checked and you have been reassured, I don't think you need to worry about it. I suggest that you keep checking for the red flag signs or danger signs which have been explained to you. As the kid is his normal self now, I don't see any need to get back to the emergency room.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My toddler swallowed a penny we just found out it s been stuck in his esophagus for seveal weeks (Mom was at chemo and when I returned after 3 weeks noticed the toddler was acting funny) Took to ER, did X-ray, found penny and pediatric ER doc did endoscopy with follow-up barium swallow a week later. My question is now 3 days after esophagram - my toddler is fussy again, getting up at night and coughing quite a bit, what is wrong with him now?","Doctor":"Hi....even though the foreign body is removed, sometimes the inflammation caused by it for staying so long can still linger on. The other possibility is that there could be a minor injury at the site of lodgement of the coin and it could have got fibrosed. This could be the reason for the fussy behavior as the pain and feeding difficulty can linger on. I suggest you get the consultation of a pediatric Gastroenrerologist.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My daughter is 4 years old and since she was very young, she has had issues with high fever, stomache aches and vomitting, diarhea, and brochitis/pneumonia. We have been told countless times that it is due to daycare and she will grow out of this constant illness, but she hasn t been in daycare since May and is still very sick. (We go to the doctor almost once a month). I heard of something on the radio about children who are always sick with the same constant problems and how to identify and fix the problem and was wondering if there was any truth to this or do you suggest having another doctor or specialist look at her?","Doctor":"Hi....If the kid is active in between episodes of this illness and the growth and development of the kid is normal otherwise you need not worry. If this is the case, I too agree with your previous doctor who has suggested that it could be due to day care.The kids eventually develop resistance to such trivial infections and they grow out of it.Regards - Dr.Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 17 month old daughter has not been feeling well for a couple of days. She has been running a fever, but it gets exceptionally high anytime she doesn t eat for a period of time, and there is very little that she will eat right now. I have been feeding her yogurt, bananas, baby food, and giving her orange juice. This seems to be keeping it under control. Any other advice?","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time.

Beside going to emergency as it being the primary option on my to do list.","Doctor":"Hi As per your query,your daughter got operated for Appendicular perforation.Appendix got perforated and lead to peritonitis.After Appendicectomy,her abdominal cavity has to be washed with Normal saline to clean the peritoneal collection.Then,a drain has to kept from inside to drain the collected fluid outside.If the drain is not kept,fluid that is collected inside will get infected or pus might not be drained completely. So,because of the infection inside,there is pain,vomiting and fever.As she is having distension in right lower quadrant ,there will be some collection at the right lower quadrant or lower abdomen.There will be mucus in stools due to rectal irritation by the pelvic collection. Adhesions after surgery will lead to abdominal distension,vomiting and constipation. Irritable bowel syndrome does not fit here. Consult your Surgeon immediately and get a Plain x ray abdomen in erect posture to rule out intestinal obstruction due to adhesions and Ultrasound abdomen to rule out any Collection inside abdominal cavity.

I suggest you continue the antibiotic therapy for a total of 10 days which is the appropriate duration of treatment for streptococcal sore throat.

Many of the formula milk can cause hard stools and constipation. A normally growing Active Baby of this age should pass urine at least 6 hours once.

Most likely cause of these symptoms are self limiting viral infections or bacterial infections esp. Streptococcal.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment.

An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5.

If it persist, then visit a dermatologist for proper clinical examination and definitive treatment.Take care"},{"Patient":"my daughter of 15 years ,studying in class X. feeling sudden heat overall body and feeling too tired (specially both hands and legs) , headache... . previous it comes once in a day but now 4-5 times daily. all med test completed including ultrasound..thirode ..LH ( 6.11), FSH 2.54), PRL(8.73). during this hot feeling the BP became 110/74..normally in only 100/60. what may be the reason... doctor cant find any pblm","Doctor":"HiThe reports and BP seems to be fine. The problem can be due to anemia, occult infection, viral illness or stress related. I would recommend you to go for complete blood count and ESR. If normal try to give her symptomatic management. If she doesn't respond and everything seems to be fine on clinical examination, then visit a psychotherapist to rule out conversion disorder.Take care"},{"Patient":"We just noticed my 9 month old daughter has large, red welts when she was having a bath. They appeared over the course of about 30 minutes because I did not see them when she woke from her nap. There is one under her eye and several under her arms, but no fever. She just got PVC13 and flu vaccine yesterday morning. And she hasn t eaten anything new. Could it have been something from my clothing?","Doctor":"HiIt seems to be due to an allergic episode. The reason can be new soap, fabric, baby products, food item, insect bites or aeroallergen.Give her antihistamine such as Chlorpheniramine or fexofenadine for relief along with lactocalamine application on the lesions. Try to find out allergens and avoid them in future.If she doesn't respond or develops breathing difficulty, then visit ER for emergency services.Take care"},{"Patient":"Dear Sir, My name is cavince, I m Malaysian, now we face the big problem about my first baby girl have ulcer on lower lips since new born on 3rd week. We already meet many doctor and do the experiment (the blood is clean from virus, ulcer test result is normal virus as human skin good virus) Finally the doctor also cannot find out what the problem on it. My baby born on 24th April 2011, is normal delivery but on that time had some situation was my placenta failed to take out. My bady feeding well now drink milk around 5oz per feeding.","Doctor":"Hi, welcome to HCM. By what you quote it doesn't seems to be a ulcer. If its a ulcer then the baby must feel pain during feeding. It could be a benign skin lesion. In my opinion, skin biopsy should be done for diagnosis. You can also send some pictures so that diagnosis can be made. I hope this will help you. Take care.

We were outside and i put the baby on a little like bike type thing it wasn t even 1 foot tall. Her feet were almost touching the ground. She was having fun pressing buttons and things and listening to the music. One of the other kids kinda of shouted so i turned around for like 1 second and then the baby was on the ground. She had fallen on her back. And had fell onto grass. She cried constantly for about over 20 minutes. Then her mom came to get her and the second she got to her mom she was a lot better. Stopped crying and everything. The next day the mom told me she was a little fussy last night but was totally fine today. Is the baby going to be okay? I have been just so guilty about it.","Doctor":"Brief answer :Seems normal. No need to worry. Detailed answer :Hi, welcome to HCM. Since, it's a fall from very less height and that too on grass, i don't think that its a serious issue. Also, the child is playing well, there was no loss of consciousness, mouth bleed or seizures, so we can presume that everything is alright. I hope this has helped you. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, for a 2 year old boy that had colics and reflux till he was 1 1/2 year old; after going to the beach-the next day- vomits his breakfast(simple white toasted bread, a boiled egg, a small glass of bongurt(a yogurt-like product)(this is more or less a normal breakfast for him, but usually eats with the above,give or take one, plus a fruit(like a banana) and another protein or carbohydrate or cereal).He went to #2 as soon as he woke up (a bit soft but not really abnormal feces); yesterday he drank seawater(he was enjoying the beach too much) but he also ate some snacks for the first time(the restaurant where we had planed to eat was closed): 1cm of a chicken vienna sausage, and 7 doritos(pieces). After going home(1:30 hours after) he ate a normal dinner. Grandma gave him a bit of chocolate(hersheys milk bar). He asked for his milk bottle (usually milk with nestum cereal)before sleeping-1hour later- but I thought he d eaten too much-his stomach was big) and gave him only 3 ounces of milk without cereal. He went to sleep normally, woke only once at night(this normal 2 to 3 times a week, he likes to come to our bed at 4-5 am). He has no fever, no other symptom, and has only vomited today s food. Gave him 1onz of Pedylite, and some water, he has not vomited them. He seems to be vomiting mostly the egg, but it was not a bad egg and looked allright, I had one too from the same batch and it semt fine. My mother says it might be the seawater, specially since the last time we went to the beach he also vomited (but only one vomit) the next day. He sometimes has gagged a bit when eating boiled eggs(and red meat-but not with chicken or fish-) but this time he had already swallowed the egg, stood up to play(he is very active) during his breakfast, but suddenly looked bad and vomited. Could it be the seawater? If so, why didn t he vomit yesterday? I m alert for any symptoms but so far he s playing normally, being a normal crazy toddler like always.He looks a bit tired but I think it is because he had a busy day yesterday plus the vomit. The last month he weighted almost 30 pounds.He is tall for his age, around 90.(He looks like a 4 year old).","Doctor":"First I would like to appreciate your detailed and beautiful history ! From what you ve posted, the possibility I would think of is a mild stomach bug that he got from the sausage. As you rightly said, seawter would have caused him to puke yesterday itself, and if it was a bad egg he would not have vomited immediately. As he is active and playful, you can be reassured that it is nothing serious.warning signs to  look out for:1. Persistent vomiting > 10 times2. Blood in stools3. High grade fever (Temp >102 F)4. Decreased activity5. Not peeing enough (less than once in 6 hours)6. Not eating or drinking fluidsFor now, i suggest you give him ondansetron if he is still nauseous and vomiting, and some zinc supplements to help with the semi solid stools. There is no need to avoid egg in the future :)Hope this helps and he gets better soon! Feel free to clarify any other doubts you may have."},{"Patient":"My son is 9 months old had croup a couple of days ago and yhis morning woke up coughing and sweating. While he would cough he would cry and than i held him and he went back to sleep. He woke up and seems ok now but Im worried that it maybe something else wrong ie pneumonia or bronchitis. Can you please help.","Doctor":"Hello, I understand your concern. I would like to know if he has any other symptoms such as fever or fast breathing? My suggestion is that you count the number of breaths he is taking in a minute (watch his chest movement up and down for a full minute). If it is more than 50/minute, i suggest you take him to a pediatrician who can listen to his chest for wheezing or other sounds.Watch for the following:1. High fever >102 F2. Fast breathing (>50 breaths per minute)3. Gasping for breath4. Poor feeding or decreased activity5. Wheezy sounds heard when he is breathingIf none of the above are present, it is unlikely that he has pneumonia or bronchiolitis.Nebulised adrenaline helps if he still has croup Hope this helps and he gets better soon!

From your description, the swelling behind his knee seems to be a Bakers cyst, which is a benign swelling that you do not have to worry about (even I have one behind my right knee). Unless it causes severe pain or difficulty walking, it does not require evaluation by an orthopedician. Contact one if he develops either of those.Hope this helps, do feel free to clarify any other doubts you may have."},{"Patient":"I have been having a squeezing feeling in my abdomen , it feels like a rush up to my throat sometimes.

I also been having headaches since I started the synthroid . YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hi. It would be more thyroid gland pressing your esophagus then side effects. You should do neck ultrasound do rule this out. Antiacid medicines can be only helpful. These thyroid medicines can cause such symptoms if you take overdose. So try to see blood tests for t3,t4 and change drug dose if necessary. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"my 8 month old son was diagnosed with Rhinovirus 2 weeks ago.

Is he irritable or playful and happy?4.Has he taken vaccine shots for measles and rubella?A picture of the rash would be very useful in diagnosing his infection.Rhinoviruses produce runny nose and cough, but are not known to produce a rash.Do get back with the above information and we can come to a conclusion."},{"Patient":"my baby boy is uncircumsized and I went to clean it as I was changing his diaper this morning and he experienced pain.

If so, the greyish black colour could be due to paraphimosis in which the foreskin wraps tightly around the penis and decreases blood supply. It is imperative that you see a doctor right away so that he may release it. Hope this helps and he gets better soon!

There is no way she is not hungry. What should I do?","Doctor":"I understand your concern. Right now my thoughts are that she has some oral ulcers or throat pain which makes her scream when you put the bottle in her mouth. Try giving her formula with a cup and spoon, as the spoon will only touch the lip and need not be thrust in like a bottle. If this method doesn't work, I suggest you see a pediatrician because young infants need feeding quite frequently.Warning signs:1. Not peeing atleast once in 6 hours2. Irritability even when you are not trying to feed her3. High fever (Temp > 102F) 4. Refusing to feed even with cup and spoonIf any of the above are present, take her to the pediatrician right away.Hope this helps and she feeds well again.

I shall address the two issues separately.1. Child's breathing problem:I would like to know some more details such as if she has a fever, whether she has fast breathing or just has a blocked nose. Count the number of times she breathes in one minute(count her chest movements in and out for 1 minute). If it is more than 40 per minute, take her to see the baby doctor.How is her feeding? You need not be concerned about her getting typhoid from the mother's breast milk. Typhoid does not spread by breast milk.2. Mother's Typhoid:    I would like to know the antibiotics used for your wife's typhoid treatment and how many days it was given each time. It would help in figuring out why she is having a relapse so many times. Also, is she growing the typhoid organism (S.typhi) in her blood cultures or are they treating her as typhoid based only on the WIDAL test? Kindly enclose the blood test reports if possible. Precautions:1. Mother has to wash her hands well (with soap and water) after going to the toilet, before cooking, before eating and feeding the child as typhoid spreads through feces touching food or water2. Vaccinate your child against Typhoid. A typhoid conjugated vaccine is available which can be given to your childSo please tell whether child has a fever, how her feeding is, if she has fast breathing, your wife's treatment and test reports and we will solve the issue. Hope this helps and they both get better soon."},{"Patient":"Hello, I m writing to inquire about a lump that appeared on my daughter s forhead a week after her birth - twin, c-section birth (her brother has no lumps). The lump started as a small red fleck and grew quickly - now is M&M sized, mushy with a red birthmark. She is 10 months old now and acts normal and falling into place with all the milestones - laughs, smiles and doesn t seem to have any pain. I was told not to worry - it would grow and then shrink around age 2 - my pediatrician seems confident as she said it was a collection of vessels. Should I be worried, what should I watch for, and/or are these lumps common with twin births / C-section? Thanks","Doctor":"Hello, I appreciate your concern. From what you ve described, your pediatrician was absolutely right in saying that it is a collection of vessels, called a 'hemangioma', and is not rare (seen in 5 to 10% of babies). She was also right in saying it shrinks around two to five years of age (50% disappear by 5 years of age and 90% by 9 years).Answers to your questions:1. You need not be worried as complications are very, very rare.2. Watch out for bleeding from the swelling( if she bumps her head), any ulcer-like lesion, and hoarseness of voice or difficulty breathing (which may indicate a hemangioma in her airway)3. These lumps are more common with preterm births, and twins, but have nothing to do with C-section. Hope this helps!"},{"Patient":"My 16 mt old grandchild is exhibiting a fiery red rash on trunk and back of neck with some raised welt like lesions that are very transiet. He doesn t seem to be feeling very well - possibly a low grade fever. Question an allergy bur concerned because of West Nile season etc","Doctor":"Hello, I appreciate your concern. What you are describing seems to be a form of allergy, called urticarial lesions which are raised and welt-like. A viral infection (in view of the fever) is the most likely cause. others could be an allergic reaction to a new food or piece of clothing/bedding (as it is confined only to the shirt area) The rash with West Nile virus will be smaller spots and bumps, which appear after the fever settles, so you need not be concerned.  I would suggest an anti-histamine to help with the rash and itching, it is important that you measure the temperature and give paracetamol if temp crosses 100 F.

He has had 5 episodes this year (they are occurring more often). Long term: Could this be something else? Short term: Should we keep giving him gatorade, or is it making his vomiting worse? It hurts me to see him vomit constantly, but its what he wants.","Doctor":"Hi....I have just read through your query. By what you quote I too feel that your kid is having a cyclical vomiting syndrome. This might get better as the kids grow. Coming to your queries - 1. On long term - sometimes these kids can c=have seizures and you need not worry about as of now. It is only a possibility and if this happens then it can be taken care of.2.

This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put  the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If  still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

I have been monitoring his pulse ox and at times when he is out of control it will drop to the low 80 s and as he starts to calm down it will go back to the low to mid 90 s. There is no history of asthma or any signs of any wheezing, coughing or hyperventilation. Could the low pulse ox indicate that his blood oxygenation is contributing to his moods?","Doctor":"Hi...I feel that he might be having temper tantrums. If low oxygen in the blood is the reason for this he should be anxious and irritable and not throwing tantrums. Tantrums may happen when kids are tired, hungry, or uncomfortable; or because they can't get something (for example, an object or a parent) to do what they want. Learning to deal with frustration is a skill that children gain over time. Tantrums are common during the second year of life, a time when language skills are starting to develop. As language skills improve, tantrums tend to decrease. This is what you can do to avoid or prevent tantrums - 1. Give plenty of positive attention2. Try to give toddlers some control over little things3. Keep off-limits objects out of sight and out of reach4. Distract your child5. Help kids learn new skills and succeed6. Consider the request carefully when your child wants something7. Know your child's limitsRegards – Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"I am having pain in my lower abdomen.

As there was a history of diverticulosis and now having pain abdomen as the symptom, thus following should be your approach:i. At present, it might be a 'gastrointestinal' symptoms [diverticulitis, celiac disease thus you should contact either a general surgeon, gastroenterologist or Gynecologist and if not sure consult your GP who after reviewing your case history and physical examination will refer you to specialist concerned.PS. The most common diagnoses of lower abdominal pain relate to uterine, gonadal, renal, and bladder complications, [less common causes like primary dermatologic and musculoskeletal problems as well as referred pain and neuropathies related to underlying vertebral and spinal cord complications can also occur], so examination is mandatory for further workup and management.2. since the pain is unexplainable thus it is wise to check with your doctor since persistent or chronic pain should be examined to rule out any serious underlying causes.PS.

C/s has nothing to do with white hair.However chebulic myrobalan powder may be given approximately 125 mg with honey daily (its best friend of infants as per Ayurveda classics). Similarly Emblic extract (Indian gooseberry: Phyllanthus emblica) juice one to two fresh drops daily may be given to the baby. Fresh juice extracted everyday at home pl.These two things will show benefits without side effects if its not severe genetic change.Hope it helps.For any further query, pl write direct question."},{"Patient":"My 5 years old son (normal weight) is getting vomiting tendency just after getting up in the morning. Yesterday he was perfectly normal and had normal home food. 10 minutes after drinking some water he is vomiting-which is consisting of mainly water only. He has already vomited 4 times but is still feeling uneasy and nauseating. Please advise.","Doctor":"I understand your concern. Vomiting for one day in a young child is usually due to a mild stomach infection which occurs not only through outside food, but by drinking contaminated water or not washing hands properly before eating. When a child comes to me with vomiting, I suggest they have Ondansetron syrup half an hour before food or drink. Some guidelines you could follow are to give him more of fluids like tender coconut, juice if he feels nauseous on seeing food.Do make sure he washes his hands well before eating and after using the toilet, as children his age tend to touch dirty items and not spend enough time washing hands well. Warning signs you should look out for:1. Persistent vomiting >10 times/day2. Blood in vomit3. High fever Temp>102 F4. Severe headache If any of the above are present, kindly take him to see a pediatrician.Hope this helps. If you have further questions, feel free to ask them. Wishing him a speedy recovery"},{"Patient":"Right after my boyfriend and I were fooling around with each other (we didn t have sex), my stomach began to hurt and then the next day I got my period.

My ovaries have a sudden sharp pain to them, and it I could it feel it make bubbling noises. Is it possible for me to feel a pulse down there? Do I have an infection or something?","Doctor":"Hi. It is hard to say is it infection or something else, but this kind of pain is common at woman. If this is associated with your period then some  dismennorhea must be considered. Infection would present with vaginal discharge and fever.  common causes are also ovarian cysts ruptures and endometriosis so at least pelvic ultrasound should be done to rule this out.Also you need to check your hormone levels too see is there some menstrual disorder."},{"Patient":"Hi, My baby is 21 days old and is having loose motions.He is on top feed.My doctor has asked me to give him enterogermina oral suspension (1/2 bottle twice for 3 days) and Taxim 0 (5ml for 3 days).Are these medicenes/antibiotics fine for such a small baby.","Doctor":"I understand your concerns. Are you also breast feeding him? Usually it is normal for breast fed babies to have some loose stools.If you are breast feeding him, there is no need to give probiotics like Enterogermina. Also, Taxim O is usually started only if they have blood in stools or high fever. These medicines are safe for small babies but if there is no blood in stools, my recommendation is that you can stop the medicines  If top feeds are being given by bottle, I would suggest you change to a cup and spoon or paladai (or gavage feeds) as bottles, even if sterilised well have more chance of harbouring germs. Also check that you are giving the correct dilution of 1 scoop formula in 30 ml water, as overdilution can cause loose stools. Make sure you wash your hands well after cleaning the baby, and before giving feeds. My last recommendation is that you give him rotavirus vaccination from the age of two months, to protect him from rotavirus diarrhea. Warning signs which should make you take him for a review to the pediatrician:1. Blood in stools2. Persistent vomiting3. Poor feeding4. Decreased urination (less than once per 6 hours)5. High fever Temperature >102 FHope this helps. If you have further doubts, please do not hesitate to ask.Wish him a speedy recovery."},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor,My SIL has delivered a collodion baby.

Is this the best drug for him?","Doctor":"DearWelcome to HCMWe understand your concernsI went through your details. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a complex mental health disorder that can affect a child's success in school and with interpersonal relationships. You need to understand the ADHD concept, symptoms and treatment methodologies in order to provide best help to your child. More than medicine, parental and teacher care are essential. Adderall will do fine. If your child is hyperactive, inattentive, or impulsive, it may take a lot of energy to get him or her to listen, finish a task, or sit still. The constant monitoring can be frustrating and exhausting. Sometimes you may feel like your child is running the show. But there are steps you can take to regain control of the situation, while simultaneously helping your child make the most of his or her abilities.While attention deficit disorder is not caused by bad parenting, there are effective parenting strategies that can go a long way to correct problem behaviors.Children with ADD/ADHD need structure, consistency, clear communication, and rewards and consequences for their behavior. They also need lots of love, support, and encouragement.There are many things parents can do to reduce the signs and symptoms of ADD/ADHD without sacrificing the natural energy, playfulness, and sense of wonder unique in every child.I suggest you read articles about ADHD and discuss with the child psychiatrist for management and care.If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.

Pain associated with dark urine can be serious complication. It can be caused by bile duct obstruction which isnt very rare after such procedures.

Cortigen B6 is not useful for vomiting in toddlers. You may give her Domperidone or Ondansetrone for controlling emesis. Also, give an antacid such as digene or ranitidine for gastritis.

Tiredness and grouchy symptoms are not regarded to be part of hyperactivity. Being hyperactive at times is also not hyperactivity.

Mental Retardation generally cannot be treated with the help of medicines. Mental retardation in moderate levels requires proper training and interaction with other normal children.

If the size of penis is small in infants and children, it is advisable to wait till the growth spurt of puberty. Sometimes in children the penis is buried below the pubic or buccal pad of fat and hence it is better to wait for children to grow and then the size of penis should be evaluated to look out for micropenis. The size of an erect penis usually over 2 inches is normal. Anything less than that is called micropenis or microphallus. In children, stretched penis length of less than 1.9cm (3/4 inch) long at birth and can be described as a micropenis.

Remember all those olden days when your mother struggled to make you eat all those vegetables and nutritious menu. Now history repeats itself. The behavior of your child is quite normal. One reason for this is for many “picky eaters” sensory processing plays a big role in their refusal to eat foods. Simply put, if something feels gross in their mouth or on their hands, they aren’t going to eat it.  The fancy therapeutic term we give for this is tactile defensive. I strongly believe that structure and routine around food and meal time is critical to kids eating well. I suggest you to stick to routine. Never ever provide any food or drinks (except water) to the child other than in the structured time. Let the child come and tell you that she is hungry. Let her eat herself. Remove all play items, TV from nearby. Provide her food she likes most. Nutrition can be provided through drinks.

Your 11 year child is feeling low, his stomach hurts and few loose stools, these are symptoms of stomach infection. In my opinion, You should give Oflox-ornidazole tablet two times a day for 3 days.

Detailed answer :A 7 month child may sometimes pass 5 to 6 stools in a day or may pass stools once in 3 to 4 days. This is a normal thing. Since, there is no fever, urine and stool reports are normal, there is no need to give antibiotics. Also, there is no need to change gain plus formula.

Any advice would be welcome.","Doctor":"Brief answer :Seems to be normal. Detailed answer :Hi, welcome to HCM. Child age is only 4 years, a 4 year child doesn't have that much mind to understand whether humping has bad impression. I think she is just playing and it's a habitual thing.

I contracted Trichomoniasis from my girlfriend. So I went to the doctor, had the tests done and was given called metronidazole I believe. From what I noticed everything has cleared up.

It s light pink discharge almost similar to what you d expect to see the first day of your period. I do have pain in my abdomen . Its on either side and the pain is actually quite high up. I haven t had sex in the last month and I m a lesbian so the likely hood of pregnancy does not exist. I am actually driving myself insane thinking about what could be wrong.","Doctor":"First check whether u have taken adequate dosing of metronidazole (about 2g as a single dose) Ur symptoms suggest pelvic inflammatory disease.

How many days per month does she cough or feel breathless?2. How many nights per month does her sleep get disturbed due to above symptoms?3. Does she feel breathless when she runs around or plays with other kids?4. Are the symptoms when there are seasonal changes?5. Is there any family history of asthma or any other sort of allergies like skin allergy etc.?6. Is the cough always associated with fever?If your answer is yes for any of the above questions, your kid might be having viral associated wheezing or multi triggered wheezing and I suggest you meet a paediatric pulmonologist who is near your place.No point in using antibiotics (LIKE CLARITHROMYCIN AND AZITHROMYCIN) every time.

As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4.

Congenital airway anomaly - this causes noisy breathing (both inspiratory and expiratory noise, actually inspiratory will be more than expiratory noise). But the child will not struggle to breath and there will not be fast breathing and in-drawing of chest wall. The sound will be more heard during sleeping and feeding.2. Wheezing - Here the sound will be predominantly expiratory; the kid will be struggling to breathe, might turn blue and require oxygen and may have chest wall in-drawing.But both are associated with recurrent cough and cold.

Detailed answer :A 3 month baby can pass 5 to 6 stools per day and can pass stool only once in 3 to 4 days, both these things are normal and there is no need to give antibiotics in that. In my opinion, you should stop metrogyl as it has no role in diarrhea in 3 month old baby. In my opinion, you should give enterogermina ampule once a day for 3 days. Enterogermina is a prebiotic which is used to increase gut immunity in child. I hope this has helped you. Take care.

NO MALARIA","Doctor":"Brief answer :It indicates infection. Detailed answer :Hi, welcome to HCM. Your child has fever for 4 days and neutrophil count is 64, this indicates infection in child. Since, malaria is negative, you need to do some more investigations like NS1 Antigen test for dengue, typhidot Igm for typhoid. In my opinion, your child will probably need antibiotics based on above reports. I hope this will help you. Take care.

I have suggested moving him to the 20 min away children s hospital.","Doctor":"HI,Welcome to Hcm,Its a difficult neonatal condition which can happen in multiple situations like infection and some not so common conditions. Very fact that baby is needing ventilator and not being able to maintain body temperature suggests that he is not very stable. I agree with you that baby should be in a better Nicu unit. However, baby should be in a clinical condition to be shifted to the hospital and the treating unit is the one who can decide on that. Hope this advice helps.

Thank you chris","Doctor":"HiWelcome to the HCMI understand your concerns but don't worry. Kids are prone to self limiting viral infections in this age group. They just need symptomatic management and plenty of fluids along with healthy diet. It improves over a period of few days. I would recommend you to start her on a probiotic such as enterogermina once daily for next 5 days along with Zinc suspension ( ZnD or Zinconia) once daily for next 14 days. These will help in early recovery and further immunity against similar episodes.Hopefully this will help you.Take care"},{"Patient":"Hello, So my 3yr old son scraped his big toe yesterday, a little bit of skin was pulled back on it, I cleaned the wound and put gauze and tape around it, now what is the best way to keep caring for it?

Detailed answer :Your child scraped his big toe with little skin pulled out indicates that wound is not big.

You can also do spongebath to cool his body. it's just supportive and lots of rest at this point.

Since then she gets recurring abominal pain. 2-I am writing to you from Pakistan and doctors here have been doing a lot of medicinal experimentation on her. I just got a chance to read about her symptoms and they match with Gastritis and post surgery adhesion . 3- She moreover, has been using seretide ( inhaler ) to treat her asthama for around 10 years now. I checked and there are cases reported for seretide causing Gastritis. 4- Her ultrasound has been done here and is clear in all regards. Please advice. Best regards, Iram","Doctor":"Hi, recurring abdominal pain after surgery is common but if it persist and increase then needs to evaluated. Some abscessus or collection can always be cause of pain. Ulstrasound is the best way to see it but also Ct scan of pelvis should be performed. These things I ve mentioned and postoperative adhesions are typical complications which are not caused by surgeon or his experiments. It is always possible and dont blame them for it.  Gastritis can be side effect of seretides, but I would think first of most common causes such as stress, spicy food, alcohol or nonsteroida analgetics. GAstroscopy would reveal the real cause and also can be therapeutic. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"My baby is nearly 8 weeks old but almost since birth he has been breathing rapidly. Usually during the evening but occassionally in the morning too he will begin by panting incredibly rapidly, this gets faster and faster and he gets more and more worked up and is extremely difficult to calm down. Can someone tell me if this is dangerous or normal? And offer advise on how to calm him down or stop him doing this please? Thank you","Doctor":"Hi! Thank you for choosing Healthcare Magic! Congratulations on your new baby! For 2 month old babies, the normal respiratory rate can be as high as 50 breaths per minute. But other than how fast it  is, you must also check if the breathing seems labored and deep. Do you see this while he is calm and asleep or only when he is irritable? When they are crying and fuzzy, breathing can be faster. I would advice that you consult  your doctor. It would be best for him to be examined thoroughly so as not to miss any serious causes of the fast breathing. Also, try to feed the baby upright with his head a little elevated to prevent aspirating the milk to his lungs. Hope this helped you.

The milk requirement increases as he gets older. Have you tried changing the nipple of your feeding bottle? sometimes it is too big or hard? You can try to give small frequent feeds coz maybe he gets full easily. Burp in between feeds to get rid of gas. You can also feed  by demand. How is the weight gain of your baby? this is the best indicator that he gets enough milk and nutrients. If he is gaining well then there's nothing to be worried about. During check up, your doctor will monitor his weight, length and head circumference to make sure he is growing right for his age. Hope I was able to help you. Have a great day.

Child should be regularly counselled by explaining the disease that he may catch by putting finger in mouth.

Asthmatic episodes are triggered by agents from which the child is allergic like dust, cold water etc. You need to identify the allergens and do your best to avoid them.

I saw some red color streaks in his stools and when consulted doctor he advised me to give him taxim o drops 1ml in morning and night. We have given for stool culture test Also. Will this medicine help me cure this problem ?.","Doctor":"Hi...for a 3 month old baby it is very unusual to have blood in the stools due to an infective cause if the baby is exclusively breast fed.If the baby is formula fed and bottle is used then it is possible that it could be an infective diarrhea and antibiotic like Taxim-O might work.If not then the other possibility is cows milk protein intolerance. Antibiotics like Taxim-O will not help in curing this.I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option till 6 months age. I request you to keep me posted about the recovery of the baby and follow of the case.Regards – Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my son was having fever frm last one week.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Meftal-P contains Mefenamic acid which is a NSAID.

Detailed answer :Hi, welcome to HCM. Your child is getting frequent cold for 2 months and now for two days he is pulling his ears, probably he has also developed ear infection. In my opinion, an examination by ENT Specialist should be done and antibiotic like amoxyclav 4 ml three times a day for 3 days should be given. However, since this is a prescription medicine, i advice you to meet the local doctor to confirm the diagnosis. For recurrent cold, you need to follow some precautions like avoid cold drinks, ice creams, avoid fried food from outside, cover mouth while coughing. I hope this will help you. Take care.

Detailed answer :Hi, welcome to HCM. Cypon syrup contains cyproheptadine which is a centrally acting appetizer drug. At 11 months, there is no need to give an appetizer syrup as at 11 months child don't want to eat because of taste problems. Child prefers to eat what tastes betters. In my opinion, you should give multivitamin drops 1 ml PO once a day so that multivitamin deficiency will be corrected. I hope this will help you. Take care.

It was a hard lump, not red and it did not appear to cause her pain when I touched it. By the time I finished the diaper change, the hard lump (which was about 1 x 2 ) had disappeared. Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Brief answer :No need to worry Detailed answer:Hi, welcome to HCM. You have noticed a lump of 1×2 cm which was not red and disappeared with 5 to 6 minutes. In my opinion, this lump was caused by tightened cloth or pressing of skin between clothes which disappeared as soon as the pressure was released. I think that you need not worry about this.

Any viral fever can present with similar symptoms of fever, leg pain, body ache. But If symptoms persists these symptoms are more common in dengue and chikungunya fever.

I have read your question in detail. Redness around perianal region could be due to intestinal infection in which acidic stools are present which causes redness of perianal region. Worm infestation can also lead to perianal redness. In my opinion, you should give albendazole syrup 10 ml at night before sleep and syrup oflox 4 ml three times a day for 3 days. However, since this is a prescription medicine, i advice you to meet the local doctor to confirm the diagnosis. I hope this will help you. Take care.

Pleae help","Doctor":"Brief answer :Nasal block or wheezing episodes Detailed answer :Hi, welcome to HCM. Your child is having only mild cough but has intermittent respiration, this could be due to nasal block or a wheezing episode. In nasal block, sometimes the respiration becomes intermittent as child tries to clear the nose. In wheezing episodes there is difficulty in breathing which causes intermittent breathing. In my opinion, you should start saline nasal drops 1 drop in each nostril three times a day and get the chest examined by a Pediatrician. I hope this will help you. Take care.

Your child is sick for 5 weeks and the thing that you noticed at back of throat  is post nasal drip. In chronic sinusitis or allergic rhinitis continous post nasal drip is common with the child feeling a little low. Since, you have taken a lot of antibiotics, i don't think that you will require it now. You need to investigate the child for sinusitis with X ray of sinus and an examination by ENT Specialist is required. Till then you need to avoid things which aggravate the problem in child.

A tiny drop of pinkish fluid in a 3 year old at the time of stool could be due to the type of food he has eaten.

Bulgy swelling over head in your child seems to be due to falling with trauma on head. In a case of head trauma, if there is loss of consciousness, nose or mouth bleed, seizures then the injury is serious and need immediate neurological assessment. In your case, these things are not present but a boggy swelling is present, in my opinion, there doesn't appear to be damage to brain.

Is his count normal.  Doctor has suggested to give him antibiotic for 6 days","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,I would be also interested to know what TLC is?I am sure its above normal and so rightly the doc has adviced antibiotics. Rest of the values are not to be worried about. She should respond after atleast 2 days of antibiotics goes in. Happy to clear any further doubts. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, my son is 6 month old. When he was 5.5 months, I started giving him cerelac wheat (stage 1). I noticed redness around his mouth after feeding him so I discontinued wheat and tried rice. That did not cause any redness around the mouth. Did he has wheat allergy? Is he in a danger of developing Coeliac disease?","Doctor":"Hi, welcome to HCM. In celiac disease, the child has gluten sensitivity at intestinal region that is at small intestine. I think it's just a coincidence that you have given wheat to child and his mouth near lips became red. I have not seen a single case of celiac disease with this type of history although i have seen many. I think that your child doesn't have celiac disease. If you want to be 100 percent sure than I suggest you to do TTG levels in child, it will clear all your doubts. I hope this has helped you. Take care.

I have read your questions in detail. Some babies are more alert and awakens on slight sound while some babies tend to have deep sleep,both these things are normal in babies so you need not worry about this. Also, the weight gain of baby is good at 3 months which also points that the baby is normal. Semisolid food are usually advised after 6 months in India and in western countries at 5 months, so i don't think that you should give semisolid food at this age. I hope this has helped you.

Viral fever usually lasts for 3 to 4 days. Since, your child has fever for 10 days, a possibility of typhoid fever is very much likely. In my opinion, you should do some blood tests like CBC, typhidot Igm for diagnosis of typhoid. If I was your treating doctor, i would have given cefixime with azithromycin for 5 days. However, since this is a prescription medicine, i advice you to meet the local doctor to confirm the diagnosis. I hope this has helped you. Take care.

Your child has fever for 2 days and now developed a painful swelling behind left year, this appears to be post auricular lymphadenitis. In post auricular lymphadenitis, usually fever is present, sometimes cough also present and the swelling is tender to touch. In my opinion, an antibiotic like cefpodoxime (5 ml= 50 mg concentration) should be given 5 ml three times a day for 3 days, and panadol and neuron should be continued. I hope this has helped you.

Three episodes of fainting which has also led to injury once could be absence seizure or anxiety episodes. In absence seizure, the child has starring look and child usually falls on ground or sits idle without talking, the child doesn't remember anything about the episode.

The paste should be given to baby to lick once or twice a day. This may be continued for two weeks or so.

Modern drugs are good in acute and emergent cases but can't build immunity to resist further cough attacks.

To avoid sticking in throat, may coarsely grind it. It's a routine spice in kitchen and harmless. 1/2 to 1 tsp two to thrice a day suffices. Yes, taste may not be good but see the result yourself.For small babies' constipation chebulic myrobalan (Haritaki) may be found/ rubbed against hard, clean surface (stone etc) by adding few drops of water and small qty of paste may be allowed to be licked by baby. May add pure honey for taste. Give twice or thrice in a day initially and then reduce as per need. It will regulate bowels, detoxify, enhance appetite and digestion. Do not panic if there are initial lose motions.But pl see that in the beginning, if anus is stuck with dry faeces, remove it mechanically by inserting gloved, lubricated small finger of yours.Then you may, if you agree, contact for overall strength of intestines and growth of baby.

Usually it takes few days after appendix removal for the pain to go away. After a week there should be no pain at all. If after that time the pain is still present, either there are some complication after the surgery (like an abscess or wound infection) or it was not the appendix causing your pain.

However there must be some lesion causing bleed shown in vomiting.If it persists, you need to get further investigation of the source of bleeding. Sometimes green vomiting is associated with 'Kapha humour vitiation' also. To stop the bleeding from nose and vomiting give her maximum coconut water. If you can get Naagkeshar (Mesua ferrea) powder, anhydrous alum powder and Prawal Pishti in the ratio of 1 gm + 250 mg + 125 mg approx every eight hrs with honey. This is best haemostatic combo. Even if anyone of the three is available, pl start with that. It's absolutely safe n harmless. It can be found from where to get on the net. As an alternative, Himalya herbal co.'s Styplon tab may also be used but it may not be as quick.Cynodon dactylon or Bermuda grass or Durva grass extract may be instilled in nostrils to stop nose bleed immediately without side effects.

As you have seen yourself that upper GI showed normal.So the problem remains with functioning of digestive system and enzyme secret which is causing mushy stools etc.My recommendation is that non toxic, natural herbal treatment should be given to your child.BAEL fruits pulp (dried) plays an important role in such conditions. If you can get it - nice. Otherwise get online from South East Asian countries esp India. Himalaya herbal co. also has BAEL cap containing BAEL extract. It markets the same globally.Now your small child would not take Capsule. So open/ cut the capsule and pour into a bowel. Mix honey and let the child lick it. Do it twice or thrice.Alternatively if you get BAEL powder (also called Bilv powder) from India, give it at least 1/2 gm with honey twice or thrice a day.After giving for a week or two you may add little (250 mg approx) dry ginger powder also once a day to BAEL powder and if child accepts its taste, continue it for a week more.It will flare the natural enzyme secretions. It is astringent, antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, antispasmodic etc without any toxicity or side effects.BAEL is also called stone apple, wood apple.For any other query pl write direct question.Hope it is helpful."},{"Patient":"hi doc , my 7 year old complaints of stomach ache every alternate day and doesn,t drink milk as it gives her stomach ache. she also doesn t eat or like home cooked foods except khichdi. for school she likes cheese toast and maagi and refuses to eat anything healthy. she has power in her eyes and i am worried about her health please suggest good diet chart for her as i don t want to compromise on her health. she also does nt like nonveg items","Doctor":"If she likes khichdi its very good and you can use your expertise to put leafy contents and other ingredients like tasty Amla powder, calcium etc in small qtys disguising as variety of khichri. Slowly when the taste develops, you may make it a base for adding different things. You may even prepare 'daliya' of wheat looking like khichri and adding dried methi, pudina, dhaniya leaves in it. If you can do, it would be wonderful. Little counseling is required.I also recommend to give her ARVINDASAV (Sandu co. preferred) liquid 5-10 ml + water twice a day. A powder of following should be made and given in 1/4 gm dose with honey twice a day. It will be complete nourishment for her :-Kumarkalyan RAS 1 gm, Prawal Pishti 5 gm, Sitopaladi choorna 30 gm. Grind all these and mix well. It will be sufficient for two months. It will flare her natural desire to eat food too.No side effects. Safe for children.Hope its helpful.For any further query pl consult through direct question."},{"Patient":"Hi. I had laptoscopic appendectomy six weeks ago. Still having mild pain on left side in-between the two left incisions. I had sex with my husband two days ago and have had a huge increase in the pain in that same area. Today the pain seems closer to my bellybutton. I feel no bumps. Is this muscular. Or should I go back to the surgen if it could be more serious. The pain is relieved by laying down flat on my back. Thank you","Doctor":"Hi haley. This can be muscular or intraabdominal lesion as well. If the pain depends on your position then it is probably caused by muscle or skin incision during the surgical procedure. If you have persistant pain which is increasing while touching this area, or is asscoiated with fever and muscle guarding then go to hospital.

Pl guide","Doctor":"Calpol and Ibugesic both can control instant fever. But if it's a repeated process for days together, I do not recommend.For children Bachaturbhadrika chooran is best Ayurveda medicine in India but it won't settle fever immediately.It's wonderful for chronic and repeated fever and associated ailments in children.Harmless, safe, no interaction.

As if normal water is given. If he can lick little honey mixed with pure turmeric, pl give him 8 hrly. Turmeric is tasteless, so no problem.These are safe, no side effects.

What is this problem","Doctor":"It's some kind of allergy or urticaria against some allergens.If allopathic is not settling it, you may go for Ayurveda's simple remedy. If you can get Haridra Khand - a coarse herbal powder - give 1/2 tsp TDS with honey. I don't know where you live and if this is not available start giving him 1/4 tsp pure turmeric powder + little sugarcandy powder+ Neem leaves powder (if available). This mixture of powders may be given with honey every 8 hrs at least. For one to weeks. No side effects.

More fibre etc, today him after he had a BM there was bright red blood & quite a bit... Really worried any advice?? We are making an appointment with his DR tomorrow..","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,The problem that your child is facing is not commonly seen in this age group. Bright red blood and increased quantity is not suggestive of infection alone and I am thinking of a surgical cause a possibility. Most probably due to some injury at the exit point of the stools. You Need to consult doctor at the earliest and you might need to meet a pediatric surgeon too. Wish your child a good health.

He is also passing a lot of gas that smells really bad like a rot in egg. The formula he is on is alimentum which has a bit of and bad smell but I am smelling a different smell other than his milk when he vomits","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,I am sorry to hear about your child's troublesome situation . There is actually no reason why a baby of 3 months should normally vomit like you described. If he is vomiting significantly after every feed , then a surgical problem like some obstruction in the food tract should be thought of especially if he has lost significant amount of weight or not gained weight adequately. But if his weight is good, then the vomiting might not be a significant one. However, if I were your pediatrician and after completely evaluating your son feel that there is a problem, I would refer him to a pediatric surgeon and get ultrasound done. Would advice you to do that. Happy yp clear further doubts.

Ahh new mom!","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,I understand your concern. You seem to be doing very well for a new mom. Infants of this age can sometimes have abnormal sound while crying. Can be due to some secretions in the throat and sometimes mild nose block . But these things usually recovers without any problem and without much treatment.

The condition only goes away when he takes antibiotics, but I do not want him on antibiotics constantly.  He has been tested for allergies and gets allergy shots. This all started 2 years ago when a dr prescribed a nose spray","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Hcm,I can't boil down to a specific problem in your child. However, I get a feeling that you are over treating him probably for something and that's what is causing this issue. Some local applicants in the nose can cause irritation over the skin of the nostril which can cause bleeing at the tip. I would suggest you to consult an ent specialist so that a proper examination of the nose could be done to rule out any local problem.

Its although hard to diagnose such lesions without having a look at it. I however get a feeling it could be a fungal infection especially because its spreading. I suggest you to keep that area as dry as possible that means not to let any wetness like sweat or urine get accumulated. But if she has pain due to friction can apply soothening agent like coconut oil or moisturizer. For a proper diagnosis, better she is seen by a dermatologist. Wish your child a good health.

Multivitamin syrup usually has b complex vitamins which are excreted through urine. In my opinion, your child has stomach infection, and you should do a stool routine microscopy test. Treatment will depend on above reports probably a deworming syrup and antibiotic like oflox will be required for 3 days. I hope this has helped you. Take care.

I was wondering if you could clarify one question since I ve been searching in a lot of sources and can t find the answer. I read that children tend to respond better to chemotherapy than adults, why is this? Isn t supposed to be the other way around considering chemotherapy is a strong treatment and a child s body is still in early development?","Doctor":"Hi, welcome to HCM. Children tend to respond to chemotherapy better than adults because1. Usually cancer is detected earlier in children as compared to adults which are diagnosed at late stages. 2. Exposure of carcinogens is less in childhood as compared to adults like smoking, lead exposure. 3.

Your child is making deep breathing movements for 4 hours after coming from school, one common reason could be that she is worried about something which might have happened in school.

All children have particular likes and dislikes of taste. It may be possible that your child doesn't like taste of ceralac.

A 4 month old baby can pass 5 to 6 semisolid stools in a day, green yellow or golden colour stools are normal in babies at 4 month of age. Most of the diarrhea in babies are viral. You should stop nalidix as there is no need of antibiotics and you have already given it for a long period which is not recommended.

Since your child immunization is complete for age and though the knife was rusted, the scratch and bleeding was little, there is no need of giving tetanus injection. Whenever a wound occurs, there are increased chances of staphylococcal infection so child should be given cover of antibiotics like cloxacillin.

Typhoid fever is contracted by drinking or eating the bacteria in contaminated food or water. People with acute illness can contaminate the surrounding water supply through stool, which contains a high concentration of the bacteria. Contamination of the water supply can, in turn, taint the food supply. The bacteria can survive for weeks in water or dried sewage. So, you need to give purified water to child, avoid eating outside food which may be contaminated. I hope this has helped you. Take care.

I am formula feeding with Similac Sensitive Lactose-free. I also use gripe water a couple times. Should I go to Soy?","Doctor":"You may chose to give anything that suits your baby but if you can get chebulic myrobalan called Haritaki and give its scrub to baby, it will do wonders.If dried stool is stuck in anus, extract it mechanically by inserting your gloved, gelled small finger in anus of child. It will clear the way.Then chebulic myrobalan may be ground against clean, hard, rough stoned object in kitchen etc by adding drops of water and get the extract and give to your baby (simply allow her to lick). May add in honey too. This may be done twice or thrice initially and then once a day. Even if lose stools come initially, do not panic.It's said in Ayurveda that mother may become angry with baby but not the Haritaki. It will increase baby's appetite and digestion also and detoxification will be natural.It's harmless and safe. No need of any other medicines.

Wish you good health.-"},{"Patient":"My 21 month old son s skin get a red raised rash it seems after eating cinnamon toast but we are thinking it was the sugar free syrup? this has also happened with sugar free jelly too. Is there a way to still give Sugar free products without them hurting him? If he gets a rash on his skin what is it doing to him internally? Thanks!","Doctor":"Repeated raised rash on the skin after a certain kind of food suggests that there is some kind of allergen that can't be resisted by individual's immune system. It could be urticaria too.Still want to give the same food? Chances are rashes may double next time or even more next to that. Wisdom is to avoid it. But before quitting that food you should ensure that same  food is culprit. Anti allergics in modern toxic medicine relieves fast but doesn't cure nor does it create immunity.Alternatively Ayurveda has the answer. If you can give pure turmeric powder + Neem leaves + Sugarcandy powder (if not diabetic) in 1:1:1 ratio and give the mixture 1/4 tsp every eight hrs. mixed in honey (again if not diabetic) for a week to two weeks, you will start seeing lesser or no rashes appearing. But the effect comes slowly being natural things.Here sugar candy and honey have different properties. Together these things act as 'Sheet Pittnaashak' as per Ayurveda principles.Beauty of the combo is you may mix any two or all three ingredients. If nothing is available, at least your kitchen will have turmeric of best quality.If honey is not to be given , for diabetes, water may be given but for small child its difficult.In ready made classics of Ayurveda, HARIDRA KHAND is medicine of choice in place of above combo. It's a coarse powder. Give 1/2 tsp TDS if you can get from India or online.I do not find better thing which is natural, harmless, safe, no side effects for such issues. But little slow.Hope it helps your child and it will.In case any further information is needed, pl write direct question."},{"Patient":"My 6 years daughter had a ear enfection first time.Doctor gave the antibiotic and one another medicine.Now she is ok.Doctor told for the X ray of her throat.Now he is tellin for the operation of Adenoid. i am afraid. i don t want to go for operation .Is there any other remedy of it","Doctor":"Well upper respiratory infection seems to have gone chronic. Ear, nose and throat are connected and the infection in one causes trouble in any or both of other organs mostly.Adenoids might have also infected because of ENT infection. Many times these become suppurative too. Adenoids may catch tuberculous infection too.So if doctor has already prescribed antibiotics and response is good, pl continue it or request him to reconsider alternative. I feel antibiotics might not be controlling infection now and surgeon has advised adenoidectomy.If at all need is felt Ayurveda has a remedy called Sarivadi vati, made of polyherbal formulation, to counter such issues where antibiotics fail or immunity is weak. But first priority should be given to correction of acute phase by allopathic medicine.Sarivadi vati helps to remove ear infection and some other issues of throat, nose etc when given with different other herbomineral medicines. It creates immunity also. Similarly Chitrak Haritaki medicine plays a significant role. But all these are slow acting though super safe, no side effects.Contrarily ear infections do not go easily though allopathy may give fast relief every time. It keeps going on. But I am not against Allopathic medicine. It saves life in acute cases.If you agree and feel the need after your attempts at ENT surgeon, may consult by direct question anytime in future.Hope it helps."},{"Patient":"My 3½ yr. old daughter is on day six of illness.

There are some other areas, on her face, that are non-raised and blanchable, small reddish circular. They seem to fade and move a bit. But the area under her eyes is constant and deeper in colour. She has been developing a persistent dry cough and has remained anorexic. She s been running low-grade fevers and remains lethargic.

You may get it world wide in the form of Guduchi capsules. Pour the contents and give to child twice a day with honey.
