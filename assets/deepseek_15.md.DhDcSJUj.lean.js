The sore eye could be due to infection by a virus causing conjunctivitis. She should repeatedly wash her eye with clean water and avoid touching it. Take her to the doctor tomorrow in case she is not having any trouble with vision. Her abdominal pain could be due to parasitic infection whic is very common in this age group. She must undergo some blood tests and stool tests to confirm that.

It occured to me the other day that i only started suffering when my wisdom teeth came through. Could this be a link causing the problem? and if so, will removal then help the problem?","Doctor":"Hello,Do you have any symptoms of an infection?These include redness, swelling, drainage, and pain. Pressure could cause some issues with your equilibrium.  This may affect your balance and give you a motion sickness feeling.An infection that drains could cause an increase in acid content and have gastric disturbances. This could give you a nauseated feeling.Keep in mind if your wisdom teeth have erupted fully, are in function and you are able to keep them clean, you should not have discomfort associated with them. Consider having a dental exam to evaluate the wisdom teeth. An extraction may be recommended if problems are diagnosed.I recommend that you make sure that your blood tests are normal and have a physical if you are due for this. Other systemic problems are more likely to be associated with motion sickness. Your blood sugar level should tested. I hope this has been helpful. Thank you for your inquiry,"},{"Patient":"I had a Dentist appointment and i had a tooth filling this was around 12pm and its 4:04pm now... so i got anestithia (however you spell that) on my right side of my mouth and my jaw was hurting really bad and it still is... but... about one hour ago i took a nap and i think that i bit my tounge (which has anesthisia) and its really swollen and im having this sharp pain whenever i swallow in the right side of my throat... please help me. im scared that when i bit my tounge i did something to myself and its gonna stay swollen :/","Doctor":"Hello,Please do not worry. Biting your tongue or lip is always a risk until the anesthesia wears off. Don't eat or have any extreme temperature liquids until you have a normal sensation and control. Take some antiinflammitory medication and rinse with warm salt water. Call your dentist and make the office aware of your amount of discomfort. Have your dentist take a look if anything worsens or you do not feel better with the antiinflammitory medication such as Tylenol or Motrin. Just make sure that you do not think there is any allergic reaction that may be occurring. Benedryl is recommended and immediate attention required if you have difficulty breathing.There is an injection that can reverse the local anesthesia affects. Ask if your dental office offers this in the future.I hope you will feel better quickly. Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"I have a five yr old granddaughter, who is being raised as a vegetarian, but is living on breads, pasta, sliced cheese and cottage cheese. She sucked a soother till four when the dentist suggested it was doing damage to her teeth and her mouth. I was wondering if she also may have a sensitive palate. What foods could I encourage her to eat?","Doctor":"Hello,I wonder if the soother has caused an open bite? Please look to see if her teeth come together when she bites down. Often, these can put pressure on the upper front teeth causing the teeth and upper arch to move forward. She may then breath through her mouth and dry out her tissue. This can cause soreness. This can result in a tongue habit of pushing against her teeth or tongue thrust. Plaque will dry against the teeth making it harder to remove. Decay and giginivitis will become a concern.Make sure she takes adequate vitamins especially with a restricted diet. Adequate protien is needed. Beans are a good source of protein. Some foods help cleanse such as celery. Avoid high sugars and sticky foods. Avoid high acid content. Some fruits can have high sugar and acid such as orange juice. Do not consume excess.I hope this is helpful. Schedule a visit to an orthodontist or a pedodontist for a full evaluation and recommendations.Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"Hi!

I suspect you have have been exposed to a virus. A bacteria infection may also be a consideration. Try to increase your regular daily dental care routine which should include gentle brushing, flossing and vigorous rinsing. Warm salt water or the rinse of your choice will be acceptable. Keep well hydrated with a proper diet that includes balanced vitamins. As long as your oral symptoms do not worsen and you are feeling better, I wod not be concerned. If discomfort persists, Schefule a dental exam and see your physician for an exam and blood testing. Many systemic diseases have detrimental effects on your oral tissue. Antiinflammitory medication is recommended if you experience discomfort and to assist healing.I thank you for your inquiry and hope you feel better soon."},{"Patient":"i have some kind of whole or gap in my gums located in my left side near the back behind where my wisdom teeth were taken out. recently there has been food getting stuck back there and i dont notice it until i develop a nasty taste in my mouth and my throat will start to feel a little sore. Can you help me with this , do i need to see an ent speacilist","Doctor":"Hello,Once a tooth has been extracted, there is a long period of healing. Depending on the bone lost, there may be a concavity that catches food as it continues to heal. Sometimes tjere is extra tissue which can easily be refuced if there is a flap that catches food. If your socket is infected, you may have a bad taste and drainage from this location. A piece if tooth or bone may be present and needs to be removed. Rinse the area vigorously and clean well. Plan a return visit to your dentist or oral surgeon to evaluate the extraction site if symptoms persist.Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"I had an accident years ago where one of my front two teeth chipped and went into my lip.

I suggest rinsing well with warm salt water and taking antiinflammitory medication such as Tylenol or Advil.Schedule a dental visit for an exam an X-ray. You may have an infected tooth, periodontal disease or a fracture. Sometimes  a deep cleaning can treat inflamed gums and eliminate unhealthy pockets. Antibiotics may be prescribed to help control an infection. Root canals can often allow you to keep a tooth by treating an infection inside the tooth which damaged the nerve. Bone loss can compromise the support of a tooth and can result in loss of a tooth. Is the tooth loose?  Do not put pressure on the tooth. Recent trauma could have caused a fracture of the root. This often can require an extraction. Implants can be planned to replace the root. Your dentist will present a diagnosis and options after a thorough diagnosis.

During the time of trauma, the tooth gets compressed and apply pressure over the nerve endings in the root tip. Nothing to be panic, consult a oral physician and get a rdaiograph done to rule out any tooth infection. Usually the tooth will loose its life after impact. Check the vitality of the tooth. So confirm whether that tooth is milk tooth or permanent, if it is permanent tooth, get it restored with RCT if it is non vital. If it is a milk tooth and infected get it extracted and replace it with a bridge or an implant.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"I ve had very sore gums & mouth ulcers for over a week.

Could the fact I have crowded teeth have done this?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The chipped part can be a hard calculus or fractured tooth piece. This can occur when you apply more pressure on the tooth surface, it can dislodge the calculus or any food debris or if the tooth is decayed and has become weak, at that time it can break.

I suspect, especially with your initial difficulty with healing, that you have some granulomous tissue which could be curettaged out by your dentist. This will assist healing and replace this tissue with healthy tissue.Try to massage the tissue, rinse with warm salt water and if much more sensitive, I suggest scheduling another follow up dental visit .

This is not an alternate treatment to a filling. Sometimes I warn a patient that a filling is very deep and a root canal may be required in the future. If your sptons include swelling or a bubble on the gum, this may be a sign of an infection rather than irritation from the procedure. Other signs of infection include sensitivity to hot, pressure sensitivity and pain that may come and go or be getting worse.

I am very chemically sensitive as I have fibromyagia. Should I have the tooth extracted? Then I will lose my bridge..any solutions to this problem?","Doctor":"Hello,Have you has a follow-up visit with your dentist and discussed your symptoms? I suggest an evaluation with a root canal specialist before considering an extraction. There may have been some sinus reaction to your infection and you need time for this to heal completely. Antibiotics may help improve your  ability to heal. There are surgical endodontist procedures that can treat resistant infections. Removal of the post and core is possible if you have a reaction to the material, but this should all be contained inside the tooth and canal system. There is something wrong if the post is outside of the tooth or root. Look into all possibilities for treatment before disturbing your bridge. Any loss of a tooth under a bridge can cause removal of the bridge or weaken it. Make sure your periodontal condition is sound and you do not have a unrelated sinus infection. I hope this helps and you are able to retain your tooth with comfort.Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"Once in a very great while, out of boredom, I will stick a mirror in my mouth to check out my maxillary teeth.

It is wise to schedule an exam. Uf decay is present, a simple filling is possible if it is small.

The rubber bands are necessary to help tooth movement. noncompliance will extend the time needed to wear braces. Discuss your difficulty with wearing the rubber bands with your orthodontist. There may be an alternative such as a neck apparatus to wear at night that may be an option.If spacing can not be completely closed, there are options such as bonding, veneers, crowns or bridges to close the space. Stabilization after removal of the braces is very important to avoid a relapse. Wear retainers and follow instructions for the best long term result.

By braces you can correct the deep bite and alignment of the teeth so that the esthetics and traumatic bite can be prevented. regarding your medical card, it might not be covering the orthodontic treatment.

Your dentist can evaluate your bite and make a recommendation.You may have an infection in a tooth that needs treatment. See your dentist for an evaluation and necessary x-ray. If you broke a filling, you also need to take care of that to avoid a larger problem. Broken teeth or filling can also be a result of grinding your teeth.Maintain good daily dental care which includes brushing, flossing, and rinsing. Look for sensitivity to temperatures and pressure.

If untreated can lead to destruction of the implant bone connection leading to the problems in the implant. Medical conditions like diabetes and smoking habit will further worsen the condition.

Since you are giving history of previous RCT, it does not look like tooth infection. It can be secondary to deposits around the tooth or it can be secondary to infected residual cyst. Consult a oral physician and get it evaluated. You need to take a radiograph to confirm the diagnosis. If it is a gum infection, then get your teeth cleaned(incision and drainage along with scaling and root planing).If it is because of infected radicular cyst, then get the cyst enucleated.Get the tooth treated as early as possible because if the infection spreads, it can involve bone and result in osteomyelitis.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"I have had a root canal treatment about 1 month ago and it helped as far as pain, but there is something he used(my dentist) that didn t agree with my system..I have fibromyagia and I am very chemically sensitive..don t know if it was the post or sealer but now the tooth must come out..Do i need to be frozen again to have tooth extracted or seeing it is has a root canal I will not need numbing agent??","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.If you need to get a tooth removed, You need to get an injection containing local anesthesia. Since the tooth is root canal treated, it does not mean that that tooth will be numb. While removing the tooth, there will be tearing of the gums and surrounding bone. so there will be pain arising from these structures.

The hole where my tooth is removed is ealling nicely but the bone above it is still fully exposed. Is this normal? Will my gums grow back over the exposed bone? Thanks!","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The exposed bone can be because of the tensed soft tissue over it. During the extraction procedure, if the soft tissue flaps have been approximated under tension, then it can result in exposure(dehiscence) of the bone. If it gets infected, then it can result in osteomyelitis. So consult your oral maxillofacial surgeon and get the bone reduced and induce bleeding and close the wound with flap covering over it with the help of sutures.

If i am your treating doctor, I would have suggeted you to take  anti inflammatory drugs like piroxicam 20mg twice daily on first day and twice daily on next 6 days. You can also take muscle relaxants like chlorzoxazone. You can give hot fomentation over the joints. Do not eat hard things, do not open your mouth too wide. take soft diet.If the problem is not solved by conservative method, then you have to go for surgical treatment.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"My husband has a tooth abscess.

It does happen in some cases due to various factors. Having a crown done post the treatment is very important as the tooth will be brittle once it is dead and has more chances of breakage.Yes ,you can go for retreatment of the tooth followed by the placement of crown on it.Or if you do not want the retreatment ,implant can also be advised.Hope this was useful.Thanks and regards."},{"Patient":"Hi yes my husband has a fake tooth and he has not been to the dentist in quite a while the other dy he tok it out to clean and when h put it back it started to hurt he has a bad taste and he face was getting swallon and he is in realy bad pain he went to the emergency room and they prescribedhim anibiotics and sometn for the pain he has been taking it but it's really not doing anything he is still in pain they did tell him that he had an infeccion he has had an infeccion before and they gave him antibiotcs and the pain went away ,but this time it does notseem to be doing anything, Does this take time?

Gordon Harper,  YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Thanks for using Health Care Magic.Read your query.Metallic taste in the mouth can be due to many etiological factors.Since your aunt is a diabetic ,the medicines used for diabetic can itself induce the metallic taste in the mouth as an adverse effect. * Sometimes common cold, nasal infection or sinusitis are associated with this problem. *Poor oral hygiene, periodontitis often case the metallic taste in mouth.If I had a patient with the similar complaint I would have recommended them to have 'citrus fruits' for next couple of days and maintenance of good oral hygiene. Also maintaining the sugar levels is very important.If the problem still persists, please consult your local doctor for further evaluation and treatment.

I put a mirror in to try and see the roof of my mouth and it does has a blueish purpleish tint, but I presume that, that ids caused from veins.

Do I have nerve damage?","Doctor":"Hello, I went through your query. There might be little bit of cement stuck below your crown. you can go back to your dentist to get it removed easily. For the numbness of your lip, it is unlikely that you have a nerve damage, because nerve damage usually occurs after any kind of surgeries in the mouth. One possibilty is Nickel allergy from the crown(if your crown is made of metal alloy), which usually can cause tingling sensation of tongue or lips. In any case, it is better to visit back your dentist to correct it.Hope you have benefited from the answer."},{"Patient":"I have a pyogenic granuloma on my gum its been there for about 3 years now.

I dont have dental insurance nor do I have any money to get it removed but this is got my whole mouth sore to where I can't eat. On top of all that I have gotten 2 fever blisters on my lip. And my top and bottom gums are really red and they are hurting really bad. What should I do?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.As far as the pyogenic granuloma is concerned, it occurs commonly during pregnancy, but it can also occur secondary to deposits or any irritation.Regarding the blisters on the lip and reddish gums, it is because of the herpes virus infection resulting in herpetic gingivostomatitis.If i am your treating doctor, I would have suggested surgical removal of the pyogenic granuloma but it has a recurence rate of 2-3%.For the herpes virus infection, it is a self limiting infection, but you have to get your teeth cleaned once.

The implant cannot be placed in the root itself. The root piece has to be removed, then the implant has to be placed. If required bone graft has to be placed and the socket should be left for minimum of 6 months for the new bone to form.

Read your query. Thanks for choosing healthcaremagic.U see, the treatment time for orthodontic problems are not the same. It varies from person to person and mostly depends on the severity of the problem. Also it depends on the patient's cooperation for the treatment. For the canine that is out of the arch u need not worry as of now since it can get back to its normal place in the arch at the end of the treatment. Usually canines won't be extracted unless the dentist is left with no other option. Per molars are the ones usually extracted. You will be asked to wear a retainer at the end of the treatment which holds your teeth in the newly positioned place. If those are not worn for the prescribed time there is every chance that the teeth would go back to their abnormal positions.So please have patience as you have waited this long, your treatment might get over in a few months time.

This wisdom tooth also grows crooked and grows into the last molar. I'm now 30 and every 6-8 months since I was 18/19, for two weeks, I suffer with pain, fever, headache and my gum swelling as this wisdom tooth seems to rupture the gum and grow. I can actually see a small part of the wisdom when it breaks the gum. After 2 weeks or so, the gum covers the tooth and the pain goes away.I've seen several dentists over the years who said the wisdom tooth can only be removed via an operation. I'm trying to avoid an operation and over the years I've learned to deal with this occasional pain.It hasn't occurred to me until last night, what if I have the last molar extracted and allowed the wisdom tooth to come out?The molar is perfectly healthy and strong. And I realize the wisdom tooth will grow crooked which may make it useless. Is this an alternative to an operation?I realize its also difficult to voice an opinion without an xray.Looking forward to your answers.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query. I have gone through your query.The swelling or lump can be because of the pericoronal abscess. Nothing to be panic.If i am your treating doctor, i would suggest you to take a radiograph like IOPAR OR RVG to rule out the amount of space available for the wisdom tooth to erupt. If there is no space then the tooth has to be removed. If the wisdom tooth is covered with bone, then it has to be removed by a minor surgical procedure. Since it is a non functional tooth, get the tooth removed, to prevent future complications.Meanwhile i would have suggested to take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin and metronidazole(if you are not allergic).

I am a 27 year old female","Doctor":"thanq for your querythe sensitivity of tooth and the subsequent lymph node swelling you described indicated that the tooth has infected internally and externally may look absolutely fine. visit your dentist and ask for an X-ray in that region and if there are any abnormal changes the further treatment will be done by your doctor.                    there is no need to use prilosec and zantac unless you have gastric ulcers or taking pain killers. dont use the unnecessarily.                  use MUCOPAIN if u have ulcer on tongue, this topical medication is just sufficient. apply it before you take food.                 another cause for feeling of burnt tongue is vitamin deficiency. eat lots of green leafy vegetables and fruits. anemia could also cause burning sensation of tongue. this is seen during your menstrual cycle. so dont worry. make slight changes in your diet."},{"Patient":"helllo i have a 10yr old son he has lost a lot of teeth and i was told by his dentist that he will not develop his adult teeh???this is on the top of his mouth he has 3 big huge spaces.juss 2 nite he lost another tooth in the top bac r these teeth suppose 2 fall out?? now he has 1 more loose tooth and that is at the bottom on the side a lil towards the bac my question is he lossing 2 many teeth n will they come bac??","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The lost teeth or exfoliated teeth might be the milk teeth, the front milk teeth will fall at the age of 6-7 years and the back teeth will fall up to the age of 10-12 years. If there are no permanent teeth inside the bone, then there are no chances of teeth development. To confirm this, you need to consult a oral physician and get a radiograph like OPG to rule out the missing teeth. Yo need to get your son completely examined to rule out ectodermal dysplasia. If the teeth are missing within the bone, then you have to get the missing teeth replaced after the age of 14 with removable appliance. Once the your son completes the age of 18 then you can go for implant supported dentures.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

Consult a oral physician and get a radiograph or CBCT to rule out the pathology. If there is a wisdom tooth with a cyst, then get the cyst enucleated with removal of the wisdom tooth.

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. Even though your treating surgeon might be the best possible person to explain you the reasons, I would presume that the non viability of the intestines could have been due to jeopardizing of the vascular supply of the intestines due to either a vascular cause or due to any kind of pressure over it. Now that they might have excluded any cause for a recurrence of the problem, you had been advised for a reconstruction of the intestines for a normal passage of your stool.

I had a right side molar tooth extraction 3 years ago and then I had recurrent sinusitis. I felt pus coming out of my nostrils and got bad smell of the pus. When that happened I took some antibiotics and it was subsided. It happened a  couple of times. Then in January 2010(after 2 yrs of extraction) I had the pus formation and bad smell and I met an ENT. They took scanning and some other tests and told me that I have to undergo FESS. So I underwent FESS in February. After 35 days of FESS, I had the pus formation again and that time I consulted an Oro Maxilo Facial surgeon . he did many x rays and found out that there is an Oro Antral fistula , which was the cause of the recurrent infection and PUS formation. So I had to undergo cod wel luc surgery and they close the fistula by flap. After 5 months of the surgery now, I again felt some pain over the flap and some blockage of nose. But this time I did not feel pus or bad smell. What comes out of nose is clear mucous. I again met the doctor and he told me that the pain is because of the inflammation on the top layer of flap due to the common sinusitis. He gave me augmentin 625 mg for 5 days. I am worried if the infection will become any serious trouble in future. Should I undergo any checkups again, or to take any medicines? IS the sinusitis I feel now is common?? Will it affect the flap adversely? Please let  me know as early as possible.Thanks doctor.","Doctor":"Thanks for using Health Care Magic.Read your query.Yes, An oro-antral communication is a potential complication of an upper molar extraction.

Take care"},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, I have broken front teeth which got rebalanced recently by a good dentist after they got maltreated by a bad dentist. Aside from that I also have inwards growing teeth, because I have been playing trumpet for a while. The crookedness is causing changes in the way I eat and I cannot put my teeth together anymore. The teeth do not touch correctly anymore and they are now also affecting the balance in my mouth; sometimes my mouth begins watering for no reason and I feel off balance on occasion and nauseous. I read about a solution called invisalign, but there was one dentist from Harvard who had a really big mouth towards me; he refused to treat me unless he got to pull three front teeth etc. He also claimed that I would never be able to handle corrections on my teeth because he had a client who could not adapt his embouchure to an overbite correction and he compared me to that client. He was a pathetic man, claiming invisalign was nothing but a piece of plastic. I simply wish to look- and feel better and am very well trained for resetted embouchures, because my teeth broke more than once, using the Berklee schillinger and zero pressure method. I have also had very good teachers and can adapt to many different situations. But I am looking for a biological solution and not enhancements because I know that the human being is already in balance with itsself, it is supposed to be like that. The human being is supposed to be at peace and balance with itsself and within the comfort zone; doctors can help bring the human being into the comfort zone.","Doctor":"thanq for your query.i can understand that every human being wants to be at peace and balance.but in your case this may not be possible. moreover you have not mentioned your age and gender. as your previous doctor suggested if you want treatment to be done, you have get your teeth removed because your teeth have grown inwards very much that mere uprighting them may not be sufficient to get the required space to move other teeth. the entire procedure will take atleast 1.5-2 years if u keep your doctor's appointments and allow him to do his job. the beginning to the treatment may be painful and u will have to restrict your diet. the dentist from Harvard you were referring to must have explained you all these. so you better tune your mind to all these issues.all the best!!!!"},{"Patient":"I have had my wisdom teeth come in about a 1yr ago..all are threw gums..This summer I visted my dentist and he recommended I have all 4 taken out..my top left wisdom tooth has had a cavity for awile.

I am scared of the pain.","Doctor":"Hello,A broken tooth, left untreated, will continue to decay and abscess. Your choice is to fill , if possible, or proceed with the recommended extraction. Since the tooth is erupted, you will most likely need a Simple extraction.,You may wish to inquire about this cost. Cost is generally higher when you see a specialist such as an oral surgeon. Is the dentist that suggested the wisdom teeth be extracted willing to take this tooth out? This dentist shod already have this X-ray. You need an X-ray or copy of this X-ray to proceed with an extraction or filling if visiting another dentist. If you are up to date with routine exams, your dentist will schedule your procedure for this tooth without another consultation. Start with a phone call to this dentist. Thank you for your inquiry. Do not wait and let the situation get worse. Numbness is not difficult when there is not an out of control infection. Usually it is much easier to get numb on a top tooth."},{"Patient":"My glands are swollen and my gums are swollen and bleeding when brushed.  I have cold like symptoms, achy body, tired, loss of appetite.  Feels like the common cold, with the exception of the bleeding gums.  Glands are so swollen on the outside, they hurt to be touched.  Symptoms began 2 days ago.  Is this strep?  Possibly mono?","Doctor":"hello,Virus and any systemic infection can affect the oral tissue. Realize if your body is under stress your gums will react. Signs of Information Include bleeding and painful gums.Keep well hydrated. Proper nutrition with balanced vitamins are helpful. Make sure to include adequate amounts of vitamin B 12. Continue to practice good daily dental hygiene with gentle techniques for tender gums. Rinse your mouth with warm salt water.Take some anti-inflammatory medication such as Advil  or Tylenol. Antibiotic treatment may be necessary and would require a prescription from your physician. Strep and mono are a definite possibility and can be diagnosed with further testing. See your physician for further diagnosis such as a virus, mono, flu and cold. If your oral symptoms persist, plan a visit to your dentist to evaluate your help. Early Diagnosis with her periodontal conditions will allow treatment with a good prognosis.Thank you for your inquiry.

Is this what is creating my consistent bad breath?","Doctor":"Its good that you are maintaing your oral hygeine. Bad breaths are also caused by carious teeth that either need simple fillings or root canal treatment (rct) or by calculus deposition that won't get resolved by manual brushing or mouth wash. I would suggest that you undergo a thorough dental examination at the earliest.

He said i have to under go a root canal treatment so i have to visit him 4 to 5 sessions and each visit will cost me Rs.600.He also suggested me to have a white cap or a metal cap.Please let me know is it a serious problem because i do not have pus or pain.I just wanted to know that is root canal ok for me at this age and i am very upset because many whom i know told that the root canal treatment will last only 3 years and i have to undergo the same treatment every 3 years. Any alternative please -- something that can solve the problem without root canaling let me know..","Doctor":"Root canal is usually performed when the cavity reaches till the inner most layer of the tooth and affects the vitality of the tooth. I will advise that you get a second opinion from another dentist to confirm that the decay is extensive enough for a root canal. If you really do need a root canal, then unfortunately there is no other alternative. It is not true that it will last only 3 years. Many factors affect the success of a root canal procedure. If you have enough remaining tooth structure and if the procedure is performed properly, the root canal can last many years."},{"Patient":"hello im a dental lab technician 3 weeks ago i cut myself witha  duplicate of a denture, it is a copy of acrylic of the one the patient actually wears and it is made of  an impression of the original denture, i trully fear getting any blood borne disease!!! im so anxious havent been sleeping, my muscles hurt, i feel nauseous, and my appetite has lowered.. i do suffer from hypocondria... risk?","Doctor":"Hello,Proper disinfecting techniques should be used by the laboratory and the dental office before sending you dental lab cases.  It is unlikely that a patient blood borne disease has been transmitted to you. Some contamination may have entered your bloodstream from being cut from your tools or laboratory materials. You may have an infected cut due to poor healing. How deep was your cut? Did you clean out the cut sufficiently?Take some anti-inflammatory medication such as Tylenol or Motrin in. Check for signs of inflammation around the cut such as swelling, redness, or any type of drainage. Use some antibacterial medication and keep the area clean. See your physician if you continue to experience symptoms. You may need a prescription antibiotic. You can have simple blood tests performed to put your mind at ease.Thank you for your inquiry. I understand your concern because you do not know how the materials were handled prior to arriving at your lab or the history of the patient. You can always call the dental office to explain your concern and ask for some information on the particular patient.

Lately I haven't developed any new blisters but the inside of my gum line is still raw. A couple of days ago I developed a grape sized lump on my jaw bone just under my right ear lobe. It's very hard and doesn't move like a lymph node would. It's quite painful to the touch and the pain is moving to my ear without be felt at all. I've been quite fatigued for several weeks with bad headaches and my back aches and almost burns. I'm not sure if this related but it started around the same time. Luckily I haven't developed a fever so far.","Doctor":"Hello,You may be experiencing signs of a spreading infection related to a tooth. Have you had a recent dental exam? I suggest taking an x-ray of that side of your mouth and checking for any active dental infections. Your history of blisters are possible from a virus, allergic reaction or even a fistula draining from an infection. Often a bubble will form on the gum and drain. The pressure builds up and the bubble reappears. If it does not drain pressure will build up. Often systemic effects can give you symptoms. Try to take some anti-inflammatory medication such as Tylenol or Advil.  Your dentist will prescribe a prescription antibiotic if necessary. Dental infections Can often be treated with a root canal or extraction. There are periodontal conditions that can cause infection as well. A growth or tumor cannot be ruled out. Wisdom teeth can appear as a hard lump in this location.Consider having a physical with routine blood testing. This will give you a complete diagnosis and allow proper treatment to be determined.  Your multiple symptoms raise a concern of a systemic infection. Maintain a proper diet with balanced vitamins, keep well hydrated and practice good daily dental hygiene. Warm salt water rinses may send your gums.Thank you for your inquiry. Your full medical and dental history will be important to discuss with your physician and dentist. I hope you find my suggestions useful."},{"Patient":"I had a root canal two weeks ago after throbbing/hot and cold sensitivity and chewing pain in molar#3. 3 days later, the chewing pain came back and was still throbbing.

In the past 6 month-1 year my gums have bled slightly, it has now gotton worse and today my gums feel very inlamed and sore to touch. I brush regular and try to look after my teeth as much as possible, i think i have gingivitis and i am terrified that i will suffer from tooth loss! help!","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The reason for the bleeding as you said, it is because of the gum infection secondary to deposit. How much ever we clean there are certain areas where the brush will not be able to reach and once the debris becomes hard, it cannot be cleaned or removed by brush. At that time, you need to get your teeth cleaned by consulting a dentist. Forget about the bad experience about your previous dentist and consult another good dentist and get your teeth treated. If you neglect and prolong the treatment then your teeth might become loose secondary to bone loss and you might lose teeth.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"I had a crown prep and a root canal during the last two weeks.  When the dentist gave me a novocain shot I felt a huge shock.  I have had pain in my jaw ever since.  I feel it in my ear, below my ear, in my chin.  Is this from the shot?  When will it go away?  It's been a week now.  The pain is less but it's still driving me crazy.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The pain can be because of the injection. While injecting the novocaine, the trauma cause at the site of injection, the muscle fibres or nerve can result in pain. Usually it will go after a week to 10 days. Nothing to be panic, take a pain killer, do saline gargling 3-4times daily. If the pain does not subside, then consult a oral physician to rule out other causes of pain below the ear like TMJ disorders.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"I have a blister like structure behind my wisdom tooth, on my gums. It is painful, and is sensitive to touch. The pain and sensitivity extends beyond the structure, and includes sensitivity in the jaw region and also in the throat, near the structure. What is it and what should I do?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The blister behind your wisdom tooth can be a pericoronal abscess or it can be a mucocele.The pericoronal abscess occurs secondary to the gum infection around the wisdom tooth and deposits around the wisdom tooth.The mucocele can occur secondary to any trauma like biting over the gums from opposing tooth or tooth brush trauma. Consult a  oral physician and get it evaluated.If I am your treating doctor, If i diagnose it as pericoronal abscess i would have prescribed a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin 500mg and metronidazole 400mg tid for 5 days (if you are not allergic). Then i would have suggested to go for aperculectomy or extraction of wisdom tooth.If it is a mucocele i would have suggested you to get it treated by surgical excision.

The bleeding in the oral cavity could be because of the gum infection, or any cuts in the oral cavity or pulp polyp or any bleeding disorders like idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Consult a oral physician and get these things ruled out. Get a complete blood investigation along with INR to rule out the bleeding disorders.If any gum infection then get your teeth cleaned and use topical gum astringents like stolin gum paint.if pulp polyp is there then get it root canal treated.If bleeding disorder is there then consult a general physician.The chest pain is not related to bleeding gums. Consult a general physician for this.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"I had a root canal done two years ago and after that my teeth seemed to be fine.

Your teeth may not line up well and cause uneven wear which can create sharp edges, sensitive teeth and risk fracture. Certain teeth such as canines have very pointed edges. Enamel can be resized with reshaping and reduce sharp edges. Other options include bonding or porcelain veneers. Braces will move your teeth into better alignment and usually proves esthetics.Schedule a routine exam with X-rays and your dentist will discuss options to best address your concerns. Schecule a visit with an orthodontist if you are interested in braces.Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"I am having problems with my permanent retainer on my lower 4 front teeth I have really bad build up of tater on the back but now 2 of my teeth in the front are going black between them and along the gums. I would like to know if this can be handled with a cleaning or if it s more serious?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The black discoloration can be because of the stains secondary to coffee or tea or smoke. The other possible cause is decay of the teeth.Consult a oral physician and get it evaluated. If it is stains then cleaning of the teeth will solve the problem. If it is decayed teeth, then it has to be restored with tooth color restorative material.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"My husband thought a crown was cracked. He went to an emergency dentist yesterday, had xrays taken, a good cleaning. Xrays were negative, no cracks, cavities, etc. Was given antibiotics and rinse. He was up all night because the pain was horrible and throbbing. Went to regular dentist today, more xrays which revealed nothing. Was given pain pills that aren\`t working. There is obviously something very wrong. He\`s ready to get the tooth pulled. Any theories, or suggestions for pain relief? Applied extra strength Orajel over the weekend which made the pain worse.","Doctor":"Hello,I would suggest reducing the bite on the crown as a first step to evaluate if this gives any relief.  An older crown may have decay underneath the crown which is not visible on X-ray, but has caused an abscess. A new crown can also have an abscess underneath the crown. Treatment options include a root canal. Some root fractures are difficult to diagnosis with X-rays. Consult a root canal specialist if the tooth already has a root canal or you want another evaluation and testing of the nerve health.More details involving the crown placement and dental history with X-rays would allow me to give a more detailed response. I suggest a combination of Tylenol and Advil taken at regular intervals for relief of severe pain. Orajel can burn the tissue. Antibiotics are usually prescribed for infections and can take more than 24 hours to be effective. Sometimes a different antibiotic is necessary to treat a resistant infection. Are there periodontal conditions to be concerned about? Was there an event that made your husband think the crown was cracked?I am glad to assist further and thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"my two-year old's teeth are bleeding a little at night and when we brush them in the morning. He cries when we brush (even with the soft brush and even with a swab), but does not bleed during the day. He has been crying when he eats things that are crispy and he points to his back molars, but we have never had bleeding when he has gotten new teeth in the past. What would be causing this? Teething?","Doctor":"Hello,Teething is possible since teeth need to fully erupt. Cold is helpful.  Make sure nails are trimmed to avoid cutting gums with fingers placed in the mouth. Check that teeth are bright white and all discoloration can be removed. If any concerns, schedule a dental exam to rule out decay. Enamel can erode if your baby sleeps  with a bottle . Remember, only water in a bottle at night. Infections are possible. Do your best to keep the teeth clean and remove plaque. Inflamed gums can be sensitive. Consider a dental cleaning. It is possible to have tartar in young children.Thank you for your inquiry.

If you do not get it restored, the infection can spread to the root tip and the surrounding bone and result in pain, swelling, limited mouth opening.

The changes with inflamed tissue may appear very dark. Trauma to an area with dried blood or hematoma may appear dark in color. Different pigmentations in tissue can be normal such as a nevi or a change of tissue color can indicate concern requiring a biopsy to evaluate for a melanoma. An amalgam tattoo can occur with removal of older filings.I suggest rinsing the area with warm salt water. Maintain a soft diet, gentle daily dental care, stay hydrated and avoid acidic or spicy foods. Continue to monitor  the area noting size, shape, texture and discomfort. A clinical diagnosis by your dentist will put your mind at ease. Your dentist would determine if a biopsy is needed to determine pathology of a suspicious lesion. As long as the area is healing and not showing abrupt changes, there is most likely less need for concern. Make sure you discuss your concern with dentist at your next dental visit.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you find my comments helpful."},{"Patient":"Hello.I arrived last night from the night shift and hit my teeth with the toothbrush against my lower teeth (ie, between teeth and gum just at the gumline ... it has now bled!) and now I'm afraid that the  tooth dies. Can that happen through the hit, or was he too weak? Have you ever heard of such a case? Or one probably, even had?How should I proceed further and not allowing it to die? (wanted to scrub the chewing surfaces), and then slipped and hit it! Is it very bad? I dont want my tooth to become dark and dead.. :( And the dentist aren\`t open here.","Doctor":"Thanks for using Health Care Magic.Read your query.The impact of the tooth brush trauma will not usually lead to the tooth to be dead , though it may have caused the gums to get bruised and cause the bleeding .Relax, and do not try to hurt it more . Do salt water gargling. Application of a oral topical gel will help relieve the symptoms.Once the dentist office opens you can have it reviewed.Hope this was useful.Thanks and regards."},{"Patient":"About 4 months ago I had a filling done in my tooth. It was very sensitive for weeks and I even went back although the dentist said it looked fine when he saw it. Eventually the sensitivity went away. Then about 3 weeks ago my gum next to the filled tooth started shedding.. like if I'd burnt the inside of my mouth. I assumed it must have been something I ate, but now three weeks later it is an open space that I can actually feel my tooth through. There is no pain, but because of the holidays I haven't been able to get into the dentist. Will be trying to get in tomorrow, but I'm hoping someone here can give me an idea of what I'm looking at...","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The space in between teeth can be secondary to the loss of supporting bone because of the gum infection. The other possible cause can be a fractured or broken filling or decay in between two teeth. Consult a oral physician and get it evaluated. You need to take a radiograph to rule out any bone loss and tooth infection. If there is a gum infection, you need to get the teeth cleaned(scaling and root planing with graft placement).If there is tooth infection, it has to be treated with RCT and crown.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"When I bite down on my tooth it feels like it's numb, but I also get this tender pain. It kind of feels like how it would feel if a dentist froze it. I'm just wondering what may be wrong with my tooth? This has been going on for a few weeks now, but I do not have the money to have it taken care of. Is my issue serious?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The numbness in the teeth can be because of the nerve injury(neuropraxia) secondary to the pressure on the nerve by the impacted wisdom tooth or any cyst or benign tumor. Consult a oral physician and get a radiograph done to rule out these pathologies, later based on the cause we can treat accordingly.If I am your treating doctor, I would have suggested you to take capsule neurobion(multi vitamin supplement) which helps in nerve regeneration. Regarding your financial issue, you can go to a educational institute which is attached with a dental hospital, where you can get the treatment and radiographs for free or at a nominal price. I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here... I believe I have acid reflux which is affecting my gums and teeth.  I am scheduled to have eight teeth and tori's removed this wednesday.  Do you see a problem having the oral surgery done?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.In acid reflux the teeth will get damaged secondary to the acid attack on the teeth resulting in erosion of the teeth. If sufficient tooth structure is there, then we can save the teeth by doing RCT. If the tooth structure is not there then it has to be removed.The teeth can be removed and tori can also be removed but the antibiotics and analgesics should be of lower dose since this will cause gastric irritation and may cause vomiting and heart burn or gastric pain. Even the pain killers prescribed after the surgical procedure can worsen the acid reflux. So be careful and take precautions like antacids at regular intervals before the medications prescribed after surgery.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"I had a carotid body tumor removed in 2007. It was cancer. Currently have lession on gum (comes and goes), dentist can not determine if this is from tooth problem or sinsus. Is this possibly a spreadof orginal cancer.  Also had breast cancer L 1997and R 2003.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The lesion on gums can be a parulis or a pyogenic granuloma or peripheral oscifying fibroma. Consult a oral physician and get it examined completely and get a radiograph done to rule out any tooth infection.If it is a tooth infection, it can be treated with RCT or extraction.If it is a pyogenic granuloma or peripheral osscifying fibroma, then it can be surgically removed. The chances of spread of cancer to this region is less but it can occur. Based on your description of the lesion, it is difficult to give a diagnosis and treatment plan, if you can upload the images of the lesion, we can give a exact diagnosis and treatment plan.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"just got a filling on saturday and the same tooth started hurting yesterday and the pain got worst by 11 pm. I had some chocolate last night as well. Is it normal to hurt after getting a filling or was it the chocolate or something else? I took an advile 500mg pain realiver 3 hours ago and it went away.our health queries right now ?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The pain after the filling can be because of two reasons,The first reason could be a decay involving the pulp and over that restoration has been done. This can cause severe pain in the tooth.The second cause could be any high points or extra filling material over the chewing surface. Consult your dentist and get these two things ruled out. You need to take a radiograph to see the extent of decay. If the decay is involving pulp, then the previous filling has to be removed and it should be restored with RCT. If there is high points then, it has to be reduced. The pain killers will work for 3-4 hours, after that again the pain will come. So consult the dentist immediately.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"hi. I have like a stomach ache. But its not normal its like an aching/stining in my middle stomach. I have had this before and it is usually when i eat lots of junk foor. I ussually throw up. I was wondering if there is anything i can do for it","Doctor":"Hello, These all symptoms due to acidity.

She has seen several dentist and specialist who stated nothing was wrong with her gums.  She was told to have a saliva test which showed many types of bacteria.

The other possibility can be a thick gingivocrevicular fluid, but it is harmless, it wont trouble you. Consult a good oral physician and get it evaluated. Take a radiograph of the teeth to rule out any tooth or gum infection. If there is gum or tooth infection, then it has to be treated with scaling and RCT respectively. Meanwhile do saline gargling.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"I have a very bad toothache and i took two tremadol 50 mg about an hour ago the pain didnt go so about 15 mintes ago i took two 500mg of co-codamal, the pain is still there slightly. I looked online before i took them and on everything i went on said it was ok to take them together. would there be any major side effects later, or in the morning?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The severe tooth ache can be because of the tooth infection secondary to decay. Consult a oral physician first and later you can start with these medicines. The tramadol is narcotic analgesics, it works well for the tooth pain. But it is an adictive drug. Cocodamol is a combination of codiene and paracetamol, which is again a narcotic analgesic. You can take only one of these two tablets not both, because they both belong to same group of drugs and carryout same function.Even after taking this pain will come back once you stop these medicines, so we need to treat the cause. So get the tooth treated with RCT or extraction. If I am your treating doctor, i would have prescribed a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin 500mg and metronidazole 400mg tid for 5 days (if you are not allergic) for the tooth infection along with the analgesics..I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"About three weeks ago I had a cavity refilled.

Taking tylenol and applying an icepack do make the pain go away, until the tylenol has worn off.  I am a known tooth grinder, but can this pain be all muscle related from the grinding?  I have switched to soft foods to help eliminate more chewing than neccessary.  The pain is the worst at night.  And I definately wake up right at the 4 hour mark when the tylenol has worn off.  My dentist is not in for another day, which will make it 5 days with the pain.  I am worried that there might be something more than just muscle issues from grinding.

Often, this will involve four premolars. Sometimes this choice will create a flatter facial profile. As an adult, you do not have the advantage of guiding growth of the jaw to increase space.

Ask your orthodontist what options are available that do not involve tooth removal. Your dentist will advise you on the expected results and you can compare the outcomes to make an informed decision.

Think of other irritants such as congestion or snoring which when leading to mouth breathing may cause tissue irritation.Expect improvement in seven days and do not be alarmed If symptoms are  not increasing. It may take longer than four days to heal. Consult your dentist or oral surgeon if area persists.Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"im 20 yrs old...i brush my teeth twice a day...bt my mouth stinks after meal or when im starving...specialil after i drink milk this happens...the bad smell comes from my throat...sometimes even though i clen my mouth this happens.pls help me...thanks","Doctor":"1.     Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The bad breath could be because of the deposits over the teeth causing gum infection. Or it can be because of the pus discharge secondary to gum or tooth infection or any respiratory tract infection like sinusitis or gastrointestinal disorders. Consult a oral physician and get yourself examined to rule out these conditions.if it is gum infection get the teeth cleaned once and maintain oral hygiene after that. You can use mouth wash.if it is tooth infection get the tooth restored.If it is respiratory tract infection consult a pulmonologost and gastro enterologist if it is a gastrointestinal disorder.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Hi my 10 month old son has woken up with what looks like bleeding gums along his 2 front teeth. i have put a cold compress on them and this helped temporarily. after about 5 min of crawling around they start bleeding again. this has been going on for about an hour now. what do i do","Doctor":"Hello,I do not think you need to panic. Evaluate the amount of bleeding and inspect the area. There may have been some trauma or additional teeth starting to erupt. Applying gentle pressure with gauze can help decrease bleeding. Cold is fine.Consult your physician or dentist if any other symptoms raise concern.Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"my mom is having pain in mouth for 10 days .she couldnot sleep wit mouth closed due to pain . today i saw about 8 swelling with maximum diameter around 0.5 cm on posterior 1/3 of her tongue in the region of circumvalate papilae.is it infection or allergy due to erythromycin she took 10 days bach or any specific lesion . can u please guide us sir regarding further evalvation and treatment","Doctor":"Hello,Taking anti-inflammatory medication or anti-histamine can help reduce swelling and offer relief. One Advil and one Tylenol can be very effective for pain relief and offer anti-inflammatory benefits. Benadryl is a beneficial anti-histamine that helps with reducing allergic reactions. I recommend warm salt water rinsing, stay hydrated and avoiding irritants. Practice good oral daily hygiene including gently brushing the tongue. A tongue coating and tongue soreness can indicate a fungal infection. This can be a reaction to recent antibiotic treatment. An anti-fungal prescription medication can be required to treat an oral yeast infection.Severe swelling with risk of breathing difficulties should be treated at an emergency room. Followup advice will be provided to assist you on which doctor to consult.I would need more information including a complete dental and medical history. I suggest consulting the doctor that prescribed the erthyromycin and report all occurrences. What was the condition that this medication was prescribed for? Consult a dentist to examine the tongue if this condition does not improve or worsens. Your dentist can treat an oral yeast infection with Nystatin. Prescrition rinses with a combination of medications can often be prescribed.Thank you for your inquiry. I am glad to assist you further."},{"Patient":"my mother is suffering from achalasia disease related to food pipe which doctor i have to concern in hospital means in which department","Doctor":"Hi..

Is it compulsory to first go through root canaling? How many days crown requires to straighten teeth.?I am preferring this instead of braces because already I have gone through that 5 years ago.It was that dentist's fault as he didn't created gap for pushing teeth back.He should have taken 2 or 4 teeth out,as I was having jaw size smaller than teeth.So through that process it was pushed back a little but not aligned with the lower teeth.My teeth hence somehow looks as if they are standing forward while smiling.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The mal aligned teeth cannot be corrected by just putting a crown. Ideally the mal alignment has to be treated with braces. If you are going to get a crown to correct this it is a wrong decision. The problem will not be solved by the crown.The root canal treatment has to be done before putting a crown because if the get infected in future, whole procedure has to be repeated so prophylactically.I would suggest not to go for crown, rather you get braces.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"I've just gotten my wisdom teeth removed today (4 of them).

I was fine for a couple of days then on the 29th Jan. I started feeling some tenderness around tooth. This escalated to soreness in upper and lower gum/jaw area on side of filing. Went to dentist on Feb 1st and he told me everything looked fine and to take Advil for pain and wait and see. Pain got worse and it was dificult to open mouth or eat. Went back on Feb. 3rd, dentist had a look and I was told there was an infection. I am now taking Amoxicillin. Dentist said I probably chewed on that side while I was still frozen(which I didn't). What are your thoughts. Does this happen easily and often?","Doctor":"Thanks for using Health Care Magic. Read your query. Pain in the filled tooth continuosly and increase in swelling can be probably due to the presence of underlying infection in the last tooth. Amoxicillin can be continued as adviced.

Mobility can indicate a fracture or infection. Monitor and report your symptoms to your dentist. Take some anti-inflammatory medication such as tylenol or advil to reduce discomfort from the initial possible discomfort due to the dental procedure. Cold sensitivity is less of a concern and time may reduce sensitivity. Check that filling did not chip or crack.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you will start to feel better soon."},{"Patient":"I had my wisdom teeth removed about 3 months ago. Lately the (healed) spots where my bottom two teeth were have been sore. Last night I noticed something hard and white protruding from the surface of one of the spots. Thinking it was just a bone fragment, I tried digging it out..  It seems too big, and deep to be a bone fragment, and I couldn't get it to budge in the slightest. It doesn't hurt (only the gums around it), and feels just like bone. Utterly confused.","Doctor":"Hello,Healing often occurs months after an extraction. Bone can become more prominent as the tissue heals and shrinks around the extraction area. Possibilities most likely include either a fractured piece of bone or root remaining that would act like a splinter causing inflammation around the tooth or trauma to the tissue at the extraction area. If the piece is large or deep, this may explain your experience. Consult your dentist and obtain an X-ray for a diagnosis. Rinsing the with warm salt water and keeping away from the area while sticking to a softer diet will give the area a chance to heal if trauma is the cause of your discomfort. Tylenol or Advil can reduce inflammation. Try not to irritate the area further and if symptoms persist or worsen, consult your dentist for treatment recommendations.Hope this is helpful and you feel better soon. Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"hi, i have just had my very back right tooth taken out and im now suffering from terrible vertigo, which started the same night, I had had a small filling in it, but then had to visit the emergency dentist (due to pain) i was given antibiotics and the tooth was drilled through to start off a root canal, I have been in constant and have three abcesses (treated with antiobiotics) since october, I choose not to have but to have it out and put an end to it, I had it out  on  the 13th Jan and im still not right.

Infected teeth require an extraction or completed root canal therapy. Presctiption antibiotics may be necessary to control the spread of infection. Take anti-inflammatory medication to help your level of discomfort. A combination action of Tylenol and Advil is very effective. Your body reacts to medications and may require different types if you have resistant infections or have delayed treatment.Complications from an extraction will require a return visit for evaluation and possible medication placed in the extraction site.Thank you for your inquiry. Plan a dental visit to complete all treatment and eliminate active infections as soon as possible.

You must be careful of the percentage of peroxide used. You can continue the Pro Health one or two times a day. Try to take some anti-inflammatory medication such as tylenol or Advil. Practice proper daily hygiene including gently brushing your tongue. Proper nutrition with balanced vitamins especially vitamin B12 is suggested. Keep well hydrated.Dry mouth can cause these symptoms especially after waking up if you have congestion or snore. Fungal infections such as oral thrush can cause the symptoms especially with your discomfort associated with the tongue. A prescription for an anti-fungal medication such as Nystatin would be prescribed by your dentist with this diagnosis. Changes in your health or medications taken can cause an imbalance in your oral environment. Your medical and dental history are important to determine possible causes.

You may notice inflamed tissue in a line next to where your upper and lower teeth meet. Congestion, mouth breathing or snoring may cause a dry mouth and make tissue more sensitive. Other conditions can include a broken tooth or growth. Schedule a routine dental exam and discuss this concern with your dentist. A night guard can help control a grinding habit.

Your dental plan may provide a list of local dentists that participate in your plan.  You should contact your carrier and find out information on your dental plan. Most dental plans cover a high percentage or all costs with your initial diagnostic visit. You will need to determine a treatment plan.

Please type your query here...i need serious help trying to find out why my teeth are all going at once?i never had a cavity or any problem with my mouth until i was like 19..im 23 now &basically all my top teeth seem to b getting ready to fall right out.ive been doing daily rituals cleaning&caring for my mouth.seems like theres no end in sight.a few days ago a top front tooth split horizontally and then i swallowed the whole thing.my stomachs been hurting,but no signs of blood..?how is it possible thati could have such extreme tooth decay&loss in such a short time? thanks,rachel","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The problem you are facing with looks like you are suffering from acute necrotising ulcerative periodontitis(ANUG). It will not be associated with any other causes but the teeth will become loose and exfoliates. The decay can be because of the improper oral hygiene or secondary to any systemic conditions that affect the salivary secretion(xerostomia). Consult a oral physician and get these conditions ruled out. If it is because of the ANUG then get the teeth cleaned and we can place graft(bone like material) if needed. The decayed teeth can be restored with silver amalgam or composites. If it is pulpallly involved, then it can be treated with RCT. I hope my answer will help you, Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi there My partner tells me that I have a 'slimy' mouth.

What do I do?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.Nothing to be panic, usually when the permanent tooth erupts the milk tooth starts shaking and exfoliates. The split tooth or remaining tooth piece will fall down by its own.

I received 4 shots of Septocaine.  After the fourth shot, I felt like I was passing out.  My heart was racing, etc.  I don't believe I ever lost consciousness, but I was unable to respond, feeling very \\"heavy,\\" needing oxygen, etc. for 45 minutes.  During this time, the dentist gave me an epipen (in case I was allergic to anything) and monitored my oxygen, pulse (around 100), and heartrate (which far exceeded my normal low level of around 100/60).  Finally, they brought me to the ER where I came back around.  I was diagnosed with a vasal response.  Upon my research, I'm led to believe that my response was more due to receiving too much anesthesia.  Opinion?","Doctor":"Dear User,Thanks for using health care magic.You are right in saying that your side effects are due to excessive use of local anesthetic dose. With the use local anesthetics (includes septocaine) cardiac side effects are the most commonly encountered in general practice and they may occur to minimal possible dose but more frequently present in higher dose.What they call vagal syncope is one of the cardiac side effects of local anesthetic and can occur in any individual irrespective of the prescribed dose.All the symptoms you mentioned n your query \\"heart palpitations, heaviness and high heart rate\\" can present due to septocaine.'Hope I have answered your query.

For my project, I am testing to see which mouthwash is the most effective on killing oral bacteria. I am testing Listerine, Scope, and Hydrogen Peroxide. My hypothesis is that Listerine will be the most effective because it contains an Antiseptic. Do you agree with my hypothesis? Why or why not? What ingredients are needed to potentially kill bacteria? To test my hypothesis, I am obtaining 10 samples from the back of a person’s tongue and growing them on petri dishes. Then, after waiting for about 24 hours, I will add 1ml each of Scope mouthwash using a dropper into 3 petri dishes with bacteria. I will do the same using Listerine and Hydrogen Peroxide. I will compare each dish with the one that has not received any mouthwash, and obtain my results. Should I have the person brush their teeth before I obtain the sample, rinse with water, or just plainly obtain the sample? Do you have any suggestions on improving my project?

This trauma will cause swelling. In general you don not have to worry. Initial placement of ice is helpful to limit swelling. Tylenol, at the appropriate dose, can reduce inflammation. Warm salt water rinses and benzocaine gels can help provide some relief. Help your daughter avoid the area and maintain a soft diet. Normal sensation should have returned to her mouth.Inform your dentist of this condition. Consider completing less dental treatment in a visit, so there is less numbness afterwards. A follow-up visit will be needed if condition seems to be getting worse rather than slowly improving. Time to heal will usually be all that is needed.Thank you for your inquiry.

I guess you are having nausea due to hydrocodone which could cause nausea during initial one to two weeks of treatment.

The oral surgeon has put it back and attached (splinted) it with other teeth so that it will not be disturbed during healing process.

You can take ant-inflammatory medication and make sure to stay well hydrated with balanced vitamins. Vitamin B12 is helpful to assist healing. Rinse with warm salt water. Request an additional prescription rinse with a combination of nystatin, pain and anti-inflammatory medication.Consider having a simple blood test to check your organs and systemic function if the condition persists.

Anti-inflammatory medication can help your treat your discomfort. A prescription rinse with an anesthetic could be requested. Your symptoms should resolve, but increased inflammation is common while braces are on your teeth. Accelerate your professional cleaning schedule to every three months instead of six months.Call your orthodontist and report your level of discomfort.

All seems well, except for a very small, hard white bump on the inner gum area at the extraction site. It's extremely hard, almost like a piece of tooth. I'm wondering if it's an abscess or some type of infection.","Doctor":"Hello,This may be part of the normal healing process as the gum becomes firmer during the healing process. You may feel a bony edge not noticeable before the extraction. If the area is hard and flexible, it may be a piece of tooth or more likely a small section of thin bone. If you have the sensation of a splinter and irritated tissue, you may need to have the dentist remove the remaining hard structure. Continue to monitor the area and rinse well. Return to your dentist for a follow-up visit if you continue to be concerned with the healing process. Total healing will start from the bottom by a blood clot forming and continue healing for weeks to months. You may continue to be aware of changes. If the area develops severe pain 3-4 days after the extraction, be concerned about a dry socket and call your dentist for an appointment.Thank you for your inquiry.

Consult a oral physician and get it evaluated. If there is pulpal involvement and any infection in the root tip, get the tooth treated with root canal treatment. If it is not involving pulp then you can change the restorative material to calcium hydroxide base with zinc oxide eugenol temporary cement. After that wait for 21 days, if you develop pain in this period, get the tooth treated with RCT. If you dont get pain, then get the tooth restored with composite.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"I have an area of my upper left gum where there is a dark purple and red spot running from the base of the gum up to the very top.

Consult a oral physician and get it evaluated. It can also occur secondary to any bleeding disorder like thrombocytopenic purpura.You need to get a complete blood investigation along with BT, CT, and INR to rule out bleeding disorder.If it is a hematoma it will heal or reduce by its own.

The sensitivity seems already to have dissipated but not even 15 minutes after leaving the surgery I was getting electric type feelings down the tooth under the area of filling, similar in sensation to biting on tinfoil. This happens when any form of suction is applied to the tooth. That can be sucking in the area of the tooth or my tongue running by it and creating a mild vacuum. It's not relieved by pain killers.

More time may be needed to allow your body to heal. Try to take some anti-inflammatory medication such as Advil and Tylenol. If you are experiencing a great deal of discomfort take a combination of two Advil and two Tylenol at regular intervals. Rinse your mouth often with an antiseptic or warm salt water. Keep well hydrated and make sure you do not have any deficiencies in your diet or vitamins. Take some vitamin B12.  Change your toothbrush and make sure you are properly cleaning your TMJ splint. Inspect your appliance for any damage or buildup such as plaque and tartar. Have your dentist inspect the appliance and assist you in cleaning it if needed.There is a possibility that you now have an oral yeast infection. Acidophilus may help prevent this.

If the frequency has changed and you notice larger spacing, a visit to the orthodontist could be considered to close the spaces and improve your bite with braces. Another concern is your periodontal condition which involves your gums and bone.  Increased spacing can indicate tooth movement due to loss of bone. You would need to consult a periodontist.

The MRI is indicated for soft tissue lesion. It wont give a picture of bone involvement. If there is a bony involvement by the tumor, it will not be displayed in MRI so CT is the better option. Contrast CT is indicated to find out any spread of tumors(metastasis) and to find out the extent of the lesion. You can go for either CT or PETCT Rather than MRI.

I am a 24 years old male from with eye sight of +2 on left and +1.75 Thanks & Regards, Tajinder Singh","Doctor":"Hello sir, thanks for consulting HCM. Infection of your tooth does not affect vision or eyesight in any manner. It is a misconception that tooth infection affects eyesight. from the complaints that you have mentioned, it suggests that your wisdom tooth is infected. Removal of the tooth at the earliest is suggested. Kindly consult your nearest dentist and undergo extraction after getting a radiograph of the tooth alongwith antibiotics to treat infection. Get well soon"},{"Patient":"I have pain in one of my tooth only when I drink water or after eating my meals, yesterday I went to my dentist and he told me that my new teeth was a little high but the pain will go away soon. But did not give me anything for the pain I am suffering, what can I take for the pain. Thanks a lot for your answer!","Doctor":"Hello,Dental pain can be treated with anti-inflammatory medication such as Tylenol and Advil. Try to take two Tylenol and two Advil at regular intervals if your pain is severe.If you have had recent dental treatment, you may need your bite adjusted. You refer to a new tooth as being high, so I am concerned that the pain is related to your bite and the high spot should be reduced to relieve your pain. I suggest contacting your dentist to ask this question.What is your age and do you having teeth that are erupting in your mouth? Your bite may be affected as the continue to erupt. I would still recommend that you take anti-inflammatory medication while this occurs. Rinse your mouth with warm salt water and maintain good daily dental care.I am glad to help you further if you provide me more details about your teeth. Please try my suggestions and I hope you will feel better soon. Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"Due to problem of swelling & pain in over a side teeth ,I used Amoxicillin 500  TDS for three days .it subsided , but again erupted after two days . should I again continue  Amoxicillin 500  or take Amoxicillin 500  +CV.

Yes definitely you can start with stolin gum astringent and amoxicillin.  But this swelling and pain can not just subscide with medications.

But now the tooth on the bottom left right next to the wisdom tooth that was removed is still hurting when i bite down. It feels like it shifted if that makes sense. Is that normal to be hurting still","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The pain after 2weeks of extraction is not common. The pain can be because of any sharp bony margin left during tooth removal or any infection in the next tooth.Consult a oral physician and get a radiograph done to rule the infection or any bony sharp edges. If there are sharp edges, then you can get it reduced. If there is infection in the next tooth, then get that tooth treated with RCT.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Hello my name is joseph, lately my gums have been bleeding and hurting when I brush them.

Consult a oral physician and get these things ruled out. Get a complete blood investigation along with INR to rule out the bleeding disorders.If there is any gum infection then get your teeth cleaned and use topical gum astringents like stolin gum paint.if pulp polyp is there then get it root canal treated.If bleeding disorder is there then consult a general physician.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Hello  i'm  Abdul Hamid. 65  years  old,  male.

Gasrtic disturbances affect the oral environment as well. Many  medications cause the side effect of a dry mouth. Try to get your blood pressure under control and balance your over all health to a steady state. Give your body a chance to adjust. Keep well hydrated and drink a great deal of water. Nutrition correct for your medical history should be a primary concern. Vitamin B12 can be helpful. Avoid irritants such as alcohol, smoking, acidic and spicy foods. Rinse with warm salt water. Try to use dental products designed for a dry mouth. You will be able to find gum, toothpaste, rinse and sprays.Make sure that you have a recent dental exam. An increase in decay can be anotherside effect. Your plaque and saliva consistency can change which makes keeping your mouth clean more difficult. Brush your tongue. Your dentist will check for an oral yeast infection and treat with the prescription NyStatin if necessary.Thank you for your inquiry.

Kindly get the dot examined at the earliest. As for the bad breath, try cleaning your tongue with a good brush, rinsing after every meal, brushing at night, and using Chlorhexidine mouthwash (0.2%- diluted at 1:1 solution)."},{"Patient":"For the last 3 days I've been having sharp pain in my left ovary (or what it seems like).I am 27 y.o. my mentruation is due sometime next week however this doesn't feel like the normal dull, achy pains, it's more of a sharp pain, especially when I sit down.

Consider mentioning this to both your physician and dentist at your routine visits. Most likely this condition is of no great concern. Monitor for changes.Stay well hydrated and make sure that you do not have any vitamin deficiencies or imbalances.A clinical exam of the condition would provide the best diagnosis. There can be certain conditions such as a vascular malformation, deposits on vessels restricting bllod flow, tumor or cyst.

Could you please give me a suggestion of what can be done to get back my smile?","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for consulting with healthcaremagic. As you are mentioning that many of your teeth are missing and now the rest are decaued or broken, it looks that you might be having a defect in enamel of dentin of the tooth, these are the component of tooth structure. In this case just treating the decayed teeth is not the solution, you have to get an OPG done of your jaw, which will show the cause of this,  then get the rest teeth restored with topical flouride application on the teeth and then at the end get a full mouth rehabilitation, means get crowns on the remaining teeth.Hope it will help you."},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with HSV-1 and this time, after two rounds of my acyclovir I have swollen, red gums and my gums have spots of pus between my teeth and my gums will just start bleeding for no reason.

FYI I had my teeth cleaned less than six months ago and there was no sign of gum disease.","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for consulting with healthcaremagic. This kind of symptoms of gums occur in cases of herpetic gingivostomatitis. It occurs in cases of HSV infection only. You should continue with your medications as it is a self limiting disease, and heal within 10-14 days. Even you should start with a pain killer for pain and maintain proper oral hygiene.  But if it does not heal after that also then you have to visit a good dentist for proper examination amd investigation.

BTW,She's a G6PD-deficient baby. Pls help.","Doctor":"Hello,I suggest that you count her teeth. If she does not have ten on top and ten on the bottom, she may have molars erupting. Typical teething pain is nothing to worry about. Cold will help and there are teething rings designed that can be chilled in your freezer. Children's Tylenol at the correct age appropriate dose is suggested to relieve discomfort. Consider that not all decay is visible to the naked eye. A dental visit should be considered if condition continues.Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 5 years & six months old. Last week we saw a new teeth growing at the back of one of her lower milk teeth. i took her to clinic and they moved it out. but the new one is  not at the right place. so waht would u advice me to do to make it grow in a proper place. thanks","Doctor":"Hello,Often the lower front adult teeth erupt behind the primary teeth. The position will change as the teeth fully erupt. The jaw continues to grow as the teeth are developing. Children can have an early orthodontic consult with a specialist for evaluation for the need of braces. There are interceptive treatments that include placement of a bar to guide bone growth or retainers to guide teeth. The orthodontist will advise and keep your child on a recall for the best timing of placing braces if needed. In general, braces are not placed until the primary teeth are gone and adult teeth are present. I am glad that you are aware of your child's tooth development. You should plan on routine visits with your dentist for your child. I monitor tooth development and eruption sequence for my younger patients. When I see misalignments, I will suggest an early visit to the orthodontist.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope my explanation is helpful to you."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here... hi I had one cavity filling at the dentist a week ago and i am having ear and jaw pain (pain on just my left side from the filling but my ear and jaw hurt the worst just around the area where i had the filling done! I had white caps instead of the silver filling.  Do you know why I have this pain?","Doctor":"Thank you for your query.Pain/sensitivity after filling usually goes away within few days, due to blocking of dentinal tubules within few days after filling. Please specify the pain is radiating towards the jaws or is in localized areas near tooth?"},{"Patient":"Hello, I got my 2 bottom wisdom tooth taken out about 3 and a half days ago. My left side is just sore but my right has a slight pain. I've kind of been using my tounge to just feel the hole but not using it to go deep in the hole. Also my right side hole is bigger than the right and it's bleeding lightweight. Do you think I have a dry socket? P.S. I smoked but I was careful and did it out of my nose instead.","Doctor":"Thank you for your query,Complete healing of extraction socket takes about 3-4 weeks to completely heal. Please do not disturb your socket when it is healing. The extraction is just like a wound in your body and if you keep disturbing the wound it will not heal, same way let the socket heal natural way, by feeling the hole you are disturbing the clot formation and subsequent healing.Dry socket is usually formed when the clot formation is disturbed which leads to pain, soreness and foul smell in the mouth. P.S. During smoking also when you inhale the smoke it reduces the moisture content in the mouth which may lead to dry socket."},{"Patient":"Hello, my name is Dawn. This is my story.I have been feeling dizzy, weak, and have had severe pains mainly on my left side for over a month now. The pain runs from my head into my neck and chest, down my arm and into my hand. At first the pains were on and off recently they are constant. I have seen every doctor imaginable. Cardiologist did EKG and ECG and said my heart is fine. PCP thought it was an ear infection but ENT said i don't have an ear infection. Neurologist suspected pinched nerve in neck but C-spine x-ray was normal. He sent me for a MRI of head without contrast. I will get those results tomorrow when I go in for my follow up appt. However, I had my test results sent to cardiologist and he had stated the results were nothing to worry over. My Gyn did extensive bw ( lupus, thyroid, etc. ) and my WBC was elevated. She sated that that does indicate an infection. Oral surgeon said I have an infection from an impacted wisdom tooth located on the lower left side of my mouth. The tooth is embedded in the mandibular nerve. He put me on Cipro 500mg bid. He stated he wants to clear the infection prior to surgery. I have been only on the antibiotic 2 days but I am still having the uncomfortable pressure and pains (especially in my chest). My question is can the infection from the tooth have travelled through my bloodstream and infected my chest? Would the infection have been able to be suspected on the echocardiogram?

I appreciate any advise or knowledge on the subject.","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for consulting with healthcaremagic. According to your history it looks that this infected tooth might have caused the infection. Yes infection in tooth causes general health problem, but it is very very rare.

As u suggested of being nervy that is being stressed u might be grinding or clenching the teeth, which puts a lot of pressure on the TMJ and can cause dislocation of the soft cushion or disc between the ball and socket also the Presence of osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis in the TMJ can cause a person to tighten facial and jaw muscles or clench the teeth.

I have tried therabreath products tongue scrapers I have no cavities my tonsils look fine. I do have a stuffy nose often but when my nose isn't stuffed up I still have bad breath and my tongue is white","Doctor":"Hello,You will need to evaluate your sinus area. Post nasal drip can cause a very acidic oral environment and symptoms such as you are describing. You may breath through your mouth at night. This dries out the plaque and causes a coating on your tongue. Increase your oral hygiene as this type of plaque is very sticky and difficult to remove. Maintain good daily oral care and keep up with routine dental exams. Stay hydrated. Balanced vitamins are important for overall health as well. Avoid habits such as smoking that may cause oral irritation. Consider using a humidifier at night if this is a nighttime occurrence and you are not congested during the day. Reduction of salvia can accompany sinus congestion. A burning sensation with a coating on the tongue can indicate an imbalance of bacteria. Taking a probiotic can help maintain balance. A fungal infection such as thrush can require treatment with the prescription Nystatin. If the condition persists, visit a ENT specialist to determine if there is a sinus condition or a digestive specialist to look into a contributing gastric disorder.Thank you for your inquiry.

Sensitive bumps may be a result of an infection from a tooth or due to some trauma. Any habits that may be associated with this condition. A cyst, fibrous tissue, or excess bone may give this appearance as well.Changes, especially an increase in size and irregular border with pain, should be reported to your dentist. Monitor the area. Keep the area clean and follow good daily hygiene. Thank you for your inquiry. I do not think you should worry if your dentist only suggests checking the area in two weeks.

You describe symptoms of an infection. You may have a cracked tooth, a piece of bone or tooth under the gum,  another tooth with deep decay or a gum condition.  Further diagnosis and a follow up visit with your dentist is suggested for a clinical diagnosis. Antibiotics may be considered, but additional treatment for the actual  cause is needed to prevent another occurance. Anti-inflammatory medications can reduce discomfort and swelling.

Do you have a protective wax to place over the bar? Your tongue may be rubbing against the bar and causing trauma to the tongue. Your dentist can make suggestions to cover or adjust the bar.

Nothing to be panic about the membrane. Usually the sutures will resorb in weeks to months(if it is absorbable sutures). If it is non absorbable sutures, then get it removed after 7 days.

My question is could the infection spread from my left wisdom teeth to my right one? Shouldnt the penicillin kill the infection?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for posting the query,    No the infection could not spread from one side to another, i would like to tell you that wisdom tooth is the last tooth to errupt in the oral cavity and is often impacted, tilted, or maligened it is difficult to clean and often gets carious, there is inflammation of the gingiva sorrounding it leading to Pericoronitis, Since your both wisdom tooth are infected and paining, get them removed ..The infection would have resulted from food ladgement, improper cleaning on both the sides separetlyHope you find this as helpful,Take care!"},{"Patient":"I had jaw surgery in June of 2009, the doctor that did it said that it could randomly start swelling for a couple of months, and it did. But I woke up this morning and the entire right side of my face as well as my top lip was swollen. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for posting the query,     Pain, swelling, fever, are common after surgery, you dont worry about the symptoms as they will subside after some times by its own, you just follow the post surgical instructions given to you properly, take complete course of antibiotics and analgesics, take multivitamin suplements, take lukewarm saline rinses and get the condition checked by the Dentist periodically.Hope you find this as helpful,Take care!"},{"Patient":"I got my wisdom teeth removed last Friday, April 8. It is now Tuesday April 12. I just put some gauze in my mouth to cover the site but decided to take the gauze out to clean it with a salt water solution. When I took the gauze out, there was like some green and yellow pus on it. Earlier this morning, I accidentally hit the site with my electric toothbrush. It caused some bleeding but stopped after a while. Is the pus some kind of infection or something?","Doctor":"Thanks for using Health Care Magic.Read your query.The date mentioned is not applicable ,as April is along time back.If you mean August it becomes more logical.The greenish and yellow discharge mentioned in the query suggests infection in the extracted socket.I would advice you to not keep the gauze for the long period as mentioned in the query.This will make the food eaten to get lodged in the place consequently leading to infection.Continue with the salt water gargling.If the pain or swelling increases ,consult your dentist.Antibiotics like amoxicillin 500mg and metrolag will be required on prescription.Hope this was useful.Thanks and regards."},{"Patient":"I'm worried about my abcessed tooth. I am on the seventh day of antibiotics, but I think the infection is getting worse. My face feels swollen and numb. I went to the dentist and without even looking at it they only bumped my root canal up to next week and then sent me off saying it would be fine. What is the risk of it infecting my lymph system before I get in to that appointment?","Doctor":"Thanks for using Health Care Magic.Read your query.Since the antibiotics is already taken for a long time ,the swelling and numbness will reduce only when the treatment is initiated.I would advice you to call or visit the dentist office and take a early appointment or start with the emergency treatment of root canal .Do salt water gargling and avoid applying hot bag externally.Hope this was useful.Thanks and regards."},{"Patient":"Hello!

It is normal to have pain, fever during eruption of third molar. Nothing to worry. Take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin 500mg and metronidazole 400mg tid for 5 days (if you are not allergic). Consult a oral physician and get a radiograph done to rule the amount of space present for the tooth to erupt if space is there for the tooth to erupt then the gum covering over the wisdom tooth can be removed.If the space is not available then you have to get the wisdom tooth removed.

It can also be from the herpes virus infection.If it is traumatic ulcer or herpetic ulcer, you can take topical anesthetic and analgesics like anabel gel. apply 3-4 times daily before food.If it is allergic stomatitis or aphthous ulcer  you can take topical anesthetic and analgesics like anabel gel. apply 3-4 times daily before food and topical steroid like triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% 4-5times daily after food.Do saline gargling.

Dr has taken her off cream for tongue to look at further causes /Can you help","Doctor":"Hello,First, make sure oral hygiene is maintained that includes brusing the tongue and she is up to date with her regular dental exams. Many medications have side effects including producing a dry mouth. Keep well hydrated and rinse often. Avoid irritants. There are many dental products specifically designed for addressing this condition. Antibiotics can cause a bacteria imbalance and result in an oral yeast infection. Taking acidophilus may help avoid this occurrence. Nystatin, a prescription anti-fungal medication may be required to treat an oral yeast infection.Other systemic factors including gastric disturbances and sinus irritation can cause changes in the mouth. Diet and particular food choices can contribute to coatings forming on the tongue. See what changes you can make on your own and continue to report all conditions of the mouth to your physician and dentist.Thank you for your inquiry.

Usually, the numbness goes away when I turn my head onto my left side and put a hot water bottle on it.

I had recently visited a dentist to get my lower molar tooth ckecked after i experienced some sort of sensitivity while taking food.

He drilled my tooth, pierced in there about ten different sharp pins, cleansed it with a number of solutions, stuffed medicated cotton and asked me to visit after two days.

Pulp is the only vital structure of the tooth which is rich in nerve supply, so when it is removed it causes pain. It is advised to take painkiller twice daily for 3 days during the treatment. Initial days of the treatment are crucial because the vital structure is removed so it is definitely going to cause pain but once the canals are filled with the medicine, the pain subsides. There is no connection between your tooth pain and chest pain. If your tooth pain is very severe, I would advise you to take painkiller as and when required. The pain will reduce in 1-2 days.

Try some anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. The antihistamine, Benadryl, may offer you some relief.Try to decide if there are any triggers to this condition.

Have you started any new medications that may cause a reaction? Look for any insect bites. Eliminate any new cosmetics or lotions.Try to see if you can locate a tooth that might be a source. Is there a bubble on the gum associated with the swelling? Any sensitivity with your teeth?A dental exam would be helpful to make a correct diagnosis. Monitor your symptoms and report them to your dentist. A broken or infected tooth may be the source of the swelling or you may have an impacted wisdom tooth.

Are there other dental treatment recommendations made by your dentist to address your extreme jaw disfunction? Are you in need of orthodontic treatment or a reconstruction of your bite?

No matter what we do to try and stop her being able to get onto her tummy, she always seems to find a way, she is missing quite alot of school which is worrying for both of us. She has alot of acid reflux and is on medication for this, but this problem only happens if she wakes up on her tummy, other than this she is fine. Please can you HELP!!","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query. Read the history about your daughter and understood the problems. The history is quite unique. She gets the pains in the abdomen only if she sleeps on her tummy, feels sick, dizzy, and has headache too. She finds the way in the night to sleep on tummy whatever way you try to make her sleep on her sides or so. She is fine if she is not sleeping n her tummy.With careful study of the history you have provided as above and also of the treatment for acid reflux my thoughts are as follows:-It is difficult to get acid reflux in such a small age unless there is some intra-abdominal problems.-Since the pain comes only if she is sleeping on her tummy, means she has some inflammatory process in the abdomen that touches the very sensitive peritoneum in this particular position.I would suggest her the following:-First of all clinical evaluation and actual physical examination by a General or Pediatric Surgeon.-CT scan abdomen will be of tremendous help to confirm or rule out appendicitis/ Meckel's Diverticulitis, internal hernia and so on. -Routine investigations of the blood, urine and stool. Once the investigations are done, start the following treatment:-A 5-day course of an antibiotic, metronidazole and probiotic. - Medicines against intestinal worms.-Diet changes if a particular food or beverage has been causing or increasing the problems."},{"Patient":"I am 63 year old man.

It is like this all the time.  Day or night does not matter.  It's awful in that I have trouble speaking and I am very self conscious.   I went to my GP and to my dentist.  Both had no clue.   What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello,You are describing a change called xerostomia or dry mouth. There are may dental products such as toothpaste, rinses, sprays and gum that may offer relief. Try these and keep well hydrated. Drink plenty of water and then more water. Both your GP and Dentist would screen for systemic conditions and evaluate medications taken for this potential side effect since you have reported this condition. You can consider visiting an oral surgeon to evaluate your salivary function. Disorders of the salivary glands can result in reduced salivary flow.Maintain good oral hygiene. Dry mouth can often be associated with an increase in sensitivity, tissue inflammation and increased decay. Plaque will become thicker and harder to remove causing you to increase your daily dental care routine. Make sure you are not breathing through your mouth rather than nose. This can be a factor contributing to drying out your mouth.Thank you for your inquiry.

If your gap is less than a size of a tooth, you can consider a veneer with porcelain or bonding material. This would usually need to involve at least two adjacent teeth and would provide greater esthetics if more teeth are involved. If possible, bonding would most likely be the least expensive option. Orthodontic treatment would require braces to move teeth into improved placement. This would be the best choice especially if no restorations were needed after the movement and your bite would benefit by being stabilized.Usually, the more teeth involved, the greater the expense when considering caps, crowns or veneers. More diagnostic information would be needed to evaluate if you could consider less teeth involved for your treatment. Your bone support is a factor in this decision. Implants are a good consideration for a single tooth replacement when the other teeth are in good condition. This requires multiple steps, is costly and requires a period of healing.  Something removable often offers a less expensive option for tooth replacement. There is a single cost per top and bottom, not per tooth. This is considered when you want to reduce costs, multiple teeth are missing and you do not mind taking the appliance out of your mouth daily.I hope you find my suggestions helpful. I encourage you to discuss this with your dentist to determine your best option. Consider a second opinion with all your records present to compare treatment suggestions and expenses.

Thank you I advance.","Doctor":"Hello,Your periodontal health needs to be considered when making a choice for placement of crowns and bridges.  Healthy bone support will lead to a good long term prognosis. If a tooth has reoccurring infection, bone support loss, thin tooth structure or a small percentage of root in bone, there is a good risk of fracture. If you have new crowns and a tooth fractures, then these new crowns would need to be replaced to place a fixed bridge. Another option involving a single tooth or multiple teeth would be to consider an implant. I always encourage my patients to keep natural teeth when possible and often consider implants as an option to a fixed bridge.Thank you for your inquiry. Please consider an evaluation by a periodontist if you have concerns about the strength of your bone support for your teeth. This will help you make an informed decision."},{"Patient":"I have a cut gum above my front left tooth from over flossing with my Reach flosser.  My dentist pointed it out to me and took an Xray because at first we were not sure if it was from bone loss or over flossing.  We tried to reach the area with regular floss but couldn't so she was worried but no change in bone from Xray.  When I got home I happened to think I don't use regular floss I use the Reach flosser and tried that and it reached the area.  She told me to rinse with warm salt water and be gentle with it but unfortunately I am not consistent with the rinse.  Anything else I an use to get it to heal faster??   I'm not sure how long I had this cut and it causes me no pain.  Last saw the dentist 3 months ago.","Doctor":"Hello,I suggest that you change your method of flossing. You are aware of damage done using your current technique. There are many styles of floss and floss holders available. I understand from your question that it must be a difficult area to reach. I recommend you try to relax your jaw and place the floss in gently. Do not stretch open so wide that your cheek is tight against your teeth. There are other soft interdental brushes designed for cleaning between teeth that you can try as well. I strongly suggest you continue to rinse and brush with an extra soft toothbrush. Gently massage the gum tissue. You must be effective but not abusive to your gum and Remove daily plaque. Please keep up with your routine dental exams and ask your dentist to monitor this area. I am glad that you not experiencing any sensitivity in the area, but if you continue to damage the gum area you may risk some bone loss.. A grafting procedure may be required to repair the gum if it becomes damage becomes extensive. Recession of your gum can lead to sensitive teeth and make you more prone to decay.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you find my suggestions helpful and I encourage you to try different methods. I am sure with practice, you will end up with a satisfactory result."},{"Patient":"My tooth feels loose at the bottom. I got up this morning and brushed my teeth and when I ran my toungue on the bottom row, one of them felt sharp on the bottom. I've noticed it before, and just recently went to the dentist and forgot to mention it, but he didn't notice it either. it feels worse today. Is it going to fall out. I have pretty straight teeth its jst the four bottom that aren't.","Doctor":"Hello,I assume you are concerned with the tongue side of your lower front near the gum tissue? You may have some recession and root exposure. This area can accumulate tartar quickly. This can be sharp or break off, leaving a rough edge. If your entire tooth feels loose or mobile, then I suspect bone loss. You should consider X-rays of this area and a periodontal evaluation. If you just had a routine exam and cleaning, you should contact your dentist and inquire about your periodontal health.if your teeth are sharp and chipping at the biting edge, then you may grind your teeth at night. This stress can damage enamel and the ligament holding the teeth in bone. Teeth can move with pressure. A night guard to protect your teeth is a suggestion. Have you had recent changes in the position of your lower teeth? Both grinding teeth and bone loss can cause this to occur.More details and a clinical exam would be helpful to further evaluate your dental condition. I am glad to answer additional questions. Thank you for your inquiry."},{"Patient":"I had my wisdom tooth pulled Wednesday. It was not infected or with a cavity.

In late February of 2014, I went for a cleaning and to get my teeth checked. It was the first time in 5 years, although in that time I have been pretty diligent about brushing and flossing. I wasn’t surprised though that I had some cavities and that some of the teeth that I had work on previously that the fillings had to be redone. Everything went pretty smoothly (at first), and my first work was 3 fillings (3, 13 and 20). The one that went wrong out of these was 13. After about a month, I started having pain in the tooth. I don’t remember exactly when, but she finally got around to it maybe 2 or 3 months later because she initially thought the sensitivity might go away. Everything looked fine on the x-ray, but she decided to redo the filling. After she drilled, I noticed an unusual reaction from her. As she was working on it, I asked her what was going on and she said that the material had not cured. I inquired a bit further and she said that it must have not been done long enough last time and that perhaps her choice of trying to cure a full filling all at once had been a factor. This time, she was going to cure it in 3 steps to make sure it cured. After the filling, the pain seemed to get better but I was still sensitive. She said it would be normal for that to be the case for the next few weeks since the nerve was sensitive. After the work was done, I felt sensitive for 3 weeks (mostly when I flossed and occasionally with chewing+ cold food) but thought it was normal. I went on a month vacation and during that time the sensitivity got even worse. I still don’t feel much unless I’m flossing. But the irritation while I pull down on the floss is getting worse (and it’s definitely not the gums because the pain is coming when I pull down and in the tooth nerve area rather than the gum area).After vacation, I went back to the dental office but my dentist had left and I was assigned a new one. She immediately referred me to an endodontist and he said I would need a root canal. Furthermore, he said it was a deep filling in the first place that was a candidate for a root canal and so really, she tried to make it a filling but that sometimes it just doesn’t work and so it’s entirely normal. I asked him about the uncured filling exacerbating but he brushed it off saying, it “may have” affected the nerve but he couldn’t know for sure. I then talked to the “office manager” and she was even more flippant. She said she’d never heard of a filling not curing on the inside since “if the outside is cured, the inside just cures with time”. I told her that it’s what the original dentist told me but that she’s been in the field 16 years and never heard of anything like that but that she’d “check with the orthodontist”. At that point, she asked if I wanted to start the root canal today and handed me the estimate. I politely declined saying that I wanted to get to the bottom of this and get a second opinion.For me, this is more of a case of trying to find the truth rather than a case of avoiding financial responsibility. I’m not a professional dentist, so I don’t know what might have happened here. However, it seems to me like the original dentist knew something was wrong and was trying to fix it but now that she’s gone they’ve gone into a mode of “cavities turn into root canals all the time and we tried our best”. They don’t seem to want to acknowledge that this redo is not a usual thing and that the uncured agent sitting in my tooth for a few months could be causing this. All I really want to know is what I should do… keep waiting for the sensitivity to go down or get a root canal. And if I get a root canal, is it really fair that I pay for it considering the way it all went down.","Doctor":"helloI can understand the pain and agony u went through the possibility of the material being not cured is little absurd coz composite filling is always done by layering technique so the explanation that the lady dentist gave that the filling was not cured properly looks a little absurd and negligence on her part.as u were filling post filling sensitivity it could have been due to shrinkage of composite material or reason i could see is that your cavity must be a little deep so ur getting the sensitivity or there may be a cracked tooth syndrome but since i dont have an xray to suggest wht could your problem be in my opinion u might need root canal but to suggest anything i need to see the radio grapehope it helpedregards Dr rakesh mishra"},{"Patient":"Halo Sir, I am suffering Bad breath for 1year ( I think so).

Please type your query here...Your Open QuestionShow me another » Toothache has only just subsided 8 weeks after a filling - are my teeth O.K? Hi, So beginning of january my dentist said i had a very tiny cavity at the side of my top molar, on the side nearest the next tooth. She said it would need just a tiny filling. I had the filling which was silver done and it is very tiny on the side of my tooth. That day there was a mild toothache - i mean very mild - but as i have an enormous phobia i panicked, and couldn t stop thinking about it. It was rather sensitive and i kept eating on it but that didnt hurt. it was a mild ache, that was sensitive but did not hurt upon biting, chewing food or anything else. it was sensitive to air and cold drinks. the sensitivity would last about a second and then go. the tooth did not hurt at all before the filling. a few weeks later, the ache and the sensitivity were still there, but not quite as bad. however i had noticed another small cavity in another tooth and panicked a lot. so my mum booked another appointment (im 14). the dentist said that this newly found cavity had been there for years and was just in the enamal, no nead to worry. she also said the other filling was absolutely fine and the sensitivity should dissapear on its own. O.K - i worried a lot. all i could think about every day was my teeth. this seemed to make those two teeth in particular hurt a bit, and sometimes the others did. when i forgot about them, or distracted myself the pain went away. I have been really positive about them and 10 weeks after the filling, there is hardly any sensitivity, no pain at all in either teeth. However it has only just stopped in the last two weeks. two weeks ago, i had a cold and was very run down. this made my filled tooth hurt a bit. since then, i have gotten over my cold and the tooth doesn t hurt at all. O.K - I know it is common for teeth to ache a few weeks after a filling but is 8 weeks a normal amount of time? Are my teeth O.K. if they dont hurt now, or has the pain just temporarily subsided? I was told most of the pain was psycological by many people, but i find it hard to beleive. i am beginning to worry again - even though i have no toothache?! Are my teeth O.K.? I am also using a high flouride toothpaste, which apparently will help with small cavities. At first i chewed on the fillied tooth a lot to see if it hurt, which it didn t even though i was told not to chew on it. could this have made it worse?","Doctor":"Hello,Toothache after filling can be because of two reasons presence of high points in the filled tooth or some caries present beneath the filled tooth, I would suggest you get an x-ray done of the tooth if there is the presence of high points get it trimmed if there is the presence of secondary caries it can be refilled.Hope I have answered your query.

Thanks.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The boil in the roof of the mouth could be because of the tooth infection like periapical abscess. or the boil can also occur secondary to the herpes virus infection.If it is a periapical abscess then get the tooth treated with RCT or extraction.Meanwhile you can take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin 500mg and metronidazole 400mg tid for 5 days (if you are not allergic). If it is a herpetic infection, you can take symptomatic treatment like topical anesthetic and analgesics like anabel gel. apply 3-4 times daily before food.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Dentist help!

Please take anti-inflammatory medication to control your symptoms and reduce your discomfort until you can schedule a dental exam for a complete diagnosis. If possible, I suggest taking two extra-strength Tylenol and two Advil at regular intervals. Please try to keep the area clean and avoid chewing there. You may require prescription antibiotics. Your tooth description indicates a large amount of decay. Decay will enter the nerve chamber of the tooth and infection will spread if left untreated. Usual treatment choices are a root canal or extraction. Your dentist will need an x-ray and explain your options to help you make a treatment decision. Do not ignore your symptoms. Infections can flare up and calm down, but left untreated will turn into a more complicated situation.Hope I have answered your query.

White and puffy appearance is the process for start of healing so dont worry about that use benzocain ointment it will help you to eat (mucopain) It can be applied on the cut areas as an whenever you feel uncomfortable, avoid spicy and hot food.

I am worried, is this normal?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The pain, lymphnode enlargement and ear ache will be there for a week after extraction. The numbness over the chin and lip could be because of the nerve injury during extraction of the wisdom tooth. If it is a minor injury, then it will reverse back to normal sensation in weeks to month. If it is a major injury, then it can take 6 months to a year. Consult a neuro physician and get it examined.Meanwhile, you can take nerve regenerating drugs like capsule neurobion once daily for 30 days.

Thank you!!","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The white patch could be because of lichen planus, candidiasis, or leukoplakia. Consult a oral physician and get it evaluated. The possible cause of halitosis or bad breath could be because of the deposits over the teeth causing gum infection. Or it can be because of the pus discharge secondary to gum or tooth infection or any respiratory tract infection.Consult a oral physician and get yourself examined to rule out these conditions.If it is gum infection get the teeth cleaned once and maintain oral hygiene after that.

Any trauma caused by needle penetration to any muscle can cause limited mouth opening. You can take an analgesic with muscle relaxants like flexon MR three times a day for three days.The other possible cause for limited mouth opening could be because of the disc displacement secondary to long-standing mouth opening during a dental procedure.

But piercing has other side effects like,it may cause infections,drooling of saliva,inadequate function of tongue,chipping of teeth due to continuous abrasion. You can visit American dental association www.ada.org for further information on adverse effect of piercing. ADA strongly discourages piercing.So advice not to go for piercing from my side.

The fell out tooth structure could be only the crown portion. The Root canal treated tooth becomes weak after RCT so it has to be crowned immediately.

Rinse the area vigorously and try to keep it clean. Take a soft toothbrush and massage the tissue. This increases blood circulation and firmness. Try to be careful to not let food get caught under the tissue. She may have bitten the gum area and caused slight trauma, but do not worry. As long as the tooth has enough room to errupt, this will resolve. Only if there is swelling with increased pain, would you need a dentsit to assist by cleaning out the tissue and prescribing antibiotics. For slight soreness, take some anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. There are gels with benzocaine available to apply to sore tissue as well.Thank you for your inquiry.

Please let me know if that is ok.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The pain and swelling could be because of the tooth infection. Consult a oral physician and get a radiograph done to rule out the tooth infection. If there is infection in the root tip the tooth has to be treated with RCT or extraction. Before that you can take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin 500mg and metronidazole 400mg tid for 5 days (if you are not allergic). I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, I had root canal therapy 2 days ago.

She has been living with pain for several days.  Her cheek and gums are swollen and sore.  She started  taking amoxicillin 2 days ago.  Although her pain level seems to have decreased some, her cheek and gums are still swollen and she is taking motrin and tylenol.  Is removal of the tooth necessary at this point, or are there other options?  Is it better to remove the tooth or access the infection through the gum?  Any advice will be much appreciated.  We live in Israel and it is very frustrating to get answers from the local dentist.  We're seeing him today, and I'd like to be as educated as I can.  Thanks so much!","Doctor":"hello.thank you for sharing your problem with HCM.To decide extraction is necessary or not I need X-ray. If infection is deep there can be option of saving it by a treatment called root canal treatment.but if it's more than enough deep and can't be saved then extraction is only the option.continue with antibiotics .and take pain killer if pain is unbearable. you can consult back for further queries.wish you good health"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...I had a difficult tooth extraction on Monday, the dentist put me on amoxicillen and I was sick and nauseous and dizzy the day after; could not get out of bed. He changed my prescription to amox-clan; but it still has not helped; I have headache and overall sick feeling.","Doctor":"Hello,Please contact your dentist to update your symptoms. Make sure you have ruled out any allergic reaction or intolerance to Amoxicillin. You may need to change the antibiotic again. You need to control the spread of infection into your blood stream that can give you systemic affects. Follow all instructions provided by your dentist.Try to take a combination of two Advil and two extra strength Tylenol at regular intervals (as long as you are not allergic and can take these anti-inflammatory pain relief medications). Were you given any prescription medication to control pain and inflammation? Your initial healing will be uncomfortable with a more difficult extraction and medication to control the inflammation will offer some relief. Prescription medication for relief may be required. Possible use of a steroid for control of intense inflammation may be recommended by your dentist.Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you have some improvement soon and recover quickly. I hope my recommendations are helpful."},{"Patient":"Hi, 3 days back I develop very tiny small blisters in mouth , Today morning I saw them turned white in color, look like small patches like tip of pimple. They are not very painfull but they cause some in comofort. I am really worried Please advice should I meet my dentist or I should meet another specialist?","Doctor":"Hello,Do not worry and try to rinse the area with warm salt water. Avoid extreme temperatures, spicy and acidic foods.  Take some anti-inflammatory medication and try a gel with benzocaine to control discomfort. Keep the area clean and give a chance for healing to occur. See your dentist if continues or gets worse. Allow a week, but make sure to schedule a routine dental exam if you are not up to date on your dental visits and report all symptoms to your dentist.Possible causes include trauma such as biting your cheek, hot temperature burn, allergic reaction to food or change in products used.

I have been havin a toothache since few days. I ws told few months back that the tooth needed a root canal. A temporary coverin ws done but within days it came off and exposed tooth since then. I ws advised meftal - forte tablets to take for pain by a chemist. Please advice ASAP if i should take to subside the pain for now. Within 2 or 3 days i would be visiting a good dentist. Thank you!","Doctor":"Hello,I am glad to assist you. The temporary filling placed would be expected to wear away if only placed to cover the tooth while expecting you to return for a root canal therapy. The filling needs to be removed to enter the center of the tooth and clean out the canals to complete the root canal. You will have a temporary filling until the canals are sealed and you can plan restorative treatment with your dentist. An antibiotic such as Amoxicillin may be necessary if pain and swelling is present. This will help control the spread of inflammation from the infected tooth. I usually recommend taking a combination of two Advil and two extra strength Tylenol to control a more severe pain until you are able to visit the dentist again.Thank you for your inquiry.

He was afraid that the piece would break off. His suggestion was that he drill out the old filling and replace with a new one to hold the fracture in place. After doing all of that, he determined that the fracture would not be repaired with the filling and I would need a crown.

Everything is costing me an arm and a leg now. I have dental insurance that only covers 50% of the cost. This is really frustrating. Thoughts","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The ideal way of treating your tooth is by root canal treatment followed by crown.Because since the tooth is sensitive any time it can become non vital, so prophylactically get it root canal treated now only and complete the treatment. If you get the crown without RCT, If some problem occurs in future then the crown has to be repeated and RCT has to be done at that time. It cannot be dry socket, dry socket occurs in a extracted tooth socket.

I am currently receiving treatments from an orthodontists. I have an impacted front tooth that I want down. Initially, during the consultation, the doctor told me that in order for that tooth to come down, I would have to get braces and then a surgery to expose the impacted tooth and to chain it. He also said that because the tooth is in the front, he would put a temporary tooth in that place while he uses the chain to pull the tooth down. Well, I ve got the braces and I had the surgery. All I m waiting for is for the doctor to pull it down and to put a tooth in the front. Well, during my last appointment, he told me that he wasn t going to be able to pull it down because my surgery area wasn t completely. Now, the surgery area is healed, and I went to see him today. I was expecting to begin pulling my tooth into place. However, that was not the case. He told me that, now, in order for him to begin to pull down the tooth, he has to leave the open space, and I would have to go a few months without a tooth in the front. This is not what I agreed to initially and I do not want to walk around like that. Is there anything I can do about this?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The tooth cannot be replaced with a artificial tooth since in that place the impacted tooth has to be pulled down.

She s currently on 3 mgs of Warfarin/day and has been for the past 5 months after suffering a DVT after 2 kidney stone procedures. She was seeing a hematologist previously but is now having her primary doctor monitor her INR. Last reading, 2 weeks ago, was 2.6.

Please help...I m not sure what to do.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The extraction can be done since the INR is 2.5, since the tooth is mobile it comes under minor surgical procedure. Take an opinion from the cardiac physician to stop warfarin. The purpose of stopping the warfarin is to control bleeding while extracting the tooth.But since it is a minor procedure we can do without stopping the drug. You need to take a prophylactic antibiotics.

The last time that I was at the dentist office, a dentist polished down the enamel in the center of my premolar tooth a bit too low. I feel regret now because I asked her to do it. It was fine when I left the office. Now, a month has passed and I m having trouble speaking properly and smiling around that tooth. It feels too low in the center and I feel stress and pressure when the teeth come together while saying words and smiling. Some words, I can not say properly. It is not comfortable. Sometimes, a very small twinge occurs when the teeth come together. I was reading online and noticed something about not having enough vertical dimension, and it affecting phonetics. This is what I think is going on here. Is there any way to restore the vertical dimension in the center of the tooth where she removed the enamel and make it feel natural, so that I feel more comfortable smiling and speaking again? The location is on a biting surface of a premolar. There is no cavity where she removed the enamel and oddly, as of now, I do not have trouble eating. Will restoring the vertical dimension cause pain here? How can this be done that will not cause new pain or problems eating? or should I leave the tooth alone so that matters don t become worse? I am very sad because I just want my normal functions back (smiling and speaking properly) and am afraid to file anything else down. Hopefully, I won’t have to choose between living with this forever or ending up in pain. Unfortunately, my dentist is booked for a month, so I have to wait before seeing her.

Or what I should do?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The yellow discharge could be a pus from the infected tonsil. It can be secondary to the tonsillitis or peritonsillar abscess. Consult a ENT surgeon and get it treated. Mean while you can take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin 500mg and metronidazole 400mg tid for 5 days (if you are not allergic). Do saline gargling.The halitosis is because of this problem only. Once you get the tonsils treated everything will return back to normal.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"While cleaning my bathroom I sprayed tile cleaner and unknowingly got some on my toothbrush. When I went to brush my teeth I started to brush then tasted a bit of cleaner so I spit it out and rinsed out my mouth. I do not think I actually swallowed any but on the bottle it said if swallowed you are to contact a physician. I feel fine but I would just like to make sure that it will not make me sick or anything.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.Nothing to be panic or worried since you have spit the cleaner. If you get any stomach pain or vomiting then you consult a oral physician or general physician. Nothing will happen to teeth, but the mucosa might get affected, it may result in chemical burn or contact stomatitis. These conditions may cause burning sensation or ulcerations. If you have any of these symptoms then consult a oral physician.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"I have this little white cut on my lower front gums in my mouth that hurts really bad. What is it? It s very painful to eat. I have great teeth so I know it shouldn t be from cleaning. Its a pretty deep cut and I havent fell or cut my self in the mouth. Thanks","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The possible causes of the cut could be a tooth brush injury or from food particles. Nothing to worry about it, you can take topical anesthetic and analgesics like anabel gel. apply 3-4 times daily before food. If the cut does not heal in 7 days then consult a oral physician and get it ruled out from other lesions.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"My 7 year old was in pain Tuesday all night we had a emergency visit to dentist they took 3 x rays well they make the choice to pull the tooth well thur and Friday he was in pain with swollen check n eye took back to dentist sat morning did exray again n looked and said took area fine...said if pain worsen n more swollen take to er ...what is going on n why","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The possible causes of the swelling could be the infected tooth leading to cellulitis resulting in extension of the swelling to involve cheek and eye region. Consult a oral and maxillofacial surgeon and get Intravenous antibiotics injected. The infection will come down after that the infected teeth can be removed. do not delay, if the infection spreads then it leads to complications like difficulty in breathing and swallowing. I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"For the past couple of days I ve noticed a white ring around my mouth with a little redness around the outside of the ring. I recently went off birth control and have heard that can cause lightening around the mouth. I also had quite a few strawberries the other day and thought it could be an allergic reaction, but I thought that would have gone away by now. Help!","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The white ring with red outline could be a symptom of erythema multiforme, that is a allergic reaction to the strawberries. consult a oral physician and get it diagnosed. Once it is diagnosed you can take anti allergic tablets like cetrizine or rupatidine. if the lesion does not subside within 5-7days, consult a general physician immediately.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Since about 6 months ago I started to have sticky saliva from time to time. That was the time when I started to use denture and the fact that my dentist recommended  a kind of glue to hold the upper denture in place. Also the soft roof (upper part) of my mouth seems to taste slightly salty. Can you tell me why?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The sticky saliva or salty taste could be because of the denture adhesive that you are using to keep the denture fit in the oral cavity. Usually the salivary flow will increase when you wear denture. In your case the salivary flow may be normal but because of the denture adhesive you might be feeling like this. consult a oral physician and prosthodontist and get it ruled out. if there is problem in the denture get it relined or rebased so that there is no need to use denture adhesive.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Doc, My son aged 10 years has been told by the orthodontist that he has lesser space in the jaw than required leading to uneven teeth line. The dentist has advised that there is a requirement to remove four Permanent Teeth  to make space for waiting teeth. Is it a correct line of treatment. Thanks (SK Didwania)","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The removal of the permanent first premolar is commonly done during orthodontic treatment to acomodate space and pull back the malaligned teeth. Nothing to worry, if the proclined teeth has to be pulled back, if there is no space in the jaw, then the premolars has to be extracted. It is a correct line of treatment. But i would like to suggest to consult a good orthodontist and take a opinion, since your sons age is 10years, all the permanent teeth might not have erupted particularly canines and premolars. Get a radiograph like OPG and Lateral cephalograph done and assess the status of teeth and bone, later start the treatment.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, I believe i m being a bit paranoid lately, My first child was recently born and i ve suffering anxiety over my issue. My wife tells me it s nothing but over my right side top teeth located on my gums, i noticed a small raised bump painless and to the right looks like a small painless flesh colored raise of tiny bumps on the light. I really had to focus on it to see it in the mirror. I occasionally smoke, and not really an alcohol drinke, and recently ate spicy foods. I also noticed the same tiny cluster on the corners of my mouth not really visible to the eye until i use my tongue to raise my lower lip to see it in the light. Please regard my question it been driving me nuts. !!!","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The tiny bumps over the gums could be because of parulis(pus discharging sinus tract) or exostoses, or frictional keratosis.Nothing to worry, consult a oral physician and get it ruled out. If these is a pus dischrging sinus tract then get the cause treated. If there is exostosis, nothnig to worry, it will not trouble you.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"I have offensive smelling hard like pus that seems to be coming out from underneath the palatoglossal fold. I can scrap it off. It is non tender. When I lift back the fold I can see more built up under there, what is it?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The pus discharge could be from an infected tonsil or infected wisdom tooth. Consult a oral physician to rule out the cause. If it is arising from the wisdom tooth, then it has to be treated with operculectomy or extraction. If it is tonsillar abscess then you can take a course of antibiotics.For both of these conditions i would like to suggest you to take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin 500mg and metronidazole 400mg tid for 5 days (if you are not allergic). Do saline gargling. i hope my answer will help you, take care.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, my doctor gave me oxycodone for my wisdom teeth being taken out...However I take ciprelex for my depression and anxiety. Is that safe? To mix? Also I think I took one two many this morning. I took one I thought but didn t remember if I did and took another but I m not to sure I should be fine right?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The oxycodone is a opioid analgesic and a central nervous system depressant. Even though it does not interact directly with the cipralex which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor(Anti depressant). The oxycodone produces depression So it is not ideal to take along with  antidepressants. Consult a general physician and take opinion. The other possible ways could be sticking on to Non opioids like non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Since the opioids have addictive properties, it is not safe for long term use.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have an 8yr old son who has been vomiting on and off (every few days) for the last month or so. He complains sometimes of pains in his stomach, but he is usually ok again 30mins after he has vomited until the next time.

I was just told I have an abscess tooth that needs to be removed. it is in a tooth that had a root canal and I do not have any pain in my mouth or face. However, I have been having pain in my neck for the last few weeks. Any posibility they are connected? Thanks so much.","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The neck pain can be a referred pain from the infected or abscessed wisdom tooth. The other possible cause of neck pain could be from the inflamed lymphnodes secondary to tooth infection. Consult a oral physician to rule out these causes. For the abscessed tooth you can take a course of antibiotics like amoxicillin 500mg and metronidazole 400mg tid for 5 days (if you are not allergic). Do saline gargling. After taking the course of antibiotics, you ca get the tooth treated with RCT or extraction. i hope my answer will help you, take care.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"Hello, i have noticed feeling pain when i touch the bottom of my tooth, where the gum and base of the tooth meet. if i touch the gum or the actual tooth where it first comes out of gum its highly unpleasant. but the tooth is even more so i almost want to jump out of my skin when i touch the outside of the tooth with my nail. Also the gum surrounding that particular tooth is white. what can this be? i am scared lifeless of a root canal ( even though i have never had one), please help!","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The pain in the gums or gum line could be because of the gum infection secondary to the deposits resulting in  bone loss, this can also cause pain in the tooth. I would suggest you to consult a oral physician and get a radiograph to rule out whether the infection is associated with tooth or gums. Then we can treat accordingly by doing scaling, root planing or RCT.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"For years, friends, family and girlfriends have always told me my breathe smells. I do brush twice daily and try and hydrate my mouth as much as I can. I've tried the gum where it makes your mouth water so it doesn't dry and create bacteria. I brush my tongue carefully as well as my entire mouth, but what it seems like minutes later, it still smells like low-tide. Is there any remedy for this?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The bad breath could be because of the deposits over the teeth causing gum infection. Or it can be because of the pus discharge secondary to gum or tooth infection or any respiratory tract infection.Consult a oral physician and get yourself examined to rule out these conditions.if it is gum infection get the teeth cleaned once and maintain oral hygiene after that. You can use mouth wash.if it is tooth infection get the tooth restored.If it is respiratory tract infection consult a pulmonologost.I hope my answer will help you, take care."},{"Patient":"My boyfriend got hit by a baseball about 5 weeks ago and had to get stitches above his lip & inside his mouth.  The doctor took out the stitches above his lip but said the stitches inside his mouth would \\"dissolve\\" or fall out.  However, not all of them have fallen out.  Is it normal to take this long or should he call the doctor?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query, I have gone through your query.The absorbable sutures dissolve or absorbed by the enzymatic process, this might take around 1 to 2 weeks. sometimes it might take months to get disolved. If the sutures are not absorbed even after a month then consult a surgeon and get it checked. Nothing to worry it will not harm you.
