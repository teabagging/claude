I understand your concern. Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a type of bacterial infection that can be found in a pregnant woman’s vagina or rectum. This bacteria is normally found in the vagina and/or rectum in about 25% of all healthy adult women. However, women who test positive for GBS are said to be colonized. There is a risk that mother can pass GBS to her baby during delivery. Not every baby who is born to a mother who tests positive for GBS is known to become ill. Expectant mothers who are tested positive for needs to be treated with antibiotics when they go into labour or if their membranes rupture early. In case the mother is not tested but is thought to be at high risk for passing the bacteria on to her baby during the birth process, she will also be treated with antibiotics to kill the bacteria during her labour. To help protect their babies from infection, pregnant women who test positive for group B strep in the current pregnancy should receive antibiotics through the vein (IV) during labor.Penicillin is the most common antibiotic that is given since it is very safe and effective in preventing group B strep disease in newborns. For women who are allergic to penicillin, there are other antibiotics that can be given. This problem can be tackled and hence you need not worry.

I'm wondering why benzylpenicillin is used to terat an infection caused by a gram negative bacteria...? I thought penicillins only had action against gram positive organisms???","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. Meningococcal meningitis is a bacterial infection that results in swelling and inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Currently, a third-generation cephalosporin (ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) is the drug of choice for the treatment of meningococcal meningitis. Penicillin G, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolone and aztreonam are alternatives therapies. Benzylpenicillin (Penicillin G) is narrow spectrum antibiotic used to treat infections caused by susceptible bacteria. Penicillin G is considered the drug of choice for several infections caused by susceptible gram positive aerobic organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. No doubt that they have limited activity against gram negative organisms. However, they may be used in some cases to treat infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcal meningitis) and Pasteurella. Also, resistance patterns of the organisms, susceptibility and treatment guidelines vary across regions. Hope the information provided would be helpful. Best Wishes."},{"Patient":"I am currently on amoxicillin for a tooth infection, but the medicine gave me a yeast infection!

I understand your concern. R-Cinex contains two medications namely Isoniazid and Rifampin, which are antibiotics prescribed to treat patients who are suffering from tuberculosis. Complying with the treatment everyday for the specified period is very very essential in the treatment of tuberculosis. Hence, you should never miss even a single dose for that matter at any cost. Otherwise, the organisms would develop resistance to the regular line of drugs and next would be very difficult to treat the infection and might land you up in development of dreadful complications. Hence, kindly take the medications as advised. You can take multivitamin capsules anytime during the course of treatment. Hope the information provided would be helpful.

I am not pregnant. I have crohn s disease. I also have high blood pressure. I was on remicade for my disease until 10 weeks ago when I started having complications with it which I was on it for over 3 years so its to to be expected. However for the last two weeks my head has been feeling really dizzy. I also keep getting headaches. The headaches are not constant but the dizziness is and sometimes it feels like there is pressure on the top of my head. I just started taking entyvio for the crohns but my first dose was last Thursday, so I know that s not the problem. My question is though could the remicaid along with the steroids that they were giving me at the time be causing the dizziness and the headaches especially since we had to just stop it or could there be something worse going on? I m supposed to do an MRI but were waiting on the insurance company to give the ok. It s just this dizziness keeps getting worse and I was just wondering if anyone has any ideas on what might be causing it? Thank you Sincerely Darlene Emmett","Doctor":"Hi, Headache and dizziness may not be due to Remicade or a steroid but it can be due to a migraine. The condition can be managed with Ergotamine or Carbamazepine before you go for an MRI. If headaches and dizziness are still there then an MRI can be considered. Till then it can be managed as a migraine headache. It is a kind of functional disorders and not the pathology of any kind. Certain precipitating factors are there which can be responsible for a headache, like psychological disturbances, stress, anxiety and sometimes diet too (spicy, fried, high-calorie diet).

Thanks","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I understand your concern. Green mucus discharge following rupture of Bartholin cyst indicates that it would have been infected. It is good that it has ruptured and see to it that all the contents are completely drained out. Kindly take antiinflammatory medication like Tablet.Ibuprofen after food twice a day for 3 to 5 days.

Today the boil was even larger and more painful so I pinched it and a fair amount of pus erupted. Should I take another course of antibiotics? And was pinching it the wrong thing to do even though it feels much better now?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I understand your concern. Recurrent skin infection in the form of boils occurring on penis despite taking treatment with antibiotics could be due to resistance of the organisms for the antibiotics previously used. Once the pus comes out, you would always feel better. Anyway, kindly get the following things done so that it would be helpful to treat your condition better. 1. Culture of pus or swab from the secretions of the boil and its sensitivity to know what could be the organism and which antibiotic it is sensitive to. 2. Random Blood Sugar (RBS) to know the status of glucose homeostasis as repeated infection could be caused due to diabetes mellitus. Kindly keep the area clean and hygienic. In the meantime, you can wash the area with mild antiseptic solution using Iodine or Savlon. Also, you can apply Neomycin ointment over the lesions. If glucose levels are normal, take a complete course of appropriate antibiotics after the culture and sensitivity report along with antiinflammatory medication like Ibuprofen. Gradually, your symptoms should subside and you should feel better. Hope the information provided would be helpful.

The decreased hearing in the ear may be due to infection in the ear or dysfunction of the eustachian tube (tube in the ear).Loss of appetite, coughing, chills can occur with these infections.If the cough is wet, then a mucolytic can be used to break up the mucus so that it can be expelled. eg bisolvan, mucomyst, guaifenesinA decongestant with antihistamine may also help.You may need to consider visiting a doctor to see if antibiotics are necessary.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor I get cold always especially whenever i get up from sleep, i sneeze 5-6 times.This happens when i get from sleep in the morning and whenever i sleep for sometime.

Despite a low risk profile: no familial history of heart issues, don t smoke, exercise regularly, good diet, no fat around girth, cholesterol in the normal desirable range, and normal blood pressure, two years ago i experienced severe chest pains which resulted in me having a stent installed in one artery. The others were clear. I was prescribed: Perindopril 2mg Atorvastatin 20mg Asprin 75mg Sometimes, I suspect my blood pressure may be a little low, although when my GP checks it routinely on my occasional visits it has been normal. Recently, I sensed my blood sugar was a little low and perhaps combined with low blood pressure, I experienced some worrying memory disturbance, which however, resolved within a couple of hours. I consulted a doctor about this but with inconclusive outcome. I have since been fine and back to functioning with full cognitive capacity (I work in the mental health field). I have also experience for some time now low libido, and occasional problems with mild impotence. Also, my doctor diagnosed me with benign tremor, which again is mild, and at this stage not too noticeable. My question is: could changing my medication address these issues better? I m wondering if nebivolol (given the good data on it now and its superiority over other beta blockers for heart conditions) could be used to replace perindopril, slightly lowering my blood pressure, and perhaps helping the benign tremor. I am aware that it is the only beta blocker of its kind that has been found not associated with a decline in libido and the problem of impotence. My last cardiologist in Australia suggested that perindopril was best for me because of its specific properties relative to my condition. I am wondering if this is the case now in the light of new data on the effectiveness of nebivolol. Lastly, I have not felt fully myself ever since the stent was installed and I started on the medications, despite daily exercise, excellent diet, meditation, and no alcohol. I forgot to mention, my cholesterol is now sitting around 3 (it never did exceed 4.5 even before I commenced on atorvastatin). Because I am in the UK getting sound advice without waiting many weeks is frustrating. Hope I can receive good advice, that will improve my quality of life and give me the very best prognosis given my history.","Doctor":"Hi, Nevibilol and perindopril belong to two different class of blood pressure medication had its own benefit and side effect profile. As per my understanding, there are certain aspects of why you want to shift to Nevibilol. Let me explain each. 1) Fall in pressure, maybe titration of perindopril dose would be more appropriate. Decreasing the same may help. 2) Tremors, Nevibilol is a beta blocker with intrinsic sympathetic activity, so though beta blocker as a class helps reduce essential tremors, Nevibilol may not help much. 3) Libido, though Nevibilol is marketed as causing least loss in libido, for sure it doesn't improve it. Also, it's a company-sponsored trial, so how much to rely on is a problem. Lastly, Perindopril has never been associated with loss of libido, so your problem may be completely unrelated and so changing medication may not make that big a difference. For sure Nevibilol is heart protective but so is Perindopril. So I think your doctor would be in the best position to select which medication would be best considering your individual characteristics. Hope I have answered your query.

As per your query you have symptoms of persistent low grade fever along with burns on throat which seems to be due to viral infection. Low grade fever is because your immunity is lower down because of infection. Need not to worry much as antibiotics will not give much relief to you as yours symptoms are more like viral infection. You should take paracetamol to prevent fever and combination of decongestants and multivitamin tablet. Yes smoke and drink is the exaggeration factor for your condition. You should quit that completely. Your symptoms will resolve in 5-7 days. Avoid touching eyes, nose again and again as it will spread infection.

Recently I have developed a spur or painful callus on the heel corner of my right foot which causes a lot of pain and the surrounding region is swollen","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I understand your concern. A callus is a toughened area of skin which has become relatively thick and hard in response to repeated friction, pressure, or other irritation. They can be dissolved by using keratolytic agents containing salicylic acid. Calcaneal sour (Heel spur)  is a calcium deposit causing a bony protrusion on the underside of the heel bone. You would require X-ray of the foot to diagnose weather the condition is callus or calcaneal spur. Conservative treatments to overcome calcaneal spur include exercise, custom-made orthotics, anti-inflammatory medications, and corticosteroid injections. Surgical excision may be necessary if conservative treatment fails. Kindly consult Orthopedic Surgeon in this regard for appropriate evaluation and management.

Can you please help me for the permenant solution for my problem.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I understand your concern. Getting repeated urinary tract infection could be caused due to resistance of organisms to the antibiotics what you have taken for its treatment. To overcome it, kindly get urine culture and sensitivity test done to know what could be the organism and which antibiotic it responds best. Kindly take a course of that antibiotic to overcome your urinary tract infection. Since, you seem to be sexually active, it would be better to evaluate your partner also for infection and treat accordingly. Regarding difficulty in conceiving, your sperm count seems to be quite low with less sperms being active. Infection could be one of the cause for it. It would be better to consider assisted reproductive techniques like IUI or IVF in such cases, as chronic infection, even if treated well, might not show much improvement in sperm count and improve chances of fertility.

I understand your concern. Intestinal parasites are generally not transmitted by taking bath in an unclean bath tub. The usual mode of transmission of many parasites in by entry in to the body by means of drinking water and contaminated foods (vegetables).

That night I started getting the chills, and the following morning i woke up with a high 104.8 fever. I took a lot of ibroprophen and mixed with Tylenol every 4 hours, my fever would go down then go right back up, kinda like a yoyo. I would break out with sweats and then the chills, mouth had a bad taste for first few days. I threw up once, and that was it on Tuesday morning. I would often wake up in 3am with my sheets soaking wet.Then on Wednesday, I still had the fever. Went to the doctors Wednesday night, where they checked my temperature, and did a throat culture which came up negative for strep, and a urine test. Also said my body was close to dehydration and that my heart rate was high, was at 120. They wouldn't be able to do a urine culture till the next day, but they were able to do a man made check? and said they saw some pus and blood, so she said i had a urinary tract infection and gave me ciprofloxacin. You have to take these once every 12 hours, so when I got home that night I took one, and the next morning, which was on thursday I took another one. I was still running a 101-102 fever on thursday, but come thursday afternoon I broke out with a rash on my neck area. I took a shower that night, probably not the best idea but I rubbed a sponge on my neck then on the rest of my body. I took another ciro pill that night. That night I broke out with kidna of a full body rash, from my back of my ears, neck shoulder parts of back/egs and feet, kinda had a burning tingly sensation in some of the areas.I went back to the doctors on friday, and they said my urine culture came up negative, and there was no blood/bacteria. Also said in my blood work my platelet count was a bit low and liver enzymes were evaluated. My heart rate was still fast at 120, and my lyphm glands were a little swallow on my neck. They ran me a Echocardiogram, but everything came up normal. They sent me to the e.r, and the doctor came in checked on me and said i had scarlet fever. He gave me amoxicillin and some other medicine for the rash.That night the fever went away, and so did most of the rash, however I still felt a bit sick for the following week. Went back to the doctors on the next friday, about 7 days later and my rash was still slightly on my neck/upper chest, lyphm glands still a bit swollen, and my heart rate was still fast at 120. She gave me another 7 days of amoxiccilian. Also did another blood/urine culture, and my results came back improved and all my levels were normal. My groin/penis area has also been very dry/itchy, and have a little rash on my upper thighs that blistered. my scrotum is super dry and kinda stings/itches, and so is my penis. The skin has become very sensitive and whenever I would preform a sexual activity such as masturbation, the skin would start coming off and I would be in pain, so I no longer have done any activity. Also has a slight odor. My scrotum kinda seems a bit hard/leathery at times, and also very sensitive/raw in others. I did not have anything wrong with the groin area till about the second week after my initial infection, most notably it was on a Wednesday night when I decided to also take one 500mg pill of tetracycline and massage my area with soap, and the following morning I woke up with itchiness. not sure if that would have any correlation or a mere coincidence.I know this is a bit of a long rant, and I apologize, but if you might know whats wrong, feel free to give some advice! I still have a slight rash under my neck/upper chest with a few sores?, the back of my throat still has a little bit of pus, but it is not sore, and my neck glands still seem to be a bit swollen, I can still see the 2 main vessels in my neck pulsating/beating, and my groin area is dry/itchy.

I feel that there is a chance of having something called as an autoimmune disease. So, I would ask you to get tested for such illnesses in which your body attacks itself, there being no germs. Also, given the facts that antibiotics ha have not been of help, I would suggest scanning yourself for viral disease. I suggest an HIV test too. This makes sense.

Rabies is caused by a virus that affects the central nervous system. It is transmitted by bites and scratches from an infected animal. Fever and tingling at the site of exposure are early symptoms to appear. These symptoms are followed by one or more of the following symptoms: violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, fear of water, an inability to move parts of the body, confusion, and loss of consciousness. Once such symptoms appear, it results in almost always death. The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months. What wound care you have taken should be alright. But, it would have been better you would have taken anti-rabies vaccine to be on the safer side. You can undergo fluorescent antibody test (FAT) to know weather there is active infection are not. Accordingly, you can get it treated within 10 days of infection after exposure.

About two weeks after I took the antibiotics, I got a brownish-clear fishy-smelling dishcharge (the discolored discharge was a one-time thing, but the smell continued). I went to the doctor, who told me nothing was wrong so I took a medication I got from sprouts for balancing of yeast bodies and bacteria. It seemed to clear up.

Usually  3rd-generation cephalosporins ( cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), carbapenems (imipenem/cilastatin), aminoglycosides (gentamicin, amikacin), & quinolones are found to be effective in Norfloxacin resistant infections. These agents may be used as monotherapy or combination therapy like a combination of Gentamicin & Ceftriaxone. If she is allergic to Ceftriazone, Aztreonam or Quinolones are the alternative effective antibiotics.So, she needs an immediate culture and sensitivity test for her urine sample to select the most suitable antibiotics to eradicate the Klebsiella infection."},{"Patient":"hi I am 6 weeks pregnant and my urine test shows that my pus cells are 180 - 200. my doctor put me on anti biotics while waiting for the urine culture rrsult.

I understand your concern. Chickenpox used to be a common childhood illness, especially in kids under age 12. It is a highly contagious disorder caused by the varicella-zoster virus. An infected child should preferably be isolated and stay home until the rash is gone. It is a self limiting viral disease and offers immunity once it is contacted with. However, supportive care is necessary for the lesions it causes. The following measures needs to be taken: 1. Administration of Paracetamol for fever. 2. Application of calamine lotion on the lesions. 3. Cutting the nails short or wearing gloves may prevent scratching and minimize the risk of secondary infections. Maintenance of good personal hygiene is very important. Gradually, the lesions would reduce in severity and dries up and subsides completely. For lesions around the eyes, it would be better to get examined by an Opthalmologist for opinion and management. Hope the information provided would be helpful.

She was given a shot of anti-tetanus and she was prescribed to take some anti-biotics and pain killer. The problem is we had the dog vaccinated with anti-rabies few days after she has bitten my mom; can we still know if the dog had rabies during the time the bite was made?","Doctor":"Hi & Welcome.I can understand your concern for your beloved mother.Since, at the time of bite your dog was not vaccinated so there's a possibility of being infected with rabies. Dogs uniformly begin to sicken and die within 10 days of spread of rabies virus from the CNS to the salivary glands. That's why a healthy domestic dog that bites a person should be confined and observed for 10 days. Dogs that exhibit any sign of illness should be evaluated by a veterinarian and reported to the local health department. If your dog does develop any signs of illness, it should be euthanised and its head shipped under refrigeration to a laboratory certified to perform rabies testing (most often a public health laboratory). If your dog remains healthy for the full 10 days, then it did not have rabies virus in its saliva at the time of exposure.Besides, your mother should be given 4 doses (injections) of anti rabies vaccine on day 0, 3, 7, & 14. If the dog remains healthy after 10 days, the fourth dose of 14 days need not be given.Hope this answers your query."},{"Patient":"my finger hurts and my moms not home right now. and to top it all off, she wont pick up her phone. i normally dont fret over hurt fingers but i thought i saw a little green spot in my finger. im horriably afraid. i dont want it to be gangrene. it hurts and its warmer than any of my other fingers and im not sure if its been cut lately. and some wierd puss came out of it. im really afraid","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I understand your concern. I went through your description and you need not be scared as it does not appear to be gangrene. It is just a finger cut injury followed by an infection leading to discolouration and oozing out of pus like material. You can get it treated on out-patient basis by getting wound dressing done by using antiseptic solution. Also you need to take a course of antibiotics with anti-inflammatory analgesic medications. Gradually, the cut wound would heal by closure from inside by generating healthy granulation tissue. Hope the information provided would be helpful.

It appears that they are living in my scalp, it appear they have moved though my bloodstream to different parts of my body.  I have not seen this issue in my internet queries.  I have a metal lice comb that I use daily to try to get rid of them on my head, but they come back daily.  I was taking 1/2 tab albenzole for 5 days, then off for 5 days, but that didn't cure.  Then I went to 1 tab per day, 5 days on, 5 days off, then 14days on.  Still not cured.  Then I used 250mg Mebendazole twice a day for 3 days, off for 5, 3 on, 5 off.  Still not cured.  I'm guessing the eggs floating around may be one issue, but I'm starting to think I have something far more serious going on.  I have two dogs that stay on one sofa and am thinking they stir up the eggs.  I have treated them for heartworms so unless they are reinfecting themself by breathing their own worm eggs (assuming they have worms, which I see no evidence that they do).  The meds I'm taking have reduced the worms but I am taking way too much and they are still around.  I have followed all the different advice regarding sanitation, I am squeeky clean and wash my hands/nails with a nail brush, roller my bed linens with a lint roller after getting up and before sleeping, wash all clothes in hot water, carefully avoid breathing near my dirty laundry when I'm changing clothes or putting stuff in the washer.  I hope there's some good advice coming.  Thank you.","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicPinworms, as you mentioned, do not usually travel to different aspects of the body. They are not present in the bloodstream so it is not likely that they have traveled to different parts of the body.A stool sample sent to the lab would be able to determine if you have any parasites in the stool.Blood tests for complete blood count and ESR would determine if any infection is present.You are also correct in saying that using these medications persistently is too much, this is the reason you should have the tests done to see if you need to still take them.A gastroenterologist  or infection control specialist may the best doctor for assessment.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi, i'm a 21 year old college student and i was diagnosed with Chron's when I was bout 11.

HBsAg is the surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Positive test indicates presently you are having hepatitis B infection. Positive HBsAg tests can be due to recent vaccination against Hepatitis B virus. However, this positivity is unlikely to persist beyond 14 days post-vaccination. HBeAg is envelope antigen and is a hepatitis B viral protein. Positive test is an indicator of active viral replication and states the person is infectious. It means the person infected with Hepatitis B is likely transmit the virus on to another person. Your test results states that you are positive for Hepatitis B but not in infectious state. You can be treated with antiviral medications and interferons. Kindly consult Physician with the reports for evaluation of the same and further management.

Symptoms what you is experiencing could be due to recurrence of yeast infection along with associated bacterial infection. This may be due to poor hygiene or due to transmission by asymptomatic partner during intercourse. If the infection recurs again and again, the following things needs to be done: 1. Maintenance therapy like a regimen of oral fluconazole tablets once a week for six months or clotrimazole as a vaginal suppository used once a week for six months can be used. 2. Treating partner too if the partner has symptoms of a genital yeast infection (balanitis). Along with this, you need take a course of metranidazole to counter bacterial infection. Other measures which needs to be taken care are the following: 1. Wash the area with warm water and mild antiseptic twice daily until the symptoms subsides. 2. Abstain from sexual activity till your symptoms subside completely. 3. After using the toilet, wipe from front to back to avoid spreading yeast or bacteria from anus to the vagina or urinary tract. 4. Wear loose fitting cotton undergarments that helps keep your genital area dry and doesn't hold in warmth and moisture. 5. Change pads or tampons often during periods. 6. Use vaginal anti-fungal medicines which are available for 1-day, 3-day, and longer courses, depending on the strength of the medicine. 7.

I had testing done with lifeline November 2016 and it showed a mild to moderate blockage in the carotid artery. I started about 4 months ago having dizziness when I bend over to pick up something, empty the dishwasher, etc. It is not every day, but some days it is all day and I have to stop and just lie down. It only occurs when I bend over. It has been recommended that I have a heart catheterization but I would like to have my carotid artery checked out first. Could there be a causal relationship between a partially blocked carotid and this type of dizziness. (The room does not spin, it is lightheadedness following bending over.)","Doctor":"Hi, The cause of dizziness is likely the vestibular system. Carotid artery blockage may cause dizziness because carotid arteries are important to supply oxygen to the brain. If the occlusion or stenosis is severe (more than 70%) it may cause dizziness or vision problems. Up to 60% occlusions usually do not cause any symptoms. But dizziness while bending is more suggestive of the vestibular system (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) rather than carotid artery stenosis.

Although tuberculosis is contagious,it generally takes a few weeks of treatment with TB medications before you're not contagious anymore.Following preventive measures are recommended to prevent the spread of infection to house hold contacts (family members):1. Ventilate the room. Tuberculosis germs spread more easily in small closed spaces where air doesn't move. If it's not too cold outdoors, open the windows and use a fan to blow indoor air outside.2. Cover your mouth. Use a tissue to cover your mouth anytime you laugh, sneeze or cough. Put the dirty tissue in a bag, seal it and throw it away.3. Wear a mask. Wearing a surgical mask when you're around other people during the first 3 weeks of treatment may help lessen the risk of transmission.4. And all the family members should be given the medication Isoniazide (INH) daily for 3 months if the Mantoux test shows POSITIVE reaction.Hope the suggestions given above could be useful."},{"Patient":"I had cataract surgery Monday, and it was very successful.

Toxoid is indicated for booster injection only for persons 7 years of age or older against tetanus. Injury in any form which has an open wound or penetrative is an indication for taking injection as it carries a risk of contacting tetanus. Ideally it needs to be taken within 24 hours after an injury to be more effective. However, one injection would offer protection for a period of 6 months. Hence, if your mother has only an abrasion of the skin without any penetrative wound, then there is no absolute necessity to take the injection. It can be managed by cleaning the wound with antiseptic and applying antibacterial cream. Otherwise, with penetrative wound, it is a must, along with taking other measures. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best."},{"Patient":"The symptoms of tetanus are due to Encapsulated Clostridium tetani. The growth of Clostridium tetani in a wound. Hemolysins produced by Clostridium tetani. An exotoxin produced by Clostridium tetani. All of these.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. Tetanus is an infection characterized by muscle spasms. It is caused by an infection with the bacterium Clostridium tetani. Signs and symptoms of tetanus may appear anytime from a few days to several weeks after tetanus bacteria enter your body through a wound. The average incubation period is seven to eight days. C. tetani is an anaerobic bacterium, it and its endospores thrive in environments that lack oxygen. The symptoms of tetanus is caused due to exotoxin (neurotoxin) produced by the organism. Tetanus toxin initially binds to peripheral nerve terminals and is transported within the axon and across synaptic junctions until it reaches the central nervous system. It becomes rapidly fixed to gangliosides at the presynaptic inhibitory motor nerve endings and block the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) across the synaptic cleft. Due to this, the nervous impulses cannot be checked by normal inhibitory mechanisms which leads to production of generalized muscular spasms characteristic of tetanus.

I understand your concern. Symptoms what you are experiencing could be due to recurrence of yeast infection. This may be due to poor hygiene or due to transmission by asymptomatic partner during sex. Kindly do the following to overcome the problem what you are facing: 1. Wash the area with warm water and mild antiseptic twice daily until the symptoms subsides. 2. Abstain from sexual activity till your symptoms subside completely. 3. After using the toilet, wipe from front to back to avoid spreading yeast or bacteria from your anus to the vagina or urinary tract. 4. Wear undergarments that helps keep your genital area dry and doesn't hold in warmth and moisture. 5. Change pads or tampons often during periods. 6. Use vaginal anti-fungal medicines which are available for 1-day, 3-day, and longer courses, depending on the strength of the medicine. 7. Along with it, you can use vaginal boric acid capsules, which are available over-the-counter. Do not use this medication if you are pregnant. If the infection recurs again and again, the following things needs to be done: 1. Maintenance therapy like a regimen of oral fluconazole tablets once a week for six months or clotrimazole as a vaginal suppository used once a week for six months can be used. 2. Treating your partner if your partner has symptoms of a genital yeast infection (balanitis). Hope the information provided would be helpful.

The yeast infection recurs again due to-     - insufficient medication in first course. Slightest of yeast hidden in vaginal folds can flourish back & cause symptoms.That';s why usually repeated courses are advised for complete irradiation of infection.    - Mostly both sex partners need treatment.

Staphylococci infection will be associated with formation of pustules or puss. For yeast infection I would suggest ointments containing anti fungal agents like Miconazole for local application.

The WIDAL test report you have posted doesn't seem to state that it is positive for typhoid fever with 1:80 dilution. You need to repeat it after 3 days to know weather the titres are rising or not.

Scabbing feels as if it is spreading further back, could possibly be in sinus and throat; C.T. shows particles in sinus cavity and throat feels dry and raw (adequate fluids consumed).Phlegm thickness felt in sinus cavity with postnatal drip, heaviness in chest and chronic cough.  Heart problems ruled out; pulmonary treatment, no avail; gastrologist ruled out stomach with endoscopy.Currently, on no medication, taking fish oil and milk thistle for one month, for diagnosis of poor liver function.  Feeling very ill, no doctor takes this seriously.  I feel my condition began with the scabbing after  septoplasty and sores remain.   I heard open sores in the nose can cause  bacteria in the blood, could this have caused all my problems?  If  not,  What could be the problem?","Doctor":"Dear friend, The simple answer is yes. Bacteria can migrate from infected open sore to the blood stream, a condition called Bacteremia. However, bacteremia will lead to SIRS (systemic inflammatory respond syndrome) and sepsis (SIRS plus bacteremia). These will lead to fever/chill and the patient will be very ill. These condition are often very rapidly developing and associate with high mortality. Giving your current symptoms, it is unlikely that bacteremia can explain your symptoms.

Thank you for your question.I understand your concern.Let me try and help.You seem to be having an infection probably an abscess.The  throbbing pain is due to the pus collection.So the best thing to do would be to visit a clinic where a general physician would let out the pus,clean and dress the wound and prescribe a course of antibiotics( according to your pus culture) along with analgesics if necessary.Even if you were to stay at home you would still need a course of antibiotics such as co-amoxiclav  which is a prescription medicine.Another thing I would like to point out is if you are still breast feeding your baby ,you might want to be careful about which medications you take.You can use painkillers such as Paracetamol 500 mg three times a day for pain or fever , but you will get complete relief only if the pus is released from the site of the wound.So my advice is still to consult a GP in your area.Hope you found this information useful.Take careThanksDr .

I read online some folks talking about fibromyalgia, but I have never been diagnosed with it or had any of the other symptoms. Very healthy otherwise!  This just keeps happening.","Doctor":"Hello, and thank you for your question.Fortunately, you probably do not have fibromyalgia.  There are several possible causes of pain just in the toe.  If there is a pinched nerve in the lower spine, it can cause pain that can be just in one toe.  If this is the case, you may find that the pain is worse with change in position, such as lying flat or standing up.Pain in the toe, typically the big toe, is common in a disorder called gout, in which the body has too much uric acid.  The pain usually lasts a few days at a time, and is usually associated with redness and swelling.Pain in the toes can be caused by corns or other skin problems that look small but feel very severe.Pins and needles, shooting, on-and-off pains can be caused by irritation to a nerve by diabetes, by lack of vitamins such as B12, or by pressure - similar to the \\"foot falling asleep\\" feeling we get sometimes if we cross our legs too long.Fibromyalgia, on the other hand, is usually a \\"pain all over\\" problem - back pain, neck pain, arm pain, knee pain, without another cause such as arthritis.  It usually does not cause just one part of the body to hurt - most patients say that \\"everything hurts\\".In my practice, I start with finding out as much as I can from the patient about how the pain feels and how long it has been going on, and if it seems related to anything else.  Then we examine the foot to look for anything going on with the skin, check if the nerves of the foot are normally sensitive, not as sensitive as usual, or more sensitive, and then we may check blood tests to detect diabetes or vitamin deficiency or other problems as needed.Fibromyalgia is diagnosed by obtaining a careful history of where the patient is having pain, other medical problems, and completing a physical exam including what is called a \\"painful point\\" exam where the doctor pushes at certain places in the body - on the back and near the joints - to see if this causes pain.I hope that my answer to your question is helpful.  If you have any further questions, please check back with us.  I hope your toe is much better soon."},{"Patient":"my wife got hives two days ago after having sore mouth with white bumps.

Another cause could be skin reaction due to hormonal change during puberty , androgen hormones stimulate more sebum to be produced and a greater amount of skin cells to proliferate. I would suggest you to exfoliate gently once or twice a day with a salicylic acid-based exfoliant. You should apply miconazole ointment for local application. You should take  fluconazole tablet for oral intake. Wash your face using a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water.

I understand your concern. Itching sensation in the rectum with a small hole that bleeds is nothing but 'anal fistula'. You need to consult Surgeon and get a per rectal examination to know the status of it. Accordingly, you need to undergo surgery called 'fistulectomy' to cure your illness. You need to avoid constipation by consuming diet rich in fibres along with consuming good quantity of water and taking laxatives, if necessary.

Initially alopathy medicine was given to her but not cured & then I switched over to homeopathy for quite some time. But whenever she gets veezing it is very severe & only remedy is nebulisation for 2 - 3 times. Is there any permenant cure for this. Am not able to see my daughter suffering from veezing like this & due to this she also misses her classes.","Doctor":"Hello, and thank you very much for your question.  Wheezing that comes and goes such as you describe is usually caused by asthma.  In most cases, there is not one single treatment to cure it and make it go away forever.  However, many children with asthma get much better as they grow up.  If allergies are causing asthma, then allergy shots can be very helpful.  For most people with asthma, there are preventive medicines, often given as inhalers so that the medicine gets right into the lungs where it is needed, that help cut down how often and how severe the wheezing is.  The hard part is getting a child to use a medicine every day or twice a day for months so that they won't get sick later.  They feel fine today - why do they need the medicine?  But lots of tests, and my experience in my practice confirm, that taking preventive medicine such as inhaled steroids every day can help prevent the wheezing from occurring as often, and keep it from getting as bad when it does happen.Your doctor may be able to help you develop an Asthma Action Plan, which helps you plan what medicines to give your daughter when she is feeling fine, what to do when she is starting to have some wheezing, or starting to get a cold that is likely to cause wheezing, and then what to do when things get severe.Also - people with asthma should make sure they get their flu vaccine and ask their doctor if they need a pneumonia vaccine.I hope this information has answered your questions.  If you have further questions please check back with us.  I hope your daughter is doing much better soon!"},{"Patient":"Hi, back in the begining of November I caught what I thought was a cold.

Getting bad odour from the skin of the wart which appears broken with a little bit of pain around your anus suggests you could be having 'anal fistula'.

Kindly do the following to overcome the symptoms:1. Remove the Stinger by scraping the area with a fingernail or by using tweezers to remove it.

Treat Symptoms (a) For pain, take an over-the-counter painkiller like acetaminophen or ibuprofen. (b) For itchiness, take an antihistamine like loratidine or cetrizine.

(not MRSA). Was put on another antibiotic and follow-up appt showed fungal infection. I m now on a 15 day treatment (Fluconazole) and 6 week nasal nebulizer treatment (amphotericin) for the fungal. I also tested positive last week for Influenza and was put on Tamiflu for 5 days. Now I have hives developing on my body. All of this is crazy to me....why so many infections (bacterial, virus and fungal) in a short amount of time? I m 44 yr old female, 5 4, 140lbs, non-smoker, non-drinker. Any suggestions on tests to determine if I have an immunodeficiency disorder? Thanks!","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for asking us on HCM.You have been treated heavily with antibiotics, antifungals and even antivirals - all these can undermine your immune system, making you more sensitive to the environment. Other factors that can suppress or disturb the immune system include sudden weight changes, stress, steroids and hormonal dysfunction.You are in your 40's, of normal weight - unless you have had a significant infection in the past that could have lead to immunodeficiency, I do not see the need to test for it. You could do a baseline blood test (full blood count, liver and kidney function) just to make sure all is well after taking so much medication. I suggest trying to rebuild your immune defense. Start taking fish oil generously (2 - 4 capsules daily), vitamin C with zinc, probiotics and antioxidants to start with. Be sure to stick to a nutritious diet rich in lean protein, vegetables and fruits. Hydrate and sleep well and do exercise regularly if you aren't already doing so. Where the hives are concerned, you could take a short course of antihistamines. Soaking in oatmeal and applying a pre-colled moisturizer can greatly help with symptoms. Use gentle skin cleansers and do not rub at your body with a rough towel after bath. Use soft towels and dab gently.I hope this helpsThank you"},{"Patient":"in year2000 my esr 256 and i had a problem of cold and cough. during that period i used to take oxygen daily at least five or six times a day. this problem was started in the year 1995 at that time the esr was 65 and some skin problem started .but by certain skin medication the skin problem resolves.i thought evrrthing got fine.but the esr goes on incresing.5years i took the medicine. every doctor gave me tuberculosis medicine but the problem does not solve. than my family doctor gave me 15days medicine and i got fine. but in the year 2012my esr again was 36and i suffered from demographism and year 2013i suffered from urticaria and now in year 2015my esr is 76 and again the same problem of cold and cough started. wat shall i do now. why does it occur again","Doctor":"Hi Dear,Welcome to HCM.Understanding your concern.

They diagnosed at the time double pneumonia, pleurisy and noted a torn tricuspid in the right atrium. Throughout most of my teen's I came down with what appeared to be flu like symptoms as well as diarrhea. Usually within a few hours to a day I was running again.  In my late teens and early twenties I was hospitalized so many times with microbacterial pneumonia's, again a dose of antibiotics and fluids, running again. Then in my 30's I started having real bad cramps in my lower stomach as well as enlarged lymphnodes in my groin area. Stools have been dark and fluid with mucous present. Wipples disease has been considered and I do believe thats on the right track. However athe biopsies were done in my small intestine with some damage to the villi, (unknown) as well as a flattened duodenum but what showed up was h-pylori that they couldn't eradicate on 4 occasions. I have had lots of episodes of bile being brought up, nausea and of course continued fatty like stools. I wake up with dislocated knee's and recently my left leg was somewhat out of socket on the outer hip/leg. My optic nerves have noted atrophy/degeneration noted and I have a spot under the right eye that has stayed with me for about a year now. Its red and flakes with white dead skin daily. My nose and cheeks often show hyper-pigmentation or seemingly fast skin growth(?) Going for the morning ritual for the last three years is excruciating to the point of crying, remember its mostly liquid coming out although a rare hard stool is the worse, almost to the point of passing out. I am treated at present with ms-contin long release, 1000mg twice daily and 10 mils per mg, 3-5 mils every 4 to 6 hours as needed of the liquid morphine. The ytried to used gabapentine but that didn't og over too well and Lyrica doesn't touch it. The liquid morphine lets me do the morning thing with very little pain and formed stools, most of the time no blood and little mucous. in 2008 I contracted MRSA which prevented the treatment for Whipples. All I know is I am exhaustedc within an hour or two of being awake but I deal with it and try to live and work normally as possible but some days are a write off. I am not depressed just bothered with it all. My doctors are giving up, that bugs me but I understand. I also receive lidocane therapy which does help but because they can pin the diagnosis they now won't treat me for Whipples because they can't confirm it.

A proper history of yourself should help you to zero in on this. Many have allergies to different things ranging from pollen, dog hair, cat hair, sesame, peanut butter etc. You will have to identify the allergen that you have come into contact with in the recent past. Although there are tests to identify this, you should understand that you cannot possibly test yourself for the 900+ allergens that are out there.

However your it has no relation with your period.  You have menstruation with shorter cycle.  You should consult gynecologist for that.  You need examination and ultrasound study.

Use medicine prescribed by your doctor after examining , learn exact way of application.     - If medical treatment does not respond, / the warts are wide spread, surgical treatment is recommended.   * Infection is carried by sexual contact. It is not related to ejaculation/ pre cum.So you have all the possibility of catching infection, you should get consultation of a gynecologist.   -* Prevention of infection is only by use of condom.   * Genital warts show after few weeks or months of sexual contact.    - Your doctor would diagnose it with mere inspection.    - diagnostic tests include - Pap smear or DNA test.

On top of it, I have had lymphnodes removed in the past and I have been neglecting the fact that I have had one in the same spot where I had had them removed for about 5 years now... It is painless and behind my ear. However, I am wondering if my pain intolerance is related to the lymphnode? Overall-- I m tired, sore, dizzy, and have no appetite... I haven t eaten in almost 4 days because I really can t even think about food. I m unable to sleep-- I wake up drenched in sweat when I do finally fall asleep... what is going on with me","Doctor":"Hi, to answer your question, pain intolerance is not related to lymph node removal but if you feel pain while turning your head it could mean a muscle or bony injury. If you feel tired, dizzy and have lost your sleep & appetite, you could have an infection running, with or without fever too because when you sweat, your body's temperature goes down, helping you feel normal and then you feel better and sleep. This is why you need to see a doctor soon to diagnose if any injury is causing the pain as well as talk to him if a blood test can be done to check your WBC count and rule out any infections.

Later she had half a banana with oj and had no problem.  For lunch she was eating a Healthy Choice meal with spaghetti and some chicken and garlic.  She had another fit, much shorter this time, where again she coughed up what she had eaten.  Both times she had the coughing fits she said her upper chest was tight which was relieved after she coughed up the stuff.My mother just turned 99, takes 50 mg metoprolol in the morning, 25 mg at night.  She also takes 20mg of generic lasix and 10meq liquid potassium.  She is supposed to start back on coumadin 3mg tomorrow.  She was hospitalized in early january with coumadin toxicity and rectal bleeding, which turned out to be internal hemmorrhoids.  She has had 2 banding procedures  and tolerated that well.She is taking a baby aspirin until she starts back up on the coumadin, and I will give her that in about an hour.  I took her blood pressure this morning right after the coughing fit and her pressure was up to 170 over 102.  I took it again when she was coughing recently, and it was about the same.  I figured I would take it again after she has sat quietly for an hour.  When she came out of the hospital she  was using only 1 of her pills, the metoprolol.  Her nifedipine was added back in but was bringing her pressure too low.  She was switched to generic Norvasc but that made her ankles swell and she was not able to lay down without feeling overwhelmed. She did have some fluid in the lungs. That drug was stopped and she was put back on her diuretic but at a lower dose.  She improved with that.  However, she says she feels blah and sleeps often during the day and then can't sleep at night.  She will feel anxious in the morning but usually that improves in the afternoon.  Because her ankles are not elevated her ankles  swell.  I asked her how she's feeling now and she said pretty good.  Sorry to ramble like this but she never had 2 fits in one day.  In the past she has had a fit if the bread was too thick or dry, but she never reacted to the chicken margherita before.    The family too tends to run to dry sinuses and post nasal drip, which I'll use an over the counter saline solution for to open up the nasal passages.Any thoughts?","Doctor":"Hi, its possible that your mother's coughing fits account to be normal, since it was a dry breakfast, and once provoked a cough fit tends to recur in such an age. I would advise to give her only semisolid food that will be easy on her food pipe and her gut since she is prone to hemorrhoids. It will be easier for her to swallow and digest if the food is more soft and watery. Her age is the reason her Gastro-intestinal tract must be narrowing, hence sometimes when swallowed too fast, food can go to the wrong pipe(viz air pipe), causing a coughing impulse, since the epiglottis is sensitive and it responds to touch by a cough impulse. Hence I would say it is nothing to worry about, when she gets this coughing spell out her in a position where she can cough out everything she swallowed since it is necessary to avoid aspirating food. After the spell, and only after the spell has subsided and she has thrown out all food, and she is in her senses, give her a glass of water that she can slowly sip n swallow, which will ease the healing. Take care. Good to know you care for your mother."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have been sick with a cold for 4 days. It started with a sore throat, then coughing, then a runny blocked nose.

I was thinking it over, and if before we have sex, i check him for visible cuts and scrapes, then surely he wont be able to infect me, or could blood be passed by cuts too small for the eye to see. As concerns kissing, im told its very low risk, but how low exactly?. I have read 'you would both need open bloody cuts/wounds in mouth to pass the blood'. What does this mean in practical terms. For example, i often bite my lip, so that may mean i have open skin on my lip. all it would need was for him to have the same (like a bitten lip) to transmit the hep c. Any advice appreciated, as really dont want to catch this.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM,I understand your concern,  Hepatitis C is a viral disease mainly transmitted through blood such as unsafe blood transfusions, unsterile needles etc, and by sexual route(very Less). Kissing can transmit the disease but it is very minimal risk and small cuts or biting lips are also considered as open wounds so this may transmit. Before going to final decision check his antibodies level for Hep C, if he is still in active phase of infection he can start on antivirals it will decrease the infectivity. During sex all the precautions such as using condoms should be followed and monogamous relationship will decrease the chance of infection. Consult your physician before taking the final call. Hope this information helps you. Have a nice day and take care."},{"Patient":"so the story is that I fell on the way from school and got injured, got 7 stiches. Yesterday got the stiches removed, and the doc said it didn't stick and it was still open (don't know how, I didn't see it), because it got contaminated.  It is pointless to sow it again since it is contaminated and something like that.

Non fatiguing means,exercise that don't let you fatigue - mild to moderate exercise.My dear friend i want to share here that exercise is safe and effective when carefully prescribed and monitored by experienced health professionals and you must also consult nearby physiotherapist.Exercise is more likely to benefit those muscle groups that were LEAST affected by polio.  Cardiopulmonary endurance training is usually more effective than strengthening exercises, especially when activities are paced to allow for frequent breaks and strategies are used to conserve energy - means do not fatigue yourself while exercising.Heavy or intense resistive exercise and weight-lifting using polio-affected muscles is not advised, as this can further WEAKEN rather than strengthen these muscles.

I know rectal is more accurate and I feel more at ease knowing im been as accurate as possible.

Or would I be looked at as if I had two heads?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to the HCM,I understand your concern, regarding body temperature measurements, there are many ways such as reactal, oral, axillary or tympanic membrane etc. The rectal measurements will be usually 0.5°F (0.3°C) to 1°F (0.6°C) higher than an oral temperature. Rectal temperatures are generally thought to be the most accurate for checking a young child's temperature not for the adults. A rectal temperature is generally considered to be the most accurate, and the standard for monitoring the core body temperature, but it is generally not recommended for use in patients, due to the risk of rectal perforation and tears with this method and also in relation with hygiene and sanitation rectal is not preferred in clinics for adults.

(Triglyceride 540, HDL30, and total chol 209) My Tsh is also back to 4.27 while being on the dose of 125mcg of levothyroxine. My question is two-fold....could my lipid panel by off again because of the Hashimotos, and is it safe to take Tricor along with Simvastin and Zetia. Of course I am distressed that my numbers are way out of range (even though I follow a nutricious diet and get some exercise and take my medicine).

Your test result is likely inaccurate. I advise you to take the test again. The test should be taken at least 1 week after from the current test and the medical decision should be based on both results. Hashimoto's disease is a hyper-functioning of the thyroid gland. High thyroid hormones are known to decrease cholesterol level in Hashimoto's disease. But cholesterol level may get increased in under-functioning thyroid gland. Regarding your medications: Simvastatin is a medicine that decreases cholesterol level by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis and has more effect on decreasing LDL levels. Fibrates (Tricor) decreases TG levels, and Ezetimibe (Zetia) decreases cholesterol absorption from the gut. The combination is more effective than using a single cholesterol medicine but combination Tricor with Simvastatin may increase muscle pain (myopathy). Metformin has no effect on test results, it was found to decrease cholesterol level. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"Hi there, I had Septoplasty with Turbinate Reduction on Thursday 22nd and developed an infection on the wound which was slightly open but I have been told it should heal on its own.

PLEASE help this could make or break our relationship","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I understand your concern. Chlamydia is one of the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by bacteria 'chlamydia trachomatis' and it easily spreads because it often causes no symptoms.  In fact, about 75% of infections in women and 50% in men are without symptoms. Hence, it may be unknowingly passed to sexual partners. Symptoms in men produced due to Chlamydia include the following:1. Small amounts of clear or cloudy discharge from the tip of the penis.2. Pain during urination.3. Burning and itching sensation around the opening of the penis.4. Pain and swelling of the testicles. The condition can be diagnosed by use a swab to take a sample from the urethra in men or from the cervix in women and then the specimen is sent to a laboratory to be analyzed. Treatment is by administration of oral antibiotics with azithromycin or doxycycline. It is recommended the partner(s) also be treated to prevent reinfection and further spread of the disease. It is very important that you always use condoms during sexual intercourse to lower your risk of contracting or passing on infections such as Chlamydia.

What you are experiencing is an acute infection of the cyst (abscess) and hence you are experiencing pain. At this acute stage, it is not advisable to get operated. You need to take a course of antibiotics and analgesic drugs so that the infection subsides. Following this, it can be removed by surgery. Ideally, the operation can be performed under local anesthesia. Yes, to decrease the intensity of pain, it can be performed under short acting general anesthesia (GA).

It is a significant health risk for pregnant women. If a pregnant woman is infected with rubella, especially in the first trimester, it may lead to miscarriage or the fetus may suffer severe birth defects. Once a person is infected with rubella, a person would have lifelong immunity. You can infect others from 10 days before the rash appears until about 2 weeks after it disappears. Like most other viral infections, there is no cure for rubella. It is a self limiting disease and you need to wait for the period to go away. No treatment will shorten the course of rubella infection. Symptoms are so mild that treatment is usually not necessary. You need to take supportive treatment like analgesics such as paracetamol and ibuprofen for fever and headache.  If you contact rubella infection while you're pregnant, you need to discuss the risks to your baby with your doctor. Hope the information provided would be helpful.

I am a 30 year old female. BMI 28.1. Over the last 6 months I have had regular almost daily episodes of heart palpitations. I have gone to the doctor and had tests done. ECG came back with normal results. Echo came back with what doctor said is normal leakage in 3 heart valves. Had a holter monitor test done and it picked up on average 2 supraventricular ectopic complexes per hour. Total of 5 ventricular ectopic complexes. And 1 ventricular triplet during the duration of the test. The test lasted approx 20 hours. I do have a family history of heart disease. My father passed away in July 2015 from heart disease after his 10th heart attack and unfortuently took an hour to get his heart beating again which left him zero hope of recovery. He had previously a triple bypass surgery and had been living as a pacemaker dependant since December of 04. My father was diagnosed with angina when he was in his late 30 s. he was 63 when he passed away. My paternal grandmother has also been living with similar heart problems as my father for years. She is now 85. My late paternal grandfather also had a triple bypass surgery in the past. My question I guess is should in be following up with a cardiologist?

If the necessary infection prevention practices were not followed by the doctors and the nurses involved in the surgery and the subsequent plan of care, then it is possible that they had introduced the infection into the body. Also, the operation theater or room in which the surgery was performed should have had a negative pressure ventilation, with the room being disinfected as per the CDC protocol periodically. The instruments should have been sterilized using Sterrad. Alcohol-based hand rubs are a must in the ward in which your sister was treated post-operatively. Breach in any of these can lead to a post-operative wound infection.  Given that the infection has been diagnosed, you might want to focus on getting the infection treated, as  it should be the surgeon's and hospital's headache to address any lapses in the infection control practices.

You might want to give the sputum sample after the course of prednisolone has ended, preferably."},{"Patient":"I think I may have lyme disease. I have been treated for vertigo, inner ear infection, fluid behind left ear drum, tingling and numbness in my feet and legs, severe headaches, dizziness, back pain along my spine and in back of my neck...dx as being arthritis, I feel depressed, and fatiqued, and my B-12 is very low and was my Vit. D...I have been told that low b-12 can also be a sign of Lyme Disease. I do live in the country. I have felt bad and been sick for several months, made many trips to the Dr. Still feel horrible. Thanks Gwen","Doctor":"Regardless of your symptoms, I recommend that a few lab tests should be done to confirm Lym'es disease. a. Serology: screening ELISA for anti-Lyme antibody with positive titres confirmed by Western blot. b. PCR for Borrelia burgdorferiIf you have any history of tick bite, followed by erythema migrans, you can get started for treatment of Lym's disease without waiting for the serology results. Doxycycline or Amoxicillin PO for 28 days should treat Lyme's disease. If arthritis persists, IV Ceftriaxone for 2 weeks is recommended."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am a female, 25, living in Mumbai, India. I have been having severe headaches since past 3-4 days. I got the WIDAL test done for typhoid, and it showed a value of 1.4, which confirmed I got typhoid. I got a temperature of 100+. The doctor has prescribed mahacef plus tablets for 5days. I want to know if it is something very serious. I have never had typhoid before. Also, I stay away from home in a PG. Can my sickness spread to others living with me also? Should I take an off from work and go home for a week or so? Or is it possible for me to get back to work? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi,During the first week of fever, typhoid can be confirmed only by 'blood culture' and not by 'Widal' - which should be used to diagnose typhoid only from the 8th day of the fever. Also, Widal is a test known to give false positive results also.I recommend that you get a blood culture done for yourself. It will take a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 2 weeks to get the results of the blood culture. The main advantage of this test is that it precisely gives details of the antibiotics which are capable of acting against the Salmonella bacteria that caused your infection. Given the widespread antibiotic resistance that we see in typhoid, it is important that this test is done. In the interim, until the final results are out, you should start an antibiotic. You can continue with Mahacef itself, which you have already started taking.  You can change the course after seeing the results of your blood culture.I would advise you to take off from work if this is indeed typhoid. Your urine and feces will contain this bacteria. Remember to wash your hands thoroughly after you visit the bathroom every time. You are capable of disease transmission for at least 3 weeks after your complete recovery, as the bacteria keeps getting shedded in your feces until then. You do not have to be paranoid about this. These are general precautions that are adopted for all communicable diseases. Hope this helps!"},{"Patient":"I've been poorly for a couple of months, 3 weeks ago went to the doctors and last week he diagnosed me with glandular fever, I have been suffering lots with aches and pain epecially in my eyes, back of my neck and upper back and rob area, am getting better now and these symptons are not as bad as they were but have since started with the backs of my knees they have started to really ache, is this part of the post viral fatigue??","Doctor":"Yes, it is. General malaise can persist even up to 3 months. Such fatigue is fairly common in infectious mononucleosis (glandular fever). You can consider taking corticosteroids if you develop any complications."},{"Patient":"Went to my doctor today for a checkup. I had been experiencing heart flutters for the past few months. No shortness of breath, sweating, pain or cramping. Blood pressure turned out to be 190/90 and my pulse rate at rest was 41 which in itself is fairly normal for me. Never had high blood pressure before. He did an EKG and it showed a flutter while it was happening. The fluttering is constant.","Doctor":"HelloFluttering heart rate is indicative of rhythm disturbances and according to severity, type and quality it is being treated some time it may be temporary, underlying cause of it need to be found out with the high blood pressure, coronary artery disease need to be ruled out.Hope I answered your query, let me know for further assistance."},{"Patient":"I had h pylori in which was treated via antibiotic.

Currently, I have lower stomach cramps,pain,bloating,fatigue,lighthediness,nausea,lowerback pain,,random dizziiness,more frequent urination..I was retesed for hpylori and it went away..what can this be?","Doctor":"You have not mentioned the duration of your symptoms. However, the symptoms do not suggest an exacerbation of a Helicobacter pylori infection. It is more suggestive of an enteric bacterial or viral infection that must have caused an infection. You should give your urine and feces for culture and sensitivity to know what this is. Please meet your physician with these results, and he should help you in taking this further."},{"Patient":"Been sick for month,Dr. first said ear infection,throat infection and Bronchitis.Now on third antibiotic-Avelox,cough is better,swollen glands went down,but still fatigue,fever blisters healed but gums are different in mouth and have white spots on lips....should I see another doctor?","Doctor":"You have not mentioned anything about the lab investigations that were done for you. Were any samples/swabs collected from you? Was the causative organism determined? What are the results of the antimicrobial sensitivity tests?If none of these were done and you were prescribed antibiotics just on the basis of a physical examination, then you should definitely see another doctor. Just taking one antibiotic after another without ensuring if the antibiotic is capable of attacking the causative bacteria will not help you. The lesions on your gums and lips are probably a fallout of prolonged antibiotic treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here... My sister is VERY sick and we are at our wits end.

That should provide details about the epidemiology of any suspected disease and the pertinent vaccination available. Did your doctor consider mumps? It is an acute generalized viral infection causing swelling and tenderness of the salivary glands. It is characterized by fever, headache, anorexia followed by earache and ipsilateral parotid tenderness. The gland swells over 2-3 days and is associated with severe pain. Swelling can lift the ear lobe up and outward. Administering antibiotics is useless in a viral infection. You can confirm the condition by doing an ELISA test for IgM. There is no specific drug to treat this condition. Antipyretics and plenty of fluids should help in bringing down the symptoms. She will be alright in 2 weeks if this is mumps."},{"Patient":"Hiii doc..my mother hv typhoid she is in icu..she has never any improvement by 4 days in the hospital.she suffer the typhoid from the 6or7 days.she has vry complicate situation...what cn i do for her....every doc try there best but....i am helpless to my mom","Doctor":"You have not mentioned what were the tests done to confirm typhoid. Widal alone is not sufficient. Please check with your doctor if ‘blood culture’ was done. This tests not only confirms typhoid, but also provides details on the list of antibiotics that are capable of working against Salmonella bacteria. Instead of administering any antibiotic, it is crucial that only the antibiotics that were sensitive are administered. If you do not have the time for this, at least check if I.V Ceftriaxone is on the drug list. Please also watch out for any gastrointestinal and other complications that can occur due to typhoid."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answGood Evening Sir. This is Surendra from Chittoor., Andhra pradesh.

Inactive HbsAg carrier: no treatment, monitor ALT every 6-12 months, screen for HCC every 2 yearsc. chronic HBV with normal ALT: no treatment; monitor ALT every 3-6 months, screen for HCC every two years.d. chronic HBV with raised ALT: Treat with peginterferon alpha-2a or lamivudine. Adefovir dipivoxil is recommended in patients who are unable to  tolerate peginterferon. There are many other categories also, but as you have not specified which category you belong to, it will be difficult to narrow down your treatment regimen.

I was once visiting my neighbour and the cat she used to have scratshed her hand on the back side of her palm. The hand was bleeding heavily. She washed her hand, used a disinfectent, but her hand was still bleeding. She was pressuring the wound with a tissue & I saw blood in that tissue. As she was doing this, she gave me her business card to send her one of my friends' CV. I was shy not to take the card from her, so I took it. Then I put the business card aside in her bathroom on the sink counter, washed my hands while giving sometime for any blood to dry on the business card, took the card again and went home immediately. At my home, I washed my hands again. Now I didnt see any apparent drops of blood on that card but I am afraid the card had any streaks of blood on it when she handed it to me. It looked a bit reddish to me but m it' only in my imagination. I am afraid I might have caught any of the communicable diseases as Hepatitis or HIV. Back then, I also had a cut on my index finger but it was recently healed as far as I remember. I am also afraid that I might have accidentally touched my mouth or nose after taking the business card. Could you please let me know my chances of getting infected by any of the communicable diseases in this case, especially HIV? Appreciate your prompt response","Doctor":"Although it is true that HIV can spread through infected blood, you have to understand that it can happen only when the blood comes into contact with your mucosa – in other words, the blood should have penetrated your skin. This happens in needle stick injuries, or by sharing needles. In your case, I do not think you have any chance of acquiring any communicable disease, especially HIV, because:1.     You did not come into direct contact with the blood.2.     Whatever traces of blood that may have bene on the card did not penetrate your skin3.     You have not mentioned if this person who gave the card to you is positive for HIV. Even if she was positive, you still would not acquire HIV as no blood has gained penetration into your body through any open wound or cut on your skin. Please calm down and carry on. You have no reason to worry."},{"Patient":"Just been told I have an infection called citrobacrtro koseri? Started with what seemed like a urinary infection. What is this? Dr. wants to treat with doxcycline. Nervous as I developed C-diff last November from taking Augmentin. Will I get this again from doxycycline?","Doctor":"Yes, Citorbacter koseri is a bacteria that commonly causes urinary tract infection. Your doctor must have prescribed doxycycline based on the bacterial culture and sensitivity test results. It is not necessary that you will get Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea because you take doxycycline. Diarrhea in general can occur as a complication of antibiotic therapy, and such complications vary from person to person. Not all react to the antibiotic the same way. Also, Clostridium difficile-associate diarrhea is more common after treatment with specific antibiotics like clindamycin, cephalosporins (particularly 3rd generation), penicillins, fluoroquinolones, and proton-pump inhibitors. Augmentin, the drug that you took last November, contains Amoxicillin, for which diarrhea is a prominent adverse effect. Doxycycline is a tetracycline is not known to commonly cause diarrhea. It is advisable to take this drug after food, so as to minimize any chances of gastrointestinal irritation. Please go ahead and take Doxycycline as prescribed. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hi, i am 27yrs old male,from the 8 months im not feeling well ,before 8 months i felt in mild fever and body,uneasy of breathing i was diagonised as acidity,later in blood test it was widal positive,i taken treatment for typhoid for 20 days,then also i didnt feel good doc said it was post typhoid effect,after 2months again i got fever in the evening again it was widal +ve,this time also i took antibiotic for 10 days done blood culture it was negative,now again am feeling feverish right side hip pain and knee pain,again its widal+ve,1:150,mountax 23mm,chest xray normal,esnophils 14%,esr 9,tested no rat fever,no dengue,no malaria.now my doc prescribed heterozine 3 times a day,doxy 100 once a day for 30days,bcoszm forte 3times a day,and i got a blister in penal befor 8month til now tat skin is not cured ,till now i am virgin ,feeling alot what is problem with me,still im having the joint pains and right hip pain,feeling feverish 99.5 in evening.please help me out..what should i do now","Doctor":"Assuming that you are suffering from typhoid for a considerable amount of time, I'm surprised that the blood culture was negative. Widal alone should not be completely relied for concluding Widal. Also, were these tests done in a NABL or CAP accredited lab? The reports provided by non-accredited mediocre labs cannot be relied upon when ruling out such infectious diseases. Now coming to the current situation, I suspect you may be suffering from Reactive arthritis (Reiter's syndrome). This is usally characterized by arthritis, urethritis and uveitis, and often, lesions on the skin and mucous membrane. It is associated with sexually transmitted infections and gastrointestinal infections. As you have declared yourself  to be a virgin, this  syndrome could arise as a post-infection complication of gastrointestinal infections caused by bacterria such as - Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella etc. The clinical features of this syndrome - urethritis, arthritis, skin manifeatations etc closely resembles your description of your condition. Please understand that there is no diagnostic test to confirm this condition. I see that your ESR is raised, and you must also be anemic. The only treatment available for this is traetment with NSAID's for symptomatic relief (Paracetamol 500 mg thrice daily), Pan 40 (once daily before breakfast), and Sulfasalazine (Saaz 500 mg twice daily after food) - all for 4 weeks should do the trick for you.

Worm infestations can be cured by taking single adult dose of Albendazole, which is a broad spectrum anti-helmenthic drug.

The colour and smell of your urine is very worrisome - I am worried about bleeding in the bladder as a result of infection or worse, a fistula (connection between the bladder and the colon) or even a tumor. The air coming out of the urethra (pneumaturia) suggests gas-producing bacteria or gas from the colon. You need to urgently see your regular doctor and have them work you up - urinalysis, culture and sensitivity to identify and treat the offending organismrenal profile to review kidney functionultrasound and more in depth imaging studies to determine if there are diverticuli (out-pouchings in the bladder) or a fistula as a result of all the recurrent infectionsReduced or impaired kidney function does not cause lower back pain - the kidneys are located just below the ribs. However, you are at real risk for acute kidney infection and I am concerned that the recurring infections have damaged the kidneys.I am afraid that you have a major problem on your hands. I know that this is easier said than done but I urge you to remain calm, educate yourself and consult your regular doctor so that he can help investigate you and refer you on for comprehensive care.Do act quickly - please take care.Dr Shabnam"},{"Patient":"my husband gets very high fever around 103F every evening for the past 10 days.

A few hours later I checked to see if maybe I was developing a yeast infection and found a large lump on the outside of my cervix close the opening. Since then I have developed some back pain and a fever. I do have an IUD in, have had it for almost 9 months. should i go to ER or?","Doctor":"Hi there and thanks for sharing your question on HCM.Fishy smell from the vagina is usually associated with bacterial vaginosis, a bacterial infection of the vagina which is very common. Some women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) remain symptom-free for a long time. I am wondering if this is the case with you.Insertion of an IUD carries a risk of infection, BV is among the infections that can occur post IUD insertion. I am very concerned for you - the large lump outside the cervix, back pain and fever suggest a pelvic infection. I am worried that the lump might be an abscess,You need to urgently go to the ER - have them work you up. A pelvic infection can result in acute and long term complications if left untreated.Take care.Dr Shabnam"},{"Patient":"My son is 14 years old. He had a fever on Sunday of 103. Not unusual for him.

Take multivitamins tablet (to be prescribed by your treating doctor) for this problem.Since most of the drugs used in the treatment of tuberculosis can cause liver injury, hence your doctor advised to do testing for liver enzymes (SGOT & SGPT) which are normal indicating that liver is not affected by the medicines.

Newer drugs are available like simeprevir plus sofosbuvir but these are most effective in genotype 1 HCV. The effectiveness of the treatment depends on the following factors:1. Age of patient2.

I have a 12 yr old son who loves the puppy and iam very worried about him being bitten/scratched by the puppy","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM.I understand your concern about you and your son getting scratched by your newly acquired pet. It is not necessary to get rabies vaccine if the vaccinations of the puppy are complete. However, make sure you clean the wound thoroughly with soap and running water. Also make sure that your pet gets vaccinated regularly. Training of the pet is also necessary to avoid accidents at home especially with young children.Thanks."},{"Patient":"Just got back from a skiing trip.

Feel tired & lethargic.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM.The symptoms suggest pharyngitis progressing to bronchitis. Cough with phlegm leads to suspicion of lower respiratory tract infection. I suggest a mucolytic syrup to soften the phlegm and decrease the chest pain. Get a sputum culture and sensitivity done. Get a prescription for appropriate antibiotics for 7 days based on that report from a GP nearby you.

When I am laying down my heart rate is around 65 bpm and when I stand up and start walking around the house it goes to 150-160 bpm. When I go out and walk for about 10 mins I start getting really sweaty and feel hot, and sometimes I m completely out of breath. Ive been told couple years ago by my GP that my blood pressure drops when I stand up. Could this be heart failure, or Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome? Also in the past year I ve been very sedentary because of my college work, with most days not leaving the house or only walking for shorts periods of time. Is it something wrong with my heart or I m just very unfit, due to a very inactive lifestyle for the past year?","Doctor":"Hello!I passed carefully through your question and would explain that your symptoms could be related to orthostatic hypotension or intolerance. Postural tachycardia syndrome is not usually associated to drop in blood pressure values. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing a Head Up Tilt test to investigate for orthostatic intolerance. Some other blood lab tests (complete blood count, PCR, ESR, blood electrolytes, thyroid hormone levels) are necessary too.

I know it is highly irrational and i think  what i actually fear is the lack of knowlegde of exactly what is inside infected sebatious cysts / infected hair follicles.Is the discharge  harmless? , im to embarrassed to tell my actual GP my fear so have reverted to finding the answer online =]","Doctor":"Hello,a pus collection can be infectious, so taking some measures is not irrational. Just don't wipe it all the time! A sebaceous cyst and an inflammed hair follicle need different treatment unless the lesions are tiny. A cyst will have to be excised. An inflammed hair follicle with minimal pus collection may get better even by itself or with proper antibiotics. In any case, if an abscess has already formed then draining its contents is essential for the healing process. If it's a cyst removing its walls is also very important to avoid recurrence. So in conclusion, you should keep this area clean and dry. Applying warm compresses may help with pus drainage (if any). Don't be so afraid of it though, just keep it clean.

Please type your query here...hii... my uncle had typhoid last month..about 2 weeks after discharge he is now suddenly having low grade fever(99-101C) from noon to night..it starts at around 12pm and leaves by 12am..he also has headache at the time..couldit be a relapse?His blood culture was normal at the time of discharge","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for posting your query here. Did your uncle take the complete course of antibiotics for typhoid ?From the symptoms you be described with low grade fever and headache, my opinion is that he is having a viral illness now. You can ask him to wait for 2-3 days, and if fever persists, to do a blood culture and start on a course of antibiotics (what he took last time for typhoid). Importantly, ask him to take a vaccine for typhoid a month after recovery, as infection with typhoid does not protect against typhoid recurring in the future .Hygiene and hand washing before eating food, after using the toilet is to be stressed upon. As is drinking boiled water, avoiding juices and uncooked food outside as much as possible. Hope he gets better soon."},{"Patient":"my husband has TB bacteria, the bacteria settle in the lungs and begin to grow.

Please give some more information on the following:1. What are all the tests they did to diagnose TB? Egs- sputum for AFB smear, geneXpert and culture, chest x Ray etc2. Names of the medicines that he is taking for TB, and any other medicines he is on3. What are the symptoms he is having now, like loss of weight, persistent cough or fever etc4. How did they diagnose TB in the spine, abdomen etc?5. Does he have contact with anyone who has drug-resistant TB?

It is only the third day of fever, Crocin or any other fever relieving medicine has a duration of action of 4 to 6 hours only. What is more important than fever is the child s activity when there is no fever, feeding, comfortable breathing etc. If she has trouble with any of those, or has high grade fever (temperature more than 102 F) for more than 2 days from now, take her to see the doctor.

BP being on the lower side, without a high heart rate is normal in some individuals as is not a cause for concern. More important is how you feel overall, any giddiness or drowsiness, how much you are peeing etc. Rash is a part of the viral illness and will go away on its own.

The best way to get rid of them is exfoliating well with a store bought scrub, or even granules of sugar rubbed into the soap lather will do.

Dengue is a viral fever transmitted by mosquitoes. It is usually a high grade fever associated with nausea, vomiting, tiredness and hemorrhagic tendencies. What you are experiencing coldness and sore throat is not due to dengue but might be due to prodromal symptoms of bacterial infection. Also redness at the mosquito site bite cannot tell weather it is dengue or not and could have happened due to local allergic reaction.Well, if you need to confirm weather you are infected with dengue or not, kindly get the following investigations done after a week: 1. Complete blood count with peripheral smear highlighting platelet count. 2. Dengue test for antigen and antibodies. If it doesn't indicate anything related to dengue, then your doubt is cleared. For sore throat, kindly gargle with warm salt water twice daily and take decongestant syrup twice daily. Hope the information provided would be clear.

But don't soap-wash more than once a day. Doing so can increase dryness.Always wipe from front to back after having a bowel movement.Wear cotton panties (no synthetic fabrics), and change your underwear every day.Stay away from hot bath tubs and avoid whirlpool baths.No swimming until you get better.Do not douche. Douching removes the healthy and normal bacteria in the vagina that actually protect you from infections.Wear loose clothes; and, no pantyhose.Use condoms during sexual intercourse to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.If you are experiencing vaginal dryness, use a vaginal moisturizer. Apply a water-based lubricant (K-Y, Astroglide) before having sex.Avoid sexual intercourse until your symptoms improve.Limit the number of sexual-partner.Don't scratch -- you can further irritate the area.Apply Clotrimazole/Hydrocortisone vaginal cream for prompt relief. Get yourself checked for any STDs. Take Loratadine by mouth if you also have got itching around the genitals.May you get very well soon and have a wonderful time ahead.

I went jogging when it was cold outside (last wed) and have had a cough/itchy through since. I have some allergies, but didn't take anything. Coughing/sneezing got worse then i spent Sun/mon in bed with a fever, chills, spine ache (hightest temp was 100.1). I took zyrtec-D, Monday, and that helped a quite a bit. My mucous has been clear...once or twice slightly green. But at the same time i have had chest congestion and coughed up green or brown loogies. Is that from laying down for two days? Am i contagious - as far as a cold goes? I have a temp again this am of 99.0.","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for posting your query here. Yes, you are still contagious for another 3 to 5 days. It is best to use cough etiquette when you are around other people-cough or sneeze into your shoulder (not your palms), or into a tissue which you dispose. As for the brownish phlegm, if your fever is settling  and you re getting better overall, there s no need to worry about them. If you have difficulty breathing or a temperature more than 102 F, contact your physician.I suggest you take some anti histamines and montelukast if you are prone to allergies, as the climate will exacerbate your allergies.

Anemia does not cause any itchy skin rash. A picture of your rash would help to narrow the possibilities. If it just feels like 'chicken skin' on your arms and legs! try exfoliating with a scrub. If it is very dry, keep moisturising with an emollient like liquid paraffin or coconut oil (which work wonders when moisturisers don't) It is important that you take iron supplements for your Anemia .

This could predispose you to get frequent cough and viral infections. If you recoughing atleast 20 days out of 60 days, with cough disturbing sleep, it is likely that you have asthma. Inhaled steroids like fluticasone and relievers like salbutamol will greatly help (and you can use them at home)2. Abscess in armpits -It is likely that you have a bacteria called MRSA on your skin that increase the frequency of abscesses. Treatment would be to apply mupirocin ointment on your nostrils, armpits twice a day for 5 days and wash well (especially armpits and groin) with.chlorhexidine body wash. 3. TirednessPlease check your hemoglobin, vitamin D levels.and thyroid function if not already done. If you re having chronic pain and tiredness, it is also.a symptom of infectious mononucleosis.

She is now in hospital on a drip and her father is really ill with it too - how is this contracted, how long does it last and what can be taken?.","Doctor":"Thank you for your question. I appreciate your concern, especially as your granddaughter is an infant. From the history you have provided, it seems to be a viral, most probably a rota viral infection which is common among infants. It usually settles in 5 to 7 days, although a few loose stools a day can persist till 14 days. The main advice I give my patients is to not worry about the number of loose stools, but to look at the oral intake of fluids and feeds, how much urine she is passing per day and her activity. If any of the above three is decreased dramatically, or she is passing blood in her motions, only then it should be a cause for concern. I would suggest the following:1. zinc supplements for 14 days as it decreases the duration of diarrhoea2. continue breastfeeding if baby is on breast feeds3. if baby has been started on complementary feeds, to give fluids like tender coconut and buttermilk as they are very rich in electrolytes 4. the care takers of the baby to wash their hands well with soap and water after cleaning the baby, before feeding etc to avoid spread of infection.Hope this answers your question.

I appreciate your concerns and have a few queries of my own. From your post, it seems like you have been on antibiotics for the cellulitis since November 2010, is that correct ? That is a very long time..! If the cellulitis has resolved, there is no need to continue antibiotics beyond a maximum of 14 days treatment, unless it is caused by non tuberculous mycobacterium for which 6 months of the treatment you are taking would suffice. Please do stop your medication if you have no cellulitis, as prolonged antibiotics can produce problems of your own. For your hair loss, I would advice folic acid tablets daily, a high protein and iron rich diet, and some stress relieving activity such as exercise, yoga or meditation as high stress is a major cause of hair fall.Hope this helps. Do let me know if you have any further questions."},{"Patient":"went to urgent care had breathing treatement to open lungs and was given arithrimyasin and prednisone and codine and an antibiotic shot.  still no fever.  diagnosis was infection in both ears, upper resp, infection, and a sinus infection.  in the beginning had severe chills and no energy then coughing started then nasal stuffiness then ears. now phelgm is almost like gelatin and is pink i that ok, does it mean that i am getting better or should i go back?  prior to the arith.  I gad been given augmentin but it didn't work even though i stopped taking my doxycycline.","Doctor":"Hello, hope you are feeling better now. To paraphrase your question, I understand that you had chills and a cough, stuffy nose and then a ear infection. After treatment with azithromycin, you have pink sputum, is that correct? When my patients come with pink sputum, if they are not breathless or sick (in which case I would think of fluid in the lungs or heart failure causing the pink sputum), a small amount usually is not a major cause for concern. It should settle once you complete your course of antibiotics, as it could be due to the infection itself producing the colour. Do see a doctor if you have any of the following:1. Breathlessness2. High fever3. Loss of weight4. Blood in the sputumWish you a speedy recovery. Will be happy to clarify if there are any other issues."},{"Patient":"dear doctor.

She's used to be able to walk , but now she is more comfortable lying down and unable to get up easily...I am getting frantic and ready to take her to ER. Please advise","Doctor":"Thank you for your question. I appreciate your concern. From your post, I have gathered that it was initially a flu like illness and now there is one sided headache with high blood pressure. Has your mom suffered from migraine before? Severe headache could also be a sign of sinusitis and I usually recommend a 7 day course of antibiotics and steam inhalation which clears up the clogged nose and sinuses. I would suggest you take her to a physician or ENT specialist in view of her severe symptoms, and make sure she takes medication for the high blood pressure, if it does not settle with painkillers (as severe pain can lead to a temporary rise in blood pressure). Hope she gets better soon.

During her endoscopy in October, it was determined that she had a fatty liver and subsequent tests disclosed high liver enzymes. Subsequently she was directed to lose some weight, which she has been trying to do without much success, even though she exercises 60-90 minutes a day and eats very well. We even joined a weight reduction team at our health club and while she loses some weight, it seems to go back on. Can the fatty liver create a catch 22 situation, where a person cannot lose weight, because the liver is not functioning properly and slowing the metabolism down? Thanks...Arnie","Doctor":"Hi, i do care for your concern. initially fatty liver has nothing to do with the metabolism of liver, as it continued to happen normally. and fatty liver as such cause no symptoms.weight reduction is advised as because of elevated liver enzyme, as it may lead to metabolic syndrome.In weight reduction process its diet which is more of a concern then exercise, therefore to have good weight reduction diet and exercise is a must, and fatty liver has no role here.Hope I have answered your question.

Some amount of scab formation is known to take place even with use of dissolvable sutures in keyhole (laproscopic) surgeries. However, the extent of scab formation (keloid) would vary from person to person. In case it has formed bigger and you have cosmetic reasons to get its removal, it would be best removed by a Plastic Surgeon.

I have carefully worked through your case, and can well realize your health worries. Being your physician, I want to assure, I will take care all of your medical concerns according to the latest medical guidelines.Glandular fever is a different disease and hepatitis is different.Glandular fever is also known as the Kissing Disease. So yes it easily spreads with kissing. coughing and sneezing. The Epstein Bar Virus causing the disease resides in the saliva of the patient.It is very dangerous for the babies as they have little immunity to fight against the diseases.Your partner should not share towel, tooth brush and the toothpaste, towels and other utensils commonly used at home which can get a direct contact of the human secretions. No kissing at all.Symptoms to keep a check on:High fever.swelling of the neck glands.extreme fatigue.severe sore throat.Babies leave feeding, have less frequent urination or have deranged bowel habits (don't wet the diaper frequently). So keep an eye on these indicators.Hepatitis is of different types. I think your partner have got the infection of the liver as a secondary complication of the same disease \\"the Infectious mononucleosis\\" i.e the glandular fever. There are other viruses too that may cause liver damage.   Hope I answered all of your questions.

I have been taking medication for a few years for marginal high blood pressure and cholesterol. My pressure is usually 125/75. The last exam I had ( blood test, heart condition, etc gave me a very clean bill of health) Today I was planning to go swimming at the pool for lapses, as usual, and I took an unusually substantial lunch with fried eggs and a glass of wine ,after which went for an equally afternoon nap (the wine had somehow ..knocked me off.) I was deeply asleep when I was abruptly awaken by my wife yelling something I couldn’t understand at first. It turned out she had left the stove open and the rice was burning. I got so startled for this sudden wake-up , even before knowing what it was, that my heart started racing and I felt something unusually wrong in my body. A sense of heaviness, the heart not only racing, but pounding.. I immediately took my blood pressure and I got even more startled: the first reading was a whopping 170/125. Never ever happened before! The second reading, a few minutes after was better : 145/119. Not bad for the systolic pressure, but still unusually high, especially for the diastolic reading. As a precaution, I took a 2nd blood pressure pill ( I usually take one a day) and a hot bath, after which the readings went back to normal: 120/70. I am planning to see my doctor again soon, , but in the meantime I would like to know if this sudden blood pressure hyke can be explained by the sudden wake-up, the heavy meal and the fact that the nap was in the mid-afternoon, maybe for reasons having to do with a perturbated circadian rhythm. When I nap I usually do it at around 1 p.m and I seem to recall to have had the same symptoms, but much milder after sleeping later on in the afternoon. Thanks for your comments Ittiandro","Doctor":"Hello, All the factors you have mentioned may contribute to sudden spike in blood pressure. Blood pressure generally tends to rise after meals. The palpitations must have been caused because of sudden disturbance in sleep. It is still advisable to get yourself checked by a physician and get an ECG done to rule out any other cardiac causes. Meanwhile continue monitoring your blood pressure and it is preferable to measure it in the early morning hours as it gives the most accurate readings. Hope I have answered your query.

You should visit oral physician once and get it examined. Get Orthopantomogram done to check joint positioning. Do warm saline gargles several times a day.

The following measures may prevent fungal groin infection (tinea cruris) from recurring:1. Wash your groin daily; then dry thoroughly.  The damp or moist groin is an ideal site for fungal germs to multiply. 2. Change your  underwear daily. Fungi may multiply in flakes of skin in unwashed underwear.3. Check for the fungal infection of the toes.  The fungi from athlete's foot may spread to the groin. The same creams are used to treat fungal infection of the toes and the groin.4. Do not share towels with people in communal changing rooms. Wash towels frequently &5.

Before you apply it, make sure your skin is cool and dry. Don't apply it after having a hot bath. Clean clothing should be worn after treatment.Skin sores that become infected should be treated with an appropriate antibiotic prescribed by a doctor. For the treatment of itching oral antihistamine like Levocetrizine can be taken.Bedding, clothing, and towels used should be decontaminated boiling in hot water or by dry-cleaning, or by sealing in a plastic bag for at least 72 hours.Since this is a highly contagious disease, all members of your family including recent sexual partners if any should be treated at the same time as you, even if they don't have any symptoms.Repeat the treatment process 7 days after the first application to ensure it's successful. The second application will ensure any mites hatched from existing eggs are killed.Because the symptoms of scabies are due to an allergic reaction to mites and their feces, itching still may continue for several weeks after treatment even if all the mites and eggs are killed. If itching still is present more than 2 to 4 weeks after treatment or if new burrows or pimple-like rash lesions continue to appear, retreatment may be necessary.Hope the suggestion given above could be useful in getting the treatment prescribed by your doctor."},{"Patient":"I've been having diahrea and nauseau for two weeks, they finally did a stool sample and found a heavy growth of pseudomonas fluorescens in my stool.  They started me on Augmentin to clear up the bacteria....is this the correct antibiotic for me to be on?","Doctor":"Hi & Welcome.I can understand your concern for the efficacy of Augmentin to treat Pseudomonas fluorescens.The antibiotic Augmentin is not effective for the eradication of the Pseudomonas fluorescens infection because of the resistance produced by the bacteria.Antibiotics like Ceftazidime with Ciprofloxcine are the drugs of choice to eradicate the Pseudomonal infection.  Other drugs which are effective are Imipenem, & Aztreonam.Hope this answers your query."},{"Patient":"I am in Argentina- I was at the border of Argentina and Chile in Patagonia 3 days ago and I thought that I was bitten by a friendly domestic puppy who was teething at the time.

Should we seek a second opinion?","Doctor":"hi there,Thank you for choosing healthcare magic,as regarding your question of viral load which is Undetectable after 4 weeks of treatment, yes I will agree to your physician to continue treatment for whole 6 months this because of a couple of reasons.1. viral load varies in blood at different times, i.e. sometimes it falls and sometimes it may rise(even though it may not happen everyday) but there is a possibility that at the time when your husband's blood was drawn there may be a drop in viral load at that time. so we may need to recheck it before making any further decision.2.Also viral load suggests active viral replication in blood only and does not help us with status of virus in the liver, so your doctor might want to make sure to clear it all for giving another 5 months treatment.also for a patient to be said to be cured from hepatitis C, his viral load should be If you are still not satisfied with this explanation I will advise you to seek another opinion, not needed otherwise.kind regardsDr.Fouzia"},{"Patient":"I just cut my calf on some rusty barbed wire one hour ago.

However, I just don t believe you can fake the arrhythmia I see on the EKG strip. thoughts?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You cannot fake an ECG rhythm. Occasional Ventricular premature complexes(VPCs) may be because of stress however a rhythm pointing towards Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome (WPW) needs evaluation. A 24 hour holter may help us diagnose previously undetected arrhythmia and help the treating doctor provide objective evidence of the rhythm. Hope I have answered your query.

Symptoms you are experiencing like abdominal pain and loss of appetite could be associated with jaundice, as you are suspecting. However, clinically it needs to be detected by examination of sclera in day light. Jaundice causes yellowish discoloration of skin and mucosa due to increased bilirubin levels in serum. Due to this, during the illness, you also pass high colored urine. Once suspected, jaundice needs to be proved at least by laboratory test called as 'Liver function test'. It is mainly diagnosed by Total and Direct bilirubin levels along with enzyme levels in serum. Hence you need to be clinically evaluated by Physician first followed by Liver function test done in the laboratory for confirmation. Based on the results, you would be appropriately treated.

Th possibility of viral infection like hepatitis A or B should be ruled out by the serological tests. And you must also have additional LFTs lie serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, & serum GGT.Ceftas 200 is an antibiotic effective only in infections caused by the bacteria.

Composition of Ovisterone is 'Dehydroepiandrosterone' (DHEA).  It is a naturally occurring hormone produced by the adrenal glands and reproductive organs in the body. DHEA is converted in the body to androgens & estrogens. Hence, its intake is known to improve ovarian reserves and response to ovulation induction. Thus it improves conception rates and minimizing miscarriages, thus increased pregnancy outcome. It is not a contraceptive pill.

How long does this take?

She was put on steroids to help it, since it spread to her face and neck in just 24 hours. (I did not put bleach on my daughter skin,just mine. Her skin is very sensitive.)","Doctor":"HiThank you for asking HCM.I have gone through your query. In case of such severe allergic reaction you and your daughter both need a short course of steroids. Initially steroid and anti histamine shots also will be needed. It will gradually decrease the severity and completely resolve within 5 days. If there is any discomfort like breathing problem or throat swelling then approach ER.Hope this may help you. Let me know if anything not clear.Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi, my Sig.

If this is the case then antibiotics would be needed.Additional cleaning of the infected areas with antiseptic solutions and dressings may also be indicated.There are other medications that may be added, if needed, to his heart failure medications to help with control.He may need to consider visiting another doctor for assessment and management.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I would like to get off eliquis mainly because I hate taking a pill for the rest of my life, also I am tired and hip joints starting to hurt and these may be side effects.

They state there is a minor leak in left atrial and they want to avoid possible blood clot. I understand this leakage is not uncommon. I would like to get off the medication for awhile at least to compare energy level and joint pain. There is no info except to talk to doctor. Have some people got off it by just reducing intake over a period of time.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I would explain that you can stop this drug cold turkey. But, you should know that this would increase the risk for stroke from possible paroxysmal atrial fibrillation episodes. Anyway, I would recommend taking a low dose 2.5 mg twice daily at first, to see if your symptoms are improved. Another option would be to take Aspirin instead of Eliquis. You can make the switch directly (not gradually). You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. Hope to have been helpful! Wishing all the best."},{"Patient":"Hi!

In my opinion it is  better to diagnose it by examining rather than illustrating, anyways, based upon your history, if these are red pimples with a pus then it is a pyogenic infection  mean it may be due to staph, plus  strep can also cause it  ,BUT ,  it can be a viral infection with superadded bacterial one too.

They then seem to suddenly become really itchy and swell up, becoming red, making it really painful to walk on my feet as it feels like these sections have become large, sore lumps. They seem to go away within a day or so. I have also had these symptoms on my palms. Currently there is an area of my palm like this that has spread to the inside of my wrist, which appears red and swollen and is quite tender. It feels like it is an internal thing, like there are toxins beneath the skin, as the skin feels really tight. I don't have any allergies that I know of. I don't know if any of this is related but I currently have a sore ulcer in my mouth and may have raised blood pressure (I did at my last doctors consultation), but apart from that I feel ok.

Longstanding uncontrolled hypertension ultimately does causes damage to small arteries  leading to angiopathies which may give you these symptoms  and it is also associated with neuropathies too, but again it should be diagnosed after careful evaluation by a physcian.     Another probability is that you might be having some vasculitis which is giving you these symptoms. if i am your attending physcian , i will go for FBC , ESR  , LIPID PROFILE along  with the DOPPLER ULTRASOUND OF BOTH UPPER  and LOWER LIMBS to rule out any arterial insuffciency.   if you are really concerned  do meet your doctor , he may also get your  xray of both hand and feet too.  meanwhile stay calm and continue with ur hypertension medications . you can use  TAB NEUROMET  daily along with tab AMYLIN 25 mg at night. it will help you relieve symptoms. and do meet your doctorget well soon Hope your query is adequately addressed if you still have any feel free to ask   RegardsDr Saad Sultan"},{"Patient":"My Daughter nearly aged 3 has a chest infection.

It is one of the infection known to cause high fever. Any fever crossing 100 degrees needs to be considered as high fever and there is no rule that typhoid fever always has 102 degrees or more of fever. Also, Typhoid is diagnosed by tests done on blood sample rater than recording of temperature alone. What medications you are taking is right and it is important to complete the entire course even though the fever subsides. Avoid physical exertion and take adequate rest. Keep yourself well hydrated. Consume bland diet at least for 3 weeks. This would ensure complete recovery from your illness. Hope the information provided clarifies most your quires.
