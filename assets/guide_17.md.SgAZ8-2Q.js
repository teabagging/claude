It lasts a second or two but may repeat several times before stopping in five minutes or so. I went out in the garden today to dig a bit and wearing my HR monitor (I have got health anxiety, anxiety disorder as well as depression). As I was digging, the pain started hurting with each heartbeat. I looked at my monitor and it read 138 bpm. I am 70 years old and have been on medication (Benzodiazepines) for over 50 years for panic attacks and general anxiety. Two years ago I felt similar pain but not to this extent. I went to ER but nothing was found (the doctor said it could be costochondritis but definitely not my heart). I get bloodwork quarterly and everything was fine except cholesterol which was 235. I tried a statin but the muscle pain was too great. In my EKG I have RBBB or LAFB which 14 years back after a stress test I was told that I was probably born with it. I had gone to see the cardiologist then because of getting skipped beats and GERD he told me to ignore them. Last time I had an EKG was in the ER for six months when I had a weird pain in back and side. They checked out heart anyway and said it was fine. Probably just a colicky gallbladder. I have had stones for more than 20 years and had no surgery. So I hesitate to go to the ER again. My local doctor just closed. HR is still 88 while lying down right now. Usually, my resting heart rate is under 67. Currently, I am on Lorazepam 2 mg, Prevacid 15 mg and baby Aspirin.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your history and it does not appear to be an ischemic pain. Ischemic pain will not be sharp and so short lasting. So the possibilities are costochondritis and pleuritic or pleuro-pericarditis. Do you get an increase in pain on application of pressure at the same site, if yes it supports the diagnosis of costochondritis? Also, do you have any history of recent upper respiratory tract infection like a cough, rhinitis, fever, etc., if yes it points to pleuro-pericarditis which is an infection of the lining of lungs and heart which is usually viral and self-resolving? The possibility is of gastritis and reflux disease. Do you also have upper abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, burping, increase in pain on food, sour water feeling in throat or chest burning? These are the other symptoms and may be associated. Increase in heart rate is likely due to anxiety of pain or as a reflex to pain. So, get with some more details of the symptoms as I explained above. Meanwhile, you should get prescribed some NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) for this pain along with antacids like tablet Naproxen 250 mg two times a day or other like Ibuprofen along with tablet Pan DSR (Pantoprazole) or Esomeprazole Domperidone combination before breakfast once a day for five days. So overall, it does not appear to be a matter of worry. However, it is better to get yourself examined by a local doctor.

Just recently my gums have gotten worse. I think it is gingivitis but my gums have been deteriorating and I have started to brush, floss, and rinse with mouthwash every day for the past two weeks and it has been getting worse. Kindly help. Currently, I am taking Ibuprofen.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the picture you have attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is definitely a gum problem but not gingivitis. It seems like a gum injury more like a cut or bruise. Listerine mouthwash and fluoride toothpaste will not work for this. I advise you to visit a gum specialist immediately and go through the blood count check. You might also have to take antibiotics. Before I suggest medicines please let me know if you have got any drug allergies. Meanwhile, you shall apply ointment Chlorhexidine and Lignocaine combination (Corsodyl ointment) over the sore gums to help to heal. Also, avoid hot and spicy food and do not brush aggressively on that side, please. This will worsen the condition. Do not try to rub salt over the area as well.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have a very good family, who have fulfilled all my wishes. When it comes to my studies, even my parents never forced me to study more than my capacity. All through my school and college, I scored more than 80 %. But when it comes to solving analytical questions and quantitative aptitude, I am very slow when compared to other people. Right from school, I have this tendency to solve the problems slowly or make a lot of mistakes. The worst part is, from childhood my brain has not matured in how to solve a problem through critical thinking and applying the skill, that is very much needed in mathematics. After graduation, I got a job, which I was not happy with. After working there for almost a year, I got frustrated with the work, as I was not learning anything that I expected. I love coding and learning advanced stuff visually. I am always in mind to achieve great things in studies and job which many people are currently doing. I thought if they can do it, then I too can do it. I resigned my job after a lot of thinking for many days, as money does not matter to me, but only learning does. When I try to do anything that I believe is great, then I tend to get lazy. I prepared a lot for the exam, but I scored a very low score. I am shattered as my hard work is wasted. I am preparing for the exam a second time, and I am again feeling lazy. The thought of getting a low score is affecting my preparation now. I get distracted by web browsing and TV for 1 to 2 hours. As I stay alone, I feel very sleepy and drowsy. I think my brain is converting all the ATP into ADP, and I sleep off for 3 to 4 hours, after studying for a couple of hours. Whenever I try to concentrate, all the negative feelings are coming to my mind. But, I motivate and pick up myself, and study. I am very lazy and less energetic than before. It is like someone has stolen all the energy that was within me. Also, I am feeling lonely, I thought a little walk outside would help me freshen up. Now, I have come to a situation that when I see the books, I am demotivated and feel unhappy to prepare for the exam. This is the most important time of my life to prepare well and pick up my career, but a lot of fear and negative thinking is present in my mind. What is wrong with me?","Doctor":"Hi.

I have a history of depression, anxiety, self-harm, drug abuse, obsessive thoughts, and chronic fatigue. I have gained 40 lb weight in the past six months. Previously, I was diagnosed with borderline personality, and have been on two psych holds within the last five years, completed two three-day stays for in-patient treatment, most recently four months ago. I was told I might be bi-polar. I cannot motivate myself to get out of bed unless I have to go to work. I have a history of toxic relationships and abandonment issues. I cannot seem to stop thinking about what happened with my most recent relationship even though I know he was not a good person and did many bad things to me. I have overwhelming feelings and feel things in extremes. I have a history of drug abuse, mostly Klonopin, Xanax, and pain medication. I am clean since four months. I have a history of reckless behavior. Now that I am not abusing pills, all I do is sleep and eat and compulsively spend money. I feel lost like I do not fit anywhere. I am upset about my weight gain, but cannot motivate myself to do anything about it. I want to go back to school but cannot bring myself to do the work. I was seeing a psychiatrist five years back for similar issues from another relationship and was diagnosed with borderline personality and was put on multiple medications that did not help me. So, I stopped going and stopped taking the meds and felt better. I got myself together and went to school and graduated with honors with associates in radiologic technology. I was alright for those three years and it has been pretty downhill the past year since I met someone else and it went horribly wrong and affected my job, which I quit due to my ex being there, which then cost me the job I was just offered because my previous boss gave me a bad reference. I lost the opportunity at a great job, and since then it has been very hard. I got reckless. I was taking way too many pills. My relationship with my mother was strained, and it got out of control. I cut my wrists with the idea that I did not care what happened, and that day I was admitted for an inpatient treatment for three days. I have not abused anything since then, but I am miserable. I just want to know what is wrong and why I feel things in such extremes.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your problem and understand your concern. I understand you were diagnosed as suffering from borderline personality disorder (BPD) and responded poorly to treatment despite multiple medications. In BPD, usually, you do not respond to medicines. You also need psychotherapy namely DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) in which you are explained about your behavior and emotions and how to control maladaptive behavior. Associated depression is a contributing factor in not being able to get out of bed. Because of BPD, or maladaptive behavior, you are having these extreme emotions. And, as with many persons, weight gain is a common side effect of the psychotropic drugs. So, do regular exercises to control weight. Thanks and regards.

A urine analysis report done during the UTI (urinary tract infection) episode, will give us a better picture of the number of pus cells. I request you to share two such reports of tests done during two different episodes. Due to the short length of the urethra, the bacteria of the perineum are inevitably introduced into the bladder.

Recurrent vertigo and nausea and associated neck pain which is radiating to shoulders and hands are suggestive of a rare form of vertigo known as cervical vertigo. Usually, the causes of cervical vertigo are acute cervical spine injury, cervical spondylosis, cervical spondylolisthesis, severe cervical myofascial pain, etc. The neck muscles play an important role in the maintenance of our balance and any abnormalities of the cervical spine with associated muscles can cause severe attacks of vertigo. Antivertigo drugs can give symptomatic relief but you may need to consult an orthopedist or a spine surgeon for further treatment.

Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

What was your dietary intake in 1-2 days prior to test? Amy family history of major gastrointestinal diseases? Now stool SCFA and butyrate are slightly out of range which is fine to have. Also, lysozyme is slightly elevated and it is a marker of inflammation in bowel which may be due to multiple reasons like IBS, IBD or diarrhea, etc. So it' is a nonspecific marker.   But important factor is stool for occult blood, which is positive. So there is some minor bleeding is going on within a bowels. This is the abnormality which should be evaluated further. This has multiple causes ranging from IBD to polyps, etc. However, some dietary factors like some fruits, vitamin C, iron supplements, nasal bleeding, hemorrhoids, etc, can give positive results.  Now, we would like to get total of 3 samples for occult blood testing and if it remains positive subsequently then needs endoscopy, or even if having symptoms then still need endoscopy.

I have seen your health investigations (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There are different possibilities that may cause weakness of one side of the body as in your case. Your healthcare center has touched every possible cause to investigate the reason behind this weakness on one side of your body and there came out to be nothing like this. I have extensively reviewed your MRI reports and other blood work. There are some red flags that bother me and indicate that these may be the cause of your issue. These are metabolic disturbances. In simple words, if your car engine's mechanical parts are all fine but there is diesel instead of petrol, your car would not work. Our body is a complex machinery and it cannot run normally if there is no controlled and balanced environment inside the body. Harmony (homeostasis) and rhythm in different metabolic products inside the body is needed at all times in order for the body to work normally.

I am having a musculoskeletal problem. 14 years back I was diagnosed bone TB and treatment was taken. Problem recurred four years later and diagnosed as ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Despite on biological injection for 10 years, efficacy reduced and became ineffective affecting mobility very badly. Ten months back another rheumatologist said it is not AS and suggested me to take massage treatment. I had a second opinion with another rheumatologist, she also confirmed it is not AS. She said myofascial pain syndrome and another pain specialist called it fibromyalgia. Hence, I am not sure about the diagnosis. As it stands it may be myofascial pain syndrome or fibromyalgia. As per their advice, I stopped all medications for AS and is continuing massage. With very very limited mobility, presently it has improved (approximately 500 m once or twice a day).Coming to the problem related to heart for past ten years (admitted for AS) till today, I had taken ECG and echo several times. I underwent angiogram since I could not complete TMT. I have provided all these details in the attachment in chronological order for easy reference. I have also attached my latest blood test report.Presently, I am feeling very mild fast breathing (age related) during walking (500 m) and subsides in two minutes after the walk, but no pain. No difficulty if walk a shorter distance. I had chest squeezing (costochondritis) like feeling losing up to one minute many times earlier. I never felt pain in other places. When I informed my rheumatologist earlier, he mentioned if it is severe it can be looked into. Hence, I have not given much weight, thinking it is non-cardio. The problem I am facing is, whenever I take ECG, I was frightened stating heart attack took place. When I went to the hospital ten months back for vomiting, I was put in ICU. They conducted blood tests, echo and seen angiography report. There was no indication of attack and then got discharged.Five months back, the doctor mentioned it as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), said is there from childhood, ECG showed an abnormality, nothing to worry, suggested not to do strainful work and prescribed medicine. I consulted the doctor who attended me ten months back. When I asked him about ECG abnormality, he did not accept HCM and said a mild attack took place. I never had any difficulty with an attack on any occasion earlier. Hence, I am confused. The echo impressions on various occasions are as follows: grade 1 impaired LV diastolic function, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.ECG: showed LVH+ on four of these reports. My height is 167 cm, weight is 65 kg. BP 120 to 130/80 to 85, pulse normally bit high 90. Presently I am taking Angizem CD 90 once daily, Clopilet once daily and Roseday 5 mg once daily. Angizem gives mild swelling at feet. hs-CRP is 5.1 and is the first time showed a higher value. I request you to kindly go through the reports. I would like to know the following:What is my problem? HCM or anything else?Whether any attack has taken place.Why ECG is always showing abnormal?Whether this problem is related to a musculoskeletal issue that is non-cardio.Is feeling of squeezing of the heart is cardio related?Kindly prescribe medicine. Any advice?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your reports and summary (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You do not have HCM (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) and also do not have had any heart attack. There are changes in the ECG (electrocardiography) which is called as strain pattern, and these changes are due to hypertension. The same hypertensive changes can be seen in echocardiography as concentric LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy). Also, your angiography which is the gold standard test for heart attack was not showing any major problems. So at this point, you do not need to worry about your heart status. At this point, you just have hypertension and some slow flow in your heart arteries which is not at all worrisome. In your reports, your hs-CRP (high sensitivity C-reactive protein) and fasting blood sugar is on a higher side, but nothing to worry about it. You are already having Roseday (Rosuvastatin) which will be helpful in patients with elevated hs-CRP. Next thing, Angizem (Diltiazem) is not a choice of drug for hypertension, nowadays, and you are having swelling in the legs, so my advice is to change it to tablet Telma (Telmisartan) CTD 40/12.5 mg once a day. So your priority at this time is healthy lifestyle and control of BP. You should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high-calorie diet. Have low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly thrice a day for one week then once or twice a week. BP should not be persistently more than 140/90 mmHg. Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according to your capacity at least 30 minutes a day and five days a week. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, fish once or twice a week, avoid meat. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. There should not be any abdominal fat deposition or obesity.

Because, in this age group, several hormonal changes occur. Just take care of your skin and be aware of your food habits. Do not squeeze out the pimples because they leave behind scars and dark spots. Avoid spicy and fried junk foods. Drink plenty of water. Do regular pranayama like Anulom vilom, Nadi Shodhan, and Bhramari. Wash your face with neem leaves water/ decoction or neem face wash and apply Clarina ointment twice a day.

I would like to obtain technical info regarding these results, particularly regarding the infarction. I would appreciate the severity of this infarction and whether it could be a machine error. Could you also tell me by perhaps drawing on the shot what waves and shapes indicate problems?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your report (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is unlikely to be a machine error. Errors do not have such patterns and it is suggestive of old infarction only. Its present in inferior leads, which suggests inferior part of the heart is damaged and these are relatively less severe kind of infarction. However, an echo will give a better idea regarding the severity and extent of damage done. So it is better to get an echo done, if not done yet. Now, you can see in lead 1, P wave followed by a sharp spike called as QRS complex followed by an upright wave called as T-wave. So now, you can see in lead 2, 3, and AVF which are inferior leads, showing downward QRS spike instead of upward and T-wave is also inverted suggestive of heart damage. So, the next step is an echo to look for the extent of damage and followed by angiography to see the blockages and if needed then revascularization.

While waiting for the appointment, I developed pain in my right upper jaw which became increasingly worse over a few days. I went to see the dentist who found out I have an infection in my first molar (upper right) which is a tooth that has been root canal filled for about 20 years. I started Penicillin for the infection but after three days with no improvement, I switched to Clindamycin 24 hours ago and I am still not sure if that is working either. My first question is, should I still have the wisdom teeth extracted as scheduled even in the presence of infection in that other tooth? The dentist made it sound like it would not be a problem but I am very nervous especially since I am already in quite a bit of pain. The second question is: should I have that tooth retreated as she suggested or am I better off extracting it and getting an implant? Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. Penicillin and Clindamycin are the antibiotics and are usually prescribed for a course of five to seven days. These drugs reduce infection but not the pain. So, you might not notice a big change in how you feel. It is the painkiller which makes you feel that the drug has worked. Answering to your first question, in my personal opinion I would treat the tooth which is painful at the moment and only then jump on to the wisdom teeth extraction. This is what is ethically right too. I would not want you to be extremely painful for so many reasons. Coming to your second question, the treatment procedure for your upper right first molar totally depends on the X-ray. If it is ideal to retreat with root canal therapy (I mean an uncomplicated one) and the longevity is guaranteed, please go ahead. Extraction followed by an implant is not a short procedure and cost-effective. So please discuss with your dentist regarding this in detail. I can also help you with this provided I see a picture of the tooth’s condition and the X-rays.

The volume of the urinary bladder is significantly decreased and I can see that there is circumferential wall thickening of the urinary bladder. This can mean that the enlarged prostate has been causing bladder outlet obstruction and that is leading to retention of urine and infection. There are no obvious features of prostate cancer on T2 and diffusion images. There is no area of strikingly abnormal enhancement. I would interpret the findings to be due to gross enlargement of the prostate and causing bladder outlet obstruction causing urinary bladder wall infection.

Last year I was diagnosed with hypertension as my reading in the clinic was 170/120 and when the doctor asked me to monitor my BP and wrote some blood test. I monitored at home for 15 days then it was around 145/100 and report for all the blood test was normal but the doctor prescribed me Met XL 25 so I am taking it at night. I have started the exercise in the morning like jumping rope, spiking and yoga as well. I play TT for one hour in the noon around 4 PM to 5 PM. Now in the morning after exercise, my BP is around 130/85 but in the evening when I measure while sitting, it is around 150/110 and when lying it is around 138/93. Is this a cause of concern having high BP in the evening or it is normal?","Doctor":"Hello.

One more thing, if I eat turmeric every day the chances of cancer will be reduced or not? Can it be cured in Ayurveda?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See there are a number of symptoms which are linked to both these cancers. Moreover, in initial stages, some patient might not feel any symptoms. As far as turmeric is concerned it has many properties including anti-cancer properties. But it can not be guaranteed that taking turmeric alone will help you in not getting any disease in future.

I am having some problem in my throat and I think those are tonsils as I am not having any pain or difficulty. But whenever I am looking into my mouth I feel something around tonsils. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern over the swelling in your throat that you observed recently in this period of Covid-19 outbreak. I checked the image and I can definitely see some swelling there. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  I have a few questions for you. Have you observed this on the back of your throat for the first time? In the past did you have a similar issue? Have you been in contact with anyone who had respiratory tract infection recently? Do you have a fever or a cough? Sometimes this type of swelling is a result of an allergic reaction to some specific food or allergen which can be triggered after you consume anything cold. As far as there is no pain and difficulty swallowing food and water, you do not need to worry much. Although keep a check on it for a week or two and see if there is any change in the swelling. You can gargle with warm water and adding little salt in it for four to five times a day and avoid eating anything cold for some duration. Feel free to contact me if you observe any change in the swelling. And stay safe as the Covid-19 is spreading quickly. Maintain social distancing and wash your hands before you touch your face, nose, or eyes."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Seven months ago I had LASIK surgery on my eyes and I still have dry eyes especially after taking a shower everything becomes so dry. My eyes, ears, even nose, and vagina. I went to a dermatologist who prescribed Accutane, Vitamin A for my acne. Then he said that he cannot prescribe it until he makes sure it will be safe for me. So I should consult an ophthalmologist. So please tell me what do you think about it? I am a female, single, 21 years old. I always use moisturizer drops for my eyes maybe three or five times a day. Before LASIK also I had dry eyes.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Dry eyes after LASIK surgery are a common side-effect, more so if you have had dry eyes before surgery. You can continue using your moisturizing eye drops for three to five times, it will not cause you any harm. The dryness in your eyes will reduce overtime. In addition, you can use hot fomentation or give heat to your eyelids. Take a clean cloth, dip it in hot water, squeeze out the water and press this cloth against your closed eyelid about twice a day. As your dermatologist has told you, taking Accutane (Isotretinoin) can increase your dry eye, so he will withhold the treatment until your dry eye has improved. So please continue your moisturizing eyedrops and start giving hot fomentation. Hope you get well soon.

Fell from his size in terms of height. We went to the hospital the next day in order to make some checks. The doctor did send us home without doing any scanner. He said it should be fine as there were no bruises, a medical examination was normal and there were no other complications such as vomiting or loss of consciousness. He only was unusually tired in the morning and that is why we made someone check him.Now. The big question is, are there any risks of difficulties in cognitive and psychomotor developpement in the future. I am worried about the risks of sequelae on the cognitive part. If the risk exists (I guess there is never zero risk), what is the prevalence or percentage of risk? Thanks a lot for your understanding and I thank you in advance for your true and right answer.","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that the risk of developing cognitive disorders or seizures is very low (less than 5 %) if there is no brain damage (in brain MRI). I agree with the doctor for not performing the brain CT scan as there was no loss of consciousness and no vomiting. The fact that his situation has improved is really reassuring that there is no intracranial bleeding or stroke. Anyway, I would recommend as follows performing a brain MRI (as it does not impose the risk of radiation like the CT scan), just to make sure that everything is fine. It is also important to avoid any possible repeated trauma in the next weeks.

Phimosis means tight foreskin. In this condition, the foreskin may not be moving freely. There are two ways to treat it. One is medical and other is surgical. I will suggest medical treatment.  First pull down the foreskin as down as possible and apply Betamethasone cream on the inner side of foreskin where it is tightly attached. Do it three times daily for next two to three months. Betamethasone will help to loosen the skin. Also, do daily stretching exercises of the foreskin. Strech forward foreskin for 30 seconds and then stretch downward for 30 seconds. Do it daily for five minutes. For more information consult a sexologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am a-32-year old female.

My weight is 175 lb and I am 5'9. A few months ago, I experienced intense vertigo and severe nausea. I was hospitalized for 15+ days where I was tested for meningitis (came back negative), tick born illnesses (negative) and autoimmune disorders. The doctors were not able to diagnose my condition and released me from the hospital. I could barely walk when I was released and lost over 30 lbs (due to constant vomiting while in the hospital). The doctors still have no idea what is wrong. I have now been home for a month's time and I am still having difficulty walking, the vertigo is gone though. My walking/balance seems to get better and worse in the same day. I cannot stand still. I can walk fast but if I slow down I lose my balance. My legs feel like jelly.

I have gained back all the weight and I do feel physically strong as I was before the hospitalization but I am still weak and lose my balance.","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that your symptoms could be related to an inner ear disorder. Have you been checked by an ENT specialist? Have you performed any labyrinthine tests? Coming to this point, I would recommend avoiding abrupt head movements and take Dimenhydrinate therapy, in order to help reduce vertigo and also nausea. A brain angio MRA is necessary to examine the blood flow to the brain and exclude possible vertebro-basilary insufficiency, which is related to narrowing of these blood vessels.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I am 43 years old and I have two brown spots on my foreskin. They are there for about one to two years, possibly longer. They do not itch, or bleed, or change in size. Only the one is closer to the glans is possibly getting a bit lighter. Can you please have a look at the photos and opinion of a dermatologist. They suggest that it could be condyloma, bowenoid papulosis, or seborrheic keratosis. As I mentioned, when I was younger I went to visit a urologist and they told me that I have a mild case of phimosis. I do not have any issues in maintaining hygiene, or having sex, except sometimes if my foreskin stretches and it is dry, I feel a bit of pain and discomfort. What I would like to add is that I am straight and married for the past eight years and in those eight years I only had sex with my wife, not sure how long is the maximum incubation of condyloma, or papulosis and does it exclude it. Also, it mentions that condyloma is cauliflower shape, which I am not sure about these spots, one closer to glans is totally flat and the other one that has a shape of a mole is slightly above the skin, but I cannot say it is cauliflower shaped. Could you please let me know do you agree with your colleagues opinion? I am very cancerophobic (if that is even a word for a person who is generally scared of cancers, so my main concern is to rule out that option). I am currently away from home and cannot go visit urologist in person for at least two months.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your queries and attachment.

If you undergo circumcision, the skin with these lesions will automatically be excised out and biopsy report will tell the final story."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I get a type of anxiety and fear of going out somewhere. Six years ago, when I was in high school some guy gave me something to smoke. I did not know what it was. That day, I went home and I was high. The next morning I woke up fine and went to school. After some time, I started to feel like as if I need to smoke again. I started panicking and was sweating. I did not know what was going on with me. I felt so horrible though I was going crazy. I went to the emergency room and they gave me medicine. Also, I had some therapy and to be honest, I do not remember how it went away. Since then, I never felt that again. I do not know whether it is something that got stuck in my head. But, my life went on and I was good. Before three years, I went for vacation and I met my husband. I stayed over there for about eight months. I am married and I am 23 years old. We had so many problems. Our main thing was jealous. We used to fight for even little things. Two months ago, when I was at work, I started getting a panic attack like the one which I had almost six years ago. I think I got it because of all the problems I have in my marriage and my profession. I left for the hospital and I started crying. It has been such a horrible experience in my life ever since. I just wanted to be at home since I knew I was not fine. Twice my fight with him ended up in the hospital. He started to get anxiety. I will cry and could not control myself so he had to get away from me. He left me and I went into depression. I was sad for the fact he left me and also because I just did not want to go out my house. It has been such a hard issue dealing with this. I have been taking medication. First, they gave me Lorazepam. I took it for a month or two, but it was bad and addicted. So, my doctor prescribed me Alprazolam. I have almost been taking it for six months. Sometimes, I take two to keep myself calm. I could not stop taking it and so I want your help. I want to be myself again. I want to know what can I do to slowly get rid of all this anxiety and depression. My husband has come back and living with me. It was so hard without him. I did not get anymore attacks. I just feel down for the reason I cannot go out because I am afraid to get anxiety attack or I just feel weird being out in the street like I do not belong. It is so hard to explain. I am here at home and I entertain myself on the internet. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. I went through all your details. No panic attack itself is a positive development. This also shows that you are able to manage your anxiety disorder. There are many aspects to your issue. The first substance abuse and resultant anxiety, relationship problems with your husband, your negative obsession with your life's little hassles, etc. But, I am not blaming you because these are quite common and nobody would foresee what could develop. Being understood your basic problem, I would not like to give it a name or classify it. Let us call it just anxiety disorder, because you are having anxiety symptoms. Panic attacks are always due to underlying anxiety disorder and therefore, we need to treat the anxiety disorder first. I suggest you stop worrying about this because, according to me, it is 100% curable. We use medicines, psychotherapy methods, exercise, lifestyle changes and relaxation therapy. You are already having medicines. That is enough. For the second part, as initial steps to the treatment, I suggest you to start physical exercise daily for one hour. On this aspect, you should start motivate yourself. Just continue with the exercise and believe your problem could be cured. I also suggest you to contact me after a week. Please understand cure through therapy takes time. Be patient. With medicines, cure may not happen at all.

I have been told that there is a perforation and it needs to be closed by a surgery. Recently, I had severe pain as well along with the pus. The usage of buds to clean was the reason for the pain which caused a earache (cartilage inflammation, I guess). I went to the doctor, have taken the medication. I do not have pain anymore. I am using tablets and eardrops to reduce the pus discharge right now. My major concern is about what foods I need to avoid to avoid any pus or ear problem. Is it right that I need to avoid eating ice creams, anything that is cold and sweets, cakes, especially can I have chocolate cake? Please do tell me clearly what all I need to avoid strictly and what all I can have.","Doctor":"Hello. The perforation has to be closed using tympanoplasty surgery. Otherwise, the perforation may become unsafe with loss of ossicles and more complex surgeries may be required for its correction. Chances are there for the development of cholesteatoma which can invade and destroy bone and spread to surrounding structures like brain. What you should be worried about is not what food you should eat or avoid but about the permanent solution to this problem. If, however, you want to know what food to avoid, avoid all those that can cause an upper respiratory tract infection, as the infection can trigger a ear infection and cause recurrent ear discharge.

I am going on a trip so I want to get period immediately. How can I get it? Please suggest me any medicine.","Doctor":"Hi. Hormones are used to delay or prepone menstrual bleeding. Hormones or medicines need to start in advance like a week or six days before. If you are going in one or two days and the due date is also within one or two days, then hormone might not be as effective as it would be when started earlier a week back or six days or you may even get irregular bleeding even after taking hormones. For postponing for weeks, you can have Primolute N (Norethisterone) 10 mg twice daily for two or three weeks if you want to delay cycles and can stop three to four days before you want to get withdrawal bleeding. Similarly, if you have time you can start pills now and stop after five days. Within a week you should have menstrual bleed as ur menses. I have given you both the above scenarios. Another important thing that hormones are taken for delaying or to prepone menstrual bleeding can make your periods irregular for few months or you can have unscheduled spotting.

It does not come off easily with the toothbrush. Actually, it does not, unless I apply significant force to remove it.

But I did not engage in a risky sexual activity until three months ago when I started dating my current boyfriend whom I live with. We stopped using condoms and I have had anal receptive intercourse with him. He said he does not have any health issues but he has had a weird dry cough for a long time and he does not want to go to the doctor. I am scared.

It appears like a normal ulceration or papule only. I suggest applying Triamcinolone ointment over it twice daily and observe if it goes down. Eat a healthy diet rich in folic acid and all other vitamins. Take plenty of green leafy vegetables and fruits and have an active lifestyle. Meanwhile, it is advisable to get your boyfriend tested for HIV. If there are multiple partners involved then it is better both of you get tested regularly. It is always safer to use protection while having an anal intercourse.

We are concerned about a possibility of pregnancy.","Doctor":"Hello. I can help you with this. With the history I think her periods are a little irregular. The time of sexual intercourse is not much near her ovulation time and if you have not ejaculated inside, the chance of pregnancy is very rare. If you have had no unprotected intercourse thereafter, and if she by chance had become pregnant, urine pregnancy test should show positive by now. So to be on safer side it is better to do a urine pregnancy test now even though she is having spotting. If it is negative now then definitely she is not going to be pregnant due to the sex.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Growing up I did take a lot of medication for my asthma like Ventolin, Seretide and other medications which may be the cause for these horrid stains, but all I really want to know is how to get rid of them?","Doctor":"Hello.  I understand your concern about the stains in your teeth as it really affects the confidence of a person. Stains can be caused due to a number of reasons both intrinsic and extrinsic.  Intrinsic stains can be caused due to internal factors like a few medicines, genetic disorders, etc. Whereas the extrinsic stains are caused by external factors like colored food items that are coffee, cold drinks, plaque, smoking, not maintaining the oral hygiene well, etc. Since you have not sent any pictures of your teeth so it is difficult for me to find out the exact cause of the stains. But there are a number of treatment options available to correct these stains. Two of the best ones are scaling and polishing the teeth. The second one is bleaching.

The redness has subsided since this morning and first noticed this, and just left with little veins and a little yellow color. My GP has advised to leave it a couple of weeks for it to disappear.

Pterygium tissue will not dissolve on its own and needs surgery to remove. Although it is possible to slow its growth by lubricants and avoiding sunlight exposure to some extent. The decision to operate on a pterygium depends on a variety of factors including the type of pterygium (progressive or not), the size of the tissue and your vision along with the condition of both your eyes. All operating surgeons also know that there is a small chance of the pterygium recurring after surgery.

Unfortunately, for the past 3 months I have been getting more symptoms which I assume is due to season and high pollen count. I am now taking Albuterol sulfate as needed and going on my third dose of Symbicort 80/4.5 as of yesterday. My concern is with this coronavirus am I considered high risk with my level of asthma? Is it a good idea to start a corticosteroid like symbicort or should I be on something more mild? I am considered an \\"essential mail worker\\" so I am wondering if I should continue to work. (Side note: my wife is 7 months pregnant on top of all this).","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you are suffering from childhood asthma which is worsening now due to season and high pollen count and occupational hazards. You should undergo serial measurements of peak expiratory flow/FEV1 at work and away from work that will determine whether you should go outside for your job or not. You can also undergo RAST (Radioallergosorbent test) that will determine the amount of IgE that reacts specifically with pollens. You have history of atopy and you are on Corticosteroid now and your occupational history suggest that you are immunocompromised now. An immunocompromised person is more vulnerable to Covid 19 or Coronavirus . If you are attacked by Coronavirus , it will be a life threatening condition as ur respiratory tracts are weak and history of repeated respiratory tract infections recently. It is also very contagious too. So from you it can be spread to your wife and your unborn child which is life threatening to both of them. If you are feeling better with your current medication, you can continue. You can also add nebulization with Albuterol 3to 4 times daily along with inhaler Albuterol SOS.

Fever sometimes takes time to settle and may take up to a week. If cough and fever continue beyond 10 days then get a chest X-ray done to rule out pneumonia.

But as the evening came by, I gradually felt an irritation in my left eye. I thought I am going to have an eyesore. But the next day, I was shocked after seeing a thin whitish film on my left eye. This stuff did not even make a little appearance the previous days. The sensation is very comparable to an eyesore though my eye does not produce any discharge. Any opinion? My sister had been diagnosed with pterygium and undergone surgery. I wonder if it is the same issue.","Doctor":"Hi. The photo attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity) is not very clear and has a lot of shadows, but I can tell you that the white thing is an inflammation of your cornea, most probably an ulcer.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

So, we first need to rule out the medical conditions that may be responsible for these symptoms by some investigation such as blood sugar, thyroid function test, serum testosterone, prolactin level and routine blood count as a minimum investigation and also get the semen analysis done. For this, you need to consult a psychiatrist or urologist in person so that he can examine you and advise necessary investigations that may be required. If there is any abnormality detected in these investigations then management includes treating the underlying cause. If everything comes within normal range, then a drug like Bupropion and PDE (phosphodiesterase) inhibitors like Sildenafil or Tadalafil are helpful to manage libido as well as erectile dysfunction. Multivitamin supplements are also helpful to some extent. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. Also, spend some good time with partner and spend enough time during foreplay. For this, you can take a vacation during a weekend and visit a place you had enjoyed earlier. Avoid any use of alcohol, tobacco or any other substances, and if taking currently then stop. Do regular exercise and get adequate sleep.

This was during a followup following a hospitalization for swollen legs due to feet infection. The hospital doctor said that the swelling would go down in time, but was not so. I saw the PCP. The medication has only helped a little. There was some improvement, but legs and feet are still swollen. A week ago, I started having problems that when I urinate and go to wipe, I cannot get dry. I have to keep on wiping going through 12 rolls of tissue and still am not dry. It stops on its own after I put depends on an hour or more later. It looks like urine on the tissue. So, I am assuming it is urine. I do not know what else it could be. It is taking me an hour or longer to wipe. The PCP took a urine sample to test for UTI. He does not know what the problem is. He has not come across this problem ever before. He does not think the Lasix is causing this. I stopped the Lasix five days ago before seeing the PCP. But, the problem has continued. This is very distressing and interferes with getting my daily activities done. I was diagnosed with overactive bladder by a urologist four years ago. Due to a problem with colonic inertia, the doctor would only prescribe one medication Myrbetriq which did not work and the doctor had me stop it because it only raised my blood pressure.

I do not think the problem is due to Furosemide. You may be suffering from severe form of stress urinary incontinence which is very common at this age.

I had an ultrasound before showing my spleen was mildly enlarged to 12.8 cm. Since then I have had on and off spleen enlargements.

I have also noticed in my ultrasound that my liver was enlarged to 16.8 cm when my liver was previously normal at 15.5 cm. I have also done a bunch of blood work and my bilirubin levels went to 27 when they should be below 20 and my conjugated bilirubin was 9 when it should be below 7. I have had my ALT and AST testing and all is fine there. I have had my CBC and differential and all is good with this too.

I guess they are confirmed on Holter and assumed to be ventricular ectopics. And also ruled out the structural heart disease on echo. They are also associated with excess caffeine, alcohol consumption, and thyroid problems may aggravate these. So if not done, thyroid should be done.  Next thing, about the medicines which you are having currently. Are you having those before this ectopics started as they can certainly cause and aggravate ectopics? So gradually should be tapered off. Stress, anxiety, lack of sleep may aggravate this. As I mentioned, these are benign and usually needs no treatment.

Being my first male to male exposure, I was not very sure to engage in anal sex and I just tried inserting and I am sure even I was not too hard enough to penetrate when I tried to. So, I removed the condom and just ejaculated. Before that, I had unprotected oral sex. Once I was about to leave the place, I found a tinge of blood on the top of the used condom. It happened over three months ago. I tested the partner on the same day for HIV fourth generation Ab/Ag test and he tested negative. From then, I am panicked about being contracted with HCV and HIV. In the due course, I got a small sore on my penis which was examined by a dermatologist and he was very sure that it was not a syphilis sore (I explained all that happened). Eight weeks later, I wanted the person who had all other STD tests including syphilis, HCV, and HIV. He tested positive for syphilis and only now he is on treatment. My VDRL and TPHA results are negative until the last test 90 days after the exposure. Further, I underwent Anti-HIV Combo ab/ag, Anti HCV, VDRL, TPHA, HIV RNA PCR qualitative several times in the last three months and got the results as non-reactive and non-detected. Now it has been 13 weeks and three days since the possible exposure. All the above tests were taken in a reputed lab. Apart from the above, HIV RNA qualitative and Western blot tests were also done in a different lab twice (eight and 10 weeks post exposure) and were negative. My fear is: If there was any exposure by touching the blood while I pulled off my condom and that had contact with my penile gland when I ejaculated (though I did not have any open cut or sore, did not see any bleeding or blood tinge on my penis when I washed my penis after the mishap), will I be at a greater risk of contracting HIV or HCV (though the partner was tested negative for HIV and HCV two months post this mishap)? With the above tests done now after three months, what is the chance that I had contracted HIV or HCV? With articles on the internet talking about HIV and HCV co-infection which delays HIV seroconversion, make me go mad. With the tests done can I allay my fears of HIV at least? As my partner is positive for syphilis, is my three months negative VDRL conclusive on me? Is there any other test I can do to put my mind at peace? It has been three months since I slept and now I feel that my liver is bulged and my ribs are aching. I know I am paranoid but an assurance from you as a doctor would give me more confidence. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Since the blood was on the outside of the condom, therefore, it was almost certainly not in direct contact with your penis. Your screening tests are negative on multiple occasions and they are conclusive. A negative Combo test (Anti HIV antibody test and P24Ag test) is considered conclusive at six weeks by most HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) specialists. Similarly, anti-HCV (hepatitis C) and HBsAg (hepatitis B) are reliable six weeks onwards in those with possible exposure. VDRL (venereal disease research laboratory) usually becomes positive three weeks after infection but because of the variable incubation period of syphilis of nine to 90 days, it is certainly conclusive if it is negative at three months. So a negative at three months in your case is conclusive. Regards.

And, what is the treatment?","Doctor":"Hello. The alcohol ingested is metabolized in the liver and converted to acetaldehyde. This takes place in the liver. The variations in the effect of alcohol in different people take place because of the difference in the genetics of enzymes called alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH). In short people with ADH enzymes fast acting in the liver, based on genetics, will have less effect of alcohol as the alcohol gets converted fast to acetaldehyde and vice versa.  Answering the second part of your question regarding treatment, make sure you drink plenty of water while ingesting alcohol and also avoid taking alcohol on an empty stomach. The effects of alcohol on you seem more than usual because of genetics which cannot be changed and of course the best treatment would be to cut down or stop alcohol.

Firstly, this does not appear to be CAD (coronary artery disease) related pain to me, however, it should be evaluated to rule out some unusual cardiac causes, especially valvular problems. Because of your age, long duration of symptoms without treatment and atypical nature of pain, it does not look like pain due to CAD. Now anginal pain would typically increase or occurs on exertion and relieves with rest. And cardiac pain would persist for a few minutes rather than seconds and does not remain round the clock. Intermittent chest pains may not be cardiac. Such pains are usually due to acid reflux. Acid reflux pain occurs more frequently in lying down position, occurs intermittently, persists for a few seconds to minutes. So, yours may be related to it. Other gastric symptoms may be associated like epigastric pain, bloating and burping, etc. Another possibility should be considered is of costochondritis, if there is definite tenderness over the chest wall. See if you also have any neck pain, tingling, numbness, etc, for cervical pains. Regarding dizziness, it is likely postural hypotension. This may occur due to dehydration so keep yourself well hydrated and have a proper diet. If you have a BP apparatus then should check your blood pressure (BP). Now if shortness of breath is significant, then this needs early evaluation with examination and tests like ECG (electrocardiography) and echo. So, your symptoms are nonspecific and overlap with many non-cardiac and benign causes as well. But you will need a thorough evaluation with an examination, ECG and echo to rule out cardiac problems. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My partner has type-2 diabetes and has lost several teeth. I am trying to talk him into a dentist visit, not necessarily to walk out with implants or dentures, but to just get an exam and a cleaning done. He believes that the few teeth he does have left will not survive even something as simple as teeth cleaning. That the dentist would take one look and want to pull them. Are his concerns/fears valid? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? First of all, do not worry. Maybe he is afraid of dental visits because of previous experiences. Uncontrolled diabetes can cause bone loss and hence tooth mobility, in conjunction with improper oral hygiene. Since I do not know the condition of his remaining teeth, I cannot comment on the treatment that will be advised for him. You can maybe send me an image of his teeth and I can advise you more precisely. Secondly, I would advise him to get his missing teeth replaced as this prolonged period of missing teeth might cause aggravated bone loss. The implant will not suit him as he is diabetic, you can go for removable dentures or fixed partial denture (if he has sound teeth left). Tell him to go get a dental visit done. Dentists are there to help you out. Nothing will be done without his consent. Moreover, he can explain his problems and fears and the doctor will accordingly plan the treatment. Feel free to ask further questions. Take care. For more information consult a dentist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I have got a mole on my arm that measures 5 mm and is flat. I have always had this mole. I have not noticed it changing and it has not bled or itched. I am a bit concerned though that it has two different brown shades in it and would like your opinion on it, please.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Yes, I have seen few important things. So, for these reasons, I would like you to have a biopsy to rule out melanoma. A biopsy is the only method to diagnose. Sometimes, it is not necessary to have bleeding or itching. I do not want you to panic, but it is good to have it done as early as possible. You may be aware that it has greater incidence in white people. So, to be on the safer side, visit your general physician. Wish you a very good health.

In focal areas, the cells show moderate nuclear pleomorphism with an increase in nuclear size. Mitotic activity is inconspicuous. Microcystic degeneration noted. No vascular proliferation or necrosis is seen. Fragments of normal brain parenchyma also noted. Ki-67 proliferation index is 3 %. Overall features are consistent with diffuse astrocytoma, WHO grade II.","Doctor":"Hello. I have thoroughly reviewed your query and can well understand your concerns. There is a brain tumor named diffuse astrocytoma that is consistent with the features described in your question. If we take a chunk of the tumor out and examine it under special microscopes and with specialized techniques (as in this case there was seen a temporal lobe of the brain involved in a tumorous growth), it gives us the behavior of cells in the specimen under review. This is a method of diagnosing a disease process. Diffuse astrocytoma is a tumor of the brain that has a specific slow-growing nature and is diagnosed based on its signs and symptoms, tests and sometimes biopsy that is sent for histopathological studies to be sure. In this case, the tumor was found to fall under WHO-II of WHO brain tumor grading. It is a grading to classify tumors of the brain to get help in diagnosis and treatment. Surgical excision, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be used to treat it.

What are the risks with such a procedure? I have receding gums on three upper teeth and three lower teeth on the left. I have no pain or problems. I have all my teeth and they are generally healthy.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your medical history and the present complaint as well. First of all, I would like you to know that receding gums is such a normal thing to happen especially at your age. You have also mentioned that there is no pain or decay in those teeth you point out. Ideally, filling procedures do not work for gum recession problems but only for decay or abrasions close to the gum lines. The reason why fillings are not recommended is that you lose normal shiny tooth surface and the bulk while the cavities are prepared and there are many chances that the filling material might show microleakage hence paving way for tooth decay. There are as such no particular risks for this kind of procedures with your medical history kept in mind. But I also would like to take a look at those teeth which are of concern in order to help you with a better treatment plan.

And today, she is very sleepy taking feed for just 10 minutes almost every one to one and a half hours before falling asleep again. Is this normal? Should I let her sleep at night? Her urine output is alright.","Doctor":"Hi. A 1 month old baby can sometimes sleep for five to six hours without a feed, this is a normal thing. If the baby is passing urine more than six times in 24 hours, then the child is getting adequate feed. If the child is on some medication like cough drops or syrup, then also sleeping increases. In that case, stop the medication. A child should feed for at least 15 minutes each time. If the child feels sleepy during feeding, then gently tap on the feet of the child to wake her.

A doctor says he thinks it is ectopic, I do not know what that is, but I can submit to you a picture of the spot on my tonsils. I have a good picture of it. I was sick about a month ago with a fever for a day and I had a sore throat.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to iciniq.com. I have seen the image (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The yellowish pus sac is a tonsil stone, known as tonsillolith. It occurs due to the accumulation of tonsillar secretions and some minerals inside the tonsillar crypt and obstruction to its free flow into the oral cavity and pharynx. It can occur subsequent to a throat infection or can occur without any reason as well. Does this cause any symptom like soreness or foreign body feeling or itching or painful swallowing? Otherwise, your tonsils and oropharynx area appear fine, without any sign of inflammation or infection. Are you a smoker? Do you have diabetes or hypertension or any illness for which you have to take medicines regularly? The stone sometimes easily comes out when we press it with a tongue depressor or a spatula. We do it in-office after giving a mild anesthetic spray onto the oropharynx and tonsils. Sometimes, however, it does not come off that easily. In some, it produces recurrent symptoms and the stone also forms frequently. They get benefitted by the removal of tonsils altogether. Do write back to us with all the details.

She underwent TORCH test as there were two miscarriages in the past after one normal delivery. The result of the test is as follows:Toxo Plasma-IgM: 4.30, Rubella IgM: 11.80, CMV IgM: 5.80, HSV 1 and 2 IgM: 0.58;Toxo Plasma-IgG: 3.60 iu/ml, Rubella IgG: 139 iu/ml, CMV IgG: 104 iu/ml, HSV 1 and 2 IgG: 10.20.Is everything alright or is there any matter of concern?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your wife's TORCH (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, and HIV) test reports. There are two types of antibodies that were investigated, IgG and IgM to exclude infection. The result could be positive or negative, it depends on the finding of IgG and IgM. A positive test result means IgG and IgM antibodies are found in one or more infections covered in screening. IgM antibodies represent that there is a current or recent infection. You can have repeat testing to confirm it again from another authentic lab. The presence of IgG indicates a past infection or vaccinated previously. Reinvestigation after two weeks of the test is better to confirm it and again to compare antibodies as well. In the meantime, inform your results to the treating consultant immediately. If the newborn tests positive for IgM antibodies, current infection is the most likely cause. If both IgG and IgM are found in the newborn, it is probably antibodies from the mother transferred to the baby. In short, she is having an infection, and that can harm the baby as well. Baby can have multiple congenital anomalies like congenital rubella and CMV (cytomegalovirus) syndrome, sensorineural defects, blindness, hearing loss, premature delivery, growth restriction, neonatal herpes, microcephaly, intracranial calcification, rash, conjunctivitis, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, etc. A detailed anomaly scan is needed urgently. If the mother gets an infection in the early trimester, diagnosed as well with active infection few consultants give an option of termination as well after describing risks of having congenital anomalies due to active infection. Immediately inform to treating consultant about the positive report, have a detailed fetal anomaly scan and discuss with your obstetrician regarding the fetal outcome. Discussion regarding fetal anomalies could be heart touching.

This is particularly uncomfortable for me and people around me, as it seems like I am staring at them even though I am not looking at them.","Doctor":"Hi. If you are suffering from a peripheral vision that makes you see less, then we can look at glaucoma as a cause and not when the opposite is true, that is when you feel you are seeing everything, which is normal. The best way to get this clarified is with a visual fields test or perimetry. This also happens to be the very same test that is done for people diagnosed as \\"glaucoma suspects\\" before taking any decisions on treatment/management. If you do feel that people are thinking that you are staring at them, then you must check to see if your eyes are crossed outwards. This deviation can be episodic, so detecting it may be difficult. A simple test you can do at home to check if your eyes are crossing out is the Hirschberg's test. You will need the help of a friend or a family member to do this. While sitting straight and looking at a distant object, ask your friend to sit directly in front of you and shine a torchlight at the bridge of your nose and look at the reflection of light on the black portion of both your eyes. If it is exactly in the middle of each black part, then your eyes are straight, if not then they are crossed and you may have to see a doctor regarding this. I hope this helps. Review after one week. Accommodation problems. 1. Alternate cover test. 2. Perimetry. Exotropia. Convergence exercises.

I am 33 years old, female. I am in good health overall, but I was told I have a heart murmur about a year and a half ago and I am on Sprintec birth control. Should I be worried about this?","Doctor":"Hello. It does not look like a matter of worry. However, since you told about a murmur, you should get one echo done to look for the cause for it. Have you got hemoglobin checked ever? For palpitations, low hemoglobin can cause it. It can also occur with a valve problem as you told about the murmur. Also, extra beats which are usually benign can cause this. So it does not appear to be an emergency. But, you should get yourself evaluated with an ECG, echo, and hemoglobin.

I am 168 cm in height and 68 kg in weight. Since last one month, I have been suffering from intermittent loose motions (yellow colored). There is no vomiting, no fever, or major abdominal pain (except for occasional cramps). Initially, I took a combination of Norfloxacin and Tinidazole for four days, but things did not improve. Thereafter on the prescription of my doctor I took Metronidazole 400 and Dicyclomine 20 mg for a period of 14 days. I also took Lactobacillus tablets for the entire period. During these times I only ate poha, rice, curd, and banana. Also, I took boiled water. It is the fifth day now and I have discontinued the medicines. Despite on such a bland diet (no wheat), I still have at least one to two loose motions in a day. My routine medical tests were done in January this year which was normal. My wife and son also developed loose motion in between for a very brief period. However, they recovered fully within three days. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello.

Please follow these general guidelines: 1) Add fibers in your diet like vegetables and Ispagol husk two spoons daily. 2) Keep yourself well hydrated. 3) Add yogurt in your diet. 4) Eat less. 5) More important is to keep yourself relaxed.

My question is, do I need crutches? I am a girl.","Doctor":"Hi. Looking into your problem it seems you are badly in pain and looking for things can help you walk so you remember about crutches. As simple protocols use simple formula RICE rest, ice compression and elevation of your feet are key sutra.  For severe sprains, you might need a brace for protection and stability its good to use ankle brace having binder together in it. You may need crutches until you can walk without pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help to control pain and swelling. We need to evaluate ankle with Grade II or Grade III sprains. Grade III sprains with complete tears of the ligaments even might need surgery to repair the injured ligaments. One thing to remember is that always in most cases, follow-up rehabilitative exercises are to restore strength and range of motion in the sprained ankle-also help to prevent future ankle injuries. If it is not healed ,think of doing X-ray of ankle, you might not know sometime there can be hairline fracture too (stress fracture)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a female, and weigh about 50 kg. I am currently having chest tightness and anxiety. I have been prescriped Zapiz 0.25. However, it is not helping much. Can I take another? About a year ago, I was asked to start Serlift and I started weaning off them about three months ago. Sometimes I feel chest tightness, difficutly in sleeping and butterflies in my chest for which I was prescribed to take Zapiz 0.25 as an SOS. I took a tablet about half an hour ago however do not see any relief. I wanted to know if it would be fine if I took another tablet of Zapiz 0.25. All my respiratory, heart, and chest tests, etc. are clear.","Doctor":"Hello. Your symptoms are of active anxiety, but only Zapiz (Clonazepam) is not going to cure anxiety for you. Zapiz is a temporary relaxant (Benzodiazepines are relaxants used in an emergency) and works well when there are active symptoms of anxiety. But it is not a permanent solution. Why was Serlift stopped? And have you taken any therapy sessions? Cognitive-behavioral therapy will help you recognize the negative thoughts which are keeping you in the loop of anxiety and you will be able to not let yourself get affected by them. Because we have to also focus on why you are getting anxiety at all. Medications and Cognitive behavioral therapy combined are a good way to treat anxiety disorder. Also, long term use of Zapiz is not good for health. As of now, you can take Zapiz 0.25, twice it will relax you a little. I would suggest you to reconsider your medication and also start therapy sessions to get good results.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

The pain in the left side could be muscle spasms or other causes like a kidney stone or colon spasms require further assessment. Can you describe the pain?

Considering your symptoms and the fact that your symptoms are relieved by Stemetil (Prochlorperazine maleate) 5 mg, I would conclude that your situation is related to an inner ear disorder. Although the doctor has excluded an inner ear disorder, a viral infection affecting the vestibular nerve (balance nerve - vestibular neuronitis) cannot be excluded.

They are available in different price ranges, and you can buy one that suits your budget. You have to make sure that the hearing aids are programmed properly. You may have to visit your doctor or audiologists who fits the hearing aid frequently for the first one month so that they can adjust the hearing aid. If the hearing loss progresses, then you may have to go for a more powerful aid.

He is in the ICU for the last four days. As per the doctor, my father may remain in this state for an indefinite period of time because his liver is not functioning. So, I want to get a second opinion and want to know, whether there is a way to revive his liver and make it function properly.","Doctor":"Hi. As per the records, he is suffering from stage-3 liver disease, that is an end-stage liver disease. His current problems need to be medically supported. This will result in temporary improvement of his condition. However, issues like infection, blood loss, fluid accumulation in the body, etc., will be frequent from now. The definite treatment ahead is liver transplantation. If you are ready to proceed with evaluation and transplant, then I would suggest considering treatment at a transplant center. Else, medical optimization, which is going on now will be alright. Was an endoscopy done for him? Also blood, abdominal fluid, and urine culture tests? If yes, please send them across.

You should include 200 g of salad in the morning and evening daily. That should contain cucumber, carrots, sprouts, etc. And in the afternoon you should eat 250 to 300 g of ripe Papaya, one hour before food.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

However, if your mother suffers from frequent constipation or a recent change in bowel habit, other than just treating it, you must get her thoroughly evaluated.

Also, since when are you having the sugar problem? Is it detected for the first time, any medicines you are having for it? Usually, it is a fungal infection of the penis which causes these problems.

Apply Abzorb (Clotrimazole) powder two times a day on the skin around your penis for two weeks. Your sugar level is very high and you should consult a doctor for that.

It does not cause me any headache, etc. It is in skin color. The only thing is that I can feel pus inside when I touch and as I touch hardly, pus comes out it is slightly yellowish and cloudy. Can it be treated with antibiotics or creams?","Doctor":"Hello. There is no relation between the ball hitting your mother during pregnancy and the lesion on your head.

My left eye vision is -3.1, and right eye vision is -1.8.","Doctor":"Hello. You are near-sighted (myopic) person. Seeing floaters points to the fact that there might be early changes of vitreous degeneration in your eye which itself is not a problem but it may cause undue traction on your retina. Here is what I suggest: You have to visit a vitreoretinal expert ophthalmologist and you have to get a dilated fundus examination. We have to rule out any areas of weakness in the retina and if found, they can safely be lasered.

I started to have painful bowel movements and then I began to bleed. The blood is on my stool, in the toilet (at times) and when I wipe, I can see it on the toilet paper. Other symptoms I experience are rectal itching and discomfort after my bowel movement. I went to the ER and they did a CT scan and did not see anything out of the normal. The doctor did a rectal examination and did not see any hemorrhoids at the time. After a month or so, I went to see my primary care physician and he said during my rectal examination, he had seen grade-1 hemorrhoids. The bleeding continues. It only happens every now and then. Being that, it has been so long I am just concerned it could be something else (cancer). Should I ask for a colonoscopy?","Doctor":"Hi. If the doctor who did the PR examination could not find any significant hemorrhoids, it is better to get a colonoscopy done. Do not worry about cancer as the most likely possibility is a missed internal hemorrhoid. The itching can be due to perianal soiling, fungal infection, or worm infestation. Keep the area dry and clean. I suggest having a single dose of Albendazole 400 mg tablet. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicine with their consent. You can take a picture of the perianal region and look for skin damage. Do review with your reports if you have any further queries.

Is there any better herb or supplements that can help prevent my situation.","Doctor":"Hello. There are a few things you should know about this condition. First of all, if the ejaculations happen before two minutes during sex, we call it as premature ejaculation. There are two types. One is the primary type that is from the beginning of sex life, usually kind of a genetic condition. Secondary type is usually due to some risk factors like performance anxiety, overweight, stress or thyroid disorder. Vitamin D deficiency also can contribute. Around 20 percent males have this condition.  Treatment wise there are natural methods including pelvic strengthening exercises, certain diet changes, and Ayurvedic supplements. Natural methods will help and the effect is long-standing but it may take time to show its effect, till then medicines may be necessary so a combination of both medicines and natural will be required.

Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 72-year-old woman and having back pain for more than three days across the lower back and sides. It feels like inflammation. How can I tell if this is simple back pain or kidney problems? I take Lithium twice a day (bipolar) and Levothyroxine. Also Vitamins, Fiber gel tablet and occasionally Melatonin and Ativan for sleep. I have been on Lithium for over 30 years. I understand it can impact the kidneys. My liver and kidneys tested normal two months ago. I usually take Aleve for pain but yesterday, I accidentally took too much Vicodin for pain and had reactions (hot flash, nausea, and vomiting). Today I am off from all painkillers and using hot or cold compresses and rest. Kindly advice.","Doctor":"Hi. If your pain is aggravated by movements and improved by rest, then it is probably due to musculoskeletal rather than kidney problems. One of the tests to find out is to do a urine test to find out if there are signs of infection or blood. You mentioned that you have fatigue. And in this case, I would recommend that you visit your doctor to have blood tests and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan of your back as soon as possible.

I would pee normally but would still feel bladder is not empty. I tried a home remedy and from the past two days, my back has started to hurt a lot. I am currently on an antibiotic (Zenflox UTI). My urinary problem has gone once I started taking antibiotic but I still do have back pain. I got my urine examination done today. I am attaching the report. Today I had slight vaginal bleeding when I wiped.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. I would like to know a few more details. Is this the first time you have had a urinary tract infection or has it happened in the past? If so, is it frequent? Are you married, had any children? A single episode of UTI (urinary tract infection) in women is not a cause for concern. If you have repeated infections then it needs to be evaluated. Since you are symptomatically improving on antibiotics, I would suggest you to continue the same. If you still have symptoms after 72 hours of medication, then you would need further evaluation. Your urinalysis (attachment removed to protect patient identity) shows evidence of infection, but the specimen has been contaminated with vaginal secretions, so it is hard to say with certainty. I would ask you not to worry as in 90 percent cases uncomplicated UTI such as yours resolve with antibiotics in three to four days.

Do you have any medical advise for it? It occurs when I wear underwear for a long time.","Doctor":"Hello. Please maintain good hygiene. Keep the area dry and avoid friction and sweating as much as you can. I suggest applying Hydrozole cream two times daily. Also, capsule Fluconazole 150 mg on Fridays. Take for two Fridays. It is a weekly capsule. Wear loose clothes. For more information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 19-year-old male. I was playing basketball with my friend and his knee went hard into the lower outside of my lower left calf. After that, it began to hurt and now it has been about six hours and I struggle to put weight on it. It sends pain down into my foot and ankle and moving my foot up and down hurts my calf and leg. My leg also does not seem to be bruised but it hurts to touch where his knee hit me.","Doctor":"Hi. Start applying cold pack in the place where it hurts. Avoid weight bearing on the injured leg. Weight bearing will aggravate the injury to become more. Avoid movements in the left ankle joint. You might have injured several tissues when you got hit by your friend's knee and there are chances of even a hairline crack in the bone during your injury. You may need an X-ray done. Contact an orthopedician or physiotherapist to start getting treated as splinting of the joint is very essential. Delaying it will make things worse rather than any better.

I also have noticed my groin/butt area gets really warm from sitting. I have noticed my urethra tip is red as well from seven days. I do not have pain while using the urinal or seeing any blood or discharge. I have started taking antibiotics (Doxycycline) but symptoms still remain. Did urine test and it came out negative. Is it normal to have these symptoms for a week now? Could it be something else than urethritis? How long do you think will symptoms disappear?","Doctor":"Hello. This could also be an allergic manifestation. Since there are no urinary symptoms, urethritis is less likely. Doxy covers chlamydia and other organisms for urethritis. Usually, a 15-day course is enough. If there is no improvement, you may also consider seeing a dermatologist.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I have two fibroids about 5 to 6 cm. Could that cause preterm labor?","Doctor":"Hi. Preterm labor can be the result of many reasons like intrauterine infection, cervical incompetence, fetal anomalies, intrauterine growth restriction, high blood pressure, abnormal placentation, trauma, multiple pregnancies, maternal uterine anomaly, prelabour preterm rupture of membranes, etc. In pregnancy, if not multiple seedling fibroids in grand multipara with soft and weak tissue texture of uterus (dangerous for post-delivery bleeding), normally one or two fibroids of 5 to 6 cm should reduce in size naturally. Fibroids locations if it is present at cervix can affect labor, can weaken cervix that lead to preterm labor or middle pedunculated fibroid which is distorting uterine cavity can also need myomectomy before conception. I do not have any idea about fibroids locations in your case but it is better to have a re-scan for size and location and discuss here or with your treating gynecologist. Some locations and sizes need intervention before pregnancy to have a good outcome. Have Folic acid 0.4 mg daily if not having any chronic disease. Have full treatment of any disease that you and your partner have and discuss advised medications effects on pregnancy and conception. Quit recreational drugs and have recreational activities both of you. Daily exercise, healthy nutritious diet, balanced BMI (body mass index). After scan and detailed discussion regarding fibroids size and location, you can retry for conception.

In cases of infertility and recurrent miscarriages, myomectomy is considered a last resort treatment, either hysteroscopic resection or myomectomy. In case of endometrium pushing fibroid and polyp better to remove before IVF (in vitro fertilization). Radiologically controlled uterine artery embolization is also an option for symptomatic fibroids in those who do not want to have a pregnancy. Rarely complications are observed in simple myomectomy and polypectomy.

This makes me extremely insecure especially when people keep pointing it out. Every day I get at least two people asking me what is wrong with me and why do I look so pale and sick. I could be feeling really good and energized but look like a zombie from the outside. Please tell me if I can correct this and look healthy? I am not married and do not have kids and my period is regular and a bit heavy.","Doctor":"Hello. In thalassemia minor patient, Hb (hemoglobin) usually remains around 10-11 gm/dl. It is hemolytic anemia and so extramedullary erythropoiesis occurs in the bone marrow (attachment removed to protect patient identity). So, the mandible is also affected and become prominent. Low Hb is also present, hence people might notice you. You can be prescribed Iron tablet like Ferrous ascorbate for your Hb improvement. Consult nearby hematologist for examination and get your prescription. Thalassemia minor people can live normally and before marriage check your husband thalassemia minor report to avoid thalassemia major child.

It was really bad during the weekend and I found a white spot in the eye. I went to an ophthalmologist and he just had a look through the machine. He said it could be marginal keratitis and gave me drops and cream. Uncomfortable feeling and watery eye have gone, but, the spot is still there. That spot is in the cornea and I can see a white line in the white (cornea) also. What can it be? And if it is keratitis, when will the spot disappear? I am really worried.","Doctor":"Hi. Can you name the medicines that your doctor prescribed? Marginal keratitis is not a disease to be taken lightly. The white spot will lighten as the healing begins but will not completely vanish. Send me the pictures of the doctor's file and the medications prescribed.

Some time ago I had pain. I am feeling this for two years. Also, I visited a urologist who saw this and went through the sonography and urine test. But he said I cannot find anything. What might be the cause?","Doctor":"Hi. This looks like chronic prostatitis (long standing inflammation of the prostate). It can be confirmed by a rectal exam, sometimes enlarged prostate on sonography and in some cases positive urine or semen cultures. In some cases, diagnosis is clinical as all tests are negative. Treatment includes long term antibiotics, anti-inflammatory, and medicines to soothe irritated nerves. I would suggest a semen culture, a post-prostatic-massage urine culture and sonography of prostate. Start tablet Moxiflox (Moxifloxacin) 400 mg once daily for 10 days, Enzoflam (Paracetamol, Diclofenac, and Serratiopeptidase) twice daily for seven days, Pantocid (Pantoprazole) 40 mg once daily for seven days, and Tryptomer (Amitriptyline) 10 mg once daily for 10 days. Moxiflox may cause joint pain or tendinitis, Tryptomer may cause sedation. Let me know the above reports and also how it goes."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My A1c is 5.4 and my fasting glucose is 107 and I was taking 800 mg of Seroquel which is a medication for paranoid schizophrenia and is known for causing diabetes and high blood sugar and five minutes after taking a 400 mg pill, one day my sugar went over 200 and the next day five minutes after taking a 400 mg pill, my sugar went up to 495. So, I stopped the Seroquel. According to my A1c, I am a nondiabetic, according to my fasting glucose, I am a pre-diabetic, and according to those two high blood sugar readings, I am a serious diabetic. Those are three different diagnoses. But those two high readings could have just been because of the Seroquel because I have never had high readings like that other than when I was taking the Seroquel and I was taking a high dose. A lot of people only take 100 to 200 mg, but I was taking 800 mg. So, do you think I am a diabetic or do you think it was just the Seroquel that caused the two high readings?","Doctor":"Hello. Quetiapine (Seroquel) in such high doses may produce hyperglycemia. So, the first possibility is drug-induced hyperglycemia. So, try to reduce the dosage after consulting your doctor. You have to monitor your blood sugar regularly when you are taking these type of drugs. The second possibility is new-onset diabetes and a wrong HbA1c lab report. So you have to check your FBS and PPBS with HbA1c again after few days. So, if FBS is less than 100, PPBS is less than 140 mg/dl, and HbA1c is less than 5.7, you are not diabetic. If FBS is between 100 to 125 mg/dl, PPBS is at 140 to 200 mg/dl, and HbA1c is at 15.7 to 6.4, you are prediabetic. Anyway check your blood sugar regularly and try to reduce weight. Do adequate exercise.

Recently, diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with controlled rate. He is taking Acitrom 3 mg now, his blood pressure is 120/80 mm of Hg. He is on homeopathic mother tincture crataegus for the heart. Recently, he has checked his INR which came 1.51. He had shown to a doctor. He only started Acitrom 3 mg. He also said to take Met XL 25. But as he could not get it easily from medical shops, he did not start. My query is when his blood pressure is controlled to 120/80 mm of Hg and is not having palpitation, then why should we start Met XL 25 (beta blocker), as this may lower the blood pressure again? why should a patient take more medicines?","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, his INR (international normalized ratio) is not in range. It should be between 2 to 3. So, his Acitrom (Acenocoumarol) dose should be increased to 3 and 4 mg on alternate days (3 mg on one and 4 mg on the next day) and get his INR checked after one week. INR should be checked monthly. Alternatively, if there are no financial issues, then he can have tablet Dabigatran, which is a blood thinner and does not require INR monitoring. Next, regarding Met XL (Metoprolol Succinate), the reason for the prescription is to control the heart. His heart rate may be on the higher side. So, he might have started. Also, this is for preventive purpose as well. His heart rate intermittently may rise to a very high level. So, beta blockers will prevent it. He is not on any rate control medicine at present. If heart rate increases, then his BP may fall, and he will have shortness of breath, chest pain, etc. If BP falls significantly, then the dose of Olmark (Olmesartan) can be decreased. If BP persistently stays below 110, then he should have just Olmark instead of Olmark A (Olmesartan and Amlodipine). Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.

A few days ago, I started and it is really mucusy and only when I wipe and food has not been appealing to me and when I do eat, I cannot eat much. This morning I feel nauseous and that is not normal for me either. I have two other kids and with them, I did not have any but maybe two symptoms, that was peeing a lot and food did not appeal to me the first 14 weeks. The last time I had sex was the 10th.","Doctor":"Hello. Hormones have different side effects and appear different from person to person. Mirena is a hormone-secreting contraceptive device which shows it effects like mood swings, breast tenderness, irregular bleeding, etc. According to one study, 20 % of the females stopped menses after a year's use of Mirena. Most of the women felt menstrual changes in the first three to six months of Mirena application like intermenstrual spotting, light irregular bleeding, very light menses. Some of the females showed heavy menstrual flow. Mood swings is also another side effect which you are feeling a lot. Try to have a healthy lifestyle like yoga, exercise, walk daily. Have recreational activities like painting, and swimming. But avoid recreational drugs like alcohol, cocaine, ketamine, etc. If you had diagnosed any problem or have any other symptoms, try to have full treatment. It is your choice if you want to continue with Mirena or want any other contraceptive if does not suit you. I suggest switching to combined oral contraceptive pills for some time to reduce Mirena effects (after removal of Mirena). Have urinalysis and urine culture for urine problem, follow report and use lots of water and cranberry juice. In case of absence of urine infection try to avoid fluids before work and sleep at night to have less disturbances. Pelvic floor exercise strengthens muscles and helps avoid incontinence. Try to go to a gynecologist with urinalysis report and discuss symptoms as well to have a proper examination to decide for related investigations.

Can you please explain to me the clinical presentation of decompensated phoria? I have had diplopia for over two years now, binocular, horizontal, worse on distant gaze. I have had an MRI as well, but no lesions found in my brain stem or other areas. Only a few white spots, punctate, in both hemispheres. They say, it is not cranial nerve palsy, so I wondered if it could be some kind of muscle-misalignment caused by decompensated phoria. I also have astigmatism, myopia (left eye -3.75 and right eye -4.25). I am very anxious about this diplopia being a sign of MS. (I have severe health-anxiety). I have no other symptoms, no headache, and taking no medicines.","Doctor":"Hi. Diplopia for distance vision is more common in neurological conditions. If you do not have any neurological problems (ruled out by MRI), other problems can be considered. In your case, as you have high myopia, it can be due to decompensated tropia (phoria). In myopia, there is a loss of accommodation since childhood. This will lead to loss or decrease of fusion (focus on an object). This may lead to intermittent diplopia. This can be improved to some extent by fusion exercises like holding a pen in hand and looking at the tip of the pen, bring it slowly near to your nose. Repeat this exercise daily 5 to 10 minutes morning and evening. You can send pictures of your eyes for better evaluation and treatment. You can also call for any queries.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

After five days of taking the tablet, I experienced spotting for two days and very light bleeding on the third day. I have not had my periods since then. What are my chances of getting pregnant? If I am not pregnant, when should I expect my periods? Should I count my cycle from 2nd or 15th, that is, the date when I experienced light bleeding due to pill? Also, could the bleeding that I experienced be implantation bleeding since it was too less? I also took a home pregnancy test on 21st that gave a negative result but I am not sure if I can rely on it. Should I take another pregnancy test?","Doctor":"Hello. The Unwanted 72 has a success rate of 99 % and so the withdrawal bleed that you experienced on 15th is more likely to be pill withdrawal rather than an implantation bleed. Another reason being you were on day-9 of your cycle during your act of sexual intimacy which was within your safe period, presuming that you have regular cycles. However, you may get a serum beta hCG test done to conclusively rule out pregnancy if in doubt. If the hCG levels are less than 3 mIU then you are surely not pregnant. If not pregnant, then your next menses shall be by 20-21st of the following month or late by a week to 10 days considering 15th as your fresh LMP.

I read carefully your question and would explain that fecal incontinence is not a common sign of stroke. It could be related to vascular dementia (compatible with the MRI findings). Coming to this point, I would recommend some diet modifications (avoiding food which can increase the motility like orange or plum juice, caffeine, etc.) and performing a stool analysis. Loperamide or Diphenoxylate/Atropine can help reduce the gut motility and thus lead to constipation and reduce the frequency of defecation.

Some dentists are saying that I have to get root canal treatment but I insist any other treatment. Please tell me what is the solution to aid my tooth as soon as possible. Currently, I have taken homeopathic medicine.","Doctor":"Hi. Considering your age, the front tooth should be a permanent tooth. You have mentioned it has turned blue and no pain which indicates that the blood supply to the tooth is stopped hence it is like a dead tooth. Since it is the front one, it is foremost important to retain the tooth for aesthetics. So to do that, a root canal treatment is the best option to stick with where the vital part of the tooth is cleaned and filled with a medication to prevent infection in the future and then a filling or crown is placed to cover up the discoloration. If you are seeking for other options, then leaving the tooth just like that is what I suggest. But in this case, you should be alright with the discoloration of the tooth.

I have read your post thoroughly and I understand that you need a sense of direction in terms of the origin of the pathology. Now, it could be a number of things. The fact that it started with you starting to lift weights puts us in the direction of both a hernia or a pulled muscle. Having said that, the cramps cannot be because of a pulled muscle. If it were to be something to do with your colon, it would account for the crampy nature of the pain. Also since it is getting worse, it could be something along the lines of a colonic inflammation, a diverticulitis in an existing diverticulosis is a likely possibility. But I need to know if the pain has any relation to meal intake, like, does it get worse after one? Also, is your bowel movement normal? It could be gynecological as well but do you have any other symptoms that would suggest that? Also, it is very very important to know if your periods are regular and is there any possibility of a pregnancy? Sometimes ectopic pregnancy also presents this way.

Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My penis is not sensitive to pleasure at all. On the other hand, rubbing glans hurts a lot instead of giving a pleasurable feeling. Also, rubbing causes a nerve to twitch in my groin.

If possible, can you please elaborate a little bit on what was the outcome of those hearts tests you mentioned earlier? If I assume there was not much they found abnormal in the cardiac evaluation three and a half years back, then she need not worry about the heart to be arrested suddenly. If there are no major risk factors, she is less likely to have SCA (sudden cardiac arrest). Females are less prone to get SCA compared to men. Getting pain in chest at the same time every time is not so relevant to the heart-associated pain unless there is a specific activity that triggers that pain at the same time every day. She should definitely take her medications on time and I would suggest getting all the heart investigations done afresh.

On a two-balloon endoscopy of the small intestine, colonoscopy with ileoscopy, CT, MRI revealed nothing. So, we can determine the location of spasm only with X-ray and barium follow through. I did barium follow through several times (with an interval of six months). There was a disagreement among the doctors and they agreed about etiology of obstruction (dynamic/spastic), but cannot decide the location of the spasm. Treatment recommended is therapeutical - endoscopic injections of Botulinum toxin into the intestine (they call it chemical denervation, and recommend it because that conservative drug therapy does not help. Therefore, it is important to know the exact location of spasm. I ask for help in this matter. I am attaching the links. The study was started 11 and half hours after swallowing barium. The last shot was taken 35 hours after swallowing barium. So, there is stasis/stagnation about 30 hours in the small intestine. The most important question is the exact location of the spastic area. It is important to know the location and length of spasm in centimeters, at least in some ranges (if absolute accuracy is not possible, but if it is possible, at least within the margin of error of a few cm, that would be perfect). This information is necessary for the doctor to develop further treatment tactics. Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello. The condition idiopathic spastic intestinal obstruction/spastic ileus is a unique and rare condition indeed. In the barium pictures, the involved area is usually seen like a sudden constriction of a segment of the small or large bowel. The segment involved can be visualized as a thin pencil-like narrowing. There can be one location involved or it can involve multiple short or long segments. The usual findings are a sudden narrowing of the bowel for a few inches. Your barium swallow images done on the 5th (attachment removed to protect patient identity), show a normal transit of barium in the esophagus and into the stomach lumen. The study is started at 10.10 AM and we can see the barium in the jejunum in the 11.27 image. There is no narrowing in the segments visualized. In the 06.03 PM image, there is a suspicious short segment of sudden narrowing of bowel in the right lower pelvis and is likely one of the affected areas. In the second series of images done on the 18th, there is no severe narrowing in any particular area. The ileocecal junction is seen narrow in some of the images but that can be normal.

I have gone through the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). She has low hemoglobin and deranged lipid profile. The lipid profile is mildly deranged and she should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according to her capacity atleast 30 minutes a day and five days a week. Get her BP checked once if not checked. She should repeat the lipid profile after eight weeks of healthy lifestyle. For her hemoglobin, which is likely due to iron deficiency only, we should get iron profile test done. I suggest she start iron supplements like tablet Fericip XT twice a day after meals. There should be a gap of atleast two hours between iron and calcium tablets. Repeat her hemoglobin after four to six weeks to see for an increase. The medicines should be continued at least six months after hemoglobin is corrected in once-daily dosing to replenish stores.

Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction.

For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy.

I have not noticed, however, signs of atrophy or actual weakness (I am able to do everyday tasks with my hands, etc). I also do not have difficulty breathing or speaking. I have had a blood test done and I do not lack any minerals. Levels of my thyroid hormones are normal. I do not drink coffee and I do not smoke. I get enough hours of sleep every day and I also would not say that I am under an extreme amount of stress. I went to see a neurologist a week and a half ago who performed a quick test to examine my reflexes and strength, stated they were normal and said I probably have BFS (benign fasciculation syndrome). However, I am still worried that I might have motor neuron disease. The fasciculations are extremely annoying and I have no idea what might be causing (and worsening) them and I am also worried because of the newly acquired pain, cramping, and feeling of tiredness in my hands. Not a single day passes by without my muscles twitching. I am female, 21 years old. I do not have a family history of neuromuscular disease. I would like to know whether my symptoms are indicative of ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Is it possible to get some tests or examinations that would exclude ALS? I would really like to find out the reason behind my fasciculations as they have started to interfere greatly with my peace of mind.","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that your symptoms do not seem to be related to ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Besides, at your age, this diagnosis would be exceptional. I agree with your doctor that benign fasciculation syndrome seems to be the most probable cause of your complaints, considering the fact that all your blood lab tests resulted normal. Anyway, an electromyography coupled with nerve conduction studies would help definitely exclude ALS. I would also recommend checking Vitamin D and B12 plasma levels for the possible deficiency. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests. I remain at your disposal for any other questions whenever you need.

While in the hospital and rehabilitation, I complained of my ear hurting. I often collect ear wax, so I thought that was the problem. Now that I am home and have a CNA and therapist helping me get stronger, the ear pain is the only pain I have. She put Debrox and Hyland’s earache drops in my ear. She flushed the ear with warm water for two days. The pain is so bad that I can hardly eat because chewing hurts. It hurts in my mouth too. I have been putting saltwater in, but it does not seem to help. Might I have an ear infection? I am not well enough to go to an ENT’s office, and I am not sure if they are open. Any advice you can give would be greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello. It is likely that you have developed otitis externa following wax removal. Syringing often leaves some moisture in the ear and this provides an ideal medium for fungi to grow in. Do you have pain while touching your tragus or moving your pinna? If you have severe pain then you may need analgesics. It would be better to use Paracetamol 500 tablet as and when required. You can also use ear drops containing (Clotrimazole, Neomycin or Ofloxacin, Beclomethasone, and Lidocaine) eg. Candibiotic ear drops. If there is visible swelling or redness of the ear canal you can also use a topical ointment like Mupirocin cream with a q tip twice or thrice a day. Hot fomentation around pinna also helps in reducing pain and inflammation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I just did chest X-ray and I believe it does not show anything. What can it be? Also, my blood work is normal except high uric acid level.","Doctor":"Hello. Your X-ray is fine (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and no lump is visible on the X-ray. The first possibility and common cause is a lipoma. If possible, you may upload a picture of the lump. Also, let me know, whether it is just below the skin or attached to the sternum, in upper or lower part of the sternum, duration of lump. So, from the description you gave, it is likely a lipoma which is a painless swelling, below the skin, slightly mobile and not attached to the bone. It is benign and usually needs no treatment. However, one may undergo minor surgery to remove it for cosmetic concerns.  It is not related to uric acid. For uric acid, have a healthy lifestyle, exercise and try to achieve weight loss. Also, limit non-vegetarian food if you are having in plenty. It needs treatment like Febuxostat if more than 10. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.

What I wanted to ask was if I had sex while still being on a strong pill and then around a week and a half later I stopped taking it (my doctor said it is active for quite some time after quitting it) could I still be pregnant? Even if eight pregnancy tests were done in a span of three months said it is negative and I had my period as regular? I am 21 years old, always had digestive problems and a bloated belly, which is why probably I am being driven crazy but still want a professional opinion.","Doctor":"Hi. At the time of sex, you were on the pill so the chance of pregnancy is nil. Because sperms usually do not survive in your womb for more than three to four days after sex, and during that time you were on the pill. Moreover, eight pregnancy tests done in a span of three months were negative and you had the period as regular. So relax you are not pregnant. For digestive problems, you can do ultrasound test of the abdomen. Also, I can suggest chewing cardamom as a whole to reduce bloating.

As you said ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors usually will not produce any hallucination or psychosis but some rare reports of hallucinations are available which was mainly visual hallucination not auditory, but psychosis is unlikely. Anyway, you change Enalapril to some other antihypertensive tablets like Calcium channel blockers or beta blockers and see the change. If it is not improving with above medicine change, you have to evaluate further by getting a thyroid function test (hypo or hyperthyroidism), hemoglobin (Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia or iron deficiency) and calcium level with serum phosphorous (hyperparathyroidism- high calcium and parathyroid hormone). If above tests are normal, get an MRI brain and rule out any organic causes. If everything comes as normal, consult a neurologist or psychiatrist.

Also, some mental confusion, lights, and difficulty reading. No headaches. I did have an odd spell of paraesthesia that lasted five minutes a week or so after head injury. I inched better. Then next month I fell onto stomach in the parking lot. There were no additional symptoms. Then four weeks ago bumped head on the headboard of bed bending over to get something that fell behind it. No marks but I do have head pain at top of the head but mainly a burning type. This did start until a couple days later perhaps I have nausea but this also started later about two weeks. Seems to be better if I do not think about the head and leave an hour after eating before reclining. I had symptoms of pain all around the edge of chest pain and into center rib pain when breathing a month back. I had earlier in the week slight sore throat. Later, I coughed a bunch of green stuff out. I also found that I was running a high blood pressure even for about 10 days after the end of the symptoms. I stayed in bed in order to keep the blood pressure down. Still some discomfort even this week. I had electrocardiogram last week that showed no problem. I have sleep apnea. Then 10 days ago I was taking my sleep apnea mask off and was walking to the bathroom and slipped and fell backward into a chair semi-padded lightly bonking my head.I am 62 years old and blood pressure normal. Eyes are normal. Like I said intermittent nausea. Reading skills up to 90 %. I did a voice change. I am talking about hire registry. This seems to happen about four weeks ago. Also, my sense of smell has improved recently. I have continual dry mouth possibly because of stress. I do not have vomiting. No slurred speech, occasional word misplacement, no unusual weakness. Have to spend half my time in bed as I felt it was best to protect my head not able to drive all around with it so basically for the last month 75 % of the time I have been in bed which I hate. I do also have an ear infection. This has been going on for two years off and on. And in this time frame, it has been mainly a burning pain in the right ear which is also the same side of my head which I bumped originally four months back. I get tense. I have tried drops in the few homeopathic remedies Natrum sulphuricum. I have also lost some weight not a lot but 5 lbs and a lot of it seems to be disconcertingly around my face. So my question would be do you think a subdural hematoma would be involved or perhaps just a continuing recovery of the original head trauma?","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that your symptoms are not typical of a dural hematoma. You should know that this disorder, usually causes progressive worsening symptoms like a headache, nausea, gait imbalances, limb numbness or weakness, somnolence and even seizures. So, as your symptoms are fluctuating in time, a subdural hematoma is less possible. Dizziness is quite common due to a possible inner disorder or after a head concussion. You should know that head trauma can lead to an inner ear disorder which is called benign positional paroxysmal vertigo, which causes dizziness and falling. Anyway, I would recommend avoiding any repeated trauma and having some rest. If your situation does not improve or even worsens, I would recommend going to the ER (emergency room) for a brain CT (computed tomography) scan to exclude a subdural hematoma (considering the fact that you have had repeated head trauma in the last months).

There is no pain but there is itching and burning on my anus area. I am very much panicked. Is it a sign of hemorrhoids or something else?","Doctor":"Hi. It is normal to have increased frequency after a pouch. As the effluent is liquid and is only ileal content, it may cause itching around the anus. Hemorrhoids will be out after proctocolectomy. Things will get better with time. There is also slightly higher chance of developing pouchitis, but it is too early for pouchitis.

It looks like you have a bacterial throat infection and the red spots on the tongue are due to inflamed tongue papillae. For confirmation, consult an otolaryngologist and get a thorough clinical evaluation and investigations like throat swab culture can help in diagnosis. They will suggest a course of antibiotics like Augmentin, anti-inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen, doing warm saline gargles, steam inhalation and using a humidifier in your room. You can also suck throat lozenges, chew Vitamin C pellet and avoid spicy and chilled foods. Hope this helps.

I was checked out by multiple doctors both dermatologists and gynecologists to give me the all clear, but this spot popped up on my stomach two nights ago and it is freaking me out. It is just below my belly button and intensely itchy, which my previous lesions were not, but just looking for some reassurance that this is not molluscum again.","Doctor":"Hello. Looking at your clinical picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and considering the onset of the lesion, and itching, it does not look like molluscum contagiosum. Most of the time, molluscum is asymptomatic, presents with a white solid bump with a central depression (umbilication). It is most probably an insect bite reaction. Topical Calamine lotion should give you relief from itching. The other possibility is scabies or ectoparasitic infestation. In scabies, there will be itchy bumps seen around the belly button, on the finger web spaces, wrist, armpits, groin, etc. Check for these sites if you have any red bumps. Check your pet animals if you have any, for mites and fleas.

My mind thinks I am infected but I am really not. Is there something I can do?","Doctor":"Hi. You seem to have a phobia about rabies. You could benefit from counselling. If that does not work, then you might need anti-anxiety drugs. Practicing meditation can also take your mind off it. Basically, you need to divert your mind elsewhere. The less you think about it, the less it will bother you. In a few weeks, you will see that the intensity of the phobia has significantly decreased.

Please advise what it can be.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the images (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Are these distributed evenly on the back, also in the chest? If yes, it strongly raises the possibility of chickenpox, especially if not suffered from it in the past. If these lesions are distributed only in a small localized area then likely to be herpes infection. Please upload a few more pics from the distance. Also, check the other body parts for lesions. You will need Acyclovir based on body weight if it is chickenpox. Consult a specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. You can apply Lactocalamine lotion locally for a soothing effect. Also, I suggest Paracetamol 500 mg for fever. Are there other symptoms like sore throat, cough, burning on urination? It is better if you can get yourself examined by a local doctor in person. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.

It is not warm to touch but an internal warm sensation that feels like you put a warm cup of coffee against a patch of skin for a second or two and then it goes away. It appears in a wave-like pattern. It shows up in one-two seconds, then it disappears for about 10-15 minutes, then shows up again. So it is not constantly present. It is not painful at all, just annoying and it is really sending my health anxiety off. Does this sound like MS or anxiety? I do not take any meds. No other symptoms. Kinds regards","Doctor":"Hello. The intermittent burning sensation in your left arm could be due to several reasons. Most commonly, we see this if there is any cervical spondylosis with the nerve being pushed. This can lead to a certain area in the arm to be painful. Again, the pain can be intermittent depending on the neck movements. Another possibility is a neuropathy due to vitamin B12 deficiency which could be tested on a blood test. Multiple sclerosis is another possibility, but that seems less likely as the symptoms would persist for few days and then they start improving. It would not last only for 10 to 15 minutes and come back again. If all of these possibilities are ruled out by clinical neurological exam and/or diagnostic testing, then this could be a somatoform disorder which can be associated with anxiety. I hope this helps.

I have been having UTI almost for three days a week and have been taking Norflox 400 twice a day. I was an alcoholic taking 360 ml of brandy every day and recently a month back, I have quit that habit. I now want to focus on my health. I went to a diabetic center and started Trulicity for weekly insulin for sugar control. I gave urine culture ten days back and the report shows Enterococcus faecalis with a colony count greater than 1000000 and only four antibiotics as susceptible, namely, Cefotaxime, Meropenem, Imipenem, and Vancomycin. My diabetic doctor has prescribed Meronem 500 mg injection twice a day for five days. My question is:  I cannot afford Meronem 500 mg as 10 injections are very expensive. I found that Cefotaxime is the cheapest among the four of them. Can I have that injected for five days, twice a day?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, you can take Cefotaxime 1 gm twice a day for five days after a test dose for allergy. Controlling your blood glucose levels will help to lower the episodes of UTI (urinary tract infection).

He is currently in class 10 and giving his board exams. He is academically oriented, has been always good in studies and wants to maintain his good image in front of his peers and teachers. Since last two months, he is having a few problems as follows:  He is having problems in his eyes and feels that his attention is drawn to his blinking and he has to blink consciously as he feels his automatic blinking does not happen. If he does not consciously blink his eyes start watering and irritating. He feels this is affecting his concentration in studies. I had shown him to an eye doctor a month back and he said it could be due to dry eyes and prescribed teardrops which he is using regularly since then, but there has been no improvement. Moreover, my son feels it is a problem with his mind and he is not able to get his attention off the blinking of his eyes. Not sure if there is a connection, around two months back he was reading the chapter of involuntary and voluntary actions of the human body in his biology book and that some actions are both voluntary and involuntary. He says his problem started around the same time. He also says that he feels suffocated and often needs to breathe voluntarily. He read about it in the same chapter. He also says that he has to swallow his saliva consciously or voluntarily, something he read about too in the same chapter. Overall he complains more about his eye problem and little less about the above two problems. He is an only child. He does not open up easily but once he does he talks a lot. At home with us and with his few friends at school, he talks a lot. He loves to follow sports. He is not very active but has a normal height (5 feet 8 inches) and weight (65 Kg approximately) for his age. He is myopic since the age of 9 and has the following approximate power: Left eye: -5.5 spherical and -0.5 cylindrical, right eye: -6 spherical and -0.75 cylindrical. We give him nutritious food at home and he is not fussy about food. He has a regular sleep schedule of around 7.5 hours at night. He is worried before going to sleep that he will not be able to sleep due to conscious breathing problem but he does fall asleep and sleeps well after that. Also, he is afraid of lizards and feels that he suffers from the phobia of lizards. He does get scared of insects very easily. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query and understand your concerns. From the available description I do not think it is serious problem and diverting attention from the areas of concern should be the prime strategy. In case the simple measures of diverting attention do not help him I feel seeking opinion from psychiatrist should not be delayed. The description clearly indicates that there is anxiety problem, the child is more conscious about his body, have a neurotic pattern of thinking. The problem can be managed with counseling and psychotherapy in most children. However few of them may need medication for a certain duration depending upon the severity and response.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

But, you also probably did not realize at that time that she is not the right sexual mate for you, though a great intellectual companion. Although your body responded through erection and other bodily reactions, your mind remained cold and unresponsive because the sex appeal is missing or you just see her as an intellectual companion but not as a soulmate. This happens, and maybe a reason why there was very little sexual excitement during intercourse or upon touching her.

However, I have some questions about the anti-constipation drug that I would like answered from a neurological point of view. The drug is called Prucalopride and is described to be a selective, high affinity, serotonin 5-HT 4 receptor antagonist with enterokinetic activities and alters colonic motility patterns via serotonin 5 HT-4 receptor stimulation. One of the common side effects can be a headache (among a few other things but that is the one I am particularly worried about) in the initial stages of taking the drug, but I just wanted to check that if I did experience such a side effect and it continued while taking the medication past the initial stages, that would it cease if I stopped the medication. I just worry about irreversible side effects with prokinetic drugs and drugs which work as serotonin receptor antagonists in the gut as I discovered that another prokinetic drug I was prescribed to speed up stomach emptying (Metoclopramide), which I did not end up taking as it had some irreversible side effects such as a condition called tardive dyskinesia and other serious side effects. What I was most worried about is that there appears to be some similarity in the mechanism of how Metoclopramide and Prucalopride work. The pharmacodynamics of Prucalopride is a serotonin 5-HT4 receptor antagonist and Metoclopramide states that Metoclopramide appears to bind to dopamine D2 receptors and is also a mixed 5-HT3 receptor antagonist/5-HT4 receptor antagonist . I referred to an extract in Wikipedia in the pharmacology section on the page about how Metoclopramide works. I noted how Prucalopride is also said to be a 5-HT4 receptor antagonist. I assume that however, they do not carry the same risk of tardive dyskinesia as I have not seen it documented so far for Prucalopride even though there seem to be some similarities in their mechanism of action. So in short, this is what I wanted to check before taking Prucalopride that it did not cause these similar irreversible conditions and side effects as Metoclopramide and that if Prucalopride did cause me to get headaches, would this stop if I stopped taking Prucalopride. I have one more question. Sometimes, off and on, over the last couple of years, I experienced a kind of noise in perhaps my ears but in the head area anyway, particularly after vomiting a lot due to the slow stomach emptying. I assume this was from some nutritional deficiency, perhaps an electrolyte imbalance, it seems chloride deficiency caused this. I am unsure if I have a chloride deficiency, but I do have low ferritin levels which can cause noises apparently. It seems to have gotten a lot better and sometimes is not there at all. The vomiting has largely stopped so I assume that is why, although it sometimes reappears if I am very stressed. My next question, therefore, is that I just wanted also to check if it was alright to take Prucalopride having had or sometimes still have this situation. Also, because it does state that one must not take Prucalopride with a neurological disorder. I do not know which one is correct.","Doctor":"Hello. You should know that Prucalopride has a different mechanism of action compared to Metoclopramide. So, it does not cause the same adverse effects. Its effects are on 5-HT4 receptors, which are mainly in the gut. These receptors are rare in the central nervous system. There are no contraindications to Prucalopride in patients with any neurological disorders. If you experience headache, it may be a temporary effect and the drug should not be stopped, as the situation is going to improve in the next coming weeks. Only if diarrhea or abdominal cramps occur, the drug should be stopped. This drug does not cause any irreversible neurological disorders.

Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I took Breeky for abortion two months back which completed successfully. Now, I have not yet started menses. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello. Normally, the periods take around two to three months to resume after taking Breeky (Misoprostol).  I see you have a high BMI (body mass index). That may be one reason for irregular periods. Also, hypothyroidism needs to be ruled out. Just check your TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) and if it is more than the upper limit of normal, do consult a doctor nearby for starting treatment. In the meanwhile, try to cut down your extra calories and do workout. Hope this helps. Get back if you have any queries.

So, he just painfully pulled it out. He is really concerned because the tooth has a root on it. It is the second one from the back on the top right side.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through the complaint and the relevant details. Considering the age of your son, I am pretty sure it is the milk tooth that he has forcefully pulled out. Ask him if the tooth was loose and that he was not able to chew food properly on that side. Do not worry because it is a milk tooth which will otherwise shed on its own around this age if he had not pulled out himself. That empty space will be occupied by a permanent molar tooth eventually. You must have noticed that the pulled out tooth has uneven roots. It is a normal thing to be. Now my advice is that, please visit a nearby dentist to ensure there are no tooth remnants left behind in the socket which if present might hinder the eruption of the subsequent permanent tooth. Also, make sure there is no bleeding in that region and ask your son not to play and touch that region with his tongue. These are the ways one could help the socket heal properly.

Is it a withdrawal bleeding? My mensuration cycle is 30 days. Does it come under safe days or not?","Doctor":"Hi. Since you have taken the emergency pill within 72 hours of intercourse there is no chance of pregnancy. Yes, you had intercourse during your safe period, which is from day 1 to 10 of your period.

As such, I am fine. The only mild problem I have is burning eyes and palms and a little heavy back head after any meal. My BP ranges between 135 to 140 by 90 to 95 mmHg and blood sugar is 105 to 125 mg/dl (postprandial). I am currently taking antibiotics, Ocid 10, and Amlodipine 5.","Doctor":"Hi. I have reviewed all the attached laboratory reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and want to add that most of your reports are fine. There is increased liver enzyme (GGTP - Gamma-glutamyltransferase) that may be due to any reason but not limited to liver damage due to any liver disease e.g., hepatitis. Heart diseases and certain infections (e.g., pancreas infection) and taking medications that are toxic to the liver may also cause a raised GGT levels. You should consult a hepatologist for further probing and to see if there is anything wrong with the liver. He may go for hepatitis screening if needed. Your present complaints of burning eyes and palms may also be associated with the liver. You said you are taking antibiotics. Having an infection and being on antibiotics may also cause eyes and palms burning. Your blood sugar tests look normal. Cholesterol levels and other tests also seem to be normal to a large extent. No worries about that. If you do exercises regularly, your LDL (low-density lipoprotein) levels possibly would also come in normal range. You should take more and more water, and do a proper physical activity (exercise) in order to remain properly hydrated and active.

The symptoms you are telling about may suggest a possible traumatic perforation of your eardrum. That needs to be ruled out at the earliest by an ENT specialist. Pure tone audiometry. 1. Eardrum rupture. 2. Eardrum trauma without perforation. Traumatic perforations heal by themselves in the majority of cases. The ear needs to be kept dry. Occasionally, antibiotics and antihistaminics are required. Avoid water getting inside the ear.

A number of my sexual partners have developed sore throats and or flu-like symptoms a few days after we have had intercourse even though I do not develop the same problems.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your problem. Even if you are not developing symptoms, still this can be possible. Avoid oral intercourses for some time and see if the situation remains the same. In that case, we can think that you might have some chronic infection in the oral cavity like in tonsils or pharynx. This should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics like Azithromycin or Ofloxacin. Metronidazole should also be added in order to complete the cover. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. This prophylactic course should solve the problem. Take the course for at least a week. Get your urine culture and routine done to rule out any UTI (urinary tract infection). If that comes normal, then there is no need to get worrried. Thanks. I hope this helps you.

I have no idea what this all means or what does OM mean. I get pain in my chest, jaw and left arm. My doctor said this could be from GERD that I suffer with. I am constantly running to the ER. Can this be fixed? I am only 40 years old. There is a strong family history of heart disease.","Doctor":"Hi. Well, keeping in mind strong family history of heart disease any chest pain can mimic a heart pain. But this can or cannot be related to the heart. OM (obtuse marginal artery) is the name of the artery that is a small branch of main arteries that supply blood to heart's own muscles. OM is not one of the major arteries of the heart, those when blocked pose a greater risk than this smaller branch. Atheroma is something that blocks a blood vessel. It can be formed by fatty deposits and associated with other factors too. It blocks the passage of blood through heart vessels.  If your doctor (after possibly seeing the angiography reports) stated that you might be suffering from GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and the symptoms you feel may be due to that stomach issue, it means they are assuming not a major blockade in blood supply to heart's own muscles. In this case, I suggest you get another opinion from a cardiologist who can reinforce the same as the previous physician said or maybe he comes to a different conclusion. All it needs is a physical examination and closer look into the laboratory reports and if needed, further investigations. Yes, it can be fixed if we make a final decision on whether you need a cardiologist or a gastroenterologist to manage this issue. If GERD, the gastroenterologist would be the next person to jump in and handle it accordingly. It takes a different direction then.

We consulted a gynecologist. She suggested taking pelvis scan where they observed that endometrium line became thick. They informed that it was due to hormonal imbalance. Later we approached an endocrinologist where she has advised us some hormonal tests (prolactin, testosterone, thyroid tests). It seems the report was normal. For the past two months, she is taking Meprate 10 mg tablet from the 16th day to 25th day of menstrual cycle. And the subsequent falling period is normal. However, during the recent review with the gynecologist, she has advised taking full abdomen scan with the pelvis and there are no findings. Even the endometric layer is normal. Hence she came to an opinion like menstrual disorder is due to hormonal imbalance. The doctor advised undergoing for copper-T which is the only solution for hormonal imbalance and menstrual disorder. The endocrinologist said reports are fine. Both the statements are contrary. We are just confused to go ahead with the copper-T process. Please see the reports and kindly provide us the detailed clarification on this.","Doctor":"Hello. I do not think the doctor has advised copper-T. I think she would have advised intrauterine hormonal device called LNG (Levonorgestrel) which contains hormone progesterone. It will regularise the cycles and control heavy flow and need not take oral medicines. It is up to you to take the advice. As she is getting regular cycles now, you may wait. However, if the bleeding is heavier and any disturbances in the cycle, then go for the device.

Kindly guide regarding medicine.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the echocardiogram (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it is fine. You mentioned her to be a heart patient. Did she suffer an attack in the past or anything to suggest heart disease? I guess she just has blood pressure problem but no heart disease at present. The kind of pain you are describing is not angina pectoris, and likely it is not related to heart. This is likely a pain related to gastritis and reflux disease. Also, the possibility of muscular pain is there. Does she also have upper abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, burping, increase in pain on food, sour water feeling in throat or chest burning? These are the other symptoms and may be associated. If these symptoms are also there, then it raises the possibility of gastritis, and she should get prescribed tablet Pan DSR (Pantoprazole and Domperidone) 40 mg before breakfast once a day for two weeks. Have you got her ECG (electrocardiography) done? Is it normal? It is better to get treadmill test done as a part of routine screening in older patients. If she is not able to perform it, then she can have stress Thallium or CT (computed tomography) coronary angiography. These are not absolutely necessary but helps to detect underlying minor disease if it is there. Next, if Nebicard (Nebivolol) is given just for blood pressure, then the reading you have mentioned is low and needs dose reduction. You buy electronic BP (blood pressure) apparatus and monitor BP frequently at home. Next, regarding Caat (Atorvastatin), you can reduce the dose to 10 mg once a day bedtime if cholesterol is well controlled. It is better to continue it as it has multiple beneficial effects other than just cholesterol control. Matilda forte (folic acid, Vitamin B6, Mecobalamin) is a multivitamin and frequently given if neuropathy is there like tingling, numbness sensation, etc. Is she diabetic?

Our doctor prescribed a course of antibiotics and it is finished. The problem is still the same. Our house is located just beside a busy and dusty road. Please help and give your valuable suggestion.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concerns. From what you mentioned, most likely your nephew has sleep terror disorder in which he experiences attacks of racing heart eats, rapid breathing, and may be sweating. It is important that he has no memory of it and he is difficult to be awakened during the attack. Generally, treatment is behavior change like continuous reassurance and avoiding any family disputes in front of him and not to watch TV late in the night. In severe cases, some medications may be required. It is important to exclude any associated medical problem. Is he epileptic? Asthmatic? I recommend that you follow up in order to exclude serious conditions and to confirm the diagnosis. Wish him all well-being.

I take a lot of fruits, tea, and fiber supplements. What can I do?","Doctor":"Hi. At your age, chronic constipation should be thoroughly investigated. Are there any other symptoms like blood in stool, weight loss, or occasional diarrhea alternating with constipation or loss of appetite? I would advise you to get a colonoscopy done as this has become chronic. If there is an underlying factor causing constipation, Laxatives will only provide temporary relief and will not solve it.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My wife lost a piece of a filling and the dentist says he needs to take out the remaining filling, and then re-fill it. But in order to do that, he needs to pull the adjacent tooth. Could you please tell me if my wife really needs to have this tooth pulled? I will send you a picture.","Doctor":"Hello. How are you doing? First of all, there is nothing to worry. I have seen the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The tooth that the dentist is mentioning for removal is the upper wisdom tooth. It has not erupted completely. The age for its eruption ranges between 18-25 years. Mostly, in such cases or after this age, we recommend for its removal because, in the future, this might cause an infection, cheek bite, or other problems. I can guide you more about this if you can provide me with an X-ray (OPG or IOPA. OPG will be better). Now, regarding the filling, I think it must be towards that wisdom tooth side and that is why the doctor is asking for its removal so that he can properly contour and fill the tooth. Otherwise, it will be difficult (I cannot visualize much of the broken filling in the image). I will need an image from occlusal (chewing surface) aspect. Again, I need an X-ray of that tooth for a proper diagnosis. You do not have to worry. The tooth removal will be done under local anesthesia only. She will be fine. You can revert back with image and X-ray for further information. Feel free to ask further queries. Take care.

My question is, can I be pregnant? If not, why am I having all the pregnancy symptoms like headache, reflux, dizziness, and back pain?","Doctor":"Hello. According to your history, you are a 39 year old lady with a BMI of 28.4, having long cycles of 42 to 55 days. You had unprotected sex activity seven days back (do not know which day of the cycle you had activity) but on the 47th day of the cycle, you got spotting with dizziness, headache, and backache. You did a pregnancy test (do not know when, but it was negative). Regarding past medical/surgical/menstrual and drug history, you did not mention anything. My advice is to have blood pressure, pulse checked in a nearby health center with random blood sugar level and one serum beta hCG (pregnancy hormone). It will the clear situation. If spotting/bleeding continues even mildly, repeat beta hCG after 48 hours as well. If it is decreasing, it means pregnancy is subsiding. But if increasing, it means you have pregnancy (more than 60 % increase after 48 hours is in healthy pregnancy and less than 60 % means unhealthy or pregnancy outside uterus alarming). Transvaginal ultrasound also may help but need specialist hands. But first most important that your vital signs should be normal. In case of abnormal vitals, you need emergency detailed evaluation. If vitals are normal with no pregnancy you can be advised for day-2 menstrual cycle - I hope you understand my point. I will wait to hear from you. Best of luck.

So, please provide me with a clear photo and tell me if there is itchiness or redness. A local antifungal cream will be suitable after confirming the diagnosis.

So, I am wondering if this dilation is even necessary or just to leave it alone?","Doctor":"Hello. When were you diagnosed with stricture? Where were you treated at that time and what treatment was given? Yes, I also feel that you should repeat cystoscopy and get it dilated as it invariably recurs. So, better to undergo cystoscopy and get it dilated as without that it may recur with more narrowing. For more information consult a urologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 34 now. My school teacher pulled both my ears in my childhood and afterwards, I suffered a loss of balance sometimes. I have pain in both my ears and also blurring in both my eyes and fatigue. I think I have mild vertigo. Please suggest the best medicines to cure this mild vertigo. To elaborate, I have giddiness when at work and when watching TV as well. I had discharge from ears some years ago. I suffered a car accident some years ago.","Doctor":"Hello. Giddiness following pulling of the ear is uncommon. Are you sure you have giddiness from childhood after your teacher pulled your ears? You may probably be suffering from BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo). We need to get a Dix-Hallpike test done to confirm your diagnosis. If it shows positive you may need to undergo Epley maneuver. For now, I will suggest a few tablets so that you can get temporary relief from your problem. Tablet Emikind MD (Prochlorperazine) nine tablets, tablet Vertin (Betahistine) 8 mg nine tablets, Stugeron (Cinnarizine) 25 mg nine tablets. Take all these tablets three times a day for three days. Consult a specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. You had a history of discharge from the ear. So, we need to confirm that you do not have an unsafe type of ear perforation causing erosion of bone. I would suggest you consult your ENT surgeon for examination and diagnosis. You can let me know if you need anything to clarify what your ENT surgeon says. I will need these two things: Ask him to put a diagram of your tympanic membrane and write the test result. Also, any other positive findings. You can take a picture of it and send it to me.

Almost 24 hours later (on Wednesday) she had 103° temperature and the doctor at urgent care said she had trauma from the braces. I then met with the orthodontist and told her that the urgent care doctor said my daughter had trauma due to braces and that my daughter was in severe pain screaming and crying for the past 24 hours. She offered to only take the wires in the springs off but I said I wanted everything off including the brackets/windows. She said that removing the brackets would cause even more trauma. Is this true?","Doctor":"Hello. Braces for an 8 year old is quite rare. They are still in the development and eruption period. Removing the brackets will not cause further trauma. But it will be a total waste. Ortho treatment initially causes discomfort, but it will be alright in time. I suggest you to let the brackets be there and the tissue trauma caused by brackets can be avoided by keeping wax over the sharp points or edges of the brackets. You can ask your dentist for a wax sheet. Ask your kid to maintain oral hygiene with orthodontic brushes and gargling (lukewarm water and salt will be better) after every meal. If there is severe pain, you can go for Paracetamol, but with the doctor's consent. For ulcers, you can apply Dentogel topically just before a meal. I would like to know why this brackets treatment has been started.

Symptoms:  Dozing off (spacing out) without realizing, lasting two to five minutes when it first started. But now it lasts less than a minute. Staring. Uncontrollable head movement from side to side. Head tilting downward. Feeling numb. Blurry vision.  In some ways, I feel paralyzed as in if I want to speak there is a delay. Also, if I want to move there is a delay. I do not know when I go into these episodes but I sometimes know when I come out of it. No abnormality in blood tests, no abnormality in MRI. No abnormality in EEG testing as well. My neurologist determined based on my symptoms. I was prescribed Lamotrigine 100 mg daily increased to 200 mg. This did not help. So, I went on Carbamazepine 400 mg daily increased to 800 mg. This did not help either. So, is it actually a seizure or could it be something else? Do I need to continue trying different medications? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Based on the description of these episodes, I agree with your doctor that these episodes seem to be related to complex partial seizures. I would like to directly review your EEG (electroencephalogram) reports if you can upload it. A normal EEG is not surprising in complex partial seizures. On the other hand, you should know that if two anti-epilepsy drugs, in their optimal doses, fail to control seizures, the chances to have success with the third anti-epilepsy drug are lower. Anyway, considering a normal EEG and normal MRI findings, I would recommend discussing with your specialist on the possibility of performing a prolonged EEG or video EEG in the hospital (up to seven days) or an EEG with sleep deprivation, to have more information on the possible location of the seizures. In such a case, switching to another anti-epilepsy drug could be an option. Another option if there is a focus on EEG, would be discussing with a neurosurgeon on the possibility of a brain surgery, in order to have a better control on seizures (considering pharmacoresistant epilepsy).

Two years after that I got sick with IBS and loss of appetite. I got tested for HIV by ELISA, combo test, tri-dot, RNA PCR all from different labs. My wife also got HIV tests done. I am very depressed. My question is HIV is not showing in my blood. What do I do?","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, the tests which you had undergone for HIV diagnosis are highly sensitive and specific and gives accurate results. It is really good that your test result is negative, which had been done under varying time periods. The p24 combo is a highly sensitive and specific test and can detect both antigen and antibodies against HIV.  If you have had no further exposure other than the one you mentioned, you do not require any more tests for HIV. You are HIV negative.The test will be negative, as you are not infected with HIV. No other test is required. Relax. Hope your query is answered, but if you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask or call anytime. You can also book an appointment with me.

Now I am experiencing erectile dysfunction. Also, the stiffness of the penis is not the same as before (maybe because I am not getting aroused as easily as before) but after stroking, I feel the stiffness is fine. I have decided to quit porn and masturbation since yesterday. But still, I feel the same. I even tried to observe if the 'morning erection' is fine because of which I could not sleep properly. I was checking whenever I woke up in the middle of the night and I found that I was having no erection. I did have one while getting up and it was not the same as before (not as stiff as before). I am now scared. Do I have any disease? Will this thing get cured on its own? If yes, how long is it going to take? Please help. Edit: I am feeling a bit better now. The stiffness and the erection are back. The only problem I am facing now is a low sex drive. I think I am not getting aroused that easily. I am not having the mood. Is it because of the stress that I am going through or because of watching porn and masturbating all this while? Do I have erectile dysfunction or is it due to stress? I am scared.Please note, I have faced a similar issue before when I was taking anti-depressants.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern and the confusion in your mind. In the edit, you have mentioned that your erection is back and that is good to know and the current concern as you have mentioned is sex drive. My explanation to you is as follows: Watching porn and masturbation is done by more than 90 percent of the people of your age group and it is not an unhealthy behavior. So, do not worry or force yourself to quit masturbation as it is one way of letting out your inner sexual drive. If you keep watching porn in excess, the arousal for the same stimulus would reduce which is very likely in your case. So, watch porn whenever you are getting sexual thoughts and once you are done with masturbation, divert your mind to something else which is more useful for you. Once you limit yourself from watching porn at the right time and not in excess, it is more likely that you will be able to appreciate a satisfactory sex drive. Mood disorders and medication like antidepressants do affect sex drive in an individual. So, if you are facing any mood problems, then you should get evaluated for the same. Stress does affect sex drive and erection, but you have not elaborated on the stress you are undergoing. Lastly, since you have mentioned erection and stiffness are back and the concern is sex drive mainly, I would suggest you give a break to watching porn for a few days and check yourself for the sex drive in you. If sexual problems continue after following the above, you can revert with more details. Regards.

Part of my overbite has returned since I got my braces off due to tongue thrusting. Partly because I never wore my retainers as much as I should have. Can I get a permanent retainer at this point? Or is it too late?","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, you should wear your retainer regularly. Ideal position of teeth or occlusion which is obtained with the help of orthodontic treatment is maintained by regular use of orthodontic retainer. Use of orthodontic retainer is equally important and is part of orthodontic treatment. You can read about orthodontic retainer from icliniq articles. As per your description, you have tongue thrust, so it should be corrected otherwise it will be a cause of relapse after successful orthodontic treatment. You can read about tongue thrust from icliniq articles. As you have stated that your bite has relapsed, so if you use permanent retainer then it will retain faulty occlusion. This is what you can see about changes. But as the bite has relapsed, definitely there must have some other changes or movement of teeth happened (you have not uploaded any image of your concern area), that you cannot see but being expert in that field we can see. So for any kind of second opinion one has to check clinically or at least have an image of your concern area.

He has given a catheter, a container for collecting sperm and syringes to perform the self insemination.

What is the importance of adding ringer lactate? Is it mandatory to add this solution or can we do without the solution? Your inputs will help us to know the process in a better way.","Doctor":"Hello. Ringer lactate is not mandatory. Sometimes, it helps with the sperm speed, but you can do without it. Your erection problem may be due to stress or anxiety or due to any medicine or nutritional supplement if you are taking any. Penile Doppler often gives erroneous results.

I also had thyroid studies and blood work about two years ago and all were fine. I take Omeprazole twice daily and Linzess. I do miss a dose here and there and I am not regularly though. I have had some pain in the jaw around the area of lymph nodes. There is no apparent swelling. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Gastroesophageal reflux disease typically presents with heartburn and regurgitation. Extraesophageal symptoms include a sore throat, hoarse voice, feeling of food stuck in the throat, chest pain etc. Upon examination of the throat, the finding of swollen vocal cords raises suspicion of reflux laryngitis. This itself can cause pain below Adam's apple. The reflux is diagnosed by means of upper gastrointestinal scope and esophageal manometry. A 24-hour pH (potential of hydrogen) monitoring test is a criterion for a surgical intervention. An empiric therapy with proton pump inhibitor like Omeprazole is usually started for reflux. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines. For complete remission of the disease in six months, treatment is advised. Lifestyle modifications such as losing weight, avoiding alcohol, chocolate, citrus juice, tomato-based products, peppermint, coffee, onion, need to wait for three hours aftër a meal to lie down, elevating head on the bed by 8 inches also help.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm?

Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Your mother has COPD which is a chronic obstructive lung disease due to changes in the lung with age and due to smoking.

SSRI are prescription only drugs. So, you need a prescription for the same.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Trying to quit smoking is a very good idea and since you have only been smoking for a year, quitting now will be much easier than doing it any later. Nicotine gum and lozenges are both good replacements and have proven to be effective. Normally, side effects may occur some times such as: But if you keep to the recommended dose, you should get minimal side effects.

Do patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome get treated easily?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Hepatopulmonary syndrome is a syndrome of shortness of breath associated with hypoxemia (low oxygen levels in the blood of arteries). This is caused by vasodilation of blood vessels in the lungs in patients with liver disease. If liver transplant takes place, the survival rate for five years is 74 %.

Along with that, take tablet Raja pravartini vati two tablets two times a day with water after food for one month. Stop taking it when you get your periods. If you get periods within a month then it is fine, otherwise, I advise you to visit a nearby gynecologist. As far as weight is concerned, it can be due to your hormonal disturbance or you may have PCOS (polycystic ovaries syndrome). To rule this out, you have to perform some investigations.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

Left kidney 26 mm in lower pole with enlarged kidney stone 213 by 116 mm. Right kidney with 20 mm in mid pole with 118 by 56 mm size.  Taking medications:  For BP, Amlokind 5 mg from three years, Thyronorm 25 mcg (three years back), 50 mcg (last year) 75 mcg current dose).  Now, the TSH reading is 3.33 UIU/mL, and creatinine is 1.0 mds/dL. History: Gone through radiogram for kidneys. The urologist said that the left kidney enlargement is biological, suggested surgery, but with advice from elders at home, he went for ayurvedic medicines.  Stones daily 2+2 morning and evening. Gokhsaradi guggul 2+2 morning and evening. Chandraprabhavati 2+2 morning and evening. Gokharu Khada 15 ml + 15 ml morning and evening.  He used it for 12 months, but from six months due to the workload at the office, he could not follow the diet properly and medication was uneven and job was mostly sitting, so his weight has increased by 4 to 5 kg in six months. His physician and urologist are suggesting for the removal of stones through surgery. I would like him to avoid that. So, please advice the best prescription for dissolving of kidney stones naturally. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and saw the attached files (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The size of the ureter is around 4 to 5 mm and kidney stones are comparatively very large. Also, only some kind of stones can be dissolved with the help of medicine, not all types of stones. Which kind of stone it is, the doctor cannot tell it without examination. As your husband has other issues like hypertension, and you have tried Ayurvedic medicine in the past for long, even if you did not take it thoroughly. I recommended you to follow the advice of your physician for surgery. Because right now your husband's kidney function test is in the normal range. In case any damage occurs due to stone then kidney function can be disturbed. So it is better that you do not take any risk. If stones were smaller then it would be easier to remove them with medicine. I hope you understand my point.

The diagnosis was severe eccentric MR. However, during the latest TTE scan, the radiographer who did the scan said that my regurgitation was only moderate. I find this very confusing and was wondering if MVP is a reversible condition. No current medications.","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, the severity of MR (mitral regurgitation) will be correctly deciphered by your cardiologist. An eccentric type of MR is actually a grade higher than what it looks. Like your radiologist may think it is moderate but it is severe, but because of its eccentric nature, it looks lesser than what it is. The second thing is, why are you not on any medicine yet? You should be on ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and diuretics. If you have symptoms like breathlessness, these medicines will relieve that and prevent heart events too. If you have symptoms and your heart chamber size increases, then you should go for MVR (mitral valve replacement). If a prolapse is worsening, then it will not reverse.

He was with someone who now has heart palpitations, sweaty palms and feet, and lightheadedness sitting in the living room. We ran a battery of tests when it first happened including TSH, EKG, lung scans, blood panels, etc. and everything was normal. So we went down the path of anxiety. Four years later, the symptoms continued. As my son now has a terrible fear of doctors, we tried a home blood test to get a full thyroid panel. I have attached the results. The blood work came back normal. Low normal TSH, but low normal T4 and lower normal free T4 and free T3. There is nothing that shows an abnormality. However, his urine test showed moderately low iodine and slightly low selenium. I have read that abnormalities in these measures could cause thyroid problems. What am I wondering is if these two indicators are worth further exploration with an endocrinologist knowing that going to the doctor will cause my son a severe panic. Also, is it possible that low iodine could have been a temporary diet thing and it is masking the signs of hyperthyroidism in the blood work? He has all of the symptoms of someone with hyperthyroidism. On a side note, I am hypothyroid, my sister is hypothyroid and my two nieces had Hashimoto's with my younger niece having thyroid cancer and got her thyroid removed at age of 22. So everyone on my side of the family has thyroid issues. We were wondering if you could please give us some guidance. Looking to see if we need to eliminate thyroid as a possible cause of his symptoms or if it is worth further pursuit.","Doctor":"Hello. Based on the details and the labs attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it seems very unlikely that the symptoms are coming from a thyroid issue. Urine iodine is really not helpful clinically in this case. Given the family history, I would ask you to monitor TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) once a year but that does not explain the severity of the symptoms at all.

Basically, I desire to have a mental illness, I have been even faking certain symptoms. To be exact, I do actually have mental health problems, I am diagnosed with Asperger’s, bipolar disorder and OCD. However, I have a feeling I am not ill enough and I want to be much sicker than I am right now. I know that is not normal and I am incredibly ashamed of it. Right now I am in remission of BAP and I should be glad for that, but instead of it, I am desperate and unhappy. The only thing I want is a relapse and it is not just a wish, I am doing something for it. I go to sleep at different times every day to destroy my sleeping rhythm and I do not take my meds (Valproate for BPD) regularly. I always skip them on purpose in such a way that nobody can notice, I am afraid to stop taking them at all because of the potential reaction of my parents. Then there are things which I just pretend to look sick, for example, I tell people that I have bad dreams and sleep paralyzes frequently, while I almost do not. When I was hospitalized with mixed mania and then with depression this year, I felt a strong need to be the sickest person in the psych ward or at least look like that. I made certain symptoms like hallucinations up. I also exaggerated everything. I had severe insomnia but I always purposely slept even less, I had meltdowns but some of them I triggered purposely or I just made them up. I self-harmed to look ill, not because of an inner need. I do not even know how sick I really was and what I just faked. I have heard about the factitious disorder and I wonder if I have it or not. I am not sure because I have a feeling it does not fit perfectly with me. Is a strong desire of having an illness a part of that disorder? Please, if you have an idea what is wrong with me, tell me. I am disgusted by myself, I want to stop this desire, faking and lying but it is just impossible. I am afraid to tell my real-life psychiatrist because he would not ever believe me on any real symptom then. I am also too ashamed to tell anyone I know. I am sorry this message is too long.","Doctor":"Hello. It is good that you are aware and trying to take the help of a psychiatrist. You are suffering from borderline personality disorder. You like to take attention from people. You want to be pampered by your family and that is why you are looking for such an illness or faking illnesses. It is your personality which makes you fake risky diseases out of anger or an emotionally unstable situation. So, no one can help you until you want to take help for yourself.

The symptoms of photophobia and blurry vision points out to the following possibilities:  Given that there is a history of congenital impairment of vision in one eye, this tips the diagnosis towards glaucoma or corneal dystrophy.

The result of which is non-reactive and the value is 0.062. Again, now I repeated the test and it showed result as non-reactive with the value of 0.104. The two reports have been attached here. Regarding symptoms, I did not develop any fever or allergy in the last four months. Is ELISA test reliable? Is there any need for me to take any other test or repeat the test? Can I stop worrying as I have already covered window period? Why did the test show some value like 0.6 and 0.104? Does it indicate the presence of any disease? What is the window period? Please help me in detail as I am much worried.","Doctor":"Hi. Let me answer one by one.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

This condition is called a silent reflux.  Because of this silent reflux, the esophagus undergoes spasm as soon as you eat any solid foods.This condition is called as a nutcracker esophagus. You need to consult a gastroenterologist and undergo a test called \\"24-hour pH (potential of hydrogen) monitoring in the esophagus\\" and an esophageal manometry. This will tell you the severity and extent of the damage to the esophagus physiologically that is if there is any functional derangement.

Are there any medications that can help me correct my lab values?","Doctor":"Hello. Turbidity due to proteins, lipids and cellular matter is a potential problem with spectrophotometric estimation of any blood constituent including hemoglobin. The large dilution (1:251) of sample largely eliminates the problem, but falsely raised ctHb (concentration of total hemoglobin) results can occur in patients whose plasma protein concentration is particularly high. Heavy lipemic samples and those containing very high numbers of white cells (leucocytes) can also artefactually raise ctHb by a similar mechanism. Regards.

But, this should be in addition to the food and it is not a substitute for food. Make him eat fruits like papaya, banana and make him drink loads of water which will relieve him from constipation.

As there is no motivation, emotional numbing and loss of interest in all things with a decreased energy, I feel the second option is more suitable for you. The dose is often started at 150 mg per day to be taken in morning and increased to 300 mg after four to seven days of initial treatment.

This is the tooth all the way in the back of a 6-year-old's mouth that has not fallen out yet. So, do children lose all their teeth and is there any teeth that remain from the first like a growing 6-year-old?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Children have 20 milk teeth (10 each in upper and lower jaws) which shed till the age of maximum 10 to 12 years. The permanent teeth erupt in their places and the three permanent molars erupt behind the primary teeth. According to the age, I think you are talking about the permanent first molar that erupts at 6 years of age and hence, it is advisable to go for filling as it will not shed. The permanent molars do not have any milk tooth predecessors and hence you may get confused with the milk teeth. It is better to get any cavity in the tooth filled in the initial stages itself unless it is very mobile (pre-shedding mobility). You can send me a picture of the tooth to guide you further.

I have already started my first week of POPs. So, how will they be affected? Will they still work? Should I use a backup method for a few weeks?","Doctor":"Hello.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

She had six seizures last week and was admitted to a ward. She was discharged later, only being told she had new cavernomas and the old ones had grown. She never saw a neurologist during her time there. However, today I have been informed she has one cavernoma in her right temporal region which has grown and there is one new one in her pons. I am very concerned about this as we have been offered no advice or anything about the dangers of this and only told we can ask questions when we get an outpatient's appointment which will probably be in a month's time. We are both very scared and concerned about for the prognosis. Can anyone help and give us some advice about cavernomas in the pons and the severity of this, it would be greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello. Regarding the cavernoma in her pons, it may lead to a low risk of bleeding. It does not cause seizures. The treatment with embolization could be a possible treatment option, but with a high risk because this is a life-threatening region of the brain. Regarding the temporal cavernoma, it is related to seizures. It can also lead to hemorrhage in this region. It can be treated with open surgery or endovascular embolization. Brain angiography is necessary to examine the anatomical features of the cavernoma before discussing treatment options. I recommend consulting with a neurosurgeon about these issues.

However, severe pain still persists, no improvement from the pain felt two weeks post-injury. Does this indicate it is not healing?","Doctor":"Hello. The pain indicates that you might give some more time for it to heal properly. Do not be in a hurry to start up your exercises. Partial PCL (posterior cruciate ligament) tear recovers well with exercises. So, you do not worry. Keep working towards pain reduction first before starting off any exercise routine. Work for range of movement in your knee. Once you attain pain-free movement with complete or at least considerable pain-free range, you can start off next level of rehabilitation. Till then, work on the recruitment of muscles and maintain whatever you have. Hope this is helpful for you.

On the seventh day, I again having my period. And now my legs are tired. I do not know why is this. The doctor please help me. Will I become pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello. Emergency contraceptive pills are hormones and have their side effects as well. One of most common is irregular bleeding. Everyone's body responds differently to hormones, but major effects are the same. Have you any bleeding disorder? Have you been treated for any chronic disease or have been using any medications that can have affect menstrual bleeding? Heavy bleeding causes weakness, anemia, dizziness, and even fainting. So, it is better to have your vitals checked (BP, pulse, respiratory rate). If the pregnancy test is negative and ultrasound normal (no signs of pregnancy), I suggest taking tablet Transamine (Tranexamic acid) 500 mg eight hourly for three to five days to reduce it. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. If the cycle remains irregular, do a hormonal profile test on day-2(serum testosterone, serum prolactin, serum insulin, serum LH/FSH, thyroid function test) to be reviewed by your gynecologist.

Unilateral vestibular hypofunction caused may be due to vestibular neuritis. I have attached the test results for your review. I also have mild cervical spondylosis but the pain is almost gone but there is some stiffness in the neck and occipital muscles.  Do you think this is neuritis or Meniere's disease - not sure what the difference is - I have a constant sense of imbalance. The doctor suggested a Gabapentin medicine. Is this considered a vestibular suppressant and should I take it? What are vestibular migraines and do you think I have this situation?","Doctor":"Hello. Your unilateral vestibular imbalance could be because of some previous attack of vestibular neuritis which has left back its impressions. I am saying this because at present you do not have any fever, nausea, or vomiting nor any ringing sounds in your ear. Yours is just a vestibular imbalance added on with some cervical spondylitis issues. Your condition cannot be called Meniere's as your symptoms do not fit into it. Gabapentin is a kind of antiepileptic drug which can act on subtle unusual presentations of fits or sometimes even unusual migraine. The doctor must have prescribed it to rule out such situations by a trial course of medication. I suggest you try it for a week and look at the response. If your giddiness is not responding, stop using that drug. But my advice would be to avoid any drug. Keep doing your physiotherapy to your neck as well as vestibular rehabilitation exercises. Maintain good postures during work. Allow your body to compensate and adjust itself. Be patient and believe me they would definitely help.

Are the alternatives as healthy as we are led to believe? What about the option of just giving up milk and not trying to replace it with anything, is that a good idea? Do you have advice on choosing the best milk alternative?","Doctor":"Hello. The idea of quitting dairy is quite controversial. There is a lot of debate on this topic. If you are giving up milk products, you might have to replace it with some other form of protein like sprouts, nuts, etc. The alternatives to milk these days are soy milk, almond milk, oat milk, coconut milk and rice milk. While these are easily available in supermarkets, it is very important to 'read the labels' of any food item you buy. This rule applies to these alternatives for milk too. I personally have read labels on packs of almond milk, soy milk, etc., and found a lot of chemical additives in it. Follow a basic rule - if you do not understand an ingredient or if it sounds like a chemical name, it probably is not good for you. You may be better off drinking real milk than these alternatives that are loaded with chemicals. If you buy milk, try to buy organic milk which is free of antibiotics or hormones. If you really want to give up milk and move to other alternatives of milk, then it is a good idea to make it in your kitchen. Almond milk, coconut milk, and oats milk can easily be made at home. You can check online video resources for this. I hope that helps.

Generally, they did work over the years until the last two years or so outcomes have been very poor. The last Botox shots by GA (six units left side) were a month back and again not successful, leaving me with little or no phonation. Botox is the only treatment offered in my area. Over the years I have tried every possible cure like prolonged speech therapy, laryngeal massage, vocal exercises, transdermal microphone, hypnosis, occupational therapy, and psychotherapy. Nothing proved to be a success. Surgery is the only option at this stage. I have had discussions with various ENT doctors who say they can see the problem very clearly but it will be very difficult to resolve. Two of the consultants strongly suggest thyroplasty type 3. Another suggested arytenoid adduction or coagulation of the PCA muscle by radio frequency. I am asking you for independent advice as to which surgery is best to restore my voice at even a relatively acceptable level. I understand thyroplasty type 3 and arytenoid adduction but should I choose thyroplasty 3 over coagulation of PCA muscle by radio frequency? I look forward to hearing from you. I have got videostroboscopy done.","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, you have to know that among spasmodic dysphonias, abductor variety is the least common type. In this, your vocal cord is away from the other vocal cord and the muscle is in unrestricted contraction resulting in voiceless or breathy voice. So, the treatment is mainly directed to reduce the contractions or spasms of posterior cricoarytenoid muscle (PCA). This can be achieved by mainly two treatments. One is Botox injection and the other is surgical which is mainly nerve ablation. The main treatment is Botox. Each Botox lasts for approximately six to eight weeks. Last failed botox may be due to fibrosis of muscle due to repeated injections. You can once again repeat the injection. That may be the best option. Surgery in abductor spasm is rarely done and not in literature. Avoid surgery.  The next thing you can do is voice therapy. All cases of abductor spasm may have nasal flaring. You can sit in front of the mirror, start with vowels and sentences and try to reduce nasal flaring by looking into mirror. By reducing nasal flare, your voice will gradually increase.

I am facing a difficulty in walking. I have done an MRI of the spine. Please provide with appropriate medicines for my pain. Kindly advise on the report and let me know if this is sciatica and what will be the treatment for the same? I will go for MRI with contrast in the coming week. Till that time, kindly advise on some medication. Currently, I am on Zerodol MR.","Doctor":"Hello. You have mentioned a pain in the left leg along with weakness, tingling, and numbness. First of all, can you tell me the duration of your symptoms? Is there any associated back pain as well? If your leg pain more or your back pain? How much distance can you walk on a daily basis and do you need analgesic (Zerodol- Aceclofenac) on a daily basis? Also, I have seen your MRI scan (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and although it is not very clear, it definitely shows a spinal cord lesion at D9 level extending one level up and one level down, which can explain your current symptoms of compressive cord disease. I would definitely advise contrast MRI of dorso lumbar spine and an urgent neurosurgical consultation as it may require a surgical intervention depending upon your clinical examination results and contrast MRI findings. Till that time take tablet Zerodol (Aceclofenac) on SOS basis along with tablet Pregabalin or Gabapentin but kindly consult an appropriate neurosurgeon on an urgent basis. Kindly let me know if you require any further information or SOS.

The miscarriage was mostly due to low FHR as evident in the report (bradycardia at 6W3D). I had spotting around 10th week and doctor reported it as a missed abortion. I also had high TSH around 6.7 and was on 25 mg Thyronorm every day. Please let me know your detailed view based on the molecular karyotyping report.  It has been around two weeks since the procedure. I am feeling better; however, do not feel completely normal or energetic yet. I get exhausted after few hours of going out (without any strenuous activity). Initially, had pain in the waist and abdomen. Now I feel like my waist is still fragile and not sure if I should start normal exercises or still be cautious. I am not working currently for some time and taking adequate rest. Given my age, TSH count (was almost 6.7 TSH last month) and other reports need your complete guidance on how to proceed further. I take 50 mg of Thyronorm every morning on empty stomach and 1 folic acid 5 mg (Folivate) late evening after dinner. The course of medicines after the miscarriage has been completed (five days course). Bleeding is almost negligible these days. My Vitamin D levels are low so should I again continue with Uprise tablet once every week along with Becosule tablet? I have migraine issue for the past three to four years. It is more in control since last two years; however, I still need to take 1 Naxdom 500 (once every three to four days average) which is an emergency painkiller. In terms of general health, normally I tend to get exhausted or tired or fatigued or sleepy very soon. All this combined with the tendency to get highly stressed out frequently. The conditions demand some kind of special medications for sure I feel for my future normal pregnancy. Please note that my AMH was pretty low as well a few months back when I got tests done. Are there good books or online websites you can suggest that also act as a guide for me, please? Please suggest me all the possible tests I should get done at this stage to be absolutely sure of any complications that we should be aware of. Given my age and general health, I want to take all possible measures.  The laboratory tests performed are molecular karyotyping, general blood, thyroid, pregnancy tests, AMH, Vitamin D.","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? I am very sorry for your loss and do understand the mental stress which you are presently suffering. But let me start on a positive note that you are fine and will surely have a healthy pregnancy. Do not worry about your age and do not feel you are aged, up to 35 years you have a very bright chance of pregnancy. Many get married at this age.

Then after three months, I got my HIV test done and the test was negative. Then again I got the HIV test after six months, the test was negative. Then after eight months, I got my HIV test done again, the test result was negative. I did Elisa test, tri-dot test, Elfa test, finally western blot test. All test results were negative. I am getting some symptoms like body pain, body tiredness, bitter mouth, sore throat, tightness in neck. So, I am fully scared. My question is that are these symptoms related to HIV or again I have to take another HIV test? Recently I did a WBC count test and it is 12000. I have got Vitamin D test results as 16.6 ng/ml. Is Vitamin D deficiency related to my symptoms? I got Vitamin B12 test results as 188 pg/ml. Is this related to the beginning of HIV infection? I am totally confused.Please answer my questions.","Doctor":"Hello. So whatever symptoms are there, it is due to vitamin deficiency. All tests are negative so it is clear that there is no HIV infection. So do not worry. You can consult a general physician.

What does this mean?","Doctor":"Hi. If there is mention of a defect then it is a hernia in the platysma which is a thin muscle in the neck area. Such a hernia can allow fat to pass through it to give the appearance of a mass in the area. It is therefore commented that a hernia may cause protrusion of fat below the skin to appear like a mass in the absence of a true mass in the area.

Does it have anything to do with his eating habits or what he ate in the morning? He ate eggless chocolate cake in the morning.","Doctor":"Hello. Do not go by the color of the urine. Always focus on the symptoms.  Is there any burning sensation while passing urine? Or, increase in the frequency of urine or any lumbar area pain? If yes, then you must go for urine culture. There might be a relationship of food with the color of urine if it happens once or twice, but if the color of the urine is persistently hazy, then go for labs.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Can you please provide me a solution for this?","Doctor":"Hello. Phimosis means tight foreskin. In this condition, the foreskin may not be moving freely. There are two ways to treat it, one is medical and other is surgical. I will suggest the medical treatment. I suggest you pull down the foreskin as much as possible and apply Betamethasone cream on the inner side of foreskin where it is tightly attached. Do it three times daily for the next two to three months. Betamethasone will help loosen the skin. Also, do daily stretching exercises of the foreskin, that is stretch forward the foreskin for 30 seconds and then stretch downward for 30 seconds. Do it daily for five minutes.

I have gone through your query with diligence and would like you to know that I am here to help you. Regarding your question, is there really a need for her to be on the medication anymore as it is ruining her life, we need to do MRI Brain (plain and contrast) with MRA, MRV, MRS and whole spine screening and EEG.

So, while sleeping and otherwise, maintain good posture. Symptoms are due to upper neck structures involvement. If it bothers you too much, go for a couple of chiropractic mobilization.

I wanted to understand what is happening to me before I go to a dentist.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the image (attachment removed to protect patient identity). These are the wisdom teeth and they have stains mostly because of smoking. There is no evidence of clinical cavity as for now, but can be confirmed after stain removal (scaling) and a clinical examination. The gums are swollen because of improper oral hygiene in that area (as the toothbrush cannot reach and clean properly there), food debris accumulation, and the traumatic bite, all causing inflammation of gums (gingivitis). For now, I suggest you do lukewarm water with salt gargling to reduce the inflammation in gums. If severe pain is there, then take a Paracetamol and do not chew anything hard on these surfaces. If the pain increases on chewing, the dentist can reduce the high points or the sharp points in the tooth surfaces in that area to give temporary relief. But, since you said it is occurring often, the permanent treatment is to get it removed (extracted) as this tooth is not much useful in chewing and in turn causes problems only. It is not an emergency. You can contact your dentist and plan it accordingly. And get a professional cleaning (scaling) once, to remove the stains and deposits and make your gums healthy and the teeth more esthetic. Take care.

Losing 50 to 100 hairs per day is considered normal. Old hairs are replaced by new hairs. If you are losing hairs on the front of the scalp and sides, leading to the receding of the hairline, then it is worrisome. It is called androgenetic alopecia. If it is so, please attach your clinical picture along with your query so that it is convenient for me to comment on your condition and give you appropriate suggestions.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My throat is showing white rashes all over. I do not know what that is. Now, I have fever and throat pain also.

Your symptoms are fever, throat pain, and ear blockage. Your clinical findings according to you are white rashes all over the throat. The two most probable causes in your case seem to be: I suggest: Other possible causes include: You may continue with the prescribed antibiotics. Additionally, Paracetamol for fever/pain and warm saline gargle may help. Also, your ear blockage suggests you are having nose blockage/discharge too which is causing your eustachian tube to get blocked. So a Xylometazoline nasal drop in both your nostrils may help.

I can see that there is fullness on the right side of the neck in the picture. In the CT scan images (attachment removed to protect patient identity) I find there are few lymph nodes on the sides of your neck but probably because of the small size, your report does not mention it. The fullness is likely due to the lymph nodes in my opinion. There are subcentimeter nodules in the left lobe of thyroid.

The result came GABA 1.04, serotonin 54.36, and glutamate 10.34 which is low. What kind of treatment does he need? Will vitamins be sufficient? Does he need medication? Where can I get help for him? What kind of doctor will treat this? He was diagnosed with ADHD by a doctor, but others said he does not have it.","Doctor":"Hello. These findings indicate low neurotransmitters (serotonin, GABA) which may be responsible for his problems. These findings could also indicate anxiety or depression. I suggest doing complete blood count and checking thyroid hormone levels. Considering his young age, I would first recommend taking a multivitamin supplement daily and performing a lot of physical activity (aerobics, recreational sports, running, etc.). Consulting with a psychotherapist can help too. If these tips do not improve his situation, I would recommend consulting with a psychiatrist. An antidepressant may be needed. Hope to have been helpful. For more information consult a neurologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am a female and my age is 25 years. My body is white but face dark black. I have used many creams and lotions but there is no change. So, I want a solution for this.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See if your face color is darker than your body color then it can be due to excessive exposure to the sun. But, if it is your natural color then it cannot be lightened through creams, etc. To get rid of sunburn apply sunscreen lotion half an hour before going outside. Apply sunscreen even on cloudy day. Apply aloe vera gel on your skin two times a day. Use oatmeal scrub two to three times a week. You can use any other scrub too if you want to. Drink plenty of water daily. Take more of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet. These all things will help you a lot. But if you have some sort of skin problem then I advise you to visit a nearby dermatologist first. I hope you understand my point. We will have a follow up after three weeks.

Inferior turbinate hypertrophy visualized on both sides. Mild middle turbinate hypertrophy visualized on both sides. Mild bilateral ethmoid and maxillary sinusitis. Small mucous retention polyp visualized in the bilateral maxillary sinus.  I have rebound congestion in my left nostril. I do not understand my report. Please say a note about this. I am currently on antihistamines and nasal spray (stopped due to rebound congestion) using steam. The left nostril is blocked.","Doctor":"Hi. Let me help you understand your report point by point. The CT (computed tomography) scan findings suggest you have a deviated nasal septum (which may be causing the nose block) and mild sinus infection. Nasal drops like Xylometazoline should not be used continuously for more than seven days as it causes rebound congestion. We substitute that with normal saline nasal drops that can be used over a long time. Antihistaminics and steam do help. If optimum medical treatment fails to relieve symptoms, patients are advised surgery (called septoplasty) involving straightening the midline partition. Your ENT specialist can help you in making an informed decision regarding the same.

GERD and H.pylori are possible suspects. Can you tell me tests to confirm or reject these possibilities? Can you tell me the possible treatments if tests are not strictly necessary? Would there be any other possibilities?","Doctor":"Hi. Gas in the abdomen is due to food and lifestyle. GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and H.pylori can be diagnosed by upper GI (gastrointestinal) endoscopy and biopsy. Need detail histroy to look for the exact symptoms and need clinical examinations also. Sometime gas may be due to intestinal bacterial overgrowth which can be diagnosed by lactulose breath test. Try to identify the food like milk which triggers the symptoms.

There are certain times, especially when I am eating when I have a runny nose, and this is when I find that it is much easier to speak freely and maintain a consistent voice. If I take medications to thin the mucus in my throat, it makes it even more difficult to speak. But, when I suck on hard candy, it is easier to speak. I can still talk but it is very uncomfortable because I cannot speak with the inflections that I want or the tone of voice that I want because I cannot control my voice. An ENT did a laryngoscopy and did not find anything.","Doctor":"Hello. As you have mentioned, your primary complaint is excessive mucus in the throat leading to you having trouble pronouncing words. Your voice gets better when you are eating, or have a runny nose, or on sucking a hard candy. All these things have one thing in common that they dilute the mucus ( eating, sucking a candy cause increased salivation, thereby diluting the mucus). That means you have a thick, sticky mucus interfering with your speech, which may be due to sinusitis, chronic pharyngitis, gastro-esophageal reflux disease or environmental factors like cigarette smoke or dust. If you have a tendency to frequently clear your throat, that may be a sign of chronic sinusitis. You may need to get a nasal endoscopy done. A clinical examination of the posterior wall of the pharynx may reveal mucosal changes, suggesting a diagnosis of chronic pharyngitis (due to any cause).  The treatment will depend upon the cause. For example, chronic rhinosinusitis is treated with antibiotics, antihistaminics (like Cetirizine), nasal sprays, etc. Chronic pharyngitis is treated with (sometimes) antibiotics, throat gargles, antihistaminics, etc. A course of PPI (proton pump inhibitors) like pantoprazole is required to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease. Whatever may be the cause, important is to stay hydrated by drinking lots of water and avoiding dust or cigarette smoke, etc. For more information consult an ENT otolaryngologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am a 61-year-old with breast cancer metastasizing to the liver, nodes, and bones. I am currently on Abraxane and Herceptin. I was diagnosed 19 years back and had 15 years of no cancer. Metastasis to a few nodes was noted four years back. I have been on Taxol, Taxatore and now Abraxane. I morphed into triple positive a year ago. I know my chance of getting brain metastasis is high. A few days back at work I noticed the left side of my chin was numb. I looked it up and read horrible information that it is from the mandible or cerebellum. And the outlook was ominous. I am so frightened. My question is how serious is numbness in this condition? I can feel pain when I pinch and poke at my chin. It does not feel like when I get Novacane at the dentist. I do get Xgeva every three months, have bad sinus and vertigo problems (just recently) and am depressed and have horrible anxiety which I try to control with Xanax. I will see my oncologist in a few days for treatment. I just need some reassurance, I guess. I have no pain from any of my metastasis. Just side effects from chemotherapy. I had laboratory tests done weeks ago. I am anemic due to chemotherapy. My liver panel is normal. I am currently taking Lotrel and Zoloft.","Doctor":"Hello. You have been living with this cancer for a long time and have a lot of information about it. This numbness on your chin can be a side effect of your chemotherapy but without MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain very difficult to say you do not have any brain metastasis. But be assured cerebellar metastasis usually have the problem of maintaining of balance rather than just sensory disturbance. You are getting best treatment trust in your creator and be bold. If you have done any radiology to rule out any brain metastasis. And if done and is negative then relax and pray and hope for a long life.

I hope there is no chance of any birth defect in my baby. My NIPT (noninvasive prenatal testing) test was normal. Also, my level 1 and level 2 scans were normal. Please check my report. Also, there is some problem with the artery.","Doctor":"Hello. At this stage, we do not look for anomalies. If NIPT is normal, then you can be 99 percent sure that there is no anomaly. Also, the level 1 and 3 scans have been normal which is reassuring. The liquor is fine and nothing to panic about (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The uterine artery shows a change in blood flow which may cause growth restriction in the coming weeks for the baby and also may indicate a high maternal blood pressure. For now, the baby is fine. Monitor your blood pressure daily and also check your blood sugars every fortnight. Go for the scan every 15 days or four weeks as suggested by the doctor to check growth and doppler. Better to take steroid injection at 30 weeks or so for respiratory lung maturity of the baby. An anticipation of a preterm delivery can be made and kept in mind. Plan a delivery in a set up with good ICU (intensive care unit) care. Keep a daily fetal movement count strictly. Report to the doctor immediately if you have vomit, headache, reduced movements of baby and high BP.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I had gone through all the details posted. Kindly answer some questions. Based on your symptoms the possibilities are I would have been able to further narrow down the differential if I had seen the photos. Do not burst those blisters with anything, apply Betadine ointment (Povidone-iodine) over the burst ones and you can start tablet Clindatec 300 mg (Clindamycin) twice daily in the morning and night for seven days antibiotic to prevent infection.

Could you please see if the report is fine? Will I require a vaccination dose for the same (I had the vaccination in childhood)? Is it harmful to have the vaccination more than once? I had a rheumatic heart surgery four years ago (aortic valve replacement). Currently, I am on Betaloc 12.5 mg, Ecosprin 75 mg, and Warfarin 5 mg.","Doctor":"Hi. I have checked the attached reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The results for measles and mumps show high antibodies which mean immunity is either due to past infection or vaccination.  As for rubella, the level of antibodies is low which means that you are prone to rubella infection. Rubella vaccine dose is required. There is no harm if you repeat the vaccine.

But today I noticed a small light brown spot on my panties and I heard it was a pregnancy sign. I am really worried. I have been on placebo pills for two days now.","Doctor":"Hello. If you have been on oral contraceptive pills since last two months, regularly and have continued the same during this present cycle as well, then there are no chances of pregnancy as ovulation would not have occurred during this cycle in view of pill intake. Now that you have been on your placebo pills already, so the blood stain that you noticed is likely start of your withdrawal bleed for this cycle and no sign of pregnancy. However, if you wish to be doubly sure then you may get a serum beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) test done which is a blood test. If the hCG levels are less than 3 mIU then you are surely not pregnant and the blood is your withdrawal bleed.

I was staying in a hotel and masturbated in the bathroom (in my room). I fear that I could have obtained HIV, if some semen or blood of the previous visitor had been on the facilities (or on the soap, which was dry and in a box and was not exposed to fresh air or light) and then came in contact with my penis (or some small wounds on penis or hands, if there were some, I do not remember their presence though). Can you look at it seriously and answer (with explanation), what is the probability for me to have obtained HIV? Even small real probability frightens me. I am a virgin.","Doctor":"Hi. There is absolutely no chance of acquiring HIV this way. HIV is only transmitted through unprotected sex e.g., either vaginal, anal or oral sex. Firstly, the virus does not survive outside the body for more than a few seconds and dies quickly in drying. Secondly, intact skin does not provide access to the bloodstream. However, even if we assume that you had a break in your skin barrier at that time, then also a paper thin cut or a scratch that is not even bleeding does not provide access to the bloodstream. There has to be a fresh actively bleeding deep cut for the virus to gain access to the bloodstream. In my view, you have no risk of HIV, whatsoever.

It is something that always present in the back wall of the throat. But there is no pain but sometimes it feels in the upper esophagus, other time it feels on the back wall of the throat. My ENT doctor examined my throat and suggested me that there is no lump or anything stuck in the throat but said some redness and many little bumps on the back wall and said pharyngitis. I have done the blood test and CT of the pharynx. There was no abnormality. I was prescribed Amoxicillin and anti-fungal and antihistamine (Levocetirizine and Montelukast tablets) for 15 days. But the hidden problem persists. Most annoying is that I feel some difficulty in the throat but cannot figure it out as there is no pain and also cannot figure the exact location of the problem. As a whole, the problem is on the back wall of the throat. Please suggest me some other test that might be required and some medication to reduce this problem.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your history and all the blood reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and they are all normal. Your CT (computed tomography) scan basically rules out any mass lesion in your neck or throat. The problem you are suffering from is known as globus pharyngeus which means the sensation of a lump in the throat or foreign body sensation in the throat. Most common cause for such a problem is reflux laryngopharyngitis which is a type of acidity related disorder. In this condition your gastric acid refluxes back inside your throat causing swelling, dryness, postnasal discharge (this causes a sensation of something in the back of your throat), redness, reddish lesions in the pharynx (which is known as granular pharyngitis) and feeling of lump down the throat while swallowing.   Causes for such condition includes untimely food habits, stress, sleeplessness, and sometimes no cause can be identified. Taking any other medicines other than anti-reflux medications will increase your symptoms. You need to take anti-reflux medications for a minimum of three weeks to three months. Recovery is usually slow and three weeks are usually necessary to observe any significant improvement. You also need to avoid spicy food, tea, chocolate, eat regularly at fixed timings, avoid salt water gargling. Take tablet Nexpro RD (Domperidone and Esomeprazole) 40 mg two times daily before food for three weeks. If you see a significant improvement you can even continue it for up to three months.

I completed the triple treatment (two antibiotics, Omeprazole) three weeks ago. The upper abdomen discomfort is gone. I still have mild intermittent nausea and loose stools and pretty consistent wet mouth (though still no drooling or spitting). Can this be GERD related? H. pylori possibly not eradicated? Or something entirely different such as C. diff, SIBO, etc? I have a follow up with my primary next week but cannot get in to see a GI for another month. Thank you in advance for any advice.","Doctor":"Hello. Nothing to worry. The loose stools may be secondary to antibiotics which you had. You can have some probiotics if it is persistent. Hope you have modified your diet and daily activities to reduce GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). Judicious use of Omeprazole or Rantac (Ranitidine) can help you in case of recurrent GERD.

On the 2nd, my girlfriend started her period. It is now the 16th. So, I believe she is in her ovulation phase. Since her period stopped, she has begun, for the very first time, taking the combined contraceptive pill consistently at 8 AM every morning. She took the pill yesterday morning. Last night, on the 15th of March, we had unprotected sex (we thought one night without condoms would be fine). However, this morning she was in a rush and forgot to take her pill for today. It is 2:16 PM now and I have a few urgent questions:  Should she take the morning after pill? How effective will the morning after pill be in protecting from pregnancy? How much will the pills previously taken lower the risk of pregnancy? Given her current stage of ovulation, what is the risk of her becoming pregnant? The period of time between the missed pill at 8 AM this morning and the time that she will take the morning-after pill (around 4 PM)? Do you recommend taking today’s pill today if she is also taking the morning after pill today? Is there anything else we can do now to minimize the risk? Should we be worried?  Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. A morning-after pill is different from the regular oral contraceptive pills. Do you mean to say the daily pill or an additional morning-after pill? I need clarity on this. If you mean the regular pill, do not use the phrase morning-after pill as that means an emergency pill used only once or twice depending on the dose.If you meant the regular pills which seems so from your history, she need not have to worry if the delay in taking the pill has not been more than 24 hours. It is fine to have taken it a few hours late as long as she has not skipped the pill that day. There is no need to take an additional pill if she has not missed the day's pill. If the pills were started a week before the intercourse and she has taken them daily and not missed a single pill, the effectiveness in preventing a pregnancy is about 99 percent.  Do remember that no contraceptive pill or method is hundred percent effective and failures can always happen. There is nothing to worry as of now and let her continue taking the pills as usual at the regular time. Hope I have answered your doubts.

I tried everything but nothing really worked. So, two months back, I finally decided to visit a dermatologist. The dermatologist prescribed me Isotretinoin capsules or Sotret of 20 mg. So, it was working quite well but I was having some breakouts. So, on my next follow up, she added 10 mg more. And today, after six weeks, I had another follow up. My previous doctor is on maternity leave. So, I had to meet another doctor. The new doctor decreased my dosage by 10 mg and now I am supposed to be taking 20 mg per day. The doctor I visited today suggested me to go through some acidic treatments like Salicylic acids. She said taking medicines will not get me the desired skin and I should be doing these acid treatments. So, what I want to know is: Is the acid treatment necessary? My acne is fading away but there are some new breakouts which I think is due to my own carelessness. I eat oily food, sleep very less and do not drink enough water.","Doctor":"Hi. Isotretinoin is a wonderful medicine for acne. The typical course of Isotretinoin ranges from three to four months, depending on the acne response to the medicine. The dose of Isotretinoin depends on your weight. Isotretinoin shrinks the oil-producing glands, and normalizes the lining of ducts. This is the best medicine for nodulocystic acne. Salicylic acid peel is helpful for comedonal (black and whiteheads) acne. It helps to exfoliate the skin. It removes the topmost dead layer of skin and helps to reduce comedones. The treatment regimen for acne depends on a lot of factors, each dermatologist will have their best protocol. I cannot really comment on this because I have not seen your acne pictures.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

In the winters, it is too dry and in the summer it is too oily.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand that there has been damage to the skin. White spots on the sides of the right sides are called miliaria crystallina. In simple terms, it is the enlargement and plugging of the sweat glands. You will need to go to a dermatologist to remove the plugs or blockage with a needle. Then it will be fine. It is a very small procedure and takes about 15 minutes for me and not painful also. Another issue is of the skin quality being different for different parts of the face. Trust me, 90 % people have this problem and you are no different. Acne is a result of that nothing else. With daily travel and dust and other environmental factors, this problem becomes bigger. Just use a good gentle face cleanser to wash your face. In your case, I will recommend Avene cleansing foam. Just apply it to wet face and wash away. Do not rub or do anything else. As for the aging problem, a majority has to do with skin damage. Damage makes the skin look more old and tired. I recommend Reverzo undereye cream by Glenmark at night. If you cannot find it then you can use Auriga Flavo-C cream instead. Apply gently under eyes and let it stay overnight. It should improve the quality very soon. Skin of the face is oily near the nose and forehead and cheek and sides of face are dry. Keep this in mind next time you wash face. It is very important that you use a good sunscreen. If the face is oily, then I recommend Isdin fusion water and if it is normal then La Shield fisico (this might be a little oily but for normal skin, it is absolutely fine). Use it everyday after shower and 20 minutes before going outdoors. It will prevent any sun damage that can make the skin look old. Rest all seems fine. I have other solutions too for under eyes but they are more expensive. So, first improve the quality of the skin. It will make a lot of difference. You can revert back if you have any questions.

There are many scenarios in addition to normal healthy pregnancy in early pregnancy like missed miscarriage (baby died or did not get heart beat), ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy growth outside normal location in female body where it is harmful to both mother and developing fetus), other kind of miscarriages like complete, inevitable, etc. But, another type in which there is no gestational sac at all which could be gestational trophoblast disease. Few pregnancies with abnormal findings and unhealthy tissues need to end and need its evaluation or investigations as well. Your given history is incomplete to conclude but whatever you have told it seems to be one of the above mentioned abnormal scenarios. It no longer seems to grow as healthy pregnancy that is why you need an abortion. May be you might be missing some important findings of ultrasound as well. In case of abortion adviced by the doctor after a proper check-up, there is more likely to be the abnormal or unhealthy pregnancy that will in future bleed or will cause some harm like severe abdominal pain with heavy bleeding, etc. So, to avoid severe consequences, it is better to take precautions. I hope you understand my point. I would be more clear if I would have had your ultrasound report.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

My LFT's and bile acids where raised. I was put on Ursodeoxycholic acid 500 gm twice daily and pregnancy vitamins. My symptoms disappeared within a week. I am closely monitored, weekly blood, growth scans, etc. But after 34 weeks, itchiness has come back. Baby is active; blood remains stable. I am not sure what to do. Should I increase my medication? Why has the itching suddenly come back after nearly three months of taking the medication? I would be grateful for your opinion.","Doctor":"Hi. You are right. You have symptoms and signs of OC (obstetric cholestasis) that shows itching on palms and soles in the absence of rash with abnormal LFT and bile acid and resolves after birth. Obstetric cholestasis has increased the risk of preterm birth especially iatrogenic; fetal distress causes passage of meconium that leads to cesarean section, post delivery bleeding. Due to risk mentioned above, the fetus should be monitored regularly and frequently along with mother's blood investigations to know the level of liver enzymes and bile acid. As you are feeling increased symptoms instead of taking medications regularly, I wanted to know have you been checked for other liver-related diseases at the start of pregnancy? And when you had last CTG (cardiotocography), electronic fetal monitoring for baby. For safer side, you should have one CTG for baby's well being and repeat blood investigations for the most recent status of disease as symptoms reappear and now already you have crossed 34 weeks. Vitamin K specifically you should have for this diagnosis and baby also just after birth. Dexamethasone can be added to prescription 10 mg orally for seven days, then to stop for three days. The Ursodeoxycholic acid dose could be increased after laboratory reports. So, my advice is better to have one CTG in an emergency due to the fetal risk of still birth in OC and to repeat blood investigations for necessary changes in dose or addition of medicines I have mentioned above. I hope you understand my point. You should have laboratory tests and CTG immediately to plan further. Keep a strict check on baby's movements.

Before asking my question, I need to provide some background and context. I have had many surgeries and am a well-educated (Ph.D.) person. I am not a typical patient, given my knowledge, background, etc., including the fact that I get a copy of my complete chart for each surgery or medical procedure using any form of sedation or anesthesia. I am knowledgeable about most drugs used during anesthesia and how they work. I have been told by a surgeon (included in his surgical report) and two dentists that I require a lot of anesthesia. I have had multiple bad experiences with anesthesia, primarily conscious sedation. In my last surgery, I became alert, aware and had full memory of the second, third and fourth stitch. I have experienced pain and awareness or memory during other oral surgeries and other procedures. I abhor the idea of conscious sedation, and the drug versed, specifically, except when used for induction. I have had my specific verbal and written expectations violated. This has all lead to both fear of some simple procedures (like oral surgery and even regular dentistry) and a distrust that I will be cared for in a manner that I do not find acceptable. Two days ago, I had oral surgery and had some memory of pain and other things and, because of my experience, I am also a person that brings a high-quality recorder into the procedure room or OR (when the opportunity presents itself). So, for the oral surgery two days ago, I recall experiencing pain and asking for more medication. I recall being told to calm down (the audio recording supports these recollections, plus the oral surgeon and anesthesiologist, who I paid extra out-of-pocket to have available so I could be in deep sedation and not experience pain. Note to all anesthesiologists and surgeons; patients can sometimes hear and remember everything you say. Be respectful, at least in the presence of the patient. I had recalled something like this but was not certain exactly what was said until I listened to the recording. Okay, my question is this is a short and long-term question. I have a procedure with the anesthesiologist at 8 AM. He also does some pain management procedures, and I will be getting the nerve block test for lumbar RFA tomorrow. I will have a CRNA who will be doing the anesthesia or sedation. But, I want to be able to discuss what happened to me during oral surgery with the anesthesiologist. I am a bit upset about that. I have a fear of dental and other painful procedures. I know that the local anesthetics do not work as well on me as they do on others which is presumably why I was feeling pain and this is an issue not just for the procure in the morning. It is an ongoing issue that just grows more intense with every procedure that my trust is violated, and I experience pain and, I need the RFA. I have multiple herniated discs and arthritis, facet joint damage. I do not know how to articulate my needs in such a way that the anesthesiologist or CRNA (later this morning or in the future) takes my concerns seriously. I do not just need something to calm me, and in fact, the very thing that an anesthesiologist would use to calm me is one of the most fearful things to me. I do not want to experience pain. I do not need amnesia, and I do not need to be calm (well, I would be calm if these things did not repeatedly happen to me). I just need no pain and if that takes a heavier dose of Propofol (in a hospital setting). So be it. If that takes more local anesthetic. So be it. I need to be unconscious, or I need enough pain management and deep sedation or no sedation. What do I need to say to get that without offending or getting interpreted as just another person who is afraid of the OR (which I am not) and, I am pretty sure that they would be freaked out if I told them that I bring a recorder in with me (for additional curiosity, if that is not something that I want to share. Is it possible that I would share that after being given versed? What if I just tell them no versed? Low dose Propofol would do the same thing. Right?). Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your past experiences of conscious sedation, and I understand how difficult it would have been for you. One thing I want to clear you first is that conscious sedation does not mean general anesthesia. Conscious sedation works on this principle only that you or the patient is conscious. It may decrease the pain and increase the cooperation for the procedure, but it does not mean that you will not hear or feel anything. For small oral surgeries and small procedures, everywhere conscious sedation is used. It just means that it will decrease to some extent your feeling of pain and you might be sedated for most of the procedure time but not the whole time of the procedure. It means one can recall so many things from surgery in conscious sedation. If you want to be completely knocked down and not feel or listen anything then what you need is general anesthesia which is usually not given for small procedures. Now coming to your problem. First, you need to discuss with your anesthesiologist better a day or few days before the surgery explaining him everything what happened in past surgeries and what you expect from him. If you will discuss this with your anesthetist a few days earlier or at least a day before, he will not think that you are just afraid of OR (operating room). You have to make your mind and explain it to him that whether you want conscious sedation or general anesthesia. If you do not want to feel anything and not want to be awake in between the procedure, explain to him that you want general anesthesia and no sedation. Explain it to him clearly what are your experiences from past and what you expect from him this time in procedure. Regarding the recording thing, let me ask you a question. Do you never talk to your colleague whenever you were doing your thesis or research work? I guess everybody does. It is routine work for them, so it is not possible that everybody is keeping silence during work. Have you never met a little difficult person to handle? The next thing I want to tell you is that keeping a recorder during the procedure is like interfering into someone else's privacy. It may have legal implications for you. Next, it is affecting your mental peace too. You are doing something which is increasing your sufferings more. Just answer one question, if you get a scary dream, is it good to have any horror dream repeated in your mind again and again or is it better to forget one. The choice is yours. Telling some patient to calm down during a procedure is a type of psychotherapy, and it has been proven effective. It is not that the person wants to give you less drug, the problem with conscious sedation is that you have to limit the dosage of the drug or else the patient will stop breathing, and that is not what you or the doctor wants. So, better ask for general anesthesia. Last but not the least, consult a psychotherapist or psychiatrist regarding your past awareness of anesthesia. The sessions will help you remove or at least decrease the mental trauma from past episodes.

My sugar levels are not stable at all, and I had consulted my first doctor, and the prescription was Metformin 850 mg and Amaryl 1 mg. The results after taking these medications are not stable. Therefore, I consulted my second doctor and he prescribed me insulin. However, I am confused whether I should keep taking medication or insulin. Kindly advise.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query, and from what you have mentioned it appears that you have diabetes. Your blood sugar is not that uncontrolled that you have to take insulin. You can do one thing, do HbA1c test and then get back to me so that I can put you on better treatment. Hope you find my advice beneficial.

After MRI report, the doctor suggested an operation. Should I go with the operation or not? MRI report: Spine with the screening of the whole spine: Cervical spine was studied with 3 mm thin slices in the axial and sagittal plane. Both T1 and T2 weighted and gradient echo images were obtained. STIR corona images were obtained. T2 weighted sagittal whole spine screening was also performed. There is straightening of cervical spine noted. Fusion of C3 and C4 vertebral bodies is seen - postoperative status. Rest of the cervical vertebrae reveals normal marrow signal intensity. Posterior disc osteophyte complex is seen at the C4-C5 level causing left neural foramina stenosis, indentation over cord and compression upon left C5 nerve root. Posterior disc osteophyte complex is seen at the C5-C6 level causing left neural foramina stenosis and compression upon left C6 nerve root. The facet joints are unremarkable. The craniovertebral junction is unremarkable. The cord is of normal signal intensity. There is no fracture, dislocation or erosion. Paravertebral soft tissues are normal. T2 weighted sagittal whole spine screening reveals intervertebral discs are of reduced signal intensity on T2 weighted images at all lumbar levels suggestive of disc desiccation. Disc bulges are seen from D5-D6 and L4-L5 levels. Impression: Cervical spondylosis as described above. Posterior disc osteophyte complex at C4-C5 level causing left neural foramina stenosis, indentation over cord and compression upon left C5 nerve root. Posterior disc osteophyte complex at C5-C6 level causing left neural foramina stenosis and compression on left C6 nerve root. More details about the presenting complaint: Currently feeling numbness in left hand 60 % and in right hand 40 %. Previous history of the same issue: Operation for cervical spondylosis was carried out 10 years back for C3-C4.","Doctor":"Hello. If there is persistent numbness in the hands in cervical radiculopathy, then surgery is indicated. As you have mentioned that you have significant numbness, and your MRI reports also suggest the same, you should consider getting a surgery done. Till then you can be started on Duloxetine and Pregabalin along with cervical collar. In case your symptoms improve significantly with the mentioned medicine you may defer the surgery.

It can be felt when I get a massage. Can this be dangerous? The doctor once told me seven years back that it might be fat. What test can make sure that it is not a serious kind of tumor?","Doctor":"Hi. I have checked the attached photos (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It looks like a lipoma, which is a benign fat mass with a soft consistency. Lipoma is completely benign with no complications. A biopsy is the most confirmative method. Surgical assessment is required for possible removal. The other possibility is chronic abscess. Is it painful or gets inflamed sometimes?

I am suffering from prostatitis and have following complaints like weak urine flow (4.8 ml/sec average flow and 8.8 maximum flow), dribbling at the end of passing urine, mild pain in testes, and frequent urination (four to five times a day and none at night). I got the following tests done, USG abdomen and pelvis, USG scrotum, DRE by two urologists, and uroflowmetry. The important findings are prostate size 3.0 x 3.1 x 2.8 cm (14 cc), pre-void bladder volume 202 cc, post void residue 14 cc, and prostate is normal in size and echotexture. There were normal ultrasound findings in both scrotal viscera, prostate was found to be normal, smooth, firm, and tender in DRE test. Currently taking Alfoo 10 mg (once daily) and Tadalafil 5 mg (twice a week). Current complaint is that I have got all complaints resolved except urine flow after one month but have a flare back. Please suggest advice on any more medicine needed.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query and the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You definitely have an obstructive pattern of urination on uroflowmetry. I see that you have also mentioned that your flow had not improved after one month of medical therapy. I would like to know whether any urine analysis was done to diagnose you as prostatitis? As your prostate glands are not enlarged and your flow is relatively poor, I would also not rule out any urethral stricture. If I were your treating physician I would first get a urinalysis before and after the prostatic massage to rule out any prostatic infection or inflammation. Then, give a trial of some newer alpha blocker for a month to assess any improvement in a symptom scoring and repeat uroflowmetry. If there is no improvement then I would suggest a urethrogram with or without an office flexible cystoscopy to ascertain the site of obstruction.

I have consulted many doctors, but there is no improvement. So, I want your suggestion in regard to this. I am explaining my problem below. Five years ago, one morning when I got up from bed, I felt numbness in my left lower limb. It continues for a few days and then my right lower limb also felt the same. Apart from that, I also started feeling difficulty in passing urine. I consulted neurologist and they performed a number of tests, but could not find out the reason. They took the MRI of whole spine and brain, but there was nothing. Today, after five years, the condition is that I have very difficulty in walking and also I am using a catheter for passing urine. Each time using the process of self intermittent catheterization (SIC). My life has become a burden for me. I become a fully dependent person to others.

The fourth generation combo test came negative and RT-PCR viral load came below the detectable limit. Can my test be conclusive? Am I risk-free from HIV?","Doctor":"Hi. Protected sex is safe as far as risk of HIV is concerned. Insertive or sex has a negligible risk of transmission of HIV. As far as testing is concerned, only a four-week fourth generation HIV screening test is considered reliable. Though even that has to be followed up by a 12-week screening test for a conclusive result. RNA PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is a very sensitive test early on after possible infection. A negative test at 23 days is fairly conclusive. A fourth-generation HIV screening test has a window period ranging from 18 to 45 days. Whereas RNA PCR has a short window period of 9 to 13 days. Therefore both the tests taken together reliably excludes the risk of HIV.

He has been found with liver cirrhosis few years back and he has taken medicine for that and all went normally. Later, he found with balanitis but after medicine he was normal. At present, he used to drink but now he is facing an issue. He has an issue with excreting out due to a fissure. He said that a few days back when he was in the washroom, he felt some piece of flesh came out through his excretory part and he used to have tight stools and feels some pricking type in his anus. His tummy also feels like some balloon on his left side of tummy. He is asking that whether he is facing fissure issue and should get this thing operated or not. Sir, I want to know what should we do. He is a hypertensive too.","Doctor":"Hi. I could find three issues with your brother. They are obesity, cirrhosis, and fissure. All these are related. He needs to lose weight. He has to be motivated with regular physical activity, modified diet and restrict fluid to 2 liters a day. Regarding cirrhosis, he needs to be on regular follow up. We need to check how bad his liver is. We need to check his : Being cirrhotic he needs to have two to three times of bowel movements daily that too soft stools. When stools become hard, his fissures (cracks) in the anal region become worse and painful. So, the first step is to avoid constipation and constipating foods. Take syrup Looz (Lactulose) 30 ml at night or twice or thrice daily to achieve adequate soft stools. You can use these two creams alternately every four hours for acute pain, Cremagel (Diltiazem) and Smuth (Lidocaine, Dobisilate, and Hydrocortisone) cream. Better to try without surgery as he is cirrhotic. If pain does not settle with these measures you can go ahead with surgery. Definitely, he has to be abstinent from all liver-damaging substances.

Your ultrasound of left breast (attachment removed to protect patient identity) shows a well defined oval shaped hypoechoic lesion measuring approximately 1x0.7x0.4 cm, likely at 12 o’clock position. It is well capsulated with smooth margins and horizontally oriented and shows distal acoustic enhancement suggestive of benign etiology likely a fibroadenoma - BI-RADS 2 (breast imaging reporting and data system) category. No surrounding changes like fat stranding. Ductal dilatation is seen to suggest infection or invasive etiology.

All my tests like TMT, 2D echo, 48 hours Holter monitor, ECG, kidney or liver tests, blood tests, vitamin tests, etc are normal. I read the side effects of Flupentixol like thrombosis, embolism, QT prolongation, etc., and I am little nervous about this medicine. I am yet to start it. Are Flupentixol and Escitalopram safe and effective for anxiety induced somatic symptoms? I am currently taking Metoprolol Tartrate (50) twice a day, Amlodipine 5 mg (twice a day) and Atorvastatin 10 (once in the night). For insomnia one of the general physician (MD) prescribed Mirtazapine 7.5. I have been taking Mirnite 7.5 for last 3 months. I was convinced about Mirtazapine safety and decided to give it a try. It makes me sleep though quality of sleep is not great. What is your opinion on XeFexor Duo? Do you recommend any other medicine for persistent anxiety and insomnia? I need something that should not increase my BP and heart rate. My BP is very much controlled (less than 110/80) and resting heart rate is normal too (70).","Doctor":"Hello. You must understand that there is a difference between potential side effects that are reported with the drug and commonly seen side effects with a drug. While the side effects that you mentioned have been reported in the literature, they are not common and I have not seen any of my patients having them while on the medicine. Still, this does not mean that there is no risk of having them. But the risk is minimal and almost every medicine (psychiatric or otherwise) has a risk of developing some or the other side effects. I use it for anxiety and psychosomatic symptoms in my patients and I find it effective. However, it may not work for everybody. The only way to ascertain is by taking it for two to four weeks. By the way, Mirtazapine at a dose of 15 to 30 mg is also effective for anxiety and psychosomatic symptoms and you can ask your doctor about it.

So, most of the teeth have started yellowing and have got caries. My dentist told me that it will change when I starting brushing them but it is not the case. Please help me. I want my smile back.","Doctor":"Hello. Looking at the condition of your mouth (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I can say that you have got a lot of dental problems like dental caries, discolored teeth with stains and tartar. These problems are causing the bad breath which is not going to get away with only tooth brushing. You require a systematic treatment plan for your mouth like scaling, finishing and polishing, filling up the various teeth and extraction or root canal treatment depending on the condition of the teeth. But the good news is that your condition is very much treatable. So, you need not worry. You just need to visit a good dentist who can take care of all your problems.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It is not painful, but annoying, though it stops when I move my hand down, or I hold my hand backward. It is only on one side, my left side. When I am sitting or lying, I am normal. I suspect an injury while doing free weights, cause this everyday annoyance came suddenly. I am being treated by a chiropractor for the last two months, who is slowly working out all my thoracic points (and says that I might have T6 and T10). What I would like to know is since this is a feeling present only at certain mechanical or postural movements, can it be anything more serious than a back injury (I have slight scoliosis and my shoulders are a bit arched)? How many treatments should it take for the stiffness or pushing to go away completely? Do I need an MRI to exclude more serious health conditions? (right now I am quite worried and would like to avoid MRI) I have been feeling like this for past six months but the stiffness is getting less often now, so it is improving. But I still feel it when moving my left hand and sometimes when I am standing, and it gets worse towards the end of the day. I do around three sessions for 20 minutes of cross-trainer every day. It does not affect me when I am doing it, but could it be responsible for my stiffness? Otherwise, I feel extremely healthy, though during the last period I felt a little tired mentally with all the overthinking related to this injury, cause I am used to being perfectly healthy.","Doctor":"Hi. I have reviewed your question. After reading your post, I immediately thought you might have a rib subluxation. This is very common with scoliosis (I myself have frequent rib issues). Since you know you have scoliosis, this will explain why this issue appears to be chronic. To specifically answer your questions, here are my answers. If you were my patient, I would perform a chiropractic examination and would most likely recommend chiropractic adjustments and exercises if you were a candidate for care. Since you are not my patient, I recommend that you continue to go to a local chiropractor for treatment and proper care.

I have been told that if you brush your teeth within a half hour after drinking or eating anything acidy, such as coffee, beer, or tea, it could actually brush the acid into your teeth, causing more damage than brushing. The problem is that after each meal, I usually have the time to brush my teeth. A half-hour later, I am involved with something else and my teeth are the last thing that I am thinking about. Neither my dentist nor anyone else has directly answered my question.","Doctor":"Hello. There is no problem in brushing immediately after a meal.

He saw a urologist immediately who did a physical exam, drew some blood and took a urine specimen. He said that the lump was located on the back of the testicle and most likely a benign cyst. We had a follow up today for the results of his blood work. He had a very low testosterone level and extremely low vitamin D and an elevated estrogen level. He was placed on a vitamin D supplement and 1 mg of Anastrozole per week to block the production of estrogen and raise his testosterone. He still maintains that these issues are the cause of the lump but we have had no ultrasound or anything that I would have expected to diagnose a problem. Should we push for a second opinion?","Doctor":"Hello. Relax and do not worry. Testicular lumps are very common in young people. As your urologist has examined you, there are high chances of it being a benign cyst arising from the epididymis. But, I will suggest an ultrasound scrotum just to be sure and confirm it is a cyst only. So, insist for ultrasound scrotum. Hormonal problem and lump of testicular cyst are two different things and as per me are not related together. If it gets confirmed on USG that it is epididymis cyst, then nothing is to be done until there is pain or increase in size.
