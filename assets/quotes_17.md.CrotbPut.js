Divide the convex hexagon into four triangles using three diagonals as shown in Figure 5, and mark the three diagonals with S-2 n-1, n+1, and S-2 n-5 respectively.

Find all integers n for which frac{4 n-2}{n+5} is the square of a rational number. (A rational number is a number in mathbb{Q}.)","solution":"Solution. Suppose frac{4 n-2}{n+5} is the square of a rational number. Then we can write it as frac{p^{2}}{q^{2}} with p, q non-negative integers, q neq 0 and operatorname{gcd}(p, q)=1. Due to the condition operatorname{gcd}(p, q)=1, frac{p^{2}}{q^{2}} is the most simplified version of this fraction, so there is an integer c neq 0 such that 4 n-2=c p^{2} and n+5=c q^{2}. Now we have22=4(n+5)-(4 n-2)=4 c q^{2}-c p^{2}=cleft((2 q)^{2}-p^{2}right)=c(2 q-p)(2 q+p) .So c is a divisor of 22. Furthermore, 22 is divisible by 2, so the right-hand side is also divisible by 2. If there is a factor of 2 in 2 q-p, there is also a factor of 2 in 2 q+p, because these two factors differ by 2 p and that is even. Conversely, if 2 q+p is divisible by 2, then 2 q-p is also divisible by 2. But 22 contains only one factor of 2, so it cannot be that both 2 q-p and 2 q+p are divisible by 2. We conclude that 2 q-p and 2 q+p are precisely odd, and c is therefore even. Finally, since p geq 0 and q geq 1, we have 2 q+p geq 2, so the factor 11 from 22 must be in 2 q+p. We conclude that there are only two possibilities:- c=2,2 q+p=11,2 q-p=1;- c=-2,2 q+p=11,2 q-p=-1.In the first case, we find 2 p=11-1=10, so p=5 and q=3. This gives 4 n-2=50, so n=13. Checking: frac{4 n-2}{n+5}=frac{50}{18}=frac{25}{9}=frac{5^{2}}{3^{2}}, so n=13 indeed satisfies. In the second case, we find 2 p=11--1=12, so p=6, but then q cannot be an integer anymore, so this case is invalid.

Since these two numbers are consecutive, one of them must be even, hence it must be 2. If ( d_{2}+1=2 ), then ( d_{2}=1 ), which contradicts the statement. Therefore, ( d_{2}=2 ) and ( d_{2}+1=3 ).If ( k=3 ), the only strict divisor of ( m ) is 2, so ( m=4 ). The only strict divisor of ( m ) being 3, we must have ( n=9 ). Conversely, since the only strict divisor of 4 is 2 and the only strict divisor of 9 is 3, the triplet ( (4,9,3) ) satisfies the statement.Suppose ( k geqslant 4 ). Since the smallest strict divisor of ( m ) is 3, ( m ) is not divisible by 2, so it is odd. Therefore, ( d_{3}+1 ) must be odd, so ( d_{3} ) is even. Let ( d_{3}=2l ). Since ( d_{3}>d_{2}=2 ), we have ( l>1 ), so ( l geqslant 2 ). If ( l geqslant 4 ), then ( l ) divides ( d_{3} ), so ( l ) divides ( m ) and ( l neq m ) because ( 2l ) divides ( m ). In particular, since ( l<2l ) is a divisor of ( m ), this contradicts the statement. Therefore, we must have ( l=2 ), so ( d_{3}=4 ). We deduce that ( d_{3}+1=5 ). If ( k=4 ), the strict divisors of ( m ) are 2 and 4, so ( m=8 ), and since the strict divisors of ( n ) are 3 and 5, we have ( n=15 ). Conversely, the only strict divisors of 8 are 2 and 4, and those of 15 are 3 and 5, so the triplet ( (8,15,4) ) satisfies the statement.If ( k geqslant 5 ), since 3 and 5 divide ( n ), 15 divides ( n ). Since ( k geqslant 3 ), we cannot have ( n=15 ) otherwise ( n ) would have only 2 strict divisors. In particular, 15 is a strict divisor of ( n ), so ( 15-1=14 ) is a strict divisor of ( m ). Therefore, ( 7+1=8 ) is a strict divisor of ( n ), so ( n ) is even, which leads to a contradiction.In particular, for ( k geqslant 5 ), there are no solutions, so the only solutions are ( (4,9,3) ) and ( (8,15,4) ).Alternative solution: In the same way as in the previous solution, we obtain that ( d_{2}=2 ). If ( m ) is divisible by an odd number ( l ), then ( l ) is a strict divisor because ( m ) is divisible by 2, so it is even. In particular, ( l+1 ) is even and divides ( n ), so 2 divides ( n ), which contradicts the fact that ( d_{2}+1 ) is the smallest divisor of ( n ). Therefore, ( m ) must be a power of 2. If ( m geqslant 16 ), then 8 and 4 are strict divisors of ( m ). Thus, 9 and 5 divide ( n ), so 45 divides ( n ). In particular, 15 is a strict factor of ( n ), so ( 15-1=14 ) is a strict factor of ( m ). Thus, ( m ) is divisible by 7, which contradicts the fact that ( m ) is a power of 2.Therefore, ( m ) is a power of 2 such that ( m<16 ) and 2 is a strict divisor of ( m ). We have ( m=4 ) or ( m=8 ). If ( m=4 ), the only strict divisor of 4 is 2, so the only strict divisor of ( n ) is 3, hence ( n=9 ). Since the only strict divisor of 4 is 2 and the only strict divisor of 9 is 3, the triplet ( (4,9,3) ) satisfies the statement.If ( m=8 ), the strict divisors of ( m ) are 2 and 4, so the strict divisors of ( n ) are 3 and 5, hence ( n=15 ). Conversely, the only strict divisors of 8 are 2 and 4, and those of 15 are 3 and 5, so the triplet ( (8,15,4) ) satisfies the statement.The solution triplets are therefore ( (4,9,3) ) and ( (8,15,4) ).Comment: The exercise was difficult, but a good number of students managed to make significant progress on the exercise.

Assuming we have selected the first three boxes, the fourth box will be left empty and is not considered further. Since each of the three selected boxes must contain all three colors—white, black, and red—we know that each box must have at least one white, one black, and one red ball.We start by distributing the balls so that each box has one of each color, which leaves us with the following:- 1 extra white ball to place,- 2 extra black balls to place,- 3 extra red balls to place.Now we determine the number of ways to distribute the leftover balls of each color:- The single remaining white ball can go into any one of the three boxes, which gives us 3 options.- For the two remaining black balls, we have two scenarios:  1. Both balls go into the same box, yielding 3 ways (one way for each box).  2. The balls go into two different boxes, which can be done in 3 times 2 / 2 = 3 ways (choosing 2 boxes out of 3 and dividing by 2 to account for the fact that the balls are identical).  Therefore, there are a total of 3 + 3 = 6 ways to place the extra black balls.- For the three remaining red balls, we have three scenarios:  1. All three balls go into the same box, giving us 3 ways.  2. Two balls go into one box and the other one goes into a different box. The two balls can go into any of the three boxes, and the single ball can go into either of the remaining two boxes, giving us 3 times 2 = 6 ways.  3. Each of the three boxes gets one ball, which can only be done in 1 way since the balls are identical.  Hence, there are a total of 3 + 6 + 1 = 10 ways to place the extra red balls.Now, we calculate the total number of different ways to place the balls:4 times 3 times 6 times 10 = 720.The answer is boxed{720} different ways."},{"problem":"2.

The moment is given by the product of the mass and the distance (arm) from the axis (with sign). The position of the center of mass can be determined by the distances from two different direction axes (the axes, of course, being in the plane). It is convenient to choose the coordinate axes such that the distance from the center of each field is a multiple of the distance to the nearest point.I. Place the chessboard in the usual Cartesian coordinate system and choose its unit length such that the center of the field common to the 1st row and 1st column has coordinates (1,1), and the center of the field common to the 2nd row and 2nd column has coordinates (2,2). Then, for the center of the field common to the i-th row and the j-th column (numbered from left to right in the usual way in chess), the coordinates are clearly (j, i), and the mass of the material point placed there in the first mass point system is j+i-1. Thus, for each material point, the arm with respect to the x and y axes is given by its ordinate and abscissa, respectively, and due to the obvious symmetry of the point system, the two coordinates of the center of mass T are equal, so it is sufficient to determine the abscissa x_{T}.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_770dc4a79e7b4d3f6d36g-1.jpg?height=1022&width=1008&top_left_y=790&top_left_x=553)To find the sum of the masses, consider the sum of the masses in each column. Their values form an arithmetic sequence with a difference of 1, increasing upwards in each column. In the first column,s_{1}=1+2+ldots+n=frac{n}{2}(1+n)The terms in the 2nd column are each 1 greater, since the number of the field with center (j, i) can be written as j+(i-1), so s_{2}=s_{1}+n, similarly s_{3}=s_{2}+n=s_{1}+2 n, ldots, and the column sums also form an arithmetic sequence. The sum of the last column iss_{n}=n+(n+1)+ldots+(2 n-1)=frac{n}{2}(3 n-1)or, after rearrangement:s_{n}=frac{n}{2}{(1+n)+2(n-1)}=s_{1}+(n-1) nThus, as the sum of the n sums,sum m=frac{n}{2}left{frac{n}{2}(1+n)+frac{n}{2}(3 n-1)right}=frac{n^{2}}{4} cdot 4 n=n^{3}In the moment of the point system about the y axis, the arm (abscissa) of each column's masses is common and equal to the column number, so based on the above,sum m_{k} x_{k}=s_{1} cdot 1+s_{2} cdot 2+s_{3} cdot 3+ldots+s_{n} cdot n=begin{gathered}=left(s_{1}+0 cdot nright) cdot 1+left(s_{1}+1 cdot nright) cdot 2+left(s_{1}+2 cdot nright) cdot 3+ldots+left{s_{1}+(n-1) nright} cdot n= =s_{1}(1+2+3+ldots+n)+n{(0 cdot 1+1 cdot 2+2 cdot 3+ldots+(n-1) n)}end{gathered}(The k index runs through the fields of the chessboard in some order.)The second expression in parentheses can be transformed as follows:begin{gathered}left(1^{2}-1right)+left(2^{2}-2right)+left(3^{2}-3right)+ldots+left(n^{2}-nright)= =left(1^{2}+2^{2}+ldots+n^{2}right)-(1+2+ldots+n)= =frac{n(n+1)(2 n+1)}{6}-frac{n(n+1)}{2}=frac{n(n+1)}{6}(2 n-2)=frac{(n+1) n(n-1)}{3}end{gathered}Thus,sum m_{k} x_{k}=frac{n^{2}(n+1)^{2}}{4}+frac{n^{2}(n+1)(n-1)}{3}=frac{n^{2}(n+1)}{12}(7 n-1)With this, the equation and solution for x_{T} arex_{T} cdot sum m=sum m_{k} x_{k}, quad x_{T}=y_{T}=frac{sum m_{k} x_{k}}{sum m}=frac{(n+1)(7 n-1)}{12 n}(The center of mass does not fall into the center of any field of the board for any n(>1), because x_{T} cannot be an integer, since n is relatively prime to both n+1 and 7 n-1.)II. For the second point system, we proceed similarly. The sum of the masses in the first column remains s_{1}, the sum of the masses in the 2nd column is 2 s_{1}, since we wrote twice the number of the 1st column for each term, similarly the sum of the masses in the 3rd, ..., n-th column is 3 s_{1}, ldots, n s_{1}, sobegin{gathered}sum m=s_{1}+2 s_{1}+3 s_{1}+ldots+n s_{1}= =s_{1}(1+2+ldots+n)=s_{1}^{2}=frac{n^{2}(n+1)^{2}}{4}end{gathered}![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_770dc4a79e7b4d3f6d36g-2.jpg?height=775&width=764&top_left_y=1412&top_left_x=664)Figure 2The distance from the y-axis is again common for each column, sobegin{gathered}sum m_{k} x_{k}=s_{1} cdot 1+left(2 s_{1}right) cdot 2+left(3 s_{1}right) cdot 3+ldots+left(n s_{1}right) cdot n= =s_{1}left(1^{2}+2^{2}+ldots+n^{2}right)=frac{n^{2}(n+1)^{2}(2 n+1)}{12}end{gathered}and thus the coordinates of the center of mass U are:x_{U}=y_{U}=frac{sum m_{k} x_{k}}{sum m}=frac{2 n+1}{3}Zoltán Papp (Debrecen, Fazekas M.

The position of the three fixed rolls can be chosen in 8 different ways, because the first element can be any of the first eight rolls. The 8 cdot 6^{7} sequences we have counted include each sequence exactly as many times as the sequence 1,2,3 appears in it, so8 cdot 6^{7}=A_{1}+2 A_{2}+3 A_{3}Now consider the sequences of rolls in which the sequence 1,2,3 appears exactly twice at fixed positions. The remaining four rolls can be anything, so there are 6^{4} possibilities. To determine how many ways the two fixed sequences of 1,2,3 can be placed, imagine combining each sequence of three into a single element. This way, we are determining the order of two combined sequences of three and four \\"normal\\" rolls. We need to choose 2 out of 6 positions for the combined sequences, which can be done in binom{6}{2}=15 ways.The 15 cdot 6^{4} sequences include each sequence exactly once that contains the sequence 1,2,3 exactly twice and three times as many that contain it three times, so15 cdot 6^{4}=A_{2}+3 A_{3}Finally, consider the sequences of rolls in which the sequence 1,2,3 appears exactly three times. Similarly to the previous cases, we find that the positions of the three sequences can be chosen in binom{4}{3}=4 ways, and the remaining single roll can be any of 6 outcomes, so the number of such sequences is 4 cdot 6, or4 cdot 6=A_{3}Based on equations (2), (3), and (4), the number of sequences in which the sequence 1,2,3 appears consecutively isA_{1}+A_{2}+A_{3}=left(A_{1}+2 A_{2}+3 A_{3}right)-left(A_{2}+3 A_{3}right)+A_{3}=8 cdot 6^{7}-15 cdot 6^{4}+4 cdot 6=2220072The desired probability isP=frac{2220072}{6^{10}} approx 0.0367Thus, on average, out of approximately 27 sequences of 10 rolls, one will contain the sequence 1,2,3 consecutively.text { Brezovich László (Szombathely, Nagy Lajos Gimn., III. o.t.) }Remarks. 1.

Some contestants tried to calculate the number of sequences of rolls in which the sequence 1,2,3 appears using the following - incorrect - method: \\"The position of the sequence can be 8 different ways, and each of the other 7 rolls can be 6 different ways, which totals 8 cdot 6^{7} possibilities.\\" This method is incorrect because it counts sequences multiple times where the sequence 1,2,3 appears more than once.

To increase the weight of a number and minimize the number, the number should have as many digits 9 as possible. On the other hand, we can say that the digit 0 is eliminated from the digits to be considered, because it increases the number without increasing its weight.We have that 2000=9 times 222+2. Therefore, the number we are looking for must have 222 digits 9 and one digit 2, or two digits 1. We eliminate the case of numbers with two digits 1 because they have 224 digits, making them larger than the numbers that have the digit 2 and have 223 digits.

Since (2013 = 3 times 11 times 61), we have:   [   phi(2013) = phi(3) times phi(11) times phi(61) = (3-1)(11-1)(61-1) = 2 times 10 times 60 = 1200   ]6. Since (phi(2013) = 1200), we know that (2^{1200} equiv 1 pmod{2013}) by Euler's theorem. We need to reduce the exponent (30^5) modulo 1200:   [   30^5 mod 1200   ]   Calculating (30^5):   [   30^5 = 24300000   ]   Now, reducing modulo 1200:   [   24300000 mod 1200 = 0   ]   because (24300000) is a multiple of 1200.7. Therefore:   [   2^{30^5} equiv 2^0 equiv 1 pmod{2013}   ]8. Finally:   [   d = 2^{30^5} - 2 equiv 1 - 2 equiv -1 equiv 2012 pmod{2013}   ]The final answer is (boxed{2012})."},{"problem":"21.

Identify the pattern to avoid three consecutive numbers:   - We can choose numbers in such a way that we avoid picking three consecutive numbers. For example, we can pick numbers in the following pattern:     [     1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, ldots, 148, 149     ]     or:     [     2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, ldots, 149, 150     ]2. Count the numbers in the pattern:   - In each pattern, we are effectively skipping every third number. To see how many numbers we can pick without having three consecutive numbers, we can count the numbers in one of these patterns.   - Consider the first pattern: ( 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, ldots, 148, 149 ).   - We can see that every block of three numbers (e.g., ( 1, 2, 3 )) allows us to pick two numbers.

We rearrange the equation to 3 a^{2}-a b^{2}=2 b+5. Since the right side is odd, the left side must also be odd, so a must be an odd number and b must be an even number.

Let O be the center of the circumscribed circle, i.e., the midpoint of the hypotenuse AB of the given right triangle ABC, and v the length of its altitude to the hypotenuse (Fig. 3). The triangle EDO is also clearly a right triangle because its sides DO and EO are perpendicular to the legs of triangle ABC; the altitude to the hypotenuse is the segment OC (of length frac{1}{2} c). Due to the symmetry of segment AC with respect to the axis OD, the angle at vertex D satisfies |angle CDO| = 90^circ - |angle COD| = 90^circ - |angle AOD| = alpha. Therefore, triangles EDO and ABC are similar (AA). The similarity coefficient k is given by the ratio of the lengths of the corresponding altitudes to the hypotenuses, so k = |OC| / v = frac{1}{2} c / v, and since vc = 2S, we havek = frac{c^2}{4S}In this similarity, the hypotenuse AB corresponds to the hypotenuse DE, so for its length we have|DE| = k c = frac{c^3}{4S}Another solution. From the symmetry of tangents from a point to a circle, it follows that both triangles ACD and BCE are isosceles, |AD| = |DC|, |BE| = |CE|. The triangles ACO and BCO are also isosceles, where O is the midpoint of the hypotenuse AB (the legs of both triangles have the length of the radius of the circumscribed circle of the right triangle ABC, which is frac{1}{2} c). We will show that these are two pairs of similar triangles ACD sim BCO and ACO sim BCE. To do this, it suffices to notice that in the quadrilateral AOC D, which is composed of two congruent right triangles, |angle CDA| = 180^circ - |angle AOC| = |angle COB|. The isosceles triangles ACD and BCO are thus similar by the theorem AA. From this similarity, it follows that |CD| : |CA| = |CO| : |CB|, so with the usual notation for the legs, we get |CD| = frac{1}{2} c b / a, and from the similarity of triangles ACO and BCE we get |CE| = frac{1}{2} c a / b. In total, we have|DE| = |DC| + |CE| = frac{cb}{2a} + frac{ca}{2b} = frac{cb^2 + ca^2}{2ab} = frac{c(a^2 + b^2)}{2 cdot 2S} = frac{c^3}{4S}.Notes. The similarity of the mentioned isosceles triangles can also be derived by noticing the equality of the corresponding angles angle ACO and angle BCE at the bases: both supplement the angle angle OCB to a right angle (angle ACB, resp. angle OCE). Therefore, ACO sim BCE.Another possibility is to discover the equality |angle ADO| = |angle BAC| = alpha (the legs of one angle are perpendicular to the legs of the other). From the right triangle ODA, we have |AO| : |AD| = tan |angle ADO| = tan alpha = a : b, so |CD| = |AD| = frac{1}{2} cb / a, and analogously for the right triangle OEB.For a complete solution, award 6 points.

Determine the number of real roots of the equation x^{2}+4=a|x| depending on the real parameter a.(Mária Dományová)","solution":"SOLUTION. First, let's present the graphical solution of the problem. The graph of the function on the left side of the equation is a parabola opening upwards, which has its vertex at the point [0,4]. The graph of the function on the right side is a pair of rays originating from the origin, which are symmetric with respect to the y-axis. The ray pointing to the right (the graph of the function for x>0) has a slope of a, and the ray pointing to the left has a slope of -a.Note that the entire situation is symmetric with respect to the y-axis (both functions x^{2}+4 and a|x| are even). Therefore, there can be three cases. For sufficiently small values of a, the rays will not intersect the parabola (this will be the case for every a leqq 0 and also for some a>0 as shown in the first figure) - the equation will then have no real roots. For a certain critical value a=a_{0}>0, both rays will be tangents to the parabola (see the second figure) - in that case, the equation will have 2 real roots. For values a>a_{0}, each of the two rays will intersect the parabola at two points (third figure) - the equation will then have a total of 4 real roots. It is therefore sufficient to calculate this critical value a_{0}>0. For it, the quadratic equation x^{2}+4=a_{0} x must have exactly one double root, which occurs precisely when its discriminant a_{0}^{2}-16 is zero. This is satisfied by the only positive a_{0}=4 (the double root is then indeed the positive number x=2).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_e8a9d2201357bccae2b6g-3.jpg?height=478&width=1170&top_left_y=1268&top_left_x=448)Conclusion.

Analyze the given condition:   The condition ( n > m(m-2) ) can be rewritten as ( n geq m(m-2) + 1 = (m-1)^2 ). This implies ( n geq (m-1)^2 ).3. Consider the minimal element ( delta ) in ( {d in D mid d > n} ):   Suppose there exists an element ( delta in D ) such that ( delta > n ). Let ( p ) be a prime divisor of ( delta ). Then ( delta/p in D ), and since ( delta/p leq m-1 ), we have:   [   p geq frac{delta}{m-1} > frac{(m-1)^2}{m-1} = m-1   ]   This implies ( p geq m ), but since ( p ) must be a prime dividing ( d in D ), and all such primes are at most ( m-1 ), we reach a contradiction.4.

If d=2 n-1 and a_{1}=cdots=a_{2 n-1}=n /(2 n-1), then each group in such a partition can contain at most one number, since 2 n /(2 n-1)>1. Therefore k geqslant 2 n-1. It remains to show that a suitable partition into 2 n-1 groups always exists.We proceed by induction on d. For d leqslant 2 n-1 the result is trivial. If d geqslant 2 n, then sinceleft(a_{1}+a_{2}right)+ldots+left(a_{2 n-1}+a_{2 n}right) leqslant nwe may find two numbers a_{i}, a_{i+1} such that a_{i}+a_{i+1} leqslant 1.

By the induction hypothesis, a suitable partition exists for the d-1 numbers a_{1}, ldots, a_{i-1}, a_{i}+a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, ldots, a_{d}. This induces a suitable partition for a_{1}, ldots, a_{d}.Solution 2. We will show that it is even possible to split the sequence a_{1}, ldots, a_{d} into 2 n-1 contiguous groups so that the sum of the numbers in each groups does not exceed 1. Consider a segment S of length n, and partition it into segments S_{1}, ldots, S_{d} of lengths a_{1}, ldots, a_{d}, respectively, as shown below. Consider a second partition of S into n equal parts by n-1 \\"empty dots\\".Assume that the n-1 empty dots are in segments S_{i_{1}}, ldots, S_{i_{n-1}}. (If a dot is on the boundary of two segments, we choose the right segment). These n-1 segments are distinct because they have length at most 1. Consider the partition:left{a_{1}, ldots, a_{i_{1}-1}right},left{a_{i_{1}}right},left{a_{i_{1}+1}, ldots, a_{i_{2}-1}right},left{a_{i_{2}}right}, ldotsleft{a_{i_{n-1}}right},left{a_{i_{n-1}+1}, ldots, a_{d}right} .In the example above, this partition is left{a_{1}, a_{2}right},left{a_{3}right},left{a_{4}, a_{5}right},left{a_{6}right}, varnothing,left{a_{7}right},left{a_{8}, a_{9}, a_{10}right}. We claim that in this partition, the sum of the numbers in this group is at most 1 .For the sets left{a_{i_{t}}right} this is obvious since a_{i_{t}} leqslant 1. For the sets left{a_{i_{t}}+1, ldots, a_{i_{t+1}-1}right} this follows from the fact that the corresponding segments lie between two neighboring empty dots, or between an endpoint of S and its nearest empty dot. Therefore the sum of their lengths cannot exceed 1 .Solution 3. First put all numbers greater than frac{1}{2} in their own groups. Then, form the remaining groups as follows: For each group, add new a_{i} mathrm{~s} one at a time until their sum exceeds frac{1}{2}. Since the last summand is at most frac{1}{2}, this group has sum at most 1 . Continue this procedure until we have used all the a_{i} mathrm{~s}. Notice that the last group may have sum less than frac{1}{2}. If the sum of the numbers in the last two groups is less than or equal to 1 , we merge them into one group. In the end we are left with m groups. If m=1 we are done. Otherwise the first m-2 have sums greater than frac{1}{2} and the last two have total sum greater than 1 . Therefore n>(m-2) / 2+1 so m leqslant 2 n-1 as desired.Comment 1. The original proposal asked for the minimal value of k when n=2.Comment 2. More generally, one may ask the same question for real numbers between 0 and 1 whose sum is a real number r. In this case the smallest value of k is k=lceil 2 rrceil-1, as Solution 3 shows.Solutions 1 and 2 lead to the slightly weaker bound k leqslant 2lceil rrceil-1. This is actually the optimal bound for partitions into consecutive groups, which are the ones contemplated in these two solutions. To see this, assume that r is not an integer and let c=(r+1-lceil rrceil) /(1+lceil rrceil). One easily checks that 0<c<frac{1}{2} and lceil rrceil(2 c)+(lceil rrceil-1)(1-c)=r, so the sequence2 c, 1-c, 2 c, 1-c, ldots, 1-c, 2 cof 2lceil rrceil-1 numbers satisfies the given conditions. For this sequence, the only suitable partition into consecutive groups is the trivial partition, which requires 2lceil rrceil-1 groups."},{"problem":"13.206.

Since there are at most 13 matches in total, we have 1 leqslant i_{1}<i_{2}<cdots<i_{7} leqslant 13.

It turned out that no two deputies that were in the same fraction before the vacation entered the same fraction after the vacation. Find the smallest possible number of independent deputies after the vacation.","solution":"1. Initial Setup:   The problem states that there are 10 fractions, each with a unique number of members, and each fraction has at least 5 members. Therefore, the smallest possible sizes for these fractions are (5, 6, 7, ldots, 14).2. Total Number of Deputies:   Calculate the total number of deputies initially:   [   5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 = sum_{i=5}^{14} i   ]   Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:   [   sum_{i=5}^{14} i = frac{n}{2} times (text{first term} + text{last term})   ]   where (n = 10) (the number of terms):   [   sum_{i=5}^{14} i = frac{10}{2} times (5 + 14) = 5 times 19 = 95   ]   So, there are 95 deputies in total.3. Formation of New Fractions:   After the vacation, no two deputies from the same initial fraction can be in the same new fraction. Therefore, each new fraction can have at most one deputy from each of the original fractions.4. Maximum Number of Deputies in New Fractions:   Since there are 10 original fractions, each new fraction can have at most 10 deputies (one from each original fraction). To maximize the number of deputies in new fractions, we need to form as many new fractions as possible, each with 10 deputies.5. Calculation of Deputies in New Fractions:   The maximum number of deputies that can be in new fractions is:   [   10 times 10 = 100   ]   However, this exceeds the total number of deputies (95), so we need to adjust our approach.6. Optimal Distribution:   To find the optimal distribution, consider the following:   - We can form new fractions with sizes ranging from 5 to 10 (since each new fraction can have at most one deputy from each of the original fractions).   - For each (5 leq i leq 10), create a new fraction consisting of exactly one deputy from the original fractions with sizes (15-i, 16-i, ldots, 14) respectively.7. Number of Independent Deputies:   Calculate the number of deputies in new fractions:   [   5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 45   ]   Therefore, the number of independent deputies is:   [   95 - 45 = 50   ]8. Verification:   Verify that this is the smallest possible number of independent deputies:   - Since each new fraction can have at most 10 deputies, the maximum number of deputies in new fractions is 45.   - This leaves 50 deputies who must be independent.Thus, the smallest possible number of independent deputies after the vacation is (boxed{50})."},{"problem":"11.2.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the number of pairs ((A, B)) of subsets of a set (M) with (n) elements such that (A subseteq B).2.

The element is in (B) but not in (A).     3. The element is in both (A) and (B).   - Therefore, for each element, there are 3 choices, and since there are (n) elements, the total number of pairs ((A, B)) is (3^n).3. Second Solution (s2):   - Consider the set (M) with (n) elements.   - For any pair ((A, B)) for (n), it can be mapped to three pairs:     1. ((A, B))     2. ((A, B cup {n+1}))     3.

Note that since a quarter of the dolls have four braids, the total number of ribbons used on them is the same as the total number of dolls. Half of the dolls have one braid, so the number of ribbons used on them is half the total number of dolls. And a quarter of the dolls have two braids, so the number of ribbons used on them is also half the total number of dolls.This means that the number of ribbons is twice the number of dolls.

The factorization of the number 56700000 is 56700000=2^{5} cdot 3^{4} cdot 5^{5} cdot 7; thus, the problem reduces to determining how many numbers less than 56700000 are not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7.Let's list all numbers from 1 to 56700000. We will strike out all numbers divisible by 2 (their number is frac{1}{2} cdot 56700000=28350000); all numbers divisible by 3 (their number is left.frac{1}{3} cdot 56700000=18900000right); all numbers divisible by 5 (their number is frac{1}{5} cdot 56700000=11340000); all numbers divisible by 7 (their number is frac{1}{7} cdot 56700000=8100000). The total number of all these numbers is 28350000+18900000+11340000+8100000==66690000.But among these 66690000 numbers, there are: frac{1}{2 cdot 3} cdot 56700000=9450000 numbers divisible by 2 and 3; frac{1}{2 cdot 5} cdot 56700000=5670000 numbers divisible by 2 and 5; frac{1}{2 cdot 7} cdot 56700000=4050000 numbers divisible by 2 and 7; frac{1}{3 cdot 5} cdot 56700000=3780000 numbers divisible by 3 and 5; frac{1}{3 cdot 7} cdot 56700000=2700000 numbers divisible by 3 and 7; frac{1}{5 cdot 7} cdot 56700000=1620000 numbers divisible by 5 and 7.All these numbers are counted twice in the sum of all numbers divisible by 2, or 3, or 5, or 7.

Now let's determine how any number divisible by three of these factors, for example, by 2, 3, and 5, is counted in this difference. This number is counted three times in the minuend (among the numbers divisible by 2, among the numbers divisible by 3, and among the numbers divisible by 5) and three times in the subtrahend (among the numbers divisible by 2 and 3, among the numbers divisible by 2 and 5, and among the numbers divisible by 3 and 5). Therefore, all numbers divisible by any three of the four factors 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not counted at all in our difference, and we must add to the difference the total number of all such numbers. The total number of these numbers (not exceeding 56700000) is obviouslybegin{aligned}& frac{1}{2 cdot 3 cdot 5} cdot 56700000+frac{1}{2 cdot 3 cdot 7} cdot 56700000+frac{1}{2 cdot 5 cdot 7} cdot 56700000+ &+frac{1}{3 cdot 5 cdot 7} cdot 56700000= &=1890000+1350000+810000+540000=4590000end{aligned}Thus, we get:66690000-27270000+4590000=44010000In the expression 66690000-27270000+4590000, all numbers divisible by one of the factors 2, 3, 5, and 7; by two of these factors; and by three of these factors are counted once. Now let's determine how numbers divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 7 are counted in this expression. They are obviously counted four times in the first term 66690000 (as divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 7); six times in the second term 27270000 (as divisible by 2 and 3; 2 and 5; 2 and 7; 3 and 5; 3 and 7; 5 and 7); and four times in the last term (as divisible by 2, 3, and 5; 2, 3, and 7; 2, 5, and 7; 3, 5, and 7). Therefore, these numbers are counted in our expression 4-6+4=2 times, and their number, equal to frac{1}{2 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot 7} cdot 56700000=270000, must be subtracted:66690000-27270000+4590000-270000=43740000.Thus, from 1 to 56700000, there are 43740000 numbers divisible by at least one of the factors 2, 3, 5, or 7. Therefore, the number of numbers not divisible by any of these factors (coprime with the number 56700000) is56700000-43740000=12960000Note.

We can consider its path as a degenerate ellipse, with the major axis being the Earth-Sun distance, the minor axis being zero, and one of its foci being the Sun. According to Kepler's Third Law, the square of the orbital period of the planets is proportional to the cube of their average distance from the Sun. Let's write down Kepler's Third Law for the Earth in two states of its orbit, using the appropriate data for the two elliptical orbits:frac{T^{2}}{T_{e}^{2}}=frac{R^{3}}{R_{e}^{3}}where the e index denotes the data corresponding to the degenerate ellipse. The major axis of the degenerate ellipse is R, so here the average Earth-Sun distance is R_{e}=R / 2.

Currently, the drama club, calligraphy club, photography club, and street dance club can each accept one more student. Exactly four students, named A and B, have come to the academic affairs department to apply for joining. According to the school regulations, each person can only join one club. What is the probability that A will join the street dance club and B will join either the calligraphy club or the photography club?A: frac{1}{4}B: frac{1}{5}C: frac{1}{6}D: frac{1}{8}","solution":"To solve this problem, we'll break down the solution into detailed steps:1. Calculate the total number of ways the 4 students can join the clubs: Since there are 4 clubs and each club can accept one more student, and we have 4 students, each student has 4 choices. This situation is a permutation of 4 distinct objects taken 4 at a time. The formula for permutations is P(n, k) = frac{n!}{(n-k)!}. Here, n=k=4, so we have P(4, 4) = frac{4!}{(4-4)!} = frac{4!}{0!} = 4! = 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24. So, there are 24 ways for the 4 students to join the clubs.2. Calculate the number of ways A joins the street dance club and B joins either the calligraphy club or the photography club:    - First, A joins the street dance club. This is a specific condition, so it doesn't add to the number of ways since A's choice is fixed.   - Second, B has the option to join either the calligraphy club or the photography club. This is a combination problem where B has 2 options (calligraphy or photography), and we are choosing 1. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}. Here, n=2 (two clubs) and k=1 (choosing one), so we have C(2, 1) = frac{2!}{1!(2-1)!} = 2.   - Third, the remaining 2 students (not A or B) can join the remaining 2 clubs in 2! = 2 times 1 = 2 ways.   - Multiplying these together, we get the total number of favorable outcomes as 1 times C(2, 1) times 2! = 1 times 2 times 2 = 4.3. Calculate the probability: The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. So, the probability that A joins the street dance club and B joins either the calligraphy club or the photography club is P = frac{4}{24} = frac{1}{6}.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{C}."},{"problem":"Let f(x)=|x-p|+|x-15|+|x-p-15|, where 0 < p < 15.

Then the line H^{prime prime} E^{prime} gives us e, h is parallel to e and passes through H^{prime}, and the right edge j is perpendicular to e and passes through the projection J_{1} of the given point J on S_{a}.With this, we have obtained two vertices of the cube's base as the intersection points J_{e} and J_{h} of j with e and h, respectively, and the direction from J_{e} to J_{h} is clearly the viewing direction.

Find all possible values of n.Ivailo Kortezov","solution":"9.4. We shall prove that n+1, n+2 and n+3 are prime powers. Assume the contrary and let some of them has the form a b, where a geq 2, b geq 2 and (a, b)=1. Since a b does not divide M, then a or b does not divide M. Let a does not divide M. Then it follows that a geq n+1, i.e. a b-a leq 2. Since a b-a=a(b-1) geq 2 for a geq 2, b geq 2, it follows that a=2, b=2, which contradicts to (a, b)=1.Therefore n+1, n+2 and n+3 are prime powers. At least one of them is even, so it has the form 2^{x}. Analogously, at least one of them is divisible by 3 , so it has the form 3^{y}. By parity arguments we conclude that2^{x}=3^{y} pm 1Case 1. Let 2^{x}=3^{y}+1. Since 2^{x} equiv 1(bmod 3) for x even and 2^{x} equiv 2(bmod 3) for x odd, we see that x=2 z, where z is a nonnegative integer, and left(2^{z}-right. 1) left(2^{z}+1right)=3^{y}. Then 2^{z}-1 and 2^{z}+1 are powers of 3 , which is possible only for z=1. Therefore 3^{y}=3,2^{x}=4, whence n=1 or n=2. These solutions are achieved for M=1 and M=2, respectively.Case 2. Let 2^{x}=3^{y}-1. We may assume that x geq 2 because for x=1 we obtain one of the above answers for n. We have 3^{y} equiv 1(bmod 4) for y even and 3^{y} equiv 3(bmod 4) for y odd. Therefore y=2 z and 2^{x}=left(3^{z}-1right)left(3^{z}+1right). Then 3^{z}-1 and 3^{z}+1 are powers of 2 which is possible only for z=1. Therefore3^{y}=9,2^{x}=8, whence n=6 or n=7. The solution n=6 is achieved, for instance, if M=60. For n=7 we obtain n+3=10, which is not a prime power.Finally, the solutions are n=1, n=2 and n=6."},{"problem":"9.

If a function is differentiable at a given point, then it is continuous at this point.From the existence of lim _{Delta x rightarrow 0} frac{Delta y}{Delta x}=f^{prime}(x), it follows that lim _{Delta x rightarrow 0} Delta y=0 (continuity), because otherwise f^{prime}(x)=infty or does not exist.2^{circ}. A function that is continuous at a given point is not necessarily differentiable at this point.For example, the function y=|x| is continuous (see Chapter V, §1), but it is not differentiable at the point x=0, since the algorithm with y_{0}=y(0)=0 leads to y^{prime}=|x|^{prime}=lim _{Delta x rightarrow 0} frac{|Delta x|}{Delta x}, and this limit does not exist (for Delta x>0 the expression under the limit sign equals 1, and for Delta x<0 it equals -1).3^{circ}. A function that is differentiable at each point of a given interval is called differentiable in this interval.

Find the value of ratio frac{|PF_1|}{|PF_2|} when angle F_1PF_2 reaches its maximum value.","solution":"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:1. Identify the foci of the ellipse:   The given ellipse is (frac{x^2}{16} + frac{y^2}{4} = 1). This is in the standard form (frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1), where (a^2 = 16) and (b^2 = 4). Thus, (a = 4) and (b = 2).   The distance from the center to each focus is given by (c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = sqrt{16 - 4} = sqrt{12} = 2sqrt{3}).   Therefore, the foci (F_1) and (F_2) are located at ((-2sqrt{3}, 0)) and ((2sqrt{3}, 0)) respectively.2. Find the coordinates of point (P) on the line:   The line equation is (x - sqrt{3}y + 8 + 2sqrt{3} = 0). We need to find a point (P) on this line such that (angle F_1PF_2) is maximized.3. Maximize (angle F_1PF_2):   The maximum value of (angle F_1PF_2) for an ellipse occurs when (P) is on the major axis of the ellipse. This is because the angle subtended by the foci at any point on the major axis is the largest possible.   The major axis of the ellipse is the x-axis. Therefore, we need to find the intersection of the line (x - sqrt{3}y + 8 + 2sqrt{3} = 0) with the x-axis (where (y = 0)).   Substituting (y = 0) into the line equation:   [   x + 8 + 2sqrt{3} = 0 implies x = -8 - 2sqrt{3}   ]   Thus, the point (P) is ((-8 - 2sqrt{3}, 0)).4.

Symmetry and Monotonicity:   Since ( f ) is monotonous, it is either non-decreasing or non-increasing. Let's assume ( f ) is non-decreasing. The same argument will hold for non-increasing functions by symmetry.3. Analyzing ( f(f(x)) = f(-f(x)) ):   [   f(f(x)) = f(-f(x))   ]   Since ( f ) is non-decreasing, ( f(x) ) must be constant on any interval where ( f ) is constant. This implies that ( f(x) ) is constant on the range of ( f ).4. Constant Function Analysis:   Suppose ( f(x) = c ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ). Then:   [   f(f(x)) = f(c) = c   ]   and   [   f(-f(x)) = f(-c) = c   ]   Therefore, ( c = c^2 ), which gives us two solutions:   [   c = 0 quad text{or} quad c = 1   ]5.

Hence, ( f(x) = 1 ) is a solution.7. Non-constant Solutions:   Suppose ( f ) is not constant. Then ( f(x) ) must take on at least two distinct values. Let ( a ) and ( b ) be such that ( f(a) = 1 ) and ( f(b) = -1 ). However, since ( f ) is monotonous and ( f(x)^2 geq 0 ), ( f(x) ) can only take values in ({0, 1}).8.

[i]Proposed by Germany, FR[/i]","solution":"To prove the given statement, we will use the concept of expected value in probability theory. Let X be the random variable representing the number of fixed points in a permutation of the set {1, 2, ldots, n}. 1. Expected Value Definition:   By definition, the expected value E[X] of the random variable X is given by:   [   E[X] = sum_{k=0}^{n} k cdot P(X = k)   ]   where P(X = k) is the probability that the permutation has exactly k fixed points.2. Probability of Fixed Points:   The probability P(X = k) can be expressed in terms of p_n(k), the number of permutations with exactly k fixed points, as follows:   [   P(X = k) = frac{p_n(k)}{n!}   ]   Therefore, the expected value E[X] can be rewritten as:   [   E[X] = sum_{k=0}^{n} k cdot frac{p_n(k)}{n!}   ]3. Simplifying the Expected Value:   Let S be the sum we are interested in:   [   S = sum_{k=0}^{n} k cdot p_n(k)   ]   Then, the expected value E[X] becomes:   [   E[X] = frac{S}{n!}   ]4. Alternative Calculation of Expected Value:   Now, consider the probability that a specific element i (where 1 leq i leq n) is a fixed point in a permutation. For any element i, the probability that it is a fixed point is frac{1}{n} because there are n positions and each position is equally likely to be the fixed point.   Since there are n elements, the expected number of fixed points is:   [   E[X] = n cdot frac{1}{n} = 1   ]5. Equating the Two Expressions for E[X]:   We have two expressions for E[X]:   [   E[X] = frac{S}{n!} quad text{and} quad E[X] = 1   ]   Equating these, we get:   [   frac{S}{n!} = 1   ]   Therefore:   [   S = n!   ]The final answer is boxed{n!}"},{"problem":"In a first-year class of a certain school, there are 1200 students.

Let's break down the calculations step by step.First, let's calculate the minimum number of students participating in both activities. According to the problem, the minimum percentage of students choosing one activity is 60%, and for the other activity, it's 50%. Since each student must choose at least one activity, the minimum overlap (students participating in both activities) can be calculated by adding these percentages and subtracting 100% (since no student can be counted more than once in the total):[1200 times (60% + 50% - 100%) = 1200 times (110% - 100%) = 1200 times 10% = 1200 times 0.1 = 120]Next, let's calculate the maximum number of students participating in both activities. The maximum percentage of students choosing one activity is 65%, and for the other activity, it's 55%. Using the same logic as before, we calculate the maximum overlap by adding these percentages and subtracting 100%:[1200 times (65% + 55% - 100%) = 1200 times (120% - 100%) = 1200 times 20% = 1200 times 0.2 = 240]Therefore, the number of students participating in both activities must be in the range of 120 to 240 students.

Find the minimum number of good permutations. (2002","solution":"Analysis and Solution: Consider the worst-case scenario: for k=1,2, cdots, n, b_{1}+b_{2}+cdots+b_{k}>0 is difficult to satisfy. This only requires that the number of negative numbers in a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n} is as many as possible. Let a_{2}, cdots, a_{n} all be negative, and a_{1}=-a_{2}-cdots-a_{n}+1. At this point, any good permutation left(b_{1}, b_{2}, cdots, b_{n}right) must have b_{1}=a_{1}, and b_{2}, cdots, b_{n} can be any permutation of a_{2}, cdots, a_{n}. Therefore, there are (n-1)! good permutations in this case.Next, we prove that there are at least (n-1)! good permutations. Note that (n-1)! is the number of different circular permutations of a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n}. We first prove that each circular permutation corresponds to a good permutation. For convenience, we call the first term of a good permutation a good number. We only need to prove that each circular permutation must contain a good number.Method 1: Induction on n. When n=1, the conclusion is obviously true. Assume that for all n, the conclusion holds. For n+1, since the sum of all numbers is positive, there is at least one positive number. Group each positive number and the next positive number in the clockwise direction, along with all the numbers between them, into one group. Each group has at least one number, and at least one group has at least two numbers (since not all numbers are positive), so there are at most k-1 groups. Summing the numbers in each group, we get fewer than k sums. Write these sums in the order of their groups on the circle. Since the total sum of these sums is positive, by the induction hypothesis, there is a sum that is a good number. Consider the positive number in the group corresponding to this sum; this number is a good number in the entire circular permutation. By the principle of induction, the conclusion holds.Method 2: Using the extremal principle. For any circular permutation left(b_{1}, b_{2}, cdots, b_{n}right), consider all partial sums starting with b_{i}: b_{i}+b_{i+1}+cdots+b_{i+t}, where indices greater than n are taken modulo n. For all i=1,2, cdots, n and all t=0,1,2, cdots, n-1, there must be a smallest partial sum b_{i}+b_{i+1}+cdots+b_{i+c}. Since there is at least one non-positive number, b_{i}+b_{i+1}+cdots+b_{i+t} leqslant 0. Among all such smallest sums, let the one with the largest number of terms t+1 be b_{i}+b_{i+1}+cdots+b_{i+t}. We prove that b_{i+t+1} is a good number.Indeed, if there exists a positive integer k such that b_{i+t+1}+b_{i+t+2}+cdots+b_{i+t+k} leqslant 0, then left(b_{i}+b_{i+1}+cdots+b_{i+t}right)+left(b_{i+t+1}+b_{i+t+2}+cdots+b_{i+t+k}right) leqslant b_{i}+b_{i+1}+cdots+b_{i+t}, which contradicts the fact that b_{i}+b_{i+1}+cdots+b_{i+t} is the smallest and has the most terms.Since there are (n-1)! circular permutations, and each circular permutation corresponds to at least one good permutation, and different circular permutations correspond to different good permutations, there are at least (n-1)! good permutations.In conclusion, the minimum value is (n-1)!."},{"problem":"If 3^{2x} = 6 cdot 2^{2x} - 5 cdot 6^x, then ( )A: 2^x > 3^xB: 2^x  3^x or 2^x < 3^xD: None of the above","solution":"Rearranging the equation, we get:3^{2x} + 5 cdot 6^x - 6 cdot 2^{2x} = 0,which can be factored as:(3^x - 2^x)(3^x + 6 cdot 2^x) = 0.Therefore, we have 3^x = 2^x or 3^x = -6 cdot 2^x.Since (3^x + 6 cdot 2^x) neq 0,we conclude that 3^x = 2^x.Hence, the correct choice is boxed{text{D}}."},{"problem":"The parabola y=x^{2}-2x+3 is shifted 2 units to the right and then 3 units up.

If such operations did not occur, we will say that this phase consists of zero operations. Everything starts with the zero phase.During one phase, no number can increase by more than 4. Indeed, if we increased the number itself, then neither to it nor to its neighbors can our operation be applied during this phase, neither before nor after, since a number increased by one in some phase cannot be the minimum during the same phase. Among the neighbors of a number, no more than 4 non-adjacent ones can be chosen, so indeed, we can increase a number by no more than 4 in one phase.Consider the first, fourth, and seventh cells in the first, fourth, and seventh rows of the table, a total of 9 cells. Note that no operation affects two of them. Therefore, to change n phases, at least 9n operations are needed. (Important! We cannot claim that one phase lasts at least 9 operations, as some of our numbers could have been increased in previous phases.)Thus, no more than 10 phases have passed, and in each, no number could have increased by more than 4.

The essence of this principle lies in the strict adherence to the equivalence of all transformations performed when solving equations and inequalities of any type. This principle allows for uniformity and logic in solving tasks of each section, without being distracted by labor-intensive work with cumbersome domains of definition and other, often excessive, restrictions on variables.However, in many traditional formulas, the domains of definition of the left and right parts do not coincide. Therefore, such formulas are presented here in the form of transformations that preserve equivalence (within the corresponding formula). In this case, identical transitions are marked with the symbol Leftrightarrow.## I.

Application of de Bruijn-Tengbergen-Kruyswijk Theorem:   According to the de Bruijn-Tengbergen-Kruyswijk theorem, the largest antichain in the poset ( S ) is given by the set of triplets ((x, y, z)) such that ( x + y + z = leftlfloor frac{3(n-1)}{2} rightrfloor ) or ( x + y + z = leftlceil frac{3(n-1)}{2} rightrceil ).4.

Squaring both sides, we get (1-x^2)(1-y^2) = [(x-1)(y-1)]^2. Cancelling factors, (1+x)(1+y) = (1-x)(1-y).Notice here that we cancelled out one factor of (x-1) and (y-1), which implies that (x-1) and (y-1) were not 0. If indeed they were 0 though, we would havecos(3A)-1=0, cos(3A)=1For this we could say that A must be 120 degrees for this to work. This is one case. The B case follows in the same way, where B must be equal to 120 degrees. This doesn't change the overall solution though, as then the other angles are irrelevant (this is the largest angle, implying that this will have the longest side and so we would want to have the 120 degreee angle opposite of the unknown side).Expanding, 1+x+y+xy=1-x-y+xyrightarrow x+y=-x-y.

Given the standard solution's assertion, let's correct the approach based on the intended outcome:The correct interpretation should be based on the principle that if the direction vector of a line is parallel to the normal vector of a plane, then the line is perpendicular to the plane. This is because the normal vector defines the direction perpendicular to the plane, and if a line's direction aligns with this, it implies perpendicularity.Given the standard solution's conclusion, despite the calculation error in my detailed step, the correct relationship based on the provided solution is that the line l is perpendicular to the plane alpha.Therefore, the correct answer is:[boxed{A}]"},{"problem":"12.121 Given that a, b, c, d are pairwise distinct positive integers, and satisfy a+b= c d, a b=c+d.

Part 2: Finding the Value of m for f(x) to be OddFor f(x) to be odd, we have f(-x) + f(x) = 0 for all x in the domain. Substituting f(x) gives:1. log_{2}frac{-x-m}{-x+1} + log_{2}frac{x-m}{x+1} = 0.2. Using the property of logarithms, this is equivalent to log_{2}left[(frac{-x-m}{-x+1})(frac{x-m}{x+1})right] = 0.3. Which simplifies to (frac{-x-m}{-x+1})(frac{x-m}{x+1}) = 1.4. Solving this, we find that m^2 = 1, giving m = pm 1.Analyzing each value of m:- When m = -1, f(x) = log_{2}frac{x+1}{x+1} = log_{2}1 = 0, but this is constant and not odd.- When m = 1, f(x) = log_{2}frac{x-1}{x+1}, which is an odd function.Therefore, the value of m for f(x) to be an odd function is boxed{m=1}."},{"problem":"10.

Let O be any tetrahedron contained in H. Its interior is the intersection of four open half-spaces determined by the planes of the faces. The center of the sphere K does not belong to the interior of the tetrahedron; hence it does not belong to at least one of these half-spaces. Therefore, there is a face S of the tetrahedron Q such that the opposite vertex of the tetrahedron and the center of the sphere K lie on opposite sides of the plane of this face (or, in the limiting case, the center of the sphere lies on this plane).Thus, Q is contained in the smaller of the two parts (or in one of the two equal parts) into which the plane of the face S divides the sphere K. Therefore, the height of the tetrahedron Q dropped onto the face S has a length not greater than 1, so the volume of Q does not exceed one third of the area of this face. The area of the face S, being a triangle, is not greater than the area of an equilateral triangle inscribed in the circle which is the section of the sphere K by the plane of this face (see Note); and even more so, it is not greater than the area of an equilateral triangle inscribed in the great circle E. The latter area equals 3sqrt{3}/4. Therefore, the volume of Q is less than or equal to sqrt{3}/4.In all the estimates mentioned, we can achieve equality by taking O to be a tetrahedron whose base is an equilateral triangle inscribed in E, and the fourth vertex is placed at the farthest point from E on the hemisphere H (at the \\"north pole\\").The number sqrt{3}/4 is the sought maximum.Note: For completeness, we will provide an elementary proof of the fact that among all triangles inscribed in a fixed circle of radius r, the one with the largest area is the equilateral triangle.Let ABC be any such triangle. By placing point C at the midpoint of the larger of the two arcs into which points A and B divide the circle circumscribed around triangle ABC, we obtain an isosceles triangle ABC, acute or right, with an area not less than that of triangle ABC. Therefore, in searching for a triangle with the maximum area (inscribed in a given circle), we can limit our attention to the class of isosceles triangles without obtuse angles (inscribed in this circle).If now ABC is a triangle from this class (|AC| = |BC|), then denoting by x the distance from side AB to the center of the circle, we get the relationships: |AB| = 2sqrt{r^2 - x^2}, h_C = r + x (the height dropped from vertex C), and thusWe have used here the inequality between the geometric mean and the arithmetic mean of four numbers: a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = r + x, a_4 = 3r - 3x.

If ( n ) has the form:   [   n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_k^{e_k}   ]   then the number of divisors ( d(n) ) is given by:   [   d(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) cdots (e_k + 1)   ]   We need ( d(n) = 2019 ).2. Factorizing 2019:   We factorize 2019:   [   2019 = 3 times 673   ]   This suggests two possible forms for ( n ):   - ( n = p^{2018} )   - ( n = p^{672} q^2 )3. Case 1: ( n = p^{2018} ):   - For ( n = p^{2018} ), we need ( n < 128^{97} ).   - Note that ( 128 = 2^7 ), so:     [     128^{97} = (2^7)^{97} = 2^{679}     ]   - Clearly, ( 2^{2018} > 2^{679} ), so there are no solutions in this case.4.

If z=infty is a removable singularity of the function f(z), then the Laurent series expansion of f(z) in the neighborhood of this point does not contain positive powers of z; if z=infty is a pole, then this expansion contains a finite number of positive powers of z; in the case of an essential singularity - an infinite number of positive powers of z.The Laurent series expansion of the function f(z) in the neighborhood of the point at infinity is called the Laurent series expansion of f(z) that converges everywhere outside a circle of sufficiently large radius R centered at the point z=0 (except, perhaps, the point z=infty itself).Let the function f(z) be analytic in some neighborhood of the point z=infty (except, perhaps, the point z=infty itself).The residue of the function f(z) at infinity is defined asoperatorname{res} f(infty)=frac{1}{2 pi i} int_{gamma^{-}} f(z) d zwhere gamma^{-} is a sufficiently large circle |z|=rho, traversed clockwise (so that the neighborhood of the point z=infty remains on the left, as in the case of a finite point z=a).From this definition, it follows that the residue of the function at infinity is equal to the coefficient of z^{-1} in the Laurent series expansion of f(z) in the neighborhood of z=infty, taken with the opposite sign:operatorname{res} f(infty)=-c_{-1}"},{"problem":"3.

Thus, our function simplifies to:g(x) = ax^2 + bx.Now let's use the conditions provided. When x = 1, g(1) = a(1)^2 + b(1) = a + b, and we are given that g(1) = 1.

Evaluating the polynomial at specific points: Evaluate ( P(x,y,z) ) at ( (x,y,z) = (n, n+m, n+2m) ):   [   P(n, n+m, n+2m) = (n - (n+m))^2 + ((n+m) - (n+2m))^2 = (-m)^2 + (-m)^2 = m^2 + m^2 = 2m^2   ]   This shows that ( 2m^2 ) is always divisible by ( m^2 ), implying ( r leq 2 ).4. Generalizing the result: To show that ( m^2 ) always divides ( P(n, n+m, n+2m) ) for any polynomial ( P(x,y,z) ) satisfying the given condition, consider the polynomial ( Q(t) = P(n, n+t, n+2t) ) for any fixed ( n ).5. Properties of ( Q(t) ): The polynomial ( Q(t) ) has exactly one root at ( t = 0 ) because ( P(n, n, n) = 0 ). Since ( P(a,b,c) = 0 Leftrightarrow a = b = c ), ( t = 0 ) is the only root of ( Q(t) ).6. Multiplicity of the root: Since ( Q(t) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients and ( t = 0 ) is its only root, the root must have a multiplicity of at least 2. This is because if the root had a multiplicity of 1, ( Q(t) ) would change sign around ( t = 0 ), contradicting the condition that ( P(a,b,c) = 0 Leftrightarrow a = b = c ).7. Divisibility by ( t^2 ): Therefore, ( t^2 ) divides ( Q(t) ), implying ( m^2 ) divides ( Q(m) = P(n, n+m, n+2m) ).8.

A constant is a value that does not change. The information provided in the table is as follows:- Amount: 116.64- Unit Price: 18- Unit Price / yuan / liter: 6.48To determine the constant, we need to understand the relationship between these values. The amount is the total cost of the fuel purchased, which varies depending on how much fuel is pumped. The unit price is the cost per unit of fuel, which in this case is given in yuan per liter. This price does not change regardless of how much fuel is pumped, making it a fixed value in this context. The unit price per yuan per liter is simply a more detailed specification of the unit price, indicating the currency and measurement unit, but it is essentially the same value as the unit price.Given this information, we can conclude that the constant in this situation is the unit price, as it remains unchanged regardless of the quantity of fuel pumped.

Let's color the cells in a checkerboard pattern: let the corner and central cells be black, and the rest white. From the condition, it follows that cells of different colors contain numbers of different parity.

Therefore, h(x) is a linear combination of f_1(x) and f_2(x).② Suppose a(x^2 - x) + b(x^2 + x + 1) = x^2 - x + 1, which simplifies to (a+b)x^2 + (-a + b)x + b = x^2 - x + 1.We can set up the following system:begin{cases}  a + b = 1   -a + b = -1   b = 1end{cases}However, this system of equations has no solution. Therefore, h(x) is not a linear combination of f_1(x) and f_2(x).(II) The linear combination h(x) can be found by substituting the given values: h(x) = 2f_1(x) + f_2(x) = 2log_2 x + log_{frac{1}{2}} x = log_2 x because using the properties of logarithms (log_b a = -log_{b^{-1}} a).If the inequality 3h^2(x) + 2h(x) + t < 0 has solutions for x in [2, 4], we need to find the maximum value of -3h^2(x) - 2h(x) in this interval to get an upper bound for t.Let s = log_2 x, so when x in [2, 4], we have s in [1, 2].We are then looking to maximize the function y = -3s^2 - 2s = -3(s + frac{1}{3})^2 + frac{1}{3}. Completing the square, we see that the maximum value y_{max} occurs when s = -frac{1}{3}, which is not in the interval [1, 2]. Therefore, the maximum value in our domain occurs at one of the endpoints s = 1 or s = 2. We calculate the values at these points:At s = 1: y = -3(1)^2 - 2(1) = -5.At s = 2: y = -3(2)^2 - 2(2) = -16.Since we want the inequality 3h^2(x) + 2h(x) + t < 0 to hold, the maximum value of t is less than -5 (since -5 is the larger of the two calculated values), thus t < -5.boxed{t < -5}"},{"problem":"For the k-th bit element, binary code is commonly used in communication.
