If the lump is very hard the lump occur probably due to salivary gland duct blockage (sa you also mention ) , it could be sialolith means blockage due to stone .If the consistency of the lump is rubbery the it needs proper medical evaluation  as it can be malignancy .So i would suggest you to consult oral surgeon for this , who may order biopsy . Silolith is a harmless condition , but if it bothers you or get infected doctor can remove salivary gland .As far as your lip is concern the patch and bump occur due to continue irritation because of smoking habit . Basically it is a canker sore which occur due to irritation .I would suggest you to quit smoking , apply lip balm , give col compresses and apply raw honey before going to bed .If it continue to persist for more the a week the consult oral surgeon .Hope your concern has been resolved.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"Hi - My daughter seems to have a lump on her spine in the middle of her back.

We eat a heart healthy diet - no red meat, no fried foods, limit sugar and salt. His kidney function is fine and he is not diabetic.

I have a lump that is swollen right below my left ear. I also have one right bellow my cheek bone. Thy are both very painful and have caused the left side of my face to swell. I have kept ice on it to help the swelling go down but nothings working. I just want to know whats going on and what to do?","Doctor":"Hi Dear,Welcome to HCM.Understanding your concern.As per your query lump below ear and cheek bone is post-articular lump which is very painful in nature. It could be due to an infected sebaceous cyst or some other cysts like lymphatic cysts and could be due to swollen lymph nodes due to ENT infection and chronic throat infection. Another possible reason is blockage of ducts of salivary gland which is causing saliva obstruction and pain and swelling.I would suggest you to go for an FNAC( fine needle aspiration cytology) and ultrasound of the lump for confirmation. Visit ENT specialist once and check if swelling can be relieved by digital pressure manipulation. Sucking on lime and citrus substances can stimulate salivary secretion. Surgical intervention is recommended only after proper diagnosis.Take oral antibiotics and anti inflammatory medicines as these will help in pain and swelling reduction.Hope your concern has been resolved.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"i have a lump under the skin of my index finger of the back side of my left hand, it is a black-eye pea size, no pain, movable,and a light purple color under the skin, i had noticed for months, what is that?

Increased proclactin levels that are caused by a tumor as you are reffering to, is called prolactinoma.  You are concerned whether surgery is the only option you are left with. For your information, We have two treatment modalities for this disease, Medical and surgical. In Medical treatment we give oral medications that decrease the production of prolactin, so eliminates the symptoms. It can also shrink the tumor. So in large number of patients’ only medications treat their disease. However, long-term treatment with medications is generally necessary. Side effects of these medications include nausea and vomiting, nasal stuffiness, headache, and drowsiness. If medication shrinks the tumor significantly and your prolactin level remains normal for two years, you may be able to taper off the medication with your doctor's guidance. However, recurrence is common. Don't stop taking your medication without your doctor's approval.       Surgical therapy is only reserved for patients for whom medications does not work or they are unable to deal with the side effects. Surgery removes the tumor and thus also relieves pressure on the nerves that control our vision. They are two surgical operations available Trans-sphenoidal surgery and Trans-cranial surgery depending on the size and extent of the  tumor.I hope my answer will help you.

It appears to be lymph node enlargement of the sub-mantle group which drains the lymphatics of the oral cavity. It appears to be some kind of infection going on in this region. Initially It is treated with empirical antibiotic therapy, if it does not respond to it then I think you need to give it some more time as the lymph nodes enlargement was because of infection, it will take some time even after the primary infection is settled.

I weightlift, etc etc etc.However, my peers who are in good (but not as great) of shape have heart rates in the 60s and 50s. This doesn't make any sense to me. Is heart rate REALLY a good measure of cardiac fitness? Should I check something?Also, I'm very skinny (150 pounds, 5'9 or 5'10).","Doctor":"Hello,Heart rate is not solely determined by cardiac fitness. Due to endurance training as you describe there is a gradual rise in a vagal tone which brings the heart rate in 60 range. However, it's determined by what was your baseline heart rate. Maybe before training your heart rate used to be in 80 s and so now it has dropped to the early 70 s. So that is a substantial drop for you.Importantly Ritalin is a CNS stimulant and can sure push your heart rate high. The bottom line, heart rate is not a specific marker for cardiac fitness and should never be seen alone without the overall picture.  Hope I have answered your query.

If I were your doctor, I would clinically examine both your breasts for any abnormality there, and after being  certain about the inflammatory cause, would advise you a course of broad spectrum antiobiotic and an anti inflammatory drug along with a proton pump inhibitor for symptomatic relief, which could also be a cure for the condition.

Further management would depend on the report of investigations.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

But encouraging thing is that it is fully curable and you will be fine in few days time if you follow my advice.       You are had an abscess in the arm, which is now ruptured with pus draining out so the pain as well as size will reduce. That pus needs to be sent for culture sensitivity, to know about the organisms involved and appropriate antibiotics to which it will respond.       If such patient walk in my clinic, I plan for local treatment of the wound under local anaesthesia. All the pus is drained and any dead tissue removed, so that focus of infection is eliminated. This process is repeated on daily basis for approximately 5 days. Second empirical systemic antibiotic cover eg (amoxillin&clavulanate) is started till the culture sensitivity report is not available. Analgesic eg Paracetamol is needed for pain control.

It appears that you are having Grade II or III hemorrhoids as you said a lump is coming out of anus. If it reduces back on its own then its Grade II and if it needs to be pushed back then its Grade III. There are four degrees of hemorrhoids, first two are treated conservatively mostly with injection sclerotherapy while grade 3 and 4 needs operations. You need a review by general surgeon.

However maybe the necessity of steroids would have present to treat your condition and hence your doctor must have weighted the risk benefit .

Till than specific medication to treat hypertension.  Ace inhibitors plus diuretic ( However many diuretic can increase uric acid, so selext accordingly ) combination would be best for her .Uric acid is already withen range and so continue the same medication.

This could be diagnoised only on physical examination and clinical assessment, and so I would suggest you to consult a dermatologist in your area for this symptom of yours.

The weird thing is my new GI did the colonoscopy and told me that he didnt see any diverticulitis  as he brushed me off and said its a spastic colon. Which I also knew I had along with the diverticulitis and peptic ulcers occassionally. But I'm scared right now because I am feeling this large hard limp in my lower left side that is causing me to cry in pain and is producing watery diaherra still 2 days after having this colonoscopy. What should I do seriously? And yes colon cancers run in my family and have taken two of my close blood relatives. 5yrs of pain is long enough and now with a large lump I just want to get to the bottom of it.","Doctor":"Current ratingGeneral Surgeon, Dr. Mukund Savaskar's ResponseHi,Good Early Morning.This is Dr.Savaskar from India,attending your query to my online HCM Clinic.-I studied your query in depth and Understood your health concerns.-Accordingly on the facts given by you-Treatment and Causes I would suggest is as follows-a-I think you are a case of-IBS with diarrhoea.b-AS your main fear is of Cancer of the Colon-as it has caused 2 deaths of your blood relatives,I would advise-Yearly Colonscopy which would detect the Colonic growths at the EARLIEST -which then could be treated effectively by the GI doctors.c-The hard painful lump in your left lower abdome is-of SPASTIC COLON-with IBS and need not worry for it as a CANCER COLON- as your recent colonoscopy is NORMAL for Cancer.d-I would advise to consult second opinion from the GI doctor,which would releive your of your worry.Hope this would help you on your impending doctors visit and would make you easy to plan treatment with your doctor.Hope this would help you with the relief you needed.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. You did not mention about your gender.Developing such lumps in case of a male person in this age group happens not infrequently, and is due to hormonal changes in this age. These usually subside by themselves excepting in a few in which case you might have to consult a plastic surgeon if disturbing both physically and mentally. In case of females also, this might be due to some hormonal changes, and this would need a clinical assessement . If clinical assessement was inconclusive, then one could go for FNAC (fine needle asapiration cytology) to have a cytological diagnosis and then proceed furhter. I would advise you to be calm and not to get nervous, as your apprehension might not be ture most of the times in this age group. However, you must consult/visit your doctor for regular follow up as per his advice.Till then, you could go for an anti inflammatoyr drug along with a proton pump inhibitor drug for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

A walked around hunched over for the next few day and I was in a lot of pain. Once the pain went away and I could actually touch that area I noticed I had a lump on the inner crease of my right leg. 1 doctor thought it was a hernia, the second doctor didn t think it was a hernia but thought I had broken my pelvis. X-rays showed nothing so what is this lump?","Doctor":"Hi. it is unlikely to be a hernia. it is most likely a muscle rupture or a intra muscular hematoma. A blood clot that is the commonest thing to happen in a scenario of trauma. If you do not have trouble in walking or passing urine and the lump does not increase in size at different times of day like straining or coughing then you need not worry. You will need anti inflammatory medicines like Tab Combiflam or Ibuprofen for a week on full stomach and application of crepe bandage over the swelling. If the doubt persists then an MRI of the thigh can be done. Do not worry.Do let us know if we can guide you further.Take care.

Lump at rectum that bleeds painlessly and there is history of straining in the past, is probably hemorrhoids. There are four degrees of haemorrhoids, first two are treated conservatively and with injection sclerotherapy while grade 3 and 4 needs operative management. In your case it appears to be grade 2 or 3, and needs a review by general surgeon. Who after performing Digital rectal examination and proctoscopy will assess the grades of the disease and will then guide you about further course of treament.      Haemorrhoids are common conditions and easily treatable. Newer techniques like Haemorrhoidal artery ligation operation (HALO), have much better results with shorter hospital stay and early return to active life.I hope my answer will help you.

I visited my GP today who diagnosed stones in my salivary glands. The GP prescribed co-amoxiclav. He did not look in my mouth at all. Why did he prescribe antibiotics when as I understand it there is no infection there?","Doctor":"Hi Dear,Welcome to HCM.Understanding your concern.As per your query painful lump on jaw which is movable along with neck pain is because of salivary gland stones, which cause obstruction of normal flow of saliva and leads to its accumulation and swelling and pain. Doctor did not look into your mouth because its not oral cavity or teeth  related as then swelling will be hard and immovable. Antibiotics  are given because if there is any infection due to stones it will not further spread and get healed then and there. I would suggest you not to worry about anything. For small stones, stimulating saliva flow by sucking on a lemon or sour candies can cause the stone to pass spontaneously. Dentist can remove small stone by massage or by push out the stone from duct.For larger stone you need to visit dentist and get it excised as small incision will remove the stone. Sialendoscopy is recent treatment to remove salivary stones.Hope your concern has been resolved.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am a 30 year old male. 6 2 and about 235lbs I have about three spots on my right side that feel tender like a bruise.

Woke up laying on the concrete with a big lump on my right head and lower back pain. And some how hit my left elbow bruised and the bone is really sore and still have a lil lump on my head that still hurts.","Doctor":"Welcome to healthcare magicI am Dr Fahim and I will help you with your problem      I have gone through your question. What I comprehend is, when you lifted the scaffold, you developed intense back pain because of back muscle spasm which lead to fainting. The head lump is because of impact on  concrete floor. This head lump needs some investigation if you are experiencing vomiting, ear, nose and throat bleed or clear fluid discharge. Loosing conscience after back pain is a rare thing. If you still remain drowsy and any of the above symptoms persists then CT Scan Brain with bone window might be needed to rule out any intracranial pathologies.

I get blotted, noxious after drinking only one glass of white wine. Although I do not drink much, I ve had a couple episodes of atrial fibrillation in the past 2 to 3 years. These episodes were serious enough for me to be kept in the ICU of the hospitals I went to. Both lasted for 48 hours+ followed by a couple of days of watch time. Ever since the second episodes, I was prescribed to take Rytmonorm 150 coupled with Coraspin 300 to avoid any blood clots. After 2 years on the treatment, I ve hoped that my heart would be clear of the problem and tried to get off of the medicine. Within 24 hours, my heart started to beat erratically, enough so that I immediately reached for the pills... Along with my heart beating awkwardly, I ve noticed an almost instant pain in my head coupled with a slight but persistent confusion... I have repeatedly told about the combination of effects to a few doctors only to be dismissed at once as there doesn t seem to be any correlation with the heart/brain (as per the doc s opinions)... I have gotten a check-up with my cardiologist a couple of weeks ago and he recommends that I stay on the medication (one of my valve (top?) is 4cm wide whereas it should be at maximum 3.8cm (from memory, and I can t remember what was what exactly). Also, there was another measure from the ECG of 450ms or such between beat... Where it should stay under 450 or 430... Again, I do not recall the exact lingo... My question is simple. Are there any known adverse effect to taking a medication such as Rytmonorm, does it affect the initial problem (atrial fibrillation)? Is there any way to remedy the problem without resorting to ablation (which has a low success rate) or cut through the electrical system (old style)... I really would like to get off the medication. Thank you for your time and feedback on this case. Best Regards, Frederic","Doctor":"Hi thereFirst of all I would like to advise you to stop drinking alcohol as its triggerING events in your case.Ablation has a very good success rate to cure AF.Radio frequency Ablation is the only other way of treatment if you don't wanna take medicine.I wish you good health"},{"Patient":"My husband is 45, very healthy (5' 11\\", appx 160 lbs), has recently (the last 2 months) developed hives and facial edema in response to high stress.

It is palatal torus, which is a normal overgrowth of bone on the roof of mouth. Sometimes food or toothbrush can scrap the tender tissue stretching over the torus causing pain.If it is very near to tooth and gingival recession is there then it could be due to calculus deposits in and around tooth of that area.Need not to worry. It is a self correcting pathology if it is palatal torus and will attain normal shape soon. If it is really troubling you then removal is the best treatment option in that case. Upper denture is also made to cover this torus area to prevent irritation and ulceration on it again and again.Visit dentist once and get it examined properly. If it is calculus related proper cleaning and scaling is required in that area. Antimicrobial mouth wash is required on daily basis.
