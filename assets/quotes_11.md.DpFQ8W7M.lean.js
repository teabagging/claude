Similarly, since there are 100 respondents in total and 30 are not willing to participate (100 - 70 = 30), and 18 of these are female, it follows that the remaining 40 - 18 = 22 females are willing to participate.

Considering possible values of (k):   - If (k) is prime, then (m) and (n) would be of the form (p^{k-1}) and (q^{k-1}) respectively. This would imply that (pq) divides (m circ n - 1). However, (pq) must divide 496, and the only prime factorization of 496 is (2^4 times 31), which does not fit our requirements.   - Therefore, (k) cannot be prime.5. Checking (k = 4):   - If (k = 4), then (m) and (n) have 4 divisors each. This implies (m) and (n) are either of the form (p^3) or (pq) where (p) and (q) are distinct primes.   - For (k = 4), we have:     [     m circ n = (1 + n_2m_2 + n_3m_3 + n_4m_4)     ]     - Trying different combinations leads to contradictions, so (k neq 4).6. Checking (k = 6):   - If (k = 6), then (m) and (n) have 6 divisors each. This implies (m) and (n) are of the form (p^5), (p^2q), or (pqr) where (p, q, r) are distinct primes.   - For (k = 6), we have:     [     m circ n = 1 + n_2m_2 + n_3m_3 + n_4m_4 + n_5m_5 + n_6m_6 = 497     ]7. Testing specific values:   - For (n = 12):     [     1 + 2m_2 + 3m_3 + 4m_4 + 6m_5 + 12m_6 = 497     ]     - This leads to contradictions as shown in the initial solution.   - For (n = 18):     [     1 + 2m_2 + 3m_3 + 6m_4 + 9m_5 + 18m_6 = 497     ]     - Solving this, we find (m = 20):       [       1 + 2 cdot 2 + 3 cdot 4 + 6 cdot 5 + 9 cdot 10 + 18 cdot 20 = 497       ]   - For (n = 20):     [     1 + 2m_2 + 4m_3 + 5m_4 + 10m_5 + 20m_6 = 497     ]     - This leads to contradictions as shown in the initial solution.8.

Evaluate the inner sum: Consider the polynomial ( Q(x) = x^{2019!} - 1 ). The roots of ( Q(x) ) are ( s_1, s_2, ldots, s_{2019!} ). We need to find the sum   [   sum_{j=1}^{2019!} frac{1}{s_j + 2}.   ]6.

Multiply by 2020: The sum we need is   [   2020 sum_{j=1}^{2019!} frac{2^{2019!} - 1}{s_j + 2} = 2020 cdot frac{2019! cdot 2^{2019! - 1}}{2^{2019!} - 1} cdot (2^{2019!} - 1) = 2020 cdot 2019! cdot 2^{2019! - 1}.   ]10. Determine the highest power of 2: The highest power of 2 in ( 2020 cdot 2019! cdot 2^{2019! - 1} ) is the sum of the highest power of 2 in ( 2020 ), ( 2019! ), and ( 2^{2019! - 1} ).11. Legendre's formula: Using Legendre's formula, the highest power of 2 in ( 2020! ) is    [    leftlfloor frac{2020}{2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2020}{4} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2020}{8} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2020}{16} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2020}{32} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2020}{64} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2020}{128} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2020}{256} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2020}{512} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{2020}{1024} rightrfloor.    ]    Calculating each term:    [    1010 + 505 + 252 + 126 + 63 + 31 + 15 + 7 + 3 + 1 = 2013.    ]12. Combine the results: The highest power of 2 in ( 2020 cdot 2019! cdot 2^{2019! - 1} ) is ( 2019! - 1 + 2013 = 2019! + 2012 ).13. Express ( n ) as ( a! + b ): We have ( n = 2019! + 2012 ). Here, ( a = 2019 ) and ( b = 2012 ).14. Find the remainder: The remainder when ( a + b = 2019 + 2012 = 4031 ) is divided by 1000 is    [    4031 mod 1000 = 31.    ]The final answer is (boxed{31})."},{"problem":"Problem 7.8.

Condition Analysis:   - (a mid (b + 1)) implies that (b + 1 = ka) for some integer (k).   - (b mid (a^3 - 1)) implies that (a^3 - 1 = mb) for some integer (m).2. Express (b) in terms of (a):   - From (a mid (b + 1)), we have (b + 1 = ka).   - Therefore, (b = ka - 1).3. Substitute (b) into the second condition:   - From (b mid (a^3 - 1)), we have (a^3 - 1 = m(ka - 1)).   - Substituting (b = ka - 1) into the equation, we get:     [     a^3 - 1 = m(ka - 1)     ]   - Expanding and rearranging terms, we get:     [     a^3 - 1 = mka - m     ]     [     a^3 - mka = m - 1     ]     [     a(a^2 - mk) = m - 1     ]4.

Case 1: (m < k):   - If (m < k), then (Delta = (mk)^2 - 4m + 4k < (mk + 2)^2).   - This implies ((m - 1)(k + 1) > -2), hence (Delta < (mk + 2)^2) if (m neq 1).   - If (m = 0), then (k = a^2) and (b = ka - 1 = a^3 - 1).   - Therefore, ((a, b) = (s, s^3 - 1)) where (s geq 2) is an integer.6.

Summation of Points:   The maximum possible sum of differences can be represented as:   [   T_p leq sum_{i=1}^{k} (2k - i + 1) - sum_{i=1}^{k} i   ]   Simplifying the above expression:   [   T_p leq left(2k + (2k-1) + (2k-2) + ldots + (k+1)right) - left(k + (k-1) + (k-2) + ldots + 1right)   ]   The first sum is the sum of the first (k) terms of an arithmetic series starting from (2k) and decreasing by 1:   [   sum_{i=1}^{k} (2k - i + 1) = k(2k + 1) - frac{k(k+1)}{2}   ]   The second sum is the sum of the first (k) natural numbers:   [   sum_{i=1}^{k} i = frac{k(k+1)}{2}   ]   Therefore:   [   T_p leq k(2k + 1) - frac{k(k+1)}{2} - frac{k(k+1)}{2} = k(2k + 1) - k(k+1) = k^2   ]6. Inductive Proof for Pairing:   We will use induction to show that for any (k), there exists a one-to-one function that maps elements of (A = {2k, 2k-1, ldots, k+1}) to (B = {k, k-1, ldots, 1}) such that each pair consists of one black and one white ball.   - Base Case ((k=1)):     For (k=1), (A = {2}) and (B = {1}). The pair ((2, 1)) satisfies the condition.   - Inductive Step:     Assume the claim is true for (k=m). For (k=m+1), consider (2m+2) balls. Without loss of generality, assume (2m+2) is black.     - If (m+1) is white, pair ((2m+2, m+1)) and the remaining pairs follow the (k=m) case.     - If (m+1) is black, there exists a pair ((a, b)) where both (a) and (b) are the same color. Pair ((2m+2, b)) and ((a, m+1)), and the remaining pairs follow the (k=m) case.7. Conclusion:   By induction, we have shown that it is always possible to pair the balls to achieve the maximum points.The final answer is (boxed{1007^2 = 1014049})."},{"problem":"## Task 1.Let alpha be a real number.

Here, we are given the ellipse C: frac{x^2}{3-k}+frac{y^2}{5+k}=1, with its foci on the y-axis. This means 5+k must be greater than 3-k, and both must be positive to ensure the denominators are positive and real.Breaking this down:1. To ensure the foci are on the y-axis, we require 5+k > 3-k. This simplifies to:[5+k > 3-k implies 2k > -2 implies k > -1]2. Additionally, for the terms in the denominators to be positive, 3-k>0 and 5+k>0 must hold true. The inequality 3-k>0 simplifies to k0 simplifies to k>-5. However, since 5+k is already established to be greater than 3-k for the foci to be on the y-axis, verifying k>-5 is redundant.3. Combining these inequalities, we get the range of k as -1 < k < 3.Therefore, the correct range of real numbers k for which the ellipse has its foci on the y-axis is (-1, 3).

Sum of the First ( k ) Numbers:   Let ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) be the arrangement of the numbers ( 1, 2, ldots, n ). We need the sum of the first ( k ) numbers to be divisible by ( k ) for all ( 1 le k le n ). This means:   [   S_k = a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_k equiv 0 pmod{k}   ]   for all ( k ).2. Sum of All Numbers:   The sum of all numbers from 1 to ( n ) is:   [   S_n = frac{n(n+1)}{2}   ]   For ( S_n ) to be divisible by ( n ), we need:   [   frac{n(n+1)}{2} equiv 0 pmod{n}   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   frac{n+1}{2} equiv 0 pmod{1}   ]   This implies that ( n+1 ) must be even, so ( n ) must be odd.3.

Therefore, it is sufficient to find such alpha numbers that meet the problem's condition and 0pi / 2, and due to the cos 2 alpha<0 condition, alpha neq pi. Thus,frac{pi}{2}<alpha<piThe cos 2^{n} alpha<0 condition generally means that there is an integer l_{n} such that pi / 2+2 l_{n} pi<2^{n} alpha<3 pi / 2+2 l_{2} pi, or with the notation alpha_{0}=2 alpha / pi4 l_{n}+1<2^{n} alpha_{0}<4 l_{n}+3Condition (1) implies that left[alpha_{0}right]=1. We will prove that in the base-4 number system, alpha_{0}=1,=1,111 ldots, that is, every digit of alpha_{0} in the base-4 number system is 1.Condition (2) precisely means that when the number 2^{n} alpha_{0} is written in the base-4 number system, a 1 or 2 stands in the units place. But by multiplying by an appropriate power of four, any digit of the fractional part of alpha_{0} can be moved to the units place. (The m-th digit is moved to the units place by multiplying by 4^{m}=2^{2 m}.) Therefore, every digit of the fractional part of alpha_{0} is 1 or 2.But the same is true for 2 alpha_{0} as well, since any digit of its fractional part can also be moved to the units place by multiplying by an appropriate power of two. Suppose there is a 2 in alpha_{0} somewhere. Let the first 2 be the m-th digit after the decimal point: alpha_{0}=1,1 ldots 112 ldots ( m 1's). Then 4^{m-1} alpha_{0}=11 ldots 11,2 ldots, and multiplying this by two, a 3 will appear in the units place, since the fractional part is greater than 1 / 2, and thus there is a carry. Thus 2^{2 m-1} alpha_{0}=22 ldots 23,1 ldots or 22 ldots 23,0 ldots, which contradicts the fact that a 1 or 2 stands in the units place of 2^{2 m-1} alpha_{0}. This proves that alpha_{0}=1, dot{1}=4 / 3, or alpha=2 pi / 3.

Thus, we can express the n-th term of this arithmetic sequence as follows:[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d]Substituting the given values, we get:[a_n = 1740 + 83(n-1)]Simplifying this expression, we obtain:[a_n = 83n + 1657]We are interested in finding out how many times the comet will be visible from now until the year 3000. Therefore, we set up the inequality:[2023 leq 83n + 1657 leq 3000]To solve for n, we first isolate 83n in the inequality:[366 leq 83n leq 1343]Next, we divide the entire inequality by 83 to solve for n:[frac{366}{83} leq n leq frac{1343}{83}]Since n must be an integer (as it represents the n-th occurrence of the comet being visible), we find the integer values of n that satisfy this inequality. The smallest integer value of n that is greater than or equal to frac{366}{83} is 5, and the largest integer value of n that is less than or equal to frac{1343}{83} is 16. Therefore, the possible values of n are 5, 6, ldots, 16.To find the total number of times the comet will be visible from now until the year 3000, we count the number of terms in the sequence 5, 6, ldots, 16, which is 16 - 5 + 1 = 12.Therefore, from now until the year 3000 AD, humans can see this comet boxed{12} times."},{"problem":"Find all functions mathrm{f} on the positive integers with positive integer values such that (1) if mathrm{x}<mathrm{y}, then f(x)<f(y), and (2) f(y f(x))=x^{2} f(x y).","solution":"Answer: mathrm{f}(mathrm{x})=mathrm{x}^{2}.Note that ( 1 ) implies f is (1,1).Put y=1.

The standard form of our function is f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3. The axis of symmetry of a parabola given by f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c is found using the formula x = -frac{b}{2a}. For our function, a = 1 and b = -2, so the axis of symmetry is x = -frac{-2}{2(1)} = 1. This means the vertex of the parabola is at x = 1. To find the y-coordinate of the vertex, we substitute x = 1 into the function:begin{align*}f(1) &= (1)^2 - 2(1) + 3 &= 1 - 2 + 3 &= 2end{align*}So, the vertex of the parabola is at (1, 2), and since the coefficient of x^2 is positive, the parabola opens upwards.Next, we evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval [0,3] to find the maximum and minimum values within this interval.

The compound function becomes f(f(x))=16x+5. This is a linear function whose graph is a straight line with a positive slope. This line will cross the x-axis at a certain point, so there will be values of x for which f(f(x))  0For a>0, the function f(x) is an upwards-opening parabola, and the vertex of this parabola is at x = -frac{4}{2a} = -frac{2}{a}.

Here the 5 cannot appear in the column of the 4, because 4+5=9 and to obtain one of the sums 13, 14, or 18 in that column, the third number would have to be 4, 5, or 9, respectively, which cannot happen since the 4 has already been used while 5 and 9 appear in the second row; a similar argument shows that the 9 also cannot appear in the column of the 4, i.e., the 8 appears below the 4. Since 4+8=12 and both 1 and 2 have already been used, the sum of this column cannot be 13 or 14; thus, the sum is 18.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_01_984603b876c0bc28095bg-22.jpg?height=157&width=240&top_left_y=2234&top_left_x=814)We can now complete the square in the following ways:| 1 | 2 | 4 || :---: | :---: | :---: || 5 | 9 | 8 || 2 | 22 |  || 7 | 3 | 6 || 13 | 14 | 18 || 1 | 2 | 4 || :---: | :---: | :---: || 9 | 5 | 8 || 3 | 7 | 6 |We leave it to the reader to show that when the numbers 6, 7, and 9 appear in the second row, the possibilities are:![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_01_984603b876c0bc28095bg-23.jpg?height=180&width=1336&top_left_y=407&top_left_x=474)Thus, there are only six squares with the sums given in the problem, up to the swapping of rows, swapping of columns, and swapping of rows with columns.## Combinatorics#"},{"problem":"Given lo{g_2}a=frac{a}{2}({a≠2}), lo{g_3}b=frac{b}{3}({b≠3}), lo{g_4}c=frac{c}{4}({c≠4}), then ()A: a lt b lt cB: c lt a lt bC: c lt b lt aD: a lt c lt b","solution":"To solve this problem, we start by analyzing the given equations and transforming them into a form that allows us to compare the values of a, b, and c.1.

Similarly, for b, the equation lo{g_3}b=frac{b}{3} can be transformed to frac{{ln b}}{b}=frac{{ln 3}}{3}.3. For c, the equation lo{g_4}c=frac{c}{4} becomes frac{{ln c}}{c}=frac{{ln 4}}{4} after applying the same transformation.Next, we define a function f(x)=frac{{ln x}}{x} and find its derivative to determine its behavior.

Here, we will use elimination.2. Elimination Method:   Multiply the second equation by 2 to align the coefficients of x:   [   24x - 10y = 250   ]   Now subtract the second equation from the first:   [   (24x - 7y) - (24x - 10y) = 319 - 250   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   3y = 69 implies y = 23   ]   Substitute y = 23 back into the first equation:   [   24x - 7(23) = 319 implies 24x - 161 = 319 implies 24x = 480 implies x = 20   ]   Therefore, the intersection point is (20, 23).3.

We notice that x and y are symmetric around the median (10). If x and y move closer to each other (and hence to the median), the sum of the squared deviations will decrease, since we are reducing the squared deviation of these two terms without affecting the others.Therefore, to minimize variance, x should be as close to y as possible.

A coloring of the integers {1,2, cdots, 2020} in blue and red is said to be pleasant if there do not exist two distinct integers in {1,2, cdots, 2020} of the same color whose sum is a power of 2. How many such colorings exist?","solution":"Solution to Exercise 8: A first idea is to test the statement for smaller values, for example for a coloring of the integers from 1 to 7.Let's color the numbers in order: to color 1, there is no apparent constraint, the same for coloring 2. However, since 3+1=4, the color of 3 is imposed. To color 4, there is no apparent constraint because 4+3=7, 4+2=6, and 4+1=5 are not powers of two. However, since 5+3=6+2=7+1=8, the color of 5, 6, and 7 is imposed. By testing all possible colorings, we see that regardless of the colors chosen to color 1, 2, and 4, the resulting coloring is pleasant. We can therefore assume that a pleasant coloring is fixed once the colors of the powers of 2 are chosen and that any coloring of the powers of 2 can be extended to a pleasant coloring.We will show that for any coloring of the powers of 2 between 1 and 2020, there exists a unique way to color the other numbers to obtain a pleasant coloring.To do this, we will proceed by induction. Let's show that if we color the powers of 2 from 1 to mathrm{N}, then there is a unique pleasant way to color the other integers from 1 to mathrm{N}.The result is clear for mathrm{N}=1.Let mathrm{N} be such that the result is true for mathrm{N}-1. We color the powers of 2 from 1 to mathrm{N}. By the induction hypothesis, there is a unique pleasant way to color the other integers from 1 to mathrm{N}-1.If mathrm{N}=2^{mathrm{k}} for some integer mathrm{k}, then mathrm{N} is already colored and the coloring is pleasant: indeed, if 1 leqslant ell<2^{k}, then 2^{k}+ell is not a power of 2 because 2^{k}<2^{k}+ell<2^{k+1}. Thus, in this case, there is a unique way to complete the coloring.If mathrm{N} is not a power of 2, then mathrm{N}=2^{k}+mathrm{n} with 1 leqslant mathrm{n}<2^{k} and k an integer. Then mathrm{N} cannot be colored the same color as 2^{k}-n because N+2^{k}-n=2^{k+1}. We therefore color mathrm{N} the other color, and this is indeed the unique way to complete the coloring in a pleasant manner. The resulting coloring is pleasant: indeed, let mathrm{t} be an integer such that 1 leqslant mathrm{t}<mathrm{N} and mathrm{t}+mathrm{N} is a power of 2, we have 2^{mathrm{k}}<mathrm{N} leqslant mathrm{t}+mathrm{N}<2 mathrm{~N}=2^{mathrm{k}+1}+2 mathrm{n}<2^{mathrm{k}+1}+2^{mathrm{k}+1}=2^{mathrm{k}+2}, so mathrm{t}+mathrm{N}=2^{mathrm{k}+1}. Therefore, mathrm{t}=2^{mathrm{k}+1}-2^{mathrm{k}}-mathrm{n}=2^{mathrm{k}}-mathrm{n}. Since we have colored mathrm{N} and 2^{mathrm{k}}-mathrm{n} with different colors, the coloring is pleasant.There are 11 powers of 2 between 1 and 2020, which are 1=2^{0}, 2=2^{1}, cdots, 1024=2^{10}, and there are 2^{11} ways to color them in blue and red. Thus, there are 2^{11} pleasant colorings.Comment from the graders:Most students recognized the importance of the powers of 2. Some proposed alternatively to look at elements congruent to 2^{n} modulo 2^{mathrm{n}+1}, which also worked. Many proved that there were at most 2048 colorings, but very few verified that the colorings thus produced were valid, which was a crucial part of the exercise.

Because they are angles on a line, it follows that they are both right angles.Since angle P M S is a right angle, P M is the height of the pyramid with base R M S and apex P.

Thus, the function g takes the value c in the interval left(0, frac{2}{3}right].Hence, the range of the function f in the interval left(0, frac{pi}{2}right) is the ray [6, infty).Remark. We can also prove that g takes the value c in the interval (0,1] using the Bolzano theorem. Since lim _{y rightarrow 0+0} g(y)=+infty, the function g takes values greater than c, and since gleft(frac{2}{3}right)=6<c, it also takes values less than c. Since g is continuous, by the Bolzano theorem, it must also take the value c at some point between 0 and frac{2}{3}."},{"problem":"G2.1 If the sequence 1,6+2 a, 10+5 a, ldots forms an A.P., find a.","solution":"begin{array}{l}6+2 a=frac{1+10+5 a}{2}  12+4 a=11+5 a  Rightarrow a=1end{array}"},{"problem":"## Task 4To become hard-boiled, 3 eggs need to cook for 5 minutes.How long do you need to cook 6 eggs?","solution":"Even 6 eggs must be boiled for 5 minutes. 11.18 19th Olympiad 1981 11.18.1 1st Round 1981, Class 2"},{"problem":"## Task 1On the meadow stands a carousel.

Our thanks go to Dr. Yongmoo Kim for pointing this out.If the problem had been posed asA triline is a line with the property that three times its slope is equal to the sum of itsx-intercept and its y-intercept. For how many integers q with 1 leq q leq 10000 is there at least one positive integer p so that there is exactly one triline through (p, q) ?(ie. with the underlined word positive added), then the following solution would have been correct:Consider a line through the point (p, q) with slope m.The equation of this line is y=m(x-p)+q=m x+(q-m p).Thus, the y-intercept of this line is y=q-m p and the x-intercept comes from setting y=0, which gives x=frac{m p-q}{m}.For this line to be a triline, we need 3 m=(q-m p)+frac{m p-q}{m} or 3 m^{2}=q m-p m^{2}+m p-q or (3+p) m^{2}-(p+q) m+q=0.Given a fixed point (p, q), for there to be only one triline through (p, q), there can be only one slope m satisfying (3+p) m^{2}-(p+q) m+q=0, ie. this quadratic equation has exactly one real root. (The leading coefficient 3+p is non-zero since p is positive.)So for a fixed point (p, q), the condition that there be only one triline through (p, q) is that the discriminant of (3+p) m^{2}-(p+q) m+q=0 equals 0 , orbegin{aligned}(p+q)^{2}-4(3+p) q & =0 p^{2}+2 p q+q^{2}-12 q-4 p q & =0 p^{2}-2 p q+q^{2}-12 q & =0 (p-q)^{2} & =12 qend{aligned}So we must determine the number of integers q with 1 leq q leq 10000 such that there is an integer p such that (p-q)^{2}=12 q.In order for this to be true, 12 q needs to be a perfect square, so 3 q needs to be a perfect square. In order for 3 q to be a perfect square, q needs to be 3 times a perfect square (since q must contain an odd number of factors of 3 and even number of every other prime factor).If q=3 k^{2}, then we can solve (p-q)^{2}=12 q since then left(p-3 k^{2}right)^{2}=36 k^{2} or p-3 k^{2}= pm 6 k or p=3 k^{2} pm 6 k.So how many integers q between 1 and 10000 are of the form q=3 k^{2} ? The minimum value of k that works is k=1 and the maximum is k=57 (since 3(58)^{2}=10092 is too large).Therefore, there are 57 such values of q, ie. the answer would be (B).However, the problem was posed asA triline is a line with the property that three times its slope is equal to the sum of itsx-intercept and its y-intercept. For how many integers q with 1 leq q leq 10000 is there at least one integer p so that there is exactly one triline through (p, q) ?Following the above solution, we arrive at needing one slope m to satisfy the equation(3+p) m^{2}-(p+q) m+q=0There are two ways for this \\"quadratic\\" equation to have a single root - either if the discriminant is 0 , or if the leading coefficient p+3 is 0 (ie. the \\"quadratic\\" is actually linear).So if p=-3, then we need the equation (q-3) m+q=0 to have exactly one solution for m, which it does for every q, as long as q neq 3.If q=3, then the value of p=9 makes the discriminant of the quadratic equation 0 .In other words, every value of q between 1 and 10000 has at least one integer p so that there is exactly one triline through (p, q), so there are 10000 values of q that work.Our apologies for any confusion that this may have caused."},{"problem":"51.

Assume the polynomial form: Let ( P(x) ) be a polynomial with real coefficients. We need to find ( P(x) ) such that the identity ( P(x^3 - 2) = P(x)^3 - 2 ) holds for all real ( x ).2. Degree analysis: Let the degree of ( P(x) ) be ( n ). Then, the degree of ( P(x^3 - 2) ) is ( 3n ) because ( x^3 - 2 ) is a polynomial of degree 3. On the other hand, the degree of ( P(x)^3 ) is ( 3n ) as well. Therefore, the degrees on both sides of the equation match, which is consistent.3. Consider the simplest case: Let's start by considering the simplest polynomial, ( P(x) = x ). Substituting ( P(x) = x ) into the given identity:   [   P(x^3 - 2) = x^3 - 2   ]   and   [   P(x)^3 - 2 = x^3 - 2.   ]   Both sides are equal, so ( P(x) = x ) is a solution.4.

Matching coefficients: For ( P(x) ) to satisfy the identity for all ( x ), the coefficients of corresponding powers of ( x ) on both sides must be equal. This implies that the polynomial ( P(x) ) must be linear. If ( P(x) ) were of higher degree, the terms involving higher powers of ( x ) would not match on both sides of the equation.6.

Subtracting these equations, we get:  [  3b_{n+1}-3b_{n}=2T_{n+1}-2T_{n} implies 3b_{n+1}-3b_{n}=2b_{n+1} implies b_{n+1}=3b_{n}.  ]- Substituting n=1 into 3b_{n}=2T_{n}+3 gives:  [  3b_{1}=2b_{1}+3 implies b_{1}=3.  ]- Therefore, {b_{n}} is a geometric sequence with:  [  b_{n}=3 times 3^{n-1} = 3^n.  ]Condition ②:- For {a_{n}}, starting from 2S_{n}=n^2+a_{n} and 2S_{n+1}=(n+1)^2+a_{n+1}, subtracting these equations gives:  [  2a_{n+1}=(n+1)^2-n^2+a_{n+1}-a_{n} implies a_{n+1}+a_{n}=2n+1.  ]- This simplifies to a_{n+1}-(n+1)=-(a_{n}-n).

Now we carry out the differentiation: f'(x) = e^x (x^2+x+1) + e^x (2x+1). Combining terms gives us: f'(x) = e^x (x^2+3x+1). We can find the extremum values by setting f'(x) to zero: e^x (x^2+3x+1) = 0.

The center of the circle C₂ is (2, 1) with a radius of 1, and C and D are the endpoints of the diameter. From overrightarrow{AC} = overrightarrow{DB}, it can be deduced that the midpoint of AB is (2, 1).Let A be (x₁, y₁) and B be (x₂, y₂). Thus, frac{x_1^2}{a^2} + frac{y_1^2}{b^2} = 1 and frac{x_2^2}{a^2} + frac{y_2^2}{b^2} = 1.

In the first method given below we go about this directly. The second method is more systematic, but more complicated.Method 1Using the formula f(x y)=f(x)+f(y) with x=4 and y=10, gives f(40)=f(4)+f(10). Hence f(4)=f(40)-f(10)=20-14=6. Using the formula with x=y=2, gives f(4)=f(2)+f(2). Therefore f(2)=frac{1}{2} f(4)=frac{1}{2} times 6=3. Using the formula with x=2 and y=5, gives f(10)=f(2)+f(5) and therefore f(5)=f(10)-f(2)=14-3=11.Since 500=2^{2} times 5^{3}, we can now deduce that f(500)=2 f(2)+3 f(5)=2 times 3+3 times 11= 6+33=39.Method 2Let f(2)=a and f(5)=b. Since 10=2 times 5, we have f(10)=f(2)+f(5). Since 40=2^{3} times 5, we have f(40)=3 f(2)+f(5).Therefore, as f(10)=14 and f(40)=20, we obtain the two linear equationsbegin{array}{r}a+b=14 3 a+b=20end{array}From equations (1) and (2)(3 a+b)-(a+b)=20-14 .We deduce that 2 a=6 and therefore a=3.

The product of all divisors of ( n ) can be written as:   [   prod_{d mid n} d   ]   Notice that for each divisor ( d ) of ( n ), ( frac{n}{d} ) is also a divisor of ( n ).

Since the latter is the same in both cases (6^5, as we are rolling five dice, and each can show six different numbers), it is sufficient to compare the number of favorable cases to determine the probabilities.First, let's look at how many ways a full house can be rolled. The dice not participating in the full house can be chosen in binom{5}{2}=frac{5 cdot 4}{2} ways: the first can be chosen in five ways, the second in four, but the order does not matter; whether we choose the red and blue or the blue and red dice makes no difference. On these two dice, 6 cdot 5 different number pairs can appear. (Here again we can see why it was necessary to divide by 2 earlier: otherwise, the possibilities of red 6, blue 3 and blue 3, red 6 would have been counted separately, although they are the same. Many submissions made this mistake or a similar one when calculating the two pairs, which unfortunately resulted in a significant deduction in scoring.)The remaining three dice show the same number, different from the previous ones, which gives 4 possibilities. Therefore, a full house can be rolled in frac{5 cdot 4}{2} cdot 6 cdot 5 cdot 4 = 1200 ways.Now let's examine how many cases result in two pairs. The die that does not belong to any pair, and thus shows a different number, can be chosen in five ways, and the number on it can be any of six. The remaining four dice form the pairs. These can form two pairs in three ways, because by choosing any die, we can pair it with any of the three others, and this already determines the other pair as well. The numbers on the dice in one pair can be any of five, and those in the other pair any of four, as they must be different from each other. Altogether, there are 5 cdot 6 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot 4 = 1800 cases where the dice show two pairs. Since 1800 = frac{3}{2} cdot 1200, two pairs are frac{3}{2} times more likely than a full house. The approximate probabilities are 0.23 and 0.15, respectively.Based on the work of Serény András (Budapest, Szent István Gymnasium, 1st year)Note. The significance of the dice colors lies in emphasizing that the dice are distinguishable, or that the rolls of red 6, blue 5 and red 5, blue 6 are not the same. We could have said the same by stating that we are rolling five distinguishable dice. Of course, we already imagine the realization of the roll this way.However, if we were to say that rolls like red 6, blue 5 and red 5, blue 6 (and similar ones) are considered the same, only the distribution of numbers on the five dice matters, for example, three sixes and two ones; then the dice would not be distinguishable, and we would get a different result. How many full houses would there be in this case? Six different numbers can be the full house, five and four for the other two, but 66612 and 66621 are the same, so there are 6 cdot frac{5 cdot 4}{2} = 60 possibilities. The number of two pairs: six different numbers can be the singleton, and the rest again frac{5 cdot 4}{2}, which is also 60 possibilities. In this model (which, however, clearly does not fit the problem), the two probabilities are the same. The fact that dice rolls do not follow this model is also supported by the fact that in the popular dice poker game, a full house is more valuable than two pairs; we can see the reason for this, as it occurs less frequently."},{"problem":"The MathMatters competition consists of 10 players P_1, P_2, dots, P_{10} competing in a ladder-style tournament.

Initial Terms:   - ( a_1 = 1 )   - ( a_2 ) must be the smallest integer greater than 1 such that ( a_1 + a_2 neq 3a_k ). The smallest such integer is 3. Thus, ( a_2 = 3 ).   - ( a_3 ) must be the smallest integer greater than 3 such that ( a_i + a_j neq 3a_k ). The smallest such integer is 4. Thus, ( a_3 = 4 ).   - Continuing this process, we find the first few terms: ( 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, 12, 13 ).2. Pattern Identification:   - We observe that the sequence avoids numbers that would cause ( a_i + a_j = 3a_k ).   - By examining the terms, we notice that the sequence includes numbers that are ( 1 mod 3 ) or ( 3 mod 9 ).3. Induction and Cases:   - Case 1: ( m equiv 2 mod 6 ). Let ( m = 6k + 2 ). Since ( 3k + 1 ) is in the sequence, ( (3k + 1) + (6k + 2) = 3(3k + 1) ), which is a contradiction.   - Case 2: ( m equiv 5 mod 6 ). Let ( m = 6k + 5 ). Since ( 3k - 2 ) is in the sequence, ( (3k - 2) + (6k + 5) = 3(3k + 1) ), which is a contradiction.   - Case 3: ( m equiv 1 mod 3 ). This case works because the left-hand side (LHS) cannot be a multiple of 3.   - Case 4: ( m equiv 6 mod 9 ). Let ( m = 9k + 6 ). Since ( 6k + 4 ) is in the sequence, ( (9k + 6) + (9k + 6) = 3(6k + 4) ), which is a contradiction.   - Case 5: ( m equiv 9 mod 9 ). Let ( m = 9k ). Since ( 3 ) and ( 3k + 1 ) are in the sequence, ( (9k) + (3) = 3(3k + 1) ), which is a contradiction.   - Case 6: ( m equiv 3 mod 9 ). This case works because if the LHS is a multiple of 3, the other term must also be ( 3 mod 9 ), which cannot happen.4. Conclusion:   - The sequence ( a_n ) consists of numbers that are ( 1 mod 3 ) or ( 3 mod 9 ).   - To find ( a_{1998} ), we need to count the numbers up to ( a_{1998} ) that fit this pattern.5. Computation:   - The sequence alternates between numbers ( 1 mod 3 ) and ( 3 mod 9 ).   - We can compute the 1998th term by noting the pattern and counting the terms.After detailed computation, we find that ( a_{1998} = 4494 ).The final answer is ( boxed{4494} )."},{"problem":"The value of the real number sqrt{2} lies between:A: 0 and 1B: 1 and 2C: 2 and 3D: 3 and 4","solution":"To determine the interval in which the value of sqrt{2} lies, we compare it with the integers around it.

Therefore, we can reduce 2023^{circ} by subtracting multiples of 360^{circ}:sin 2023^{circ} = sin left(360^{circ}times 5+223^{circ}right)2. Simplify the expression by considering the periodic nature of the sine function:= sin 223^{circ}3.

Use the property that sin (pi + theta) = -sin theta for any angle theta:= -sin 43^{circ}5.

Here is the step-by-step solution:1. Potential Energy Lost:   When the spherical shell rolls down the incline, it loses potential energy. If the shell has traveled a distance ( x ) down the incline, the height it has descended is ( x sin theta ). The potential energy lost is:   [   Delta U = 2Mgx sin theta   ]   Here, the factor of 2 accounts for the mass of both the shell and the fluid inside it.2. Kinetic Energy Gained:   The kinetic energy gained by the system is the sum of the translational kinetic energy of the shell and the fluid, and the rotational kinetic energy of the shell.   - The translational kinetic energy of the shell and the fluid is:     [     K_{text{trans}} = frac{1}{2} (2M) v^2 = Mv^2     ]   - The rotational kinetic energy of the shell is:     [     K_{text{rot}} = frac{1}{2} I omega^2     ]     where ( I ) is the moment of inertia of the shell and ( omega ) is the angular velocity. For a thin spherical shell, ( I = frac{2}{3}MR^2 ). Since the shell rolls without slipping, ( v = Romega ), so ( omega = frac{v}{R} ). Substituting these into the rotational kinetic energy expression, we get:     [     K_{text{rot}} = frac{1}{2} left( frac{2}{3}MR^2 right) left( frac{v}{R} right)^2 = frac{1}{3}Mv^2     ]   - The total kinetic energy is then:     [     K_{text{total}} = Mv^2 + frac{1}{3}Mv^2 = frac{4}{3}Mv^2     ]3.

Here's the step-by-step solution:1. First, observe that log 50 can be expressed as log 5 + log 10. Since log 10 = 1 because 10 is the base of the common logarithm, we have log 50 = log 5 + 1.2. Now, substitute log 50 in the original expression:   log^2 5 + log 2 cdot log 50 = log^2 5 + log 2 cdot (log 5 + 1).3. Distribute log 2 across the terms in parentheses:   log^2 5 + log 2 cdot (log 5 + 1) = log^2 5 + log 2 cdot log 5 + log 2.4. The term log^2 5 can be understood as (log 5)^2 and the product log 2 cdot log 5 can be rewritten as log 5 cdot log 2 due to the commutative property of multiplication:   (log 5)^2 + log 5 cdot log 2 + log 2.5. Combine like terms by adding (log 5)^2 + log 5 cdot log 2:   (log 5)^2 + log 5 cdot log 2 + log 2 = log 5(log 5 + log 2) + log 2.6. Apply the logarithm power rule by expressing log 5(log 5 + log 2) as log 5^{log 5 + log 2}. Then use the property log a + log b = log ab:   log 5^{log 5 + log 2} + log 2 = log (5^{log 5} cdot 5^{log 2}) + log 2.   Simplify the expression using the fact that 5^{log 5} = 5^1 = 5:   log (5 cdot 5^{log 2}) + log 2 = log (5 cdot 2^{log 5}) + log 2.   Since log 5 = 1 by the definition of logarithm (because 10^1 = 10 and 5 cdot 2 = 10):   log 10 + log 2 = 1 + log 2.7. Now, use the fact that log 10 = 1 to simplify the last expression:   1 + log 2 = log 10 + log 2 = log (10 cdot 2) = log 20.   Remember that log 20 can also be broken down further because 20 is 4 cdot 5 or 2^2 cdot 5:   log 20 = log (2^2 cdot 5) = 2log 2 + log 5.   However, since log 2 approx 0.3010 and log 5 approx 0.6990, their sum approximates to 1.8. Thus, our final expression simplifies to 1:   log^2 5 + log 2 cdot log 50 = boxed{1}."},{"problem":"229.

The height of triangle A B C does not exceed B M, and B M is no greater than the width of the strip, so the height of triangle A B C is less than sqrt[4]{3}, i.e., its area is less than 1.It remains to prove that any triangle with area 1 can be cut from a strip of width sqrt[4]{3}. We will prove that any triangle with area 1 has a height not exceeding sqrt[4]{3}. For this, it is sufficient to prove that it has a side not less than 2 / sqrt[4]{3}. Suppose all sides of triangle A B C are less than 2 / sqrt[4]{3}. Let alpha be the smallest angle of this triangle. Then alpha leq 60^{circ} and S_{mathrm{ABC}}=(A B cdot A C sin alpha) / 2<(2 / sqrt[4]{3})^{2}(sqrt{3} / 4)=1. A contradiction is obtained.

Consider the mapping f:begin{array}{l}A longmapsto A-{1}, text { if } 1 in A ; A longmapsto A cup{1}, text { if } 1 notin A .end{array}Clearly, f is a mapping from odd subsets to even subsets. f is injective, meaning that for different A, f(A) is different.f is surjective, meaning that for every even subset B, there exists an A such that f(A)=B. In fact, when 1 in B, let A=B-{1}; when 1 notin B, let A=B cup{1}; then f(A)=B.Thus, f is a one-to-one correspondence from the family of odd subsets to the family of even subsets. Therefore, the number of odd subsets of X is equal to the number of even subsets, both being frac{1}{2}|P(X)|=frac{1}{2} times 2^{n} = 2^{n-1}.As a corollary of (i), the number of odd subsets of X that contain 1 is 2^{n-2} left(=frac{1}{2} times 2^{n-1}right); the number of odd subsets that do not contain 1 is also 2^{n-2}.The sum of the sums of the elements of all subsets of X is2^{n-1} times(1+2+cdots+n)=2^{n} n(n+1)(because each element i appears in 2^{n-1} subsets).Corresponding to the mapping f, each odd subset A containing 1 has one more 1 than the even subset B, thus the sum of the elements is 1 more. Therefore, the sum of the sums of the elements of all odd subsets containing 1 ( 2^{n-2} subsets) is 2^{n-2} more than the sum of the sums of the elements of all even subsets not containing 1.Similarly, the sum of the sums of the elements of all odd subsets not containing 1 is 2^{n-2} less than the sum of the sums of the elements of all even subsets containing 1.Therefore, the sum of the sums of the elements of all odd subsets is equal to the sum of the sums of the elements of all even subsets, both beingfrac{1}{2} times 2^{n-2} n(n+1)=2^{(n-3)} n(n+1)"},{"problem":"## Task B-1.2.Given the expression quad|x-1|+|x-2|+|x-3|+ldots+|x-2019|+|x-2020|.Determine the largest interval of real numbers [a, b] on which the given expression has a constant value k for all x in[a, b].

Given the condition (xy + yz + zx = x + y + z), we start by noting that this implies (xy + yz + zx geq 3). This follows from the AM-GM inequality, which states that for any non-negative real numbers (a, b, c), we have:   [   frac{a + b + c}{3} geq sqrt[3]{abc}   ]   Applying this to (x, y, z), we get:   [   frac{x + y + z}{3} geq sqrt[3]{xyz}   ]   Since (xy + yz + zx = x + y + z), we can infer that (x + y + z geq 3).2.

Hölder's Inequality in this context states that for positive real numbers (a_i, b_i, c_i):   [   left( sum_{i=1}^n a_i right) left( sum_{i=1}^n b_i right) left( sum_{i=1}^n c_i right) geq left( sum_{i=1}^n sqrt[3]{a_i b_i c_i} right)^3   ]   Applying this to our problem, we set:   [   a_i = frac{1}{x^2 + y + 1}, quad b_i = 1, quad c_i = 1   ]   Then, we have:   [   sum_{cyc} frac{1}{x^2 + y + 1} leq sum_{cyc} frac{1 + y + z^2}{(x^2 + y + 1)(1 + y + z^2)}   ]   Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:   [   sum_{cyc} frac{1 + y + z^2}{(x^2 + y + 1)(1 + y + z^2)} leq sum_{cyc} frac{1 + y + z^2}{(x + y + z)^2}   ]3.

Analyzing the Steps:   - To reach ((8,8)) from ((0,0)), the person needs to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up in total.   - Given that the person takes exactly 3 steps to the right, the remaining 5 steps to the right must be taken diagonally.   - Similarly, the person needs to take 8 steps up, and since 5 of these steps are taken diagonally, the remaining 3 steps must be taken directly up.3. Counting the Total Steps:   - The total number of steps taken is (3) (right) + (3) (up) + (5) (diagonal) = (11) steps.   - We need to choose 5 positions out of these 11 steps to place the diagonal steps. The remaining 6 steps will be split between the 3 right steps and 3 up steps.4.

The equation for line CA is:y = frac{y_0}{t + 3}(x + 3),and the equation for line DB is:y = frac{-y_0}{t - 3}(x - 3).Given that point K lies on both lines, we can equate the values for y to obtain:y^2 = frac{y_0^2}{t^2 - 9}(x^2 - 9).Substituting the relationship from the ellipse frac{t^2}{9} + y_{0}^2 = 1 into the above equation yields: y^2 = frac{1}{9}(x^2 - 9),which simplifies to frac{x^{2}}{9} - y^{2} = 1.

Since l is not perpendicular to the x-axis, x_3 neq 1 and so lambda = frac{x_3}{1 - x_3}.Similarly, we get mu = frac{x_4}{1 - x_4}.Hence, the sum lambda + mu can be expressed as:lambda + mu = frac{x_3}{1 - x_3} + frac{x_4}{1 - x_4} = frac{(x_3 + x_4) - 2x_3x_4}{1 - (x_3 + x_4) + x_3x_4}.Using the earlier found expressions for x_3 + x_4 and x_3x_4, we determine that lambda + mu = boxed{-frac{9}{4}}."},{"problem":"3.

We then use this to get a formula for the gradient of the orthogonal family and solve the resulting first-order differential equation to get the orthogonal family. Thus we have 8y y' + 4x y' + 4y + 2x = ay' + a = (y' + 1)(2y + x) 2 /(y + x). So y'(2y+x)( 4(x+y) - (2y+x) ) = (2y+x) 2 - (x+2y)(x+y), or y'(2y+x)(2y+3x) = -2x(2y+x), so y' = -x/(2y+3x). Hence the orthogonal family satisfies y' = (2y+3x)/x. So y'/x 2 - 2y/x 3 = 3/x 2 . Integrating y = bx 2 - 3x. These are all parabolas. All members of both families pass through the origin. Changing coordinates to X = x + 2y, Y = y - 2x, the equation of a member of the first family becomes X 2 = a(3X-Y)/5 or Y = - 5/a (X - 3a/10) 2 + 9a/20. This has gradient 3 (in the new system) at the origin. In the old system the tangent is y = -x. The orthogonal set obviously has gradient -3 at the origin. If the angle between them is k, then tan k = (-1 +3)/(1+3) = 1/2. So k = tan -1 1/2. 5th Putnam 1942 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 5 Mar 2002"},{"problem":"Solve the equations: (1) 4x^{2}=12x; (2) x^{2}+4x+3=0.","solution":"To solve the given equations step by step, we proceed as follows: Equation (1): 4x^{2}=12x1.

If the side of the square is formed by m sides of length 14 and k sides of length 10, then the length of the side of the square is 14 m + 10 k, and its area is S=(14 m + 10 k)^{2}. Equating the expressions for the areas, we get14 cdot 10 cdot n = (14 m + 10 k)^{2} rightarrow 7 cdot 5 cdot n = (7 m + 5 k)^{2}We can assume that the numbers m and k are coprime. Otherwise, the side of the square can be reduced by a factor of p > 1, where p is a common divisor of m and k.The left-hand side of the equation (*) is divisible by 7, so the number 7 m + 5 k is divisible by 7, and (7 m + 5 k)^{2} is divisible by 49.

In the solution, we accepted from \\"intuition\\" that the sought sphere either externally touches all three given unit spheres or internally touches each of them. However, if we do not completely trust our intuition (which is especially justified in a spatial geometry problem!), we can very easily verify this. Suppose the sought sphere externally touches the sphere centered at O_{1} and internally touches the sphere centered at O_{2}. Then (denoting the sought radius by r^{prime}) O_{4} O_{1}=r^{prime}+1, O_{4} O_{2}=r^{prime}-1, soO_{1} O_{2}=2=left(r^{prime}+1right)-left(r^{prime}-1right)=O_{4} O_{1}-O_{4} O_{2}Thus, the triangle O_{1} O_{2} O_{4} is degenerate, meaning O_{4} lies on the line O_{1} O_{2}.

Does there always exist an infinite number of functions g:mathbb{R}tomathbb{R} such that f(g(x))=g(f(x)) for all xinmathbb{R}?[i]Proposed by Daniel Liu[/i]","solution":"1. Initial Consideration:   We need to determine if there always exists an infinite number of functions ( g: mathbb{R} to mathbb{R} ) such that ( f(g(x)) = g(f(x)) ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ), given that ( f ) is a bijective function.2. Case 1: ( f ) does not have a finite order:   - If there exists some ( x ) such that the sequence ( {x, f(x), f(f(x)), dots } ) is infinite, we can construct an infinite sequence of functions ( {f, f^2, f^3, dots } ).   - Since ( f ) is bijective and does not have a finite order, the sequence ( {f, f^2, f^3, dots } ) is infinite.   - For each ( n ), define ( g_n(x) = f^n(x) ). Then, ( f(g_n(x)) = f(f^n(x)) = f^{n+1}(x) ) and ( g_n(f(x)) = f^n(f(x)) = f^{n+1}(x) ), satisfying ( f(g_n(x)) = g_n(f(x)) ).3. Case 2: ( f ) has a finite order:   - Suppose there exists some ( n in mathbb{N} ) such that ( f^n(x) = x ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ). This implies ( f ) is composed of cycles.   - Let ( p ) be a divisor of ( n ) such that cycles of length ( p ) occur infinitely many times.4. Constructing ( g ) in the case of cycles:   - Consider two cycles of length ( p ): ( (a_1 mapsto a_2 mapsto dots mapsto a_p mapsto a_1) ) and ( (b_1 mapsto b_2 mapsto dots mapsto b_p mapsto b_1) ).   - Define a function ( g ) as follows:     [     g(x) =      begin{cases}      f(x) & text{if } x neq a_i text{ for any } i      b_1 & text{if } x = a_1      end{cases}     ]   - Inductively, if ( g(a_i) = b_i ), then ( g(a_{i+1}) = b_{i+1} ). This ensures that ( g ) maps the cycle ( (a_1, a_2, dots, a_p) ) onto the cycle ( (b_1, b_2, dots, b_p) ).5. Conclusion:   - Since there are infinitely many pairs of cycles of length ( p ), we can construct infinitely many such functions ( g ).Thus, in both cases, we can always find an infinite number of functions ( g ) such that ( f(g(x)) = g(f(x)) ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ).The final answer is (boxed{text{YES}})"},{"problem":"Problem 11.

The minor arc of the great circle passing through points A and B occupies a total circumference of (pi - 2alpha)R,  thus, the spherical distance between points A and B is (pi - 2alpha)R.  Therefore, the answer is: boxed{(pi - 2alpha)R}.  Analysis: By determining the radius of the latitude circle at alpha radians and combining the arc length of the latitude circle between these two places, we can find the central angle corresponding to points A and B on the latitude circle.

Therefore, the total number of people infected in the second round would be x(4+4x).Given that after two rounds of transmission, 256 people had contracted influenza A, we can set up the equation to represent the total number of infections after two rounds:[4 + 4x + x(4+4x) = 256]This equation accounts for the initial 4 infected, the 4x people infected in the first round, and the x(4+4x) people infected in the second round.

Thus, (x_{1}+x_{2}=frac{-2k}{k^{2}+2}) and (x_{1}x_{2}=frac{-1}{k^{2}+2}).Consequently, (k_{1}+k_{2}=frac{y_{1}-1}{x_{1}-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}+frac{y_{2}-1}{x_{2}-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}=2k(frac{x_{1}}{2x_{1}-sqrt{2}}+frac{x_{2}}{2x_{2}-sqrt{2}})).This simplifies to kcdotfrac{4x_{1}x_{2}-sqrt{2}(x_{1}+x_{2})}{2x_{1}x_{2}-sqrt{2}(x_{1}+x_{2})+1}=0, which implies 4x_{1}x_{2}-sqrt{2}(x_{1}+x_{2})=0.Now, frac{-4}{k^{2}+2}+frac{2sqrt{2}k}{k^{2}+2}=0, solving for k yields k=sqrt{2}.Thus, ((x_{1}-x_{2})^{2}=(x_{1}+x_{2})^{2}-4x_{1}x_{2}=frac{3}{2}), and |x_{1}-x_{2}|=frac{sqrt{6}}{2}.Therefore, the area of triangle AB{F_{1}}, S=frac{1}{2}|F_{1}F_{2}||x_{1}-x_{2}|=frac{1}{2}times 2timesfrac{sqrt{6}}{2}=boxed{frac{sqrt{6}}{2}}."},{"problem":"[left.begin{array}{c}text { Division with remainder } {[text { Arithmetic of remainders (other).] }}end{array}right]]a) For which integers n is the number 5 n^{2}+10 n+8 divisible by 3?b) And for which integers is it divisible by 4?","solution":"a) 5 n^{2}+10 n+8 equiv-n^{2}-2 n-1=-(n+1)^{2}(bmod 3).b) 5 n^{2}+10 n+8 equiv n^{2}+2 n=n(n+2)(bmod 4).## AnswerDivisible by 3 when n=2+3 k; by 4 when n=2 k(k in mathbf{Z})."},{"problem":"Find all functions f:mathbb{N} rightarrow mathbb{N} such that for every prime number p and natural number x,{ x,f(x),cdots f^{p-1}(x) } is a complete residue system modulo p. With f^{k+1}(x)=f(f^k(x)) for every natural number k and f^1(x)=f(x).[i]Proposed by IndoMathXdZ[/i]","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to find all functions ( f: mathbb{N} rightarrow mathbb{N} ) such that for every prime number ( p ) and natural number ( x ), the set ( { x, f(x), f^2(x), ldots, f^{p-1}(x) } ) forms a complete residue system modulo ( p ). This means that the set contains ( p ) distinct elements, each of which is congruent to a different integer modulo ( p ).2. Initial Observation:   If ( |f(x) - x| geq 2 ), consider a prime ( p ) dividing ( |f(x) - x| ). This would imply that ( f(x) equiv x pmod{p} ), which contradicts the requirement that ( { x, f(x), ldots, f^{p-1}(x) } ) forms a complete residue system modulo ( p ). Therefore, ( |f(x) - x| ) must be less than 2.3. Possible Values for ( f(x) ):   Since ( |f(x) - x| < 2 ), the only possibilities are ( f(x) = x + 1 ) or ( f(x) = x - 1 ).4. Eliminating ( f(x) = x - 1 ):   If ( f(x) = x - 1 ), then ( f^2(x) = x - 2 ), and so on. For a prime ( p ), the set ( { x, x-1, x-2, ldots, x-(p-1) } ) would not form a complete residue system modulo ( p ) because it would not cover all residues ( 0, 1, 2, ldots, p-1 ). Hence, ( f(x) = x - 1 ) is not a valid solution.5. Verifying ( f(x) = x + 1 ):   If ( f(x) = x + 1 ), then ( f^2(x) = x + 2 ), and so on. For a prime ( p ), the set ( { x, x+1, x+2, ldots, x+(p-1) } ) modulo ( p ) will indeed form a complete residue system modulo ( p ) because it will cover all residues ( 0, 1, 2, ldots, p-1 ).6. Inductive Step:   Assume ( f(n) = n + 1 ). We need to show that ( f(n+1) = n + 2 ). If ( f(n+1) = n ), then ( f(f(n)) = n ), which contradicts the assumption that ( f(n) = n + 1 ). Therefore, ( f(n+1) = n + 2 ).7.

Players alternately discard one of them and split the remaining one into two, and so on until there is one match left in each pile. The player who makes the last move wins. Who will win (the player starting the game or his partner) if at the beginning of the game there were 20 matches in one pile and 25 in the other?Solution. Let's solve the problem in general terms. Suppose at the beginning of the game, each pile contains an odd number of matches. Then, with the correct play, the player who starts loses. Indeed, after the player who starts discards one of the piles, there will be a pile with an odd number of matches, which he splits into two piles: one with an odd number of matches and the other with an even number. Now the second player discards the pile with an odd number of matches and splits the remaining pile into two so that each contains an odd number of matches. Continuing the game, the second player will be the last to split a pile of two matches into two parts, each containing one match, and thus he wins.Thus, a losing position is a situation where there are two piles, each containing an odd number of matches.If, however, one pile contains an even number of matches (for example, 20), and the other an odd number (for example, 25), then, to win, the player who starts must discard the second pile and split the remaining pile of an even number of matches into two piles, each containing an odd number of matches.
