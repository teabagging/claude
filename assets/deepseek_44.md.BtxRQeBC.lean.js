Though there is a good chance that this could be menstrual cycle, such a severe pain is suggesting a possibility of miscarriage or ectopic pregnnacy. Ultrasonography may guide you in diagnosing the condition. More likely possibility is Ectopic pregnancy. In this condition, initially there is very little bleeding and then it may increase; however severe abdominal pain is a classic feature of ectopic pregnancy. In this condition, there is profuse intra-abdominal bleeding and you require blood transfusions and surgical intervention. Please report to your Obstetrician ASAP. Ultrasonography at early stage may not be conclusive. I hope you got the message. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I am a 30 year-old female who wants to have another child.

A few sheets of notebook paper a day. I m sure the ink isn t good, but I m wondering if there is any real harm to it? I know that I m anemic and it s most likely Pica, and I am being treated for anemia. But I m wondering how harmful it could be to me or the baby if I keep eating as much paper as I am now.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Eating the paper per se is not harmful to you neither for your baby. However, it all depends up  on  which paper you are eating. Any newspaper, postal envelops, advertisement bills, etc. are handled by many people, are lying at any place and hence are not hygienic to eat. Moreover as you have mentioned, some inks contain heavy metals and is not good for the brain development of the foetus. Otherwise plain clean paper is not harmful; in fact some ice-creams do contain blotting paper in it. Moreover you have to go to the root cause of this craving. Anaemia and calcium deficiencies do cause such cravings which should not be labeled as pica. The cause of resistant anaemia could be worms which can cause such weird liking towards the items. Please get your stools examined from the laboratory and if indicated take anti-worm treatment with the advice of your Obstetrician. Please keep in mind, though the paper per se may not be harmful to either of you, the cause for such craving could be serious. Do not neglect it. I hope you got the message.

Your pregnancy test has revealed that you are pregnant. X-ray irradiation to the baby at 6 weeks pregnancy is not a good incidence. Tab. Mifepristone followed after 24-48 hours by Tab. Misoprostol will help you terminate the pregnancy. However, please be aware of following points:1. These are not 'over the counter' medicines. They have to be obtained by Obstetrician's prescription and taken under observation. They should be taken in prescribed dose lest the risk of incomplete abortion or failure.2. These medicines do cause developmental abnormalities in the baby. Hence, if at all they fail, you should not revert the decision to continuation of pregnancy, but get the pregnancy terminated by surgical evacuation.3. Please get the completeness of the abortion confirmed by ultrasonography. 4. A follow up visit to the Obstetrician 7 days after the last tablet is advisable. I hope this helps you.

Nearly a year ago now, I started developing symptoms of what I first thought was a UTI. I had a slight burning upon urination and some discomfort/itching in my urethra. I also had some discharge. I was sexually active at the time with only 1 person. Upon ending that relationship, my partner had gotten herself tested. Negative for all STDs but was diagnosed with BV(Bacterial Vaginosis). As the name suggests, she was told she couldn t have passed it on to a male partner. However, I was still showing symptoms. I decided to go in for a checkup. I gave a urine sample and was treated on the spot with a shot and one treatment of antibiotics. My tests came back negative for both gonorrhea and chlamydia. My symptoms seemed to mostly go away, but as of recently, I started to notice the skin around the opening of my urethra was red and easily irritated. Any friction, (masturbation or even occasionally rubbing up against the inside of my clothes) caused more redness and irritation. No pain during urination, no noticeable discharge. I have not had any sexual contact around a year now. I still have no idea what this could be and any suggestions/possible treatments would be helpful.

If you can retain oral fluids, please take a glassful of Electral solution (oral rehydration solution) after each motion. Orally eating over-ripped banana will help providing good amount of electrolytes and to control the motions also. With this, you should feel better within 24 hours. If not, you will have to report to the Obstetrician. If you cannot tolerate oral Electral and it is vomited out, you may have to take parenteral fluid therapy.

About 2 days after taking the pill i started bleeding and for two days after that i still had a heavy flow. I haven t stopped bleeding and this is now day 3.

Therefore, few days after taking the pill some amount of bleeding is expected when the levels of Levonorgestrel in the blood start dropping down. However, such bleeding is usually not heavy bleeding. If heavy bleeding is your usual tendency during menstruation, this bleeding also may be heavy. If the bleeding continues further in such fashion, I would advise you to report to a Gynaecologist to investigate and stop bleeding. The menses after Next Choice are reported to be heavier than normal. I hope this helps you.

During pregnancy, sex is not forbidden. During first three months, since the pregnancy is at a precarious stage, we advise to observe sexual abstinence. However, after completion of three months, you can have sex till you complete 7 months. During sexual intercourse, your pregnancy will be more safe if you practise sex with incomplete insertion of the penis in to the vagina. Intercourse in lateral (side) position will facilitate this type of intercourse. After 7 months, since the abdomen has started protruding substantially, man on woman or from the front of woman may be bothersome and causing pressure on the abdomen. There is a risk of complete penile insertion in the reverse position. Hence, vaginal sex with man behind the women will facilitate such sex. If you refer to Kamsutra by Vatsyayan, there are some specific positions explained for sexual intercourse during pregnancy. So with such allowance for intercourse during pregnancy, I do  not feel there is any necessity to have an alternative option of anal sex. However, if that is your choice, you have to take precautions mentioned for the vaginal sex. The choice is yours. I hope this helps you for a safe happy marital relations.

I am 9 days late for my injection and I have had unprotected sex with my partner last night.  How long before I know if I am pregnant.  I am also due to get my injection today if pregnant what will happen to the pregnancy","Doctor":"Hi, Dr Purushottam Neurgaonkar here. I welcome you to HCM VIRTUAL CLINIC. I have gone through your question, and I think I have understood your concern. I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. 1 )  First of all do not panic. If you are regularly on depo injections, then seven to ten days plus - minus  will not affect your contraceptive effects of the depo shot.Also, return to fertility is not that instantly even if a woman stops taking depo shot.2 )  You need to wait for at least 2 weeks after unprotected sex yo get the urine  pregnancy test to show the results. 3)  I will suggest you to take emergency contraceptive pill like i  pill or Plan B  within 24 to 72 hours of unprotected sex act. This will help to prevent the pregnancy. 4) Please do not take depo injection if you are not sure of the pregnancy condition. If taken in pregnant condition, it can have virilizing effect on the female fetus. I hope this answer helps you. Thanks. Dr. Purushottam Neurgaonkar."},{"Patient":"Hai, My name is Anuradha.

As you have rightly said pre ejaculation secretion does contain sperms. But chances of getting pregnant are almost nil in your case. As you did not have any penetrative sex or spillage of semen was not there in and around the vagina. Secondly in a woman with regular cycles day 10 to 20 of the cycle is the most fertile period of the cycle.

There is a possibility of pregnancy. The egg is released 14 days prior to next period. The egg has life of 24 hours and the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a period of about one week around the day of egg release is a fertile period; which in your case would be between 18 and 26. So your sex on borderline. Since you have missed period, you have following options to detect the pregnancy:1. 8-10 days after missed period, get pregnancy test done on overnight morning first urine sample. Done earlier, these tests may give false negative results.2. You may opt for Beta hCG test which can give you reliable diagnosis of pregnancy even few days before missing a period. If you are pregnant and this is unwanted pregnancy, you may opt for medical termination of pregnancy. Tab. Mifepristone followed after 24-48 hours by Tab. Misoprostol can terminate the pregnancy safely and successfully up to 9 weeks of gestation. These are not 'over the counter' medicines. You have to buy them only with Obstetrician's prescription and take them under observation. 7 days after consuming the last pill, please report to the Obstetrician for follow up. Completion of abortion can be ascertained by ultrasonography. Since these medicines cause developmental abnormalities in the baby, pregnancy should not be continued in case of failure of these medicines; pregnancy should be terminated by surgical evacuation of the uterus.

Please note the frequency of such contractions and whether you can indent the uterus with your finger during contractions. Also note whether it is uterus which is becoming firm or whole of the abdomen is getting tight. If it is uterus which is causing painful contractions, you will have to report to the Obstetrician ASAP since this is indicating premature labour contractions. You will be given some injections to relax your uterus; however at the same time you will be given steroid injections to make the lungs of the baby mature so that they will function well after the premature delivery.

He has a follow up the 17th of July, but I am sort of wondering that it may he may be bleeding slightly under his skin, and, that it is not brusing but blood under his skin in the nuts. I am leaning towards calling his doctor. There is no lumps/bumps where they did the entry, just some pain and lots of brusing all over his nut sacks. I was not aware this is something you have to pay for to get an answer.

Though there are varied causes of such sudden accidental death of the foetus in last trimester of pregnancy, let us consider the commonest cause. One thing is sure that this is a sudden acute episode causing death of the baby. Chronic starvation of baby would have retarded the growth of the baby rather than its death. Diabetes is a commonest cause of sudden intrauterine death of foetus without any other symptoms. Was she tested for blood sugar? If not please get it done with understanding that many times the diabetes shows temporarily during the pregnancy and afterwards becomes latent and non-detectable. The other commoner cause is sudden separation of the placenta. However, usually there is some cause behind it like high blood pressure, diabetes, excessive water around the baby, some bolt on the abdomen, etc.. Such separation causes pain in the uterus and may cause some amount of vaginal bleeding - which may not be there also. Please try to explore theses possibilities by discussion with your Obstetrician. If you want to discuss this in details with me, you may ask me a Direct question. I hope this gives you some direction. Dr. Nishikant"},{"Patient":"I just found out I m pregnant. My last period was June 3rd - I took a pregnancy test on Fri 7/16 it was positive-it had 3 test to the kit and the second test (because I really didn t have much urine) I held close to stream and believe it touched me a little shortly after that I fealt a tingly sensation down there and by Saturday morning I was highly irritated/inflamed/discharging(like a yeast infection) but the discharged has been colored old blood color brown and now dark/burgandy red particles. I just went to the bathroom and when I wiped it was filled again with the cottage cheese particles colored burgandy and in the toilet it was a lot of particles as well. What is going on.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Let me assure you that just little touch of the strip to your private parts would not cause such a fulminating infection. It seems you were harbouring yeast infection (candida) before the pregnancy and has now flared up. You need to undergo antifungal treatment, no doubt. But before that, you have to confirm the viability of your pregnancy. Brown discharge during pregnancy usually suggests missed abortion (nonviable baby and still not getting aborted). Pregnancy test will not help to diagnose this condition since it takes more than a week for the pregnancy test to become negative after the baby has become nonviable. The most reliable test in such condition would be ultrasonography to look for the baby's heart activities. If the baby is viable, you may undergo antifungal treatment right away; however, if the baby is non-viable you may get the pregnancy terminated before starting antifungal treatment. Local antifungal vaginal pessaries are quite effective. They need to be inserted deep inside the vagina at bed time. After inserting the pessaries, please lie down for at least one hour to prevent falling off of the pessary. This infection is sexually transmitted infection. Hence, it is advisable for both the partners to have the treatment simultaneously to avoid reinfection. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant"},{"Patient":"I m a dance and aerobics trainer.

Old) were recently married, June 26th 2010. We are trying to conceive. I was on the pill for awhile, but went off it in February of this year. I went on the pill mainly to try to keep my cycles regular, and succeeded. Now that I have been off, Iâ??m back to my irregular cycles. I had a period in Feb, March, and the middle of June. My husband and I had unprotected sex a few days before our wedding, and pretty consistently the week after. My most recent period was from June 13-18. I am not sure when I ovulate, as I have irregular cycles and never had much luck with the ovulation predictor kits. But the 4/5th of July, when I went to the bathroom and wiped, there was a brown discharge on my toilet paper, that I guess would refer to spotting. So, I used a tampon expecting my period to come, woke up the next morning, and other than a little bit of that brown substance, nothing else was on it. It is now the 14th, and still nothing (granted that Iâ??m never sure when my next period will start). Iâ??ve also had all the symptoms of what I believe to be pregnancyâ?¦. Cramps, bloating, fatigue, nausea, dizziness, mood swings, backache, just â??feelingâ?? pregnantâ?¦. Etc. I also know that these signs might also be signs of pre-period, as I sometimes get these â??symptomsâ?? without ever getting my period(it normally skips a month or two; at least). But its been about a week and a half of these symptoms, and they never normally last this long. I have taken several pregnancy tests, all coming back negative. Is there a chance I may be pregnant, or is it just wishful thinking (because Iâ??m never sure when the next period will start). Should I test again with the at home tests, get blood work done, and when? Any advice will be appreciated, its all so confusing!","Doctor":"Hi, I have gone through your question, and I think I have understood your concern. I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. 1 )  Considering your history of irregular cycles, USG will be of help to look for PCOS as a cause of irregular cycles and difficulty in detecting ovulation. 2 )  I will suggest to get HSG  to know patency of the tubes. Also husband's semen analysis will be of help. I will suggest to start ovulation induction from day 2 of the cycle and follicle study from day ten of the cycle.

My due date is 22 April 2011. I remember the beginning of my last period to be 10 July 2010. I would like to find out my conception date. I had unprotected sex with a different person on the 18th of July and with my partner on the...","Doctor":"Hallow Madam,I hope I can be of help to you today.The due date of delivery (DD) is calculated by a formula DD= Last Menstrual Period date (LMP) + 9  months + 7 days. Since you had your LMP on 10 July 2010, the DD would be on 17 April 2011. If DD provided to you is by ultrasonography, a variation of one week is acceptable as Ultrasonography calculated DD is by the size of the baby and is calculated from the date of conception. To calculate the date of egg release (ovulation), it happens 14 days before the next expected menses. So considering your menstrual cycle of 30 or 31 days, next menses would be on 10 August and ovulation would be on 28 July 2010. The life of an egg is 24 hours and the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a period of one week around the ovulation is fertile period. So your fertile period would be 24 July to 1 August. Thus the conception would be in that period. Now in this calculation, you have to make some modifications depending on the periodicity of your menstrual cycle. Then you can locate your fertile period of that cycle. Thus the intercourse(s) during this fertile period are likely to cause the pregnancy. If you had a solitary intercourse during fertile period, that day or within 4 days of that day would be the day of conception.Of course this all is based on the clinical calculations. If you want to ascertain the paternity of your child for any legal cause, you may go for DNA test which would be a fool proof evidence. I hope this helps you.

You will need to take precautions for the same, if at any time you have a urine infection or vaginal infection in this pregnancy get immediate treatment for the same.Infection is one of the most common and avoidable causes of rupture of membranes and preterm birth.Also you need to check for the length of the cervix ( neck of the womb) from the 3 rd month on wards if at any point it starts opening or measures less than 2.5 cms you should consider a procedure called cervical circlage where they tie a suture at the neck of the womb to prevent further opening.Also if you start having pains take the steroid dose for the optimal lung development of the baby.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"i am 18 and i am sexually active and i havent had my period in three months could i be having a baby and where can i go to find out without my mom knowing yet","Doctor":"HiDr. Purushottam welcomes you to HCM virtual clinic!Thanks for consulting at my virtual clinic.

However, being in a new town and trying to find work, this has made things nearly impossible.  She has tried Fenegren(sp?) suppositories, but they now do not work.  They just make her tired and she continues to throw up.  She has an appt. with an OBGYN tomorrow, but I was also researching the disease, Multiple Enchondromatosis, which she also has and she lost an index finger because of it.....what can we do to help her?","Doctor":"HiI think I have understood your concern. I will suggest her small, frequent meals.Avoid fasting for more than 3 hours.Avoid deep fried foods, bakery products and refined sugars.Cap Perinorm CR once a day and Tab ONDEM MD half hour before each meals; this will help to get control on vomiting.Also blood TSH levels need to be checked. Avoid lying down just after meals.

Any antibiotic or antibacterial agent can affect the performance of an oral contraceptive pill and cause failures. This may be applicable to the anti-malarial preparations also. Yet, I do not think you could be pregnant since you had the intercourse after your expected period. Home pregnancy tests read well when performed 3-7 days after a missed period and not earlier. You should get a blood test done to exclude/confirm pregnancy before you decide whether to continue with the pill.

If you did not receive any anti-D immunoglobulin injection soon after your previous pregnancy and if you do not Rh positive or negative, you need to get immunized in this pregnancy. Ideally, the first dose is given at 28 weeks gestation with or without a booster at 34 weeks followed by another injection within 72 hours of delivery if the baby is Rh positive. If you are already sensitized, you may need a first trimester injection. 2. It is better to avoid travel by any means in the first trimester. If it is absolutely necessary, make sure you do not face any jerky experience during travel.

There are several possibilities in the current scenario. The vomiting and the diarrhea could mean an infection. The giddiness could be due to the electrolyte imbalance caused by the diarrhea and also possible due to fall in the blood pressure. Alternatively, a threatened preterm labor can often present with diarrhea and raised hypertension could be another possible factor that should be thought of. So long as there is no gross disturbance and the fetal movements are well preserved, there is no need to worry about the fetal well being.

If you have always had regular cycles, your age of pregnancy can be approximately calculated even though you had a recent irregular period excluding the number of days your period got delayed. The ideal way to estimate the gestation age in the current scenario, however, is to get a trans-vaginal sonogram.

Everytime we have sex I lay there for a while so that it gives the sperm more time to flow to where it needs to go. When I get up sperm runs out of my vagina and when I pee it comes out even more, if this keeps up how am I ever going to get pregnant? Or what can I do to keep the sperm in me?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, You need not be as concerned about out flowing of semen after intercourse. Some amount of semen always flows out. The total semen ejaculated in the vagina is about 5 ml of which hardly 1 ml flows out. Moreover, the first bout of ejaculation comes out with a forceful spurt which directly enters the uterine cavity through the cervix. You may monitor your ovulation to locate the day of ovulation. This can be done by ultrasonography or by a home ovulation monitoring kit. Once you locate the day of ovulation, try to have your marital relations on and around the day of the ovulation keeping in mind that the egg has life of 24 hours and sperms are active for 72 hours.

Since your fasting blood sugar levels are higher than normal, you definitely need medication. In view of your past history, it is better to avoid the similar preparation of insulin. The fluctuating levels with oral medication indicate the need for insulin. In the current scenario, you should discuss the appropriate management with an endocrinologist. Either another oral drug may be added or a safer insulin is tried with proper monitoring. Hope you find this information useful.

And she was worried because she was bleeding when she went to use the bathroom, so i looked at this website and i saw that it mentioned miscarriages. she has had a miscarriage before, and shes been cramping, and goes from one minute being hot to the next minute being freezing cold, and she has been throwing up everyday, and i was wondering if you think she is gonna have another miscarriage or if you think that it is just something normal that happens to some girls?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. Miscarriages happen with an incidence of 15 to 30 percent. This does not man that it is a regular happening. Since she had a miscarriage earlier, if you wish to salvage this pregnancy, the ideal thing to do is to see a specialist immediately, get an evaluation of the pregnancy status along with the viability and plan further management. Ask her to take absolute bed rest and abstain from intercourse while you get medical attention. Hope you find this information useful.

The situation being birth control taken between 9:40 and 9:45pm, a new condom carefully put on, and not ejaculating inside the female. What are the chances?","Doctor":"hello,There is no chance of pregnancy in dual protection (condom and birth control pill) without ejaculation inside vagina. So don't be much worried.Pregnancy is possible only,if unprotected sexual intercourse is done with ejaculation around ovulation time in regular period.

During the night I woke up to air being passed through my virgina. Yes it felt wired and I was questioning and a little worried with this being my first pregnancy. So what I want to know is was that normal , why does that happen ,and of course what makes it happen too?","Doctor":"Hi, Dr Purushottam Neurgaonkar here. I welcome you to HCM VIRTUAL CLINIC. I have gone through your question, and I think I have understood your concern. I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. Please do not panic.  It is not a thing to worry about.  It is due to passing out of air from the vaginal passage. In some women there is laxity of the muscles around the vaginal opening , and it gets more so during pregnancy due to hormonal changes. This leads air to enter the vagina and with change in position or increase in abdominal pressure while laughing or coughing it comes out with some noise . So do not worry. I will suggest you to get used to pelvic muscle exercise called as Kegelle' s exercise, this involves tightening and relaxing the muscles around the anus and vagina. This will help to reduce the problem .I hope this answer helps you.

Please help me out","Doctor":"I can understand your concerns. Ejaculation is discharge or ejection of semen. As ejaculation is one of the pleasure in males, we have to be careful. There are many reasons for erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation. At your age the most common factor is stress (anxiety or depression) for erectile dysfunction. You have to be relieved from stress factors as soon as possible. This is a very common factor and there is be no need to worry. Other causes can be neurological defect as ejaculation occurs by reflex erection mechanism of nerves. In such case, it can be confirmed by duplex ultrasound and penile nerve function testYou can improve by the following methods if there are no defects in investigations:1. Maintain a healthy weight2. Avoid high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels3. reduce smoking and alcohol intake4. Exercise regularly5. Sildenafil can be used in severe difficultyNo need to worry as this is a very common problem in young adults.

I welcome you to HCM VIRTUAL CLINIC. I have gone through your question, and I think I have understood your concern. I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. There are certain situations like intra uterine growth retardation - means small weight baby , and placental insufficiency -  means less blood flow to baby and less amount of water around the baby.  Such conditions need to deliver the baby by cesarean surgery. In such cases, it is better that baby is safe outside the womb. Usually at 35 weeks of pregnancy,  baby has less risk.  But the treating doctor usually helps out the baby by giving Injection Beta methazone. This helps baby to breath easily. So Trust In your treating Doctor.

Home pregnancy tests are not so sensitive as the blood test for pregnancy; thus, they cannot read a positive result very early either before a missed period or just after. The ideal time is after 3-7 days of a missed period and with a fresh early morning sample of urine. This is the reason why you had a negative test early on and positive tests later. 2. Early positive tests can show faint lines as the amount of hCG excreted in urine would be lower in quantity; as the levels rise, the lines get darker. Hope your query has been answered."},{"Patient":"hi, i have regular periods at around 26-27 days since i had my son almost 3 years ago. This month it is 35 days and I still have no period. I have taken 2 pregnancy tests which were negative. This morning i experienced slight dizziness. Any advice? Im 42 years old. Thanks","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,If you are sexually active woman, you are very right in going for pregnancy test. They are negative even almost 9-10 days after missing period. So the chances of pregnancy are remote. For your satisfaction you may repeat the test again after 4 days on overnight first morning urine sample. Alternatively you may get Beta hCG test done. When 'no pregnancy' is confirmed, you have to consider following possibilities: 1. Considering the age, these could be perimenopausal changes when the intermenstrual period goes on increasing and ultimately, the menstruation bids you good bye. When there is no menstruation for 6 months (according to some definitions it is 9 months) at menopausal age, it is labelled as menopause. 2. You may be having or developing hormonal + metabolic imbalance which leads to Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). 3. Thyroid dysfunction also may cause irregularity in menstruation. At this age, Thyroid dysfunction is common. According to me, the possibility of the former one is more at this age. Blood examination for FSH, LH, Oestrogen, T3, T4 and TSH levels will clarify the issue and clinch the diagnosis. If you are keen on having menstruation even after the pregnancy tests are negative, you may take Tab. Deviry for 5 days. You will get menses within 4-7 days after these pills. However, take an informed decision about whether you want the menses to appear or you want the cause to be detected and managed if needed. I hope this helps you at this juncture.Dr. Nishikant"},{"Patient":"I was 5 days late on my period.

In fact missing a period is the first cardinal symptom of pregnancy. All other symptoms mentioned bellow appear about 10-15 days later. They are:1. Nausea & vomiting with pica2. Frequency of urination3. Breast changes:    * Engorgement & tenderness    * Dark discolouration of nipples and areola with increase in areolar size    * Appearance of small nodules (Montgomery's tubercles)  under the areola    * Colostrum secretions from nipple However, the pregnancy cannot be diagnosed only by such symptoms. You have options of undergoing some tests:1. Pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample about 8-10 days after missing period. Earlier, these tests may give false negative results. 2. Beta hCG test which is very specific and sensitive. These tests can give reliable results even few days before missing a period.3. Ultrasonography 10 days after missing period will provide a direct visual evidence of the status of pregnancy.4. Clinical examination by an Obstetrician 2 weeks after missing period.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common problem that affects the life of many men. It is of crucial importance that you understand ,that not every problem with erection, is necessarily a definitive case of ED. Factors that can cause the problem you have been experiencing may include the following:1- Conditions like: Diabetes, High Blood Pressure etc. 2- Psychological circumstances like: stress, anxiety, extended use of pornographic materials  etc.3- Certain drugs: like ant-depression drugs, some anti-hypertensive drugs etc. 4- Age is another factor as ED is common among elderly people.  5- Hormonal changes: thyroid disease, low levels of testosterone etc.Psychological stress is a common cause among young males. There is a simple way to differentiate if your problems come from stress. If your morning erection is preserved (erection when waking up in the morning), there is a high probability that your problems come from psychological factors. A consult with an urologist can give a more specialised insight for the causes of your condition. He/she may ask you to run some tests and/or an ultrasound of your penis in order to establish the cause of your problem.  Some causes are perfectly treatable and you can regain your sexual health (ie if you have low levels of testosterone, substitute therapy will resolve your problem) There are many therapeutic options for the treatment of ED:1- Drugs like Viagra, Cialis,Levitra  etc that you take before you are planning to have sexual intercourse. These type of drugs are perfectly safe to use and have minor side effects like: headaches, dizziness etc which tend to abate in time. You need a consult with your doctor to find out if the are suitable for you.2- Vacuum devices that create a mechanical pressure to give you an erection. They are very easy to use but may cause some discomfort, bruises etc.3- Penile prosthesis when all the above measures are not effective in taking care of your problem. I hope this helped.Don't hesitate to contact me, if you have any further questions.All the best.

What problems you are facing related to getting weak erections appears mainly psychological and mental stress with unnecessary assumptions and expectations. You can overcome it by regaining confidence from doing the following. 1. Practice behavioural therapy in the form of 'pause and squeeze' technique to achieve and sustain erection. 2. Do meditation regularly to keep your mind calm and healthy. 3. Include in your diet foods like milk, almonds, dates, figs, honey and papaya, which would help to improve blood supply to penis. 4. Eat healthy diet and improve the quantity of fluid intake. 5. Take medications only when necessary to achieve good erection like Tablet.Tadalafil. Keep your confidence levels high and maintain good health. Gradually, you will overcome the problem. Hope the information provided would be helpful.

Is it possible for it to move up and I got bigger & more weeks along it move back across the cervix again?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. First of all, at this time if you currently have a placenta previa and are contracting, your situation is very grave. The gradual dilation of your cervix can all of a sudden cause hemmorhage which can make both you and the baby lose a lot of blood, and even cause death of the fetus. So yes- it is true that if your pregnancy went to full term the placenta may move, but if you are having a short cervix and contractions and they do not stop you will need emergency cesearan delivery. So it is imperative that you be treated to stop your premature contractions. I recommend you consult as soon as possibile with a high-risk OB or go to the hospital for evaluation of your contractions.

Elevated liver enzymes and swelling unfortunately can be symptoms of two potentially very dangerous pregnancy complications. The first and most common is severe preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome  which is a combination of hypertension, swelling and protein in the urine. It normally develops at term but if it does prematurely it can cause seizures in the mother and abruption of the placenta. Typically patients also have low platelets and can be at risk for stroke. The second possibility is acute fatty liver f pregnancy which can also lead to fetal death and potential permanent liver damage. I seriously recommend you consult with a physician or take her to the hospital immediately for evaluation... She needs her blood pressure checked, a urinalysis, a CBC with platelets, electrolyte including BUN/creatinine and a consultation with a high risk obstetrician. Sometimes the baby needs to be delivered prematurely to treat the mother. I again am very concerned about your partners status and please consult immediately with a local physician and do not continue to try to diagnose her yourself. If she develops a severe headache or sees spots in front of her eyes she is at high risk of seizure and should go to the hospital immediately.

I continued geting ready for work...wiped again and saw a dark brown blood, and then before walking out the door it was brown. As I got to work, it had all stopped. I had a mis carriage last July of 09. So I called the Doctor to be on the safe side. They said because of my age, 35, I needed to see the doctor on Monday. I need to take it easy, no lifting, no sex, drink alot of water and I go to see the Doctor on Monday. This morning the exact same thing happened. Red blood, dark brown, and now back to nothing. This is totally different then my mis carriag last year. I was wondering if anyone else had expeienced a little bit of blood only in the morning and had a normal pregnancy? Or since It is starting out with red blood, I am mis carrying?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Bleeding at any stage of pregnancy is not a good sign. Red blood is a fresh blood and brown blood is old blood which got collected inside and is coming out late. Usually brown bleeding during pregnancy indicates that there is chance that baby may be non-viable. Urine pregnancy at this stage will not help since it takes 8-10 days for pregnancy test to become negative. At this stage of pregnancy, non-viable baby means a missed abortion. Please get your ultrasonography done to find out the viability of the baby. If it is missed abortion, you will have to undergo termination of pregnancy at the earliest to avoid complications like heavy bleeding due to clotting disorders (DIC), Kidney failure, infection, etc. The Obstetrician will decide after clinically examining you and seeing your reports whether your pregnancy can be terminated by medicines or you need surgical evacuation, if needed. If the baby is viable, please restrict yourself to the bed. Avoid any strenuous work, weight lifting, intercourse, etc. You may then need Progesterone preparations for stabilizing the pregnancy. If the baby is viable and you do not have any pain in the abdomen, you have got fair chances to save this pregnancy. Please do not ignore. Follow your Obstetrician's advice religiously and see him at the earliest. If possible, try to get your appointment with the Obstetrician preponed. I hope this will help you for the time being.

An hour later I bought a Plan B pill at CVS and, as I do not swallow pills, I dissolved it into a small glass of water. Is it still effective? Should I still take a pregnancy test soon? Thank You, Laura","Doctor":"Hallow my friend Laura,You have taken right step. Plan B emergency contraceptives are very effective in preventing pregnancy when taken within 72 hours. You have consumed it within one hour. Whether you swallow the pill or you drink after dissolving in water does not make any difference. It will act. You need not take your pregnancy test immediately. Wait for your menses to appear. Due to emergency contraceptive pill, it may be delayed by few days. If you miss period, then only you may think of performing pregnancy test on the overnight first morning urine sample after 8-10 days of missed period. Earlier, these tests may give false negative results. Alternatively, you may go for Beta hCG test which can give you reliable results even few days before you miss a period. However, I feel this should not be necessary. Here I would like to give you some tip about the use of condom. Before wearing condom, its tip should be pinched in the fingers to expel the air in it and then it should be worn. Otherwise the air trapped in the tit increases the pressure during ejaculation and then there is risk of bursting of condom .

Foreplay should continue even during the intercourse also. Take high protein diet, drink plenty of water.Avoid sex and masturbation when you are feeling of tired.Take proper rest and sleep of at least 7-8 hours.If problem persists then Medications likeTetrafol plus: It can help in erection and should be taken after complete physical evaluation as mentioned above.

Shona","Doctor":"Dear Shona, Hair of the body has a natural property of growing. In fact many women get haircut done and still their hair grow regularly. Had hair not grown, the saloons and barbers would have closed down. So do not worry. Whatever your hair cut or shaved will definitely grow back. It may take some time to achieve original length, still they will grow. However, sometimes when completely shaven hair grow, they may change their physical character due to change in the quality of keratin in it. Curly hair may not retain their curliness and may become straight. Now you have to take your informed decision about getting shaved or not.

The breast symptoms like engorgement, tenderness, dark discolouration of the nipples & areola with increasing areolar size and colostrum secretions will appear subsequently  up to 2 after weeks of missed period. Urine pregnancy tests give reliable results after 8-10 days from missed period. Earlier they may give false negative results. I would advise you to repeat pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample after 4 days again. Alternatively you may opt for Beta hCG test which is very sensitive and gives you reliable results even few days before missing a period. If these tests also report that you are not pregnant, then you are not pregnant. In that case, you may take Tab. Deviry for 5 days. Around 4-7 days after that you will get withdrawal bleeding.I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant"},{"Patient":"i am female 26, i had a miscarriage nine weeks ago, had a period 4 weeks later. i done a test today cause of the way i feel and its positive, i have had unprotected sex since my period. am i pregnant or could the test be showing still from the miscarriage","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Pregnancy tests are based on the raised titres of hormone hCG in the body. The titre starts falling down after abortion process and roughly after about 8-10 days it becomes undetectable in the urine. Therefore, the pregnancy test becomes negative about 8-10 days after abortion. Positive pregnancy test 9 weeks after miscarriage cannot be attributed to that pregnancy. You have to consider following possibilities:1. You may be freshly pregnant again. Ultrasonography after about a week can confirm the diagnosis. 2. Failed abortion last time. This also will be clear after ultrasonography. However, you had menses 5 weeks ago, hence this possibility can be ruled out. 3. You could have developed choriocarcinoma or molar neoplastic disease. You have to report to Gynaecologist to get quantitative estimation of the hCG in your body. If indicated, you may have to undergo curetting for biopsy of the tissue inside the uterine cavity. Ultrasonography is helpful in detecting or suspecting these lesions. However, this condition causes alarming bleeding which you do not have. Still, it is better to rule it out. Better to err on safer side. Choriocarcinoma  can be completely cured with medicines if diagnosed and treated in time. I hope this gives you guidance for next step."},{"Patient":"I am 31 year old mother of two.  I have been on a combination birth control pill for exactly one month.  I took my pill every night.

Another time my partner just barely penetrated and I made him stop in fear of pregnancy.  Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, If you are so regular with your birth control pills, the chances of pregnancy are very rare. Moreover you had only one intercourse, that too with condom on. If you do not start your menses while on inactive pills (2nd pill), you may continue with the next pack as per the instructions - this is what WHO recommends. You may get the menses by the time all inactive pills are consumed. Some times it is noted that women may not get menses after inactive pill. To sustain the effect of birth control pills, it is advised that you start with the next pack if you are very regular with the previous pack. Even after the second pack inactive pills also if you do not get periods, then you may have to report to the Gynaecologist for further investigations of pregnancy or nay other cause.

Since you have irregular cycles and also use progesterone to induce a period usually, your ovulation status is questionable. This makes you safe and puts your chances of natural conception very low. Yet, even with natural regular ovulation, the earliest time to test for pregnancy is at least a week after the intercourse through an estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres. A trans-vaginal sonogram can follow after another week or two, if tested positive. This will help to estimate the age of the pregnancy and to locate the gestation sac.

I couldnt get home pregancy test or go to any doctors for it, what can i do and how do i know if im pregnant or not?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,I would have appreciated to know when did you have your last menses and whether you have missed your period. Missing a period is the first cardinal symptom of pregnancy. The other symptoms like nausea & vomiting, frequent urination and breast changes like engorgement and tenderness, dark discolouration of nipples & areola with increase in the size of areola and secretions through the nipples appear later - may be about 8-15 days after missing a period. From your history, I could not get the information about whether you are having any of these symptoms. Only weird feeling in the abdomen cannot be attributed to pregnancy. Nausea and weird feeling in the abdomen without missing  a period could be due to the stress of (?unwanted) pregnancy!Well, if you have missed your period, 8-10 days after that, please do pregnancy test on your overnight first morning urine examined; earlier, these tests may give false negative results. Alternatively you may get Beta hCG test done which is reliable even few days before the missed period. If you do not have facility of undergoing either of this test, you can go for ultrasonography about 10-15 days after missing a period which will give you direct visual evidence of your pregnancy status. Clinical examination from Obstetrician about 10 days after missing period also can give you clue about your pregnancy status. Somehow, you have to opt for one of the diagnostic measures mentioned above for diagnosing your pregnancy. Of course, if you have not missed your period as yet, please wait for the period to appear. It you get the period, no dilemma about pregnancy. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant"},{"Patient":"Hai Doctor, I m Mahesh & i m 27 recently married.

If you are still in doubt, for further confirmation, you have following options:1. Repeat the test on the overnight first morning urine sample. This urine is concentrated with the hCG hormone and hence the test will be more reliable. 2. Get Beta hCG test done.3. Get ultrasonography done. If any of these tests reports are no pregnancy, then what your doctor has prescribed is a right treatment to get your menses. Take Primolut N or Deviry tablets for 5 days. You will have withdrawal bleeding 4-7 days after that. I hope this helps you.

It looks like mucus but colored into light pinkish color. It is my ovulation time as well. I am concerned even more since today I went to the bathroom and wiping my self w/toilet paper I noticed the same kind of discharge again. Could it be cancer? I scheduled my dr's app. for next Tuesday,","Doctor":"Hi there,,Post coital bleeding could mean a lot of things, not necessarily cancer, but it is a symptoms that cannot be ignored and needs to be evaluated.You will need to see the doctor who will examine your cervix and vagina to see if there  is any local cause for it such a cervical erosion, cervical polyp or cervicitis. If your Cervical cytology/PAP smear is due get that taken as well.If any infection is seen , antibiotics should be taken for the same.You will also need to de a pelvic ultrasound to see the lining of the womb and if there is any thickening or not. A thickened lining can cause bleeding in mid cycle.Cervical cancer can be ruled out with cytology and if any suspicion is seen a colposcopy is advised.If the lining of the womb is thickened we will need to send a small biopsy of it to the laboratory for evaluation, all this can be done at the gyanecologist you visit her/him.Do not worry.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am 22 years old. When I was 12, I had a cyst on my ovary and had to have it removed, along with a fallopian tube. I am now married and am trying to conceive. I do not have a cycle every month, and have not had one in almost a month. I have bought over-the-counter ovulation tests, and they come out positive. Any advice?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You have to consider multiple things while trying for pregnancy. 1. Even though your one tube is removed, remaining one tube is very much capable of picking up the eggs discharged from both the ovaries for conception, provided that tube is patent. I would advise you to undergo hysterosalpingography (X-ray of the uterus and tube after filling in radio-opaque dye) and/or Laparoscopy to assess then patency of the tube, normalcy of the uterine cavity (HSG) and any adhesions in the pelvis (Laparoscopy). 2. You are having irregular menstruations. Though one test by ovulation monitoring kit has indicated ovulation, may be you are not ovulating regularly every month. You may undergo regular ovulation monitoring by ultrasonography. This will guide you for the day of intercourse also. Further more it can find out the thickening of the uterine lining and size of the follicle when egg was released. Follicles between 18-21 mm size give best results. 3. Please get your husbands semen also examined for its quality.4. If you have missed your period for one month, it is a good idea to get pregnancy test done on the overnight first morning urine sample. I hope this should help you. Dr. Nishikant"},{"Patient":"I have been sick all day and i just threw up purple stuff and a little bit of bright blood.

It was at a different hospital . But they said we where gonna lose our baby just from looking at the ultrasound. But ever since I have been pregnant i have had brown vaginal discharge which my dr says is normal and fine. But ever since yesterday after i went to the dr I have had the same light brown discharge but its now a light pink with clumps or chunks in it. When they said i was gonna lose the baby they said they didnt know when or how.But yesterday our baby was moving around like crazy on the screen and the heart rate was 153 and its been around that since ive been pregnant. But I was just worried after having the light pink discharge with clump or chunks. what that might be???? I havent had any cramps or pains or anything tho. But yesterday when they did the ultrasound they did a vaginal ultrasound. And I didnt know if maybe the light pink chunks where maybe the lining of my uterus or maybe dead skin cells or something and when they did the vagnial ultrasound it maybe knocked some of the dead skin cells or lining lose or something. Any info for me????","Doctor":"Hi there,,Please do not be so tensed, having been told that you are going to loose your baby must be a devastating experience. But nothing is confirmed till a definitive test such as an amniocentesis is done. A transvaginal ultrasound does not cause any damage to the lining of the uterus or to the pregnancy, do not be very concerned about it causing harm.If some defects were identified on the ultrasound we will need to rule if they are isolated or associated with a genetic cause such as a trisomy. The amniocentesis will take some fluid from around the baby and analyse it for the DNA.But if the baby does have a genetic defect it is also more likely to miscarry itself, which could be a cause of the constant mild spotting you have already had through this pregnancy.If the amniocentesis comes out with a  normal finding and there are still defects observed on the ultrasound, you will need to get detailed scans at 20 weeks and a cardiac ECHO of the baby at 22-24 weeks to rule out other problems if any.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor. I am 39 weeks pregnant. About 5 days ago (Sunday), I was taking a shower and noticed a bump on my vaginal lip (left side). I immediately grew concerned about it and asked my husband to look at it. He said it was black and looked like a blood blister and it was in the shape of a perfect circle. At that time it didn t hurt. I was worried so I brought it up to my doctor on Tuesday. She glanced at it and said that it was just a mole . Me and my husband were relieved. But later on the next day, it just didn t sit right with me. I got a mirror and a light and looked down there to see what, if anything, had changed. I noticed that another bump was growing in right next to it. It looked exactly the same, only smaller. The initial bump was getting to be a little tender to the touch. I really freaked out. I worried about it all day yesterday and decided to check myself again this morning. So, I got my mirror and light and, from what I can see, I have another 3 or 4 dark bumps or patches coming in on my left vaginal lip. I am getting really scared now. Is there any advice you can give me of what it could be? Should I call my doctor and demand a second opinion or should I head to an E.R.? Can this effect my baby? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi there,,If the bumps are not hurting you much, please do not be worried.These are dilatation of the veins (blood vessels) in the vagina. During pregnancy the amount of blood flow to the vagina increases this causes these dilatation of the veins. Also the progesterone hormone whose level increase in pregnancy causes a dilatation of the wall of the blood vessels resulting in thicker vessels which look bluish.These will go away soon after delivery, and as you are at 39 weeks already , you may deliver soon.If at all episiotomy is required during delivery the veins can be avoided to prevent excess blood loss.These will not affect your baby.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 20 weeks pregnant and having raised temperature (37 degrees celsius = 98.6 fahrenheit) while my normal temperature (before pregnancy, in the period before the ovulation was around 36.2-36.4 celsius (97.16 - 97.52 fahrenheit). I know that in the 1st trimester teh raised temperature is a good sign of hormones doing their job.... but how long the elevated temperature should stay? Is that temperature normal in week 20? or is it a sign of some infection?

If the pregnancy is viable and progressing well, serial serum beta-hCG titres should show doubling every 2-3 days.

Progesterone supplements can do more harm than help in such situations.

These are prescription medicines and you need to consult a doctor or psychiatrist or sexologist for the prescription.Since your blood glucose appears to be high, you are advised to consult your treating doctor for certain lab tests such as fasting and postprandial blood glucose, HbA1c, urine analysis, ECG, etc/You also need to have certain lifestyle changes such as:1) Regular exercise for 45 minutes followed by meditation for 1/2 an hour in the morning. 2) Take high protein diet rich in vegetables and fruits and Vitamins A, C, D, E. and Zinc 3)Take anti oxidants like Almonds 5-6 everyday.. 4) Avoid alcohol and smoking..Hope the advice given would be beneficial."},{"Patient":"Can I be pregnant even though I took a pregnancy test and it was negative? My periods are pretty irregular but I think I m roughly 2 weeks late. I have been feeling sick in the mornings and night for about a week now, My boobs are really really sore and tender and I get sharp shooting pains and they have got a little bigger, I have headaches and stomach cramps and my stomach feels harder if that makes sense. I ve had little backache as well. I did a test today and it came back negative, is it possible that the test could be wrong, or its too early for me to do a test? It sounds stupid but this isn t my period coming I know how my body works and this is more than a late period. Im 18 and never been pregnant before so I m so confused.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Urine pregnancy test usually gives reliable results 8-10 days after missing period. You have missed period for two weeks. By now the pregnancy test results are definitely reliable. Still if you have got any doubt, you may go for ultrasonography. Two weeks after missing period, ultrasonography definitely gives a direct visual evidence of presence or absence of pregnancy. If scan also shows that you are not pregnant, you have to get rid of the possibility of pregnancy from your mind. In that case, soreness in your breasts could be due to rough handling. Cramps in abdomen, back ache, headache, etc. are not the symptoms of pregnancy. For theses symptoms, which could be due to viral infection, please report to your physician. I hope this helps you.

Just very causious.dont want another baby right now as i am only 18.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Nuristerate is a progesterone birth control pill. If you are consuming the pills regularly, there is very little possibility of pregnancy. Last time your pregnancy resulted due to dropping few pills irregularly. If this time you are regular, you should not have stress of pregnancy. As it is, you have not missed your period. So I should say, being worried about pregnancy is much ado bout nothing. However, if at all you miss your period, you have following options to detect pregnancy:1. 8-10 days after missing a period, perform pregnancy test on the overnight first morning urine sample. These tests done earlier may give false negative results. 2. Beta hCG test is very sensitive and specific. It gives reliable results even few days before missing a period. 3. Ultrasonography done after 10 days of missed period will give you the direct visual evidence of pregnancy status.4. Clinical examination by Gynaecologist 10 days after missed period. I am repeating again, if you are so regular in taking Nuristerate pills, you should not be worried about pregnancy. Stress itself may delay the menses. I hope this helps you.

Else, if you are due for your next natural period in less than a week, you can also go for an estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres. The vitamin supplement you are taking is not known to cause these symptoms. If negative for pregnancy, You need to test for gastric causes etc. as the reason for your symptoms.

The cardinal symptoms of pregnancy are:1. Missing a period: which you have.2. Nausea and vomiting with pica3. Frequency of urination4. Breast symptoms:    * Engorgement and tenderness    * Dark discolouration of nipples and areola with increase in the size of areola.    * Secretions (colostrum) through nipples. These symptoms may take a week or two after missed period to appear. You have following options for confirmation of pregnancy:1. Urine pregnancy test: This test should be done on the overnight first morning urine sample 8-10 days after missing a period. Earlier, these tests may give false negative results. 2. Beta hCG test: This is very specific and highly sensitive test and gives reliable results even few days before missed period.3. Ultrasonography done about 10 days after missed period will give direct visual evidence of the pregnancy status. 4. Clinical examination by a Gynaecologist after 10 days of missed period. If you are not pregnant and still do not get period, you may take Tab. Deviry for 5 days. 4-7 days after that you should get withdrawal bleeding. I hope this gives you the guidance.

Normally he pulls out a few seconds before he ejaculates, but this time as soon as he pulled out he ejaculated. What are my chances of becomming pregnant? I had sex on Monday, which is one of the days I was at peak fertility","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Before opining on your case, I would like to give you some scientific information about the Fertile Period. Egg release (ovulation) takes place 14 days prior to the next expected menses. Egg has a life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a period of a week around the ovulation is fertile period. So, if your menstrual cycle is of 30 days, day 16 is the ovulation day. Thus intercourse two weeks after the menstruation is very likely to be in the fertile period. Before ejaculation, there is preejaculation secretion which also contains some sperms which are capable of fertilizing the egg. Therefore, pull out technique is not a reliable method of birth control. You may please go for more reliable methods like birth control pills, condom or intrauterine device. Your history suggests that there are good chances that you could be pregnant. Now wait expectantly for the menses. It you miss them, for confirmation of diagnosis of pregnancy, you have following options:1. Pregnancy test on the overnight first morning urine sample 8-10 days after missed period. Earlier these tests may give false negative results. 2. Beta hCG tests are very sensitive and specific tests and give reliable results even few days before missing a period.3. Ultrasonography 10 days after missing period.4. Clinical examination 10 days after missing a period. If you are pregnant and it is unwanted pregnancy, you may opt for medical termination of pregnancy up to 9 weeks of gestation after which you may need surgical procedure. I hope you have got the guidance.Dr. Nishikant"},{"Patient":"hello..I face some sexul problem which is...my penis is not strong and stand when my wife come to my side..bUT..when 1st time of marriage then few days I face this problem then I take a sexul medicine vegorax .just few time ..after that s it s solve...but after 2 yes later ..at present 2 month my penis totally does stand and strong. when sexul time.","Doctor":"Thanks for contacting HCM with your health concern1.

There was no need of plan B pill also considering then timing of your intercourses. The egg is formed 14 days prior to the next menses. Egg has 24 hour's life and the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a period of about a week around the day of egg release is a fertile period. Your intercourses were far away from this period. Hence there is least possibility of pregnancy.

If this is your first pregnancy, it is likely that the morning sickness could be continuing well into the second trimester also.

Avoid spices, deep fries and fast foods. Dry fruits like pistachios are a good help. If you cannot drink water, try juices. Take the anti-emetic before you get up from the bed in the morning.

It can cause excess weight gain of the baby making delivery difficult to achieve and more likely of a Caesarean.Also certain complications such as bleeding after delivery and chances of Admission to NICU of the baby increases. The baby needs to be monitored in the first few hours after birth for sugar levels and other complications, some may have breathing difficulties.But all these complications can be minimized by checking sugar levels regularly in the mother who is diagnosed to be diabetic in pregnancy, she may also be given insulin to control the sugars .So  just repeat the glucose tolerance test at 26 weeks and if its normal do not worry.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"38 weeks pregnant and my persistant coughing for the last 4 days is leading me to believe I have whooping cough.

Is there anything I can do to ease the tension when I cough?","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.Iam sorry for your condition.In my opinion the cause for cough should be evaluated.If the cough is associated with altered sputum then it might suggest infection.If it is dry cough then it might be mostly allergy related.The definite diagnosis is possible only by physical examination.So I suggest you to consult doctor.In case of infection you might need a course of antibiotics.Nothing to worry.Symptomatic treatment like cough suppressants might give relief from cough.Persistent cough leads to pain abdomen and might not lead to any other complications.Decreasing the cough is the only thing needs to be done.Sorry there  is no other way to relieve the tension in abdomen.Hope this helps.Best regards.."},{"Patient":"hey I m 8wks 2days pregnant and have been suffring from heartburn.

My due due is 2/27/2011 which was first given to me on July 8,2010 at an ultrasound daing me 6 and a half weeks. Had two more ultrasounds done: One on August 27, dating me 13 and 5 days with my due date still 2/27/2011 and another on October 11, dating me 20 weeks 1 day with my due date still 2/27/2011. If I had intercourse with guy A on May 23 and guy B on June 5, who is the father? Is two weeks difference enough time to be able to tell this? I also have had irregular periods and only have ultrasounds to go by, is the information given to me by an ultrasound accurate enough to determine paternity? THANK YOU!","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, All the three seatings of ultrasound scanning are giving you the same due date of delivery, which is 02/27/2011. Considering this date, you should have your last menstrual period somewhere around 05/20/2010. Considering your menstrual cycle of 30 days, your likely date of egg release would be around 06/06/2010 since the egg release takes place 14 days prior to the next menses. The life of egg is 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence the possibility of the father seems to be guy B with whom you had intercourse on June 5, 2010. Howeverif you want to assess the paternity for legality purpose, you will have to get DNA test done. I am sure this solves your dilemma.

I was then advised for a second opinion scan which was done on 4 June 2010 and the TCD shows 19mm. THe report says that the cerebellar growth is on the 5th centile. Fetal growth and amniotic fluid are normal. There are no obvious structural defects or markers for chromosomal abnormalities in particular the rest of the intracranial structures appear normal. Fetal cardiac scan showed a normallly connected heart with no obvious defects and normal flow patterns. The urinary artery doppler and cervical length are normal. This cerebullar growth on the 5th centile appears to be an isolated defect and in the absence of any defects the possibility of syndromic associations appears to be low. Is this a cause for worry? My Gynaec has asked me to do a rescan after 2 weeks. Is there a chance of the growth spurting back to normal levels in 2 weeks? Please advise","Doctor":"Hi there,A low value of cerebellar diameter should be always seen with other parameters which could give an overall view. If it's an isolated defect it should not cause you to worry so much. After all ultrasound findings are only there to identify problems when there is a defect, if no other defect is seen this should be taken very positively by you.The cerebellar values are usually only checked in the 2nd trimester, a repeat scan will confirm that there are no co-existent anomalies. This scan must have been recommended by your gynae to confirm the same.So do not be over concerned about it.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, Iam expecting pregnancy this month.

I think I have understood your concern, I will try to suggest you the best possible treatment options.It is sad to know about your miscarriage. For successful conception 3 things need to be in place-1] Semen count- get semen analysis done2] Patent tubes- get HSG, Hysterosalpingography done.3] Follicle study- USG on alternate days from day 10 of the cycle to know day of ovulation. I will suggest-Indulge in routine exercise and healthy diet regimen. Avoid fried foods, Salty foods, refined sugars. Avoid substance abuse, if any. Include more portions of fruits, vegetables and salads in diet. Start on B12, FOLIC ACID at least 3 months before conception.There is always a risk of 2 in 10 pregnancy losses, so do not panic.

I have not missed one day, and I always take them on time. My partner and I had sex while I was on my period. He did not pull out. I was also taking the drug Cipro for a UTI. This was about two weeks ago. Should I be concerned about pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Since you are taking birth control pills regularly, you do not have to worry about pregnancy. Moreover, your had intercourse on your period. Intercourse during this period cannot cause pregnancy as there is no egg.The egg is released 14 days prior to the next expected menses. Egg has a life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a period of about one week around the egg release is fertility window. Unprotected intercourse during this fertility window can cause pregnancy. Your intercourse was far away from this fertility window; hence you do not have to be concerned about the pregnancy. One more advice : Intercourse done during menses carries the risk of infection and some other risks to the woman. Please avoid these days for sexual contacts. I hope this helps you.

We met for the first time and had sex on July 14, 2010 and many days after. On July 27, 2010 she got a blood test at the doctors and it said she was pregnant and the hcg level was at 27. Im not sure what she told the doctors and if that played a part in the due date or if its based off of ultrasounds and hormone levels but the due date given was April 25, 2011 by her doctor. A due date of April 15, 2011 was given based on a couple unexpected trips to the hospital for spotting. They checked her hormone levels and did measurements of the sac by transvaginal ultrasound at the hospital on Aug. 24, 2010. At the hospital they couldn t see the baby until the following week but tried measuring the sac and said she was approximately 5 weeks and 1 day based on what they could gather and see. She was having sex with multiple guys around the same time period for a while now. When would she have most likely gotten pregnant? Is finding out she’s pregnant within 13 days after having sex and having the hcg level at 27 likely? How soon can you find out you re pregnant by blood tests after having sex? How far along could she have been at the point she found out she was pregnant? How accurate is the due date based on the size of the baby by the ultrasound? How much could false information she’s giving them affect the due date? Also is it possible they couldn’t see the baby if she was more than 5 weeks pregnant (perhaps 7 or 8 weeks)? She’s very dishonest and a habitual liar and I am very stressed and don t want to wait months hoping it s not mine but not knowing. Based on all the facts given and the due date given by her doctor based on the ultrasound pics, what conclusion or opinion do you have on what’s going on and what I should think?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, I have gone through your complete history. Let me answer your questions one by one:1. If she had her menses on July 13 and if you had a solitary intercourse on July 14, it is most unlikely that this intercourse has caused the pregnancy. The egg release takes place 14 days before the next expected menses. Considering her menstrual cycle to be of 30 days, the next menses were expected on August 12 and hence the day of egg release (ovulation) would be July 29. With Last menstrual period (LMP) on July 13, 2010, her due date would be April 20, 2011. Her ultrasonography calculates it to be April 24 2011, which congruent with this calculation. A couple of days difference is no difference in this calculations. 2. It is possible to diagnose pregnancy even a few days before missing a period by Beta hCG test on blood.3. Clinically, we calculate the due date of delivery by formula DD = LMP + 9 months + 7 days. By ultrasonography, the due date is calculated by the size of the embryo, hence it is more accurate. Still usually there is no much difference in these two days. Considering the due date calculated by ultrasonography, she is giving correct information about her LMP as July 13, 2011. 4. Even after considering her history as fool proof, since you had sexual relations with her on the next day of her LMP, you cannot be the father of the child in her womb. However, to prove it scientifically, you may go for DNA test. I am sure this clears your dilemma. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 30 yr.s old woman.

My left breast is heavier than the other and this morning when i squeezed it, clear discharge came out of part of the nipple and white discharge came out as well. I may need a preg test done by blood because 2 came back neg. Are these signs and early symptoms of pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,The first cardinal symptom of pregnancy is missed period. All other symptoms appear about 10 days after missing a period. You have not mentioned about your menstruation. If you have missed your period, then secretions form the breast and heaviness of the breast do support the diagnosis of pregnancy. The urine pregnancy test gives most reliable results if performed on the overnight morning first urine sample done about 8-10 days after missing period. Otherwise, Beta hCG test gives reliable results even few days before missing a period. If you have not missed a period, these symptoms cannot be attributed to pregnancy. You never get cramps in the abdomen in normal pregnancy. Such pains are not good symptoms and indicate Threatened abortion. If you have missed your period and still the pregnancy tests are negative, you have to consider some other possibility for missing a period. You can induce period by taking Tab. Deviry for 5 days. If without pregnancy your breasts are having secretions through the nipples, please get blood examined for Prolactin. Its increased levels cause such secretions in non-pregnant woman.

I m 28 years old and truing to get pregnant for the first time with my husband. My doctor prescribed me 3 months of Cyclo Progynova therapy, because we are trying for the last year or so. My cycles are somewhat ok, but we suspect that maybe my follicular phase is a bit longer (I suspect the ovulation is on 16th or 17th day from the beginning of the period). Is my doctor right and should I go along with this therapy even though I read a lot about side effects?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Cyclo Progynova comes in two forms, white tablets are estradiol valerate while pale brown tablets are estradiol valerate with norgestrel. These pills are good for hormone replacement therapy in menopausal women. They will regularise your menstrual cycles in you; however they cannot help you to conceive. In fact they may stop the ovulation. Have you undergone the investigations to assess your ovulation, patency of the tubes and semen examination? If ovulation is the problem, Clomiphene citrate tablets may help you; may be in association with Metformin. Before taking these tablets, first get your ovulation monitoring done by ultrasonography. If it reveals that you are not ovulating, then only go for these tablets. However, your history informs that you are ovulating on 16-17 day of cycle. Ovulation on day 16 is not a problem so long as the secretory phase is 14 days. If it is shorter, you may require progesterone supplementation in secretory phase to help good implantation and support to the pregnancy. If there is no problem with your ovulation and secretory phase, the cause of non-conception could be in the tubes or with husband. Please get Hysterosalpingography done for your tube testing and also husband's semen examination. The reports of these investigations may demand for different line of treatment. After complete investigations, you may ask me Direct question for further follow up discussion and advice. I hope this gives you guidance.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I am currently 10 weeks and 4 days pregnant and have two previous miscarriages, both occured at 6 weeks. I have had an ultrasound every two weeks. My latest was last week at 9 weeks and 3 days and showed a the baby and we heard a healthy heartbeat at 164 BPM. I am currently on 600 mg of oral prometrium daily and the doctor has my progesterone taken daily. My first Progesterone taken was 14 and then dropped to 13 then went up to 39 and my most recent was t 10 weeks and it had dropped to 22.5 so he increased my prometrium to 800 mg of prometrium yesterday. I guess I am looking for a little reassurance hopefully. I am worried, and wondering if this is normal or should I be worried that there might be something wrong since my progesterone dropped so much. I know it is normal for progesterone to fluctuate but I feel like that was a major drop. I go back Monday for another blood draw and have an ultrasound schedule next weds. Your feedback and advice would be greatly appreciated. Ashlee","Doctor":"Dear Ashlee,Your thinking is absolutely logical. Progesterone is a hormone which (as it its name suggests) is necessary for maintenance of pregnancy. It has got many functions, however, an important one is to relax the uterus and let it not go into labour contractions prematurely. If the levels of this hormone are dropping down substantially, your doctor has very scientifically increased the dosage of Progesterone. I hope this helps you. I wish, Progesterone will take your pregnancy to term to give you a bonny baby to breastfeed.

This condition needs to be treated on all the three fronts for a successful outcome. To achieve ovulation, you will need to take Clomiphene citrate, may be with Metformin. You should monitor ovulation with ultrasonography and have sexual relationship on and around the day of ovulation. The period after that may be supported by Progesterone or hCG. If clomiphene does not work, you may have to go for gonadotropin hormone injections for induction of ovulation.  Along with the medicines, please have a control on this condition by diet control and exercise. Obesity, particularly increased waist/hip ratio is a characteristic of this condition. So have controlled intake of calories with high protein and low carbohydrate and fat diet. Also, along with the Gymnasium exercises, you should walk for 40 minutes minimum in the morning and evening each with 90 steps per minute.  I hope this advice will help you to have ovulation to conceive.

And when I had looked up the symptoms for CF he seems to have them but had never gotten it checked out because of the fear of getting back bad news.","Doctor":"Hi there,Cystic fibrosis is a condition where the lungs of the person are affected and he/she could have breathing difficulties and repeated infections in the chest, he/she may also have digestive enzyme deficiency as it can also affect the pancreas.This is a genetic condition and the child is only affected if both parents are carriers or patients.A carrier, such as you, do not have symptoms of the disease but can give the disease to his/her kid if the other partner is also a carrier.You need to get your partner checked if he is a carrier of the defective cystic fibrosis gene or not. If he is not a carrier then there is no risk of your child developing cystic fibrosis.If he is a carrier there is a 1/4 that your baby may have cystic fibrosis, if found positive you need to meet with a Obstetrician who can do amniocentesis immediately.He suffering from cystic fibrosis is very unlikely as most men with cystic fibrosis are infertile and are unable to father a kid.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi,  i am a 26 year old female para 3 and pregnant with number four.

Metformin is known to cause side effects especially in the initial few days of use.Metformin is usually given in women with PCOS problems, if you are having the same then you will require ovulation induction by Clomiphene and/or injectible HMG to get pregnant. But first you need to be completely evaluated for any other problems of infertility, your hormone levels, tubal function need to be checked, so also your partners semen analysis as well.Your overall health including any previous illness, diabetes, thyroid problems need to be ruled out.I would also advise you to take Folic acid if not already started.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"sir, I am having PCOD , & my gnyo has adviced to take flovite & glycomate in the morning after food & in the night glycomate again .

Blood test for pregnancy can read positive as early as one week after ovulation if conception occurs. If she was ovulating at the time of the intercourse, conception chances are high and if the test is done at least a week away, the result would be mostly positive. The blood test moreover, is very sensitive and specific and chances of error are very less. You can further confirm with a trans-vaginal sonogram done a few days after the expected period.

These medicines are known to cause developmental abnormalities in the baby. Hence, once the tablets are consumed, the decision should not be reverted to continuation of pregnancy.

The period of gestation is determined either calculating from the last menstrual period if the cycles are regular or from an early sonogram. 2. If there is no evidence of a fetal pole, the sonogram should be repeated, preferably in the trans-vaginal route, after a week. Sometimes, due to miscalculation of the dates, errors can happen, but, the size of the gestation sac is confirmatory. 3. This should be coupled with serial titres of serum beta-hCG. Doubling titres every 2-3 days are observed if the pregnancy is progressing well. With all these done, if it is concluded that there is no progress, then it is a missed abortion. Further management should be planned accordingly. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...

My triple screen was negative but cant t help but wonder if I can have an amniocentesis or if it is too risky? What are the risks for amnio increased too when a pre-exisiting abrution is present?","Doctor":"Hi there,The echogenic bowel and echogenic foci in heart make you at a slightly increased risk of having a baby with Downs Syndrome. You need to take a call about the amniocentesis, which will tell us if you definitely are carrying a genetically abnormal baby or not. This could help us a lot in managing the rest of the pregnancy. Also the echogenic bowel could be due to certain fetal infections which also could be tested in the amniotic fluid. Usually a small amount of amniotic fluid is removed about 20 ml for these diagnostic purposes and these should not cause any problems with placental bleeding or separation.Placental abruption or separation or bleeding is seen in amniocentesis done in the later months later 28 weeks or so. Moreover placental abruption is  a diagnosis of later pregnancy, I would not label a collection behind the placenta at 20 weeks as abruption.Every amniocentesis has a miscarriage risk of 1%, that is 1 in 100 women who undergo amniocentesis have a miscarriage, this has to be kept in mind before undergoing the procedure.It would be advisable for you to undergo amniocentesis as the cause for echogenic bowel needs to be ascertained.Echogenic bowel seen in babies have a risk of having babies who are small for the gestational age and require monitoring for the rest of the pregnancy even if the results of amniocentesis is normal.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am six weeks pregnant.

And also I ve noticed my discharge and urine smells a little stronger then normal, is that normal to?Sorry I have a lot of questions to ask.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Your history of being wet and still feeling dry and sore during intercourse and vaginal discharge suggests that you might be having vaginal infection - mostly trichomonal infection. The discharge of this infection gives the feeling of wetness, however due to soreness causes intercourse uncomfortable, many a times painful. Please get examined from the Obstetrician for any possibility of such infection and if present get treated lest the risk to the baby during delivery. For this infection, both of you will have to undergo the treatment simultaneously to avoid the risk of re-infection.I have to guide you regarding your sexual activities. You are now six months pregnant, hence it is safe to have the sex now. Full insertion of the penis into the vagina should be avoided to prevent the disturbance to the pregnancy. Sex in side positions helps to achieve this. However, after 28 weeks of pregnancy, the uterus becomes more irritable and the increasing size of the abdomen makes it difficult. Hence the sex after this period may be bothersome and risky. . I hope this helps you.

Since the whole story dates back in 2011, by now the baby must have been born. So getting DNA test should not be any problem for you. I hope this helps you. DR.

Also I get lots of tightening in my abdomen throughout the day and after intercourse. It is intense after intercourse. My stomach sticks right out. Another is a few weeks ago I had leakage from my left breast but it was only about a drop of so. But what weird. I have been pregnant before but had none of this before hand. Also my breasts were sore with my other pregnancies and they are not sore at the moment. There is a couple other things. But I would like your opinion on this please help!","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Your history is suggestive of possibility of pregnancy. Let me explain the events you have described. The spotting with pain in abdomen you had in the mid January period is most likely what is called as Mittelschmerz. It the a phenomenon of bleeding with abdominal pain at the time of egg release. Since you had intercourse on that day, the chances of pregnancy are very high. Now you have missed period, moreover you have nausea, tenderness of the breasts with some secretions from the nipples. This is all suggestive of pregnancy. Still if you have any doubt or want a proof of documentation, you may go for urine pregnancy test a week after the missed period. This test gives best results if performed on the overnight morning first urine sample. I hope this helps you. DR. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"My penis has been normal since I know about it. It erected perfectly. It ejaculated perfectly. It aroused normally. On my first night, it erected only about 70% of its full erection. After that it became flaccid. From last 3-4 days it is flaccid. It is not erecting at all and neither is feeling any arousal. In flaccid state, its size varies from 1-2.2 inches. I never had this problem before. I was not able to penetrate. How can you help me with this?","Doctor":"Hi, Consult a urologist and get evaluated. Detailed evaluation is required to find out what exactly causing the symptoms. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"ok when me and my boifriend first had sex it was after my period had already came last month we went three roundsda first 2 we used protection the last one he used the urination method he did it twice before entering me and there was nonthing coming out anywways (pre cum).......................the second time we had sex was a day before my period we went three rounds again the first and second using protection the third time we did the urination method twice before entering me ,,,,,,,,,,,,,he put his penis inside me four pumps then he put a condom on................now my period was suppose to start monday and wednesday i expiernced spotting thursday which is today ..............am i prego........is my period coming.......................................by the way the spotting was pinkish","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, From your history I gather that your first venture of intercourses was immediately after the period and second was just a day before your menses were expected. Both these days fall in safe period. The egg release takes place 14 days prior to next expected period. The egg has a life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a period of about one week around the day of egg release is considered as fertile period. The chances of pregnancy are very high if the intercourse is performed in this period. Your both sessions of intercourses were far away from this period. So there is no chance that you are pregnant. Moreover, you already have started having spotting. So you will get menses in few days. Get rid of the stress. Stress does delay menses. I hope this helps you and assures you.

I then took the morning after pill on sunday morning but on friday found the tip of the broken condom inside me. I am now concerned that i could still be pregnant. Since this i have been taking my pill relatively well and on time each night","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You had taken your pills very regularly. You had only skipped your sugar pills which do not contain active hormonal ingredients. Hence your pills have acted  on your body successfully to prevent the egg release. Your sexual intercourse during which the condom ruptured happened during the phase of sugar pills. Please rest assured that this will not cause pregnancy. Still however, if at all you miss your period, you can get urine pregnancy test performed after a week on the overnight morning first urine sample. Earlier these test may give false negative results. Alternatively, you may opt for Beta hCG test which can give reliable results even before missing a period. And finally before I conclude, a practical advice regarding the use of condom to avoid any further such accident. Usually condom ruptures  because the air gets trapped in the tit in front. So when ejaculation takes place, the pressure inside the tit increases resulting into its rupture. Hence, while putting on condom, tit should be pinched in the fingers to expel all the air and then it should be worn on the erected penis while the tit is pinched. I am sure, this will not only solve your query; but help you in future for proper use of condom also. If you are impressed with this information, you consider casting a 'Helpful' vote for this communication.

Tab. Mifepristone 200 mg followed by Tab. Misoprostol 800 microgm 24-48 hours later are very effective in terminating pregnancy up to 9 weeks duration. These medicines are very successful no doubt; however, if occasionally they fail, they have ill effects on the development of the baby. Hence if these medicines fail to effect abortion, the decision should not be reverted to the continuation of pregnancy. In such event, the pregnancy should be terminated by evacuation of the uterus. At this stage, uterus can be aspirated by Karman's cannula and MVA syringe to effect and complete the abortion. These medicines are not over the counter medicines and  should be obtained only by Obstetrician's prescription and taken under supervision. It is advisable to report to the Obstetrician 7 days after taking the medicines irrespective of the success or failure of the medicines. I always feel it safer to get the ultrasonography done after 7 days to confirm the completeness of the abortion.  I hope you get the message and proceed for the termination of pregnancy only with the help of an Obstetrician. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"HI, I missed my period, i took apregnancy test and it was clearly psitive within 2 minutes (slightly light pink) then i wnt to doc. her test was negative .again next morning i testet it turned positive after two days test turned again negative and it was firs mornig sample.Am i pregnant?????","Doctor":"Haallow Dear,Your two positive tests are more supporting the possibility of pregnancy. The two negative tests may be false negative. These tests if performed in the first week of missed period may give false negative results. Moreover, since you are performing the test at home on the overnight first morning urine sample, the hormones (hCG) in this urine are concentrated and hence the chances of more reliable results. When you go to the doctor, the urine you collect is a random sample which may have dilute hormones in the early stage of pregnancy. However, your second test with the doctor was on morning first urine sample. To get rid of the dilemma, I would suggest you to get Beta hCG test done which is very specific and highly sensitive. The results of this test are quite conclusive even few days before you miss your period. I hope this guides you to the better method.

Mifepristone followed by Tab. Misoprostol are the medicines which can terminate the pregnancy successfully up to 9 weeks of gestation. However, these medicines should be taken only with Obstetrician's advice and under supervision to avoid the complications. These medicines are known to cause developmental abnormalities in the baby and hence if they fail, the pregnancy should not be continued and termination should be competed by surgical evacuation of the uterus.I would advise you to practise a reliable method of contraception instead of going for termination of pregnancy so repeatedly. Condom, oral birth control pills and  intrauterine devices are very good, reliable and safe methods of birth control. I hope you got the information and the message also.

Having your period come late or skip is not unusual when you stop birth control pills. But there is no reason you need to wait until you start your period to start a new pack.

I thought I was pregnant so I took a pergnancy test and it came back positive, but I have the bloating, running back and forth to the bathroom, and also eat alot what can be wrong with me.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,At the outset let me congratulate you on your pregnancy. Let me solve your queries one by one:1. Frequent urination is one of the cardinal symptoms of pregnancy. This is due to the pressure of growing uterus on the urinary bladder. Therefore, if you do not have any other urinary problems, you may ignore this issue. 2. You are eating very frequently and that too sumptuous amount of food. This is naturally leading to  bloating due to gaseous distension. Please modify your eating habits. Have small feeds 6 times a day at the interval of 3-4 hours. As far as possible have bland diet. Avoid spicy food. This should take care of your gaseous distension. Moreover, for immediate relief, you may take some carminative like plain Soda or Gasex tablets. During first three months, I would not press you for any specific diet or any medicines. Eat what you like and what you can digest. If you can tolerate take Folic acid tablets. After 3 months, you will be advised about the diet and medicines when your nausea and vomiting will go away.I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"i go to the doctor wed.

I m not a doctor but I can help but doubt what she tells me. I have a regular 25 day period and I m just wondering how does blood get out and on time EVERY month and sperm cant get it???","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Tight cervix is one of the factor of failure of conception. You have to find out how tight is the cervix. Very tight cervix will cause intolerable pain during your menstruation. Your question is very valid that if your menstrual discharge can come out how is it that sperms cannot go in. My dear, during the menstruation, the uterus is contracting and pushing the lining and the blood out when the cervix will open; while there is no such force for the sperms to get pushed inside the uterine cavity. The sperms swim their own way through the cervix towards the egg. However, if too much uterine force is required to open the cervix, it will cause considerable pain in lower abdomen and low back ache. May be the inner lining of the cervix is not conducive for the sperms. This is called as cervical factor which (empirically thought)  gets corrected after dilatation of the cervix. To have the clarification on your doubt, you may undergo Ultrasonography in which the diameter of the cervical canal and the inner opening can be measured.I hope this clarifies your doubts.

Any advice would be appreciated Thank you","Doctor":"Hello dear,I.understand your concern.In my opinion the spotting during pregnancy can be due to various causes like hormonal abnormalities like thyroid abnormalities, progesterone insufficiency,uterine morphological abnormalities ,abnormal pregnancy,bleeding from cervix etc.In your case as doctor said the definite diagnosis can be made only after repeating the ultrasound.For now avoid physical strain and intercourse.Take good rest and vitamin supplements and others as suggested by your doctor.Take healthy nutritional diet.Best regards..."},{"Patient":"im under a fertilirty specialist who has given me and my husband the home insemination kit. i dont ovulate regularly but do have a regular menstrual cycle. we have done the inseminations over the last four days and today i had some spotting and feeling very sick is there a chance i could be pregnent?","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion the spotting can be due to implantation bleeding.The symptoms of pregnancy like nausea,vomiting,increased urination,sore breast,tiredness usually start 2 weeks after missed period but not this early.Anyways for early confirmation serum or blood BHCG testing can be done after 8-10 days after insemination.Or else wait and check for the period.If at all the period is missed a urine pregnancy test can be done a week after missed period.Avoid stress.Nothing to worry.Best regards..."},{"Patient":"hello i am 33 years old female. suffer from polycystic ovaries and my partner has a low sperm count.

Do you think i could be pregnant?!?","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion the urine pregnancy test needs to be repeated.Even the faint line suggests that there is pregnancy.it is called weakly positive.Weak positive urine pregnancy test is seen in case of early testing,progesterone insufficiency,any abnormal pregnancy like miscarriage or ectopic.In your case it might be hormonal insufficiency.I suggest you to consult doctor as you might need any hormonal supplements.And the test also needs to be repeated after a week.Nothing to worry.Best regards..."},{"Patient":"hi I am 17 weeks pregnant now.When i was tested for Tsh in 13th week it was 9.15uIU/ml(N.R-0.37-6.0)& normal T3 226.49ng/ml(N.R-70-204) ,T4 9.3ug/dl(4.6-12.5)levels.But i was not adviced to use any medicine.Will the increased levels of Tsh effect the foetus?","Doctor":"Hi there,A TSH of 9 in the 13th week is high and should be around 2.5 uIU.You need to start taking thyroid supplements after consultation with a endocrinologist. Do so as soon as possible.Though the threshold of hypothyroidism is 5 in non-pregnant women it is further lowered to less than 2.5 in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy , and 9uIU is way too high. You need to take the supplements.Also regular monitor of TSH during pregnancy will be required.The increased TSH can have some effects on pregnancy like increased chances of preterm labour, small for gestational age.Also delivery events can be more complicated in women with hypothyroidism , and they tend to have a higher chance of caesarean delivery and post delivery bleeding.Taking TSH can help avert these problems.Also some doctors believe that hypothyroidism in pregnancy can affect the optimal development of the baby and can cause problems in learning.Do get on the thyroid medications soon.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"hi there..im trying for a baby at the mo so i was wondering could you help me..i am nomaly on the pill so i dont no my cycle.. after i came off my pill it was 34days till i got them again..does that mean that is my new cycle now??? my last period was the 2th dec so i dont no when im due my period???","Doctor":"Your cycles may remain disturbed for a few months after stoppage of pills.you will resume your earlier fertility and cycles within 3 months or so."},{"Patient":"I'm 17 weeks and 2 days pregnant and I have been having headaches a lot and today it started once I woke up in the morning until now, almost being the next day.

It is like your body recognizing a stressful situation and determining that it is not a good time to get pregnant.  So, if you are not pregnant, the most likely explanation is related to delayed or absent ovulation.  Also, if you are overweight, this sometimes leads to absent or delayed ovulation as well - commonly associated with a condition called PCOS.I hope that this helps and good luck!Dr. Tim"},{"Patient":"Hi Mam, I am married recently and planning not to have child for another 1 year.

My Last Periods was on Feb 1st and EDD is on Nov 10th. Right now in 1st week of 7th month. I have a buisiness meeting in Germany in the 1st week of september. Is it safe to travel and what measures I should take in case of emergency. Kindly revert me back for my request. regards, Rashmi","Doctor":"Dear Rashmi,Travel by air is safe in the second three months of the pregnancy (14 weeks to 28 weeks). After that the uterus goes on becoming more and more irritable and the risk of premature delivery goes on increasing in flight. Though, the aeroplanes have controlled pressure inside, the risk of preterm labour cannot be completely ruled out. So after 28 weeks of pregnancy, air travel, particularly international air travel should be avoided. The airlines also do not accept the pregnant passengers after 30 weeks of pregnancy without certificate from an Obstetrician; and my experience tells that most of the Obstetricians are reluctant to issue such certificate. If the delivery process starts on the board, there are constraints of availability of the facilities for conducting delivery on board. Moreover, according to the international rule, the problem of nationality of the baby arises for them. Of course, being Indian, you can opt for the Indian citizenship for you child, however, depending up on the aerial zone of a nation where the delivery takes place, you can opt for the nationality of that country; or the airline itself being a area of the nation to whom it belongs to, you may opt for that nationality also. This is all greatly complicated, hence the airline rules. I feel you should avoid international travel after 30 weeks of pregnancy. If you are less than that period (7th month), you may choose to travel; however do consider the date of return. If your return is within this time, you may travel. I hope this provides you a clarity in taking your decision.

Shall I consult a Gynecologist or a GP? 2. Is it safe to take Calpol at this stage of pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Calpol is a paracetamol preparation which is safe during pregnancy. However, no medicine should be taken during pregnancy, particularly during first 3 months of pregnancy without an Obstetrician's advise. Self medication should be avoided during pregnancy.  It will; help to bring down your fever.However, you have to find out the cause of the fever - whether it is viral infection or bacterial infection. Depending on it the decision for only paracetamol or additional antibiotics will have to be taken. Moreover, some viral infections during pregnancy are quite notorious for the baby. Hence, please report to your Obstetrician before you take any medicine. Do consult a doctor - Obstetrician and Gynaecologist only before taking any medicine.

If you have symptoms of ED, it’s important to check with your doctor before trying any treatments on your own. This is because ED can be a sign of other health problems. For instance, heart disease or high cholesterol could cause ED symptoms. With a diagnosis, your doctor could recommend a number of steps that would likely improve both your heart health and your ED. These steps include lowering your cholesterol, reducing your weight, or taking medications to unclog your blood vessels.If other health issues aren’t found to be the cause of your ED, your doctor will likely prescribe some common treatments. However, you may also choose natural options — just be sure to discuss them with your doctor first.Whichever route you take, keep in mind that ED is a common condition that’s very treatable. With some trial and error, you’re likely to find a treatment that works for you and your partner.In many cases, changes to your lifestyle and diet can help ease ED symptoms. Lifestyle changes that could help improve your sexual function include exercising and losing weight. They also include stopping smoking and curbing your alcohol intake.With regards- Dr Sanjay Kini"},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor,I am very worried.I am 19 weeks pregnant,and three days ago I unknowingly ate 3-4 ounces of fully roasted (whole)turkey that had been left at room temperature for more than 5 hours!Can listeria regrow after they are killed by cooking?I am so worried for the baby.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. It is true that poor quality or poorly stored processed lunch meat can carry listeria, however, the chance of catching Listeria from properly cooked food left at room temperature is practically nonexistent.

Having completed 2 such tests they confirmed i had an infection and started me on a course of Amoxicillin today. Any further advice would be much appreciated regarding whether there maybe an underlying cause to the low white blood cells and the possible risks to my unborn child? Many thanks B.Buckland","Doctor":"Hello, and i hope I can help you today. Low white blood cells (which are the disease-fighting cells in your body) can occur both as a result of a disease that lowers your white cell count (like HIV) or by consumption when your body is working hard to clear an infection. In your case, your doctors were concerned you had an infection in your body causing your white blood cells to fall. They found the infection in your kidneys and prescribed an antibiotic, which if it works, should clear the infection and your white cell count will return to normal. Your white cell count and your having a kidney infection does not affect the baby at all as long as you are treated properly and follow your doctor's advice. My only concern is that if you truly have a kidney infection, amoxicillin is not a particularly strong antibiotic for urinary tract infections. So if you have taken the medication for a few days and you still have fever higher than 38.5 Celsius, (101f) or bad flank pain occasionally IV antibiotics are needed for treatment.I hope my answer was helpful for you today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"im a female and 24 years.i married before one and half years.i have checked all the test including hsg for getting pregnant.for the past 6 months i have 24 days menstrual cycle.i asked my doctor and she said that both me and my partner hormone starts to work and this is good.but monthly i will get periods.this month i missed my period and now 37 days over.i checked on 35th day home test.it came negative.if i again test on 40th day is it possible to get positive result?plz answer me","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion yours might be a case of unexplained infertility where both the partners are normal and still infertility occurs.Anyway I suggest you to repeat the test after  a week.The result of the test cannot be predicted but it needs to be repeated.Intrauterine insemination confers good results in those with unexplained infertility.So you can discuss regarding that with your doctor.Also avoid anxiety and stress regarding pregnancy as they cause hormonal imbalance and delay fertility further.Relax.Practice regular intercourse on alternative days to increase the chances of conception.Best regards...."},{"Patient":"hi i have a question, my period this month came on two days late and it only lasted maybe a day or a day and a half and was very light. i had a peagnancy test done 5 days ago and it said negative should i go get another one done at the health department? could i still have a chance at being pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion the delayed period with scanty bleeding needs to rule out pregnancy.As the test is negative the chances of pregnancy are rare.I suggest you to repeat the test after a week.If the repeat rest is also negative the pregnancy is ruled out.And the abnormal period can be due to hormonal imbalance due to stress or any.But if this sort of abnormal period continues every month then thyroid abnormalities, stress,overweight or obesity should be checked and treated.Nothing to  worry.Best regards..."},{"Patient":"My girlfriend and I were having sex yesterday and the condom slipped off.

The fact that you have the tendency of acquiring repeated infections in the axilla suggests lowered immunity which should have been evaluated for prior to the pregnancy. Pregnancy itself causes lowered immunity and so, the incidence of abscess formation may rise.

Other health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, anxiety, anddepression.Side effects of certain medicines. Stress. Drinking too much alcohol or smoking. The exam, lab tests, and sometimes mental health tests can help find out the cause of the problem. Tretament is based on cause and include avoiding tobacco and drugs and limiting alcohol.Also, talking about the issue with your partner, doing sensual exercises, and getting counseling may be beneficial. Finding and then stopping medicines that may be causing the problem. In some cases you can take a different medicine that doesn't cause erection problems. Taking prescription medicine that can help you get erections. These include pills such as sildenafil (for example, Viagra), tadalafil (for example, Cialis).

I would like to know if you were a diabetic in the pre-pregnant state also or have high blood glucose levels noticed only during this pregnancy and also if you are receiving any treatment. If you have not received any specific treatment so far, please do it immediately because the fetus can have adverse effects with uncontrolled hyperglycemia. The high epithelial cell count is suggestive of renal pathology. Further evaluation is needed with a nephrologist.

In the lower region of her abdomen and lots of back pains too. I’m so confused.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. If your mother no longer menstruates she is not capable of pregnancy at age 52. At all. Short of in vitro fertilization or women who have had a recent pregnancy (within 2 years) 52 year olds do not get spontaneously pregnant. In a woman of your mother's age, symptoms normally associated with pregnancy can actually be signs of real medical problems. Increasing size of the abdomen with pain can be a sign of cancer, both of the ovaries and the GI tract. Large tumors and fluid in the abdomen can also make an older woman look pregnant. Fluid in the abdomen can also be caused by liver disease So I seriously encourage both you and your mother to abandon the thought of her actually being pregnant (which is really not possible) and make sure she is evaluated for her enlarging abdomen by a regular medical doctor. She should at least have a ultrasound or CT scan of her abdomen to make sure nothing dangerous is going on. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.

High fever and a rash in an adult, pregnant or not, needs to be investigated. There are diseases also, such as Rubella, that can also affect the pregnancy. In your case specifically, I am concerned that you may have scarlet fever. Scarlet fever is a reaction to a strep bacterial invention of the throat. Without antibiotic treatment, the bacteria can spread through your blood and cause infection of your heart valves.

Two days after my cycle, we had sex and he pulled out before ejaculation when he realized the condom had broke. I took Plan B within 18 hours. I am not on birth control. I have been pregnant before. I had cramping after 4 days of taking the pill and then bled for 2 days. Today, I  noticed clear watery discharge from both nipple when breasts are squeezed. No nipple or breats tenderness. How likely is it that I'm pregnant? My cycle shouldn't start for another 3 weeks.","Doctor":"HI,     Thanks for your query.      I understand your concern.    *  Readin your query I feel you have least chance of conception because-       -You had the sex in safe zone of your menses. ( day 8 to 20 are supposed to be fertile period)          _ though the condom was broken, you have taken plan B in 18  hours of sex. Plan B is successful in avoiding pregnancy when taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex.So if at all there is slight chance, it will be taken care of by Plan B.  *Bleeding  & cramping after 4 days of taking pills is due to withdrawal of hormone from your body.Your routine period may be delayed by one week,   * breast tenderness is seen due to side effect of the hormone inbuilt in plan B.     Clear discharge from nipples after squeezing can be seen  after pills.

I am terribly sorry about your miscarriage. Unfortunately, miscarriage, or death of the pregnancy that occurs in the first trimester, happens in one out of every ten pregnancies. If you are over 35 the risk increases to one in seven, and women over 40 miscarry up to 20 percent of the time. For this reason, most prenatal care providers advise women to wait until the first trimester is over to tell their friends and family about the pregnancy. 99 percent of pregnancy losses have genetic abnormalities, and death of the fetus in the first trimester is nature's way of preventing further development of a fetus that would be incompatible with life. A portable ultrasound is just as accurate as a large machine with Doppler in examining a fetal heartbeat in experienced hands. However, if you have any doubts about having the D and C there is no harm in waiting longer and checking another ultrasound. And it is possible for your doctor to send tissue from the D and C for genetic analysis if it it available. I hope I was able to answer your question and that this information was helpful to you.

So you do not need to worry about your wife's pregnancy from the medication the doctor prescribed.However, to properly treat a urine infection the dosing of the medication is typically 500 mg three or four times daily rather than just twice. If your wife completes the medication and her next urine test still shows white blood cells (plus) it should be cultured for bacteria to make sure that the infection is gone, because this dose of septum is frequently not strong enough to properly treat the infection, even in a pregnant woman.So in summary, it certainly is safe to take the prescribed medication for your wife during the pregnancy, and her doctor should consider increasing the dose if the suspected urine infection does not resolve within a few days.I hope that I was adequately able to answer your question today, and that this information was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"My daughter in law is just a few weeks pregnant in hospital with what they say is gallstones and they want to leave it to operate in the 2nd trimester. No she as been diagnosed with glandular fever. She has been given antiboticss Also I believe they gave her morphine. What effects will this al have on the baby?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Contrary to what many may believe, many medications can be used safely during pregnancy without having any effect on the fetus. Many types of antibiotics, especially ones that are derived from penicillin, are completely safe to use during pregnancy. Furthermore, pain relievers like morphine and similar drugs can also be used safely during pregnancy.I am sure that the doctors caring for your daughter-in-law have taken into consideration her pregnancy when deciding what the best medical treatment is for her. If she has infection that is spread beyond her gallbladder, treating her properly is absolutely necessary for her to have a healthy pregnancy going forward.In addition, your daughters doctors advice about operating on her gallbladder during the second trimester is correct. This is the time when the fetus is big enough to be less at risk for the effects of any drugs or medications, and still small enough to make the surgery technically possible without manipulating the uterus.Gallbladder disease tends to get worse while a woman is pregnant because of the hormones, so it is very important that your daughter-in-law follow the doctor's recommendations. It is a common disease that is managed frequently by obstetricians. I am sure that her medical team has chosen antibiotics and other medications to use that will not cause harm to the fetus.I hope I was able to answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring.Best wishes, and best of luck to your daughter-in-law with the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"My wife is 20 weeks pregnant and has an abnormally high heart rate. She did a 24 hour test and her average heart rate is 115. Her blood pressure is normal. The echogram showed no problems. She has to do a thyroid function test next week. Is this anything to be concerned about?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Many women experience a fast heartbeat while they are pregnant, and as long as the doctors evaluation of her heart as well is for other medical problems the can cause rapid heartbeat, such as thyroid disease, are negative than the symptom is likely just due to pregnancy. A pregnant woman's blood volume increases to one half times greater capacity during pregnancy to provide the placenta with oxygen as well is prepare her body for childbirth, so during the adjustment period, her body may just be under some additional stress. Furthermore, if your wife has gained a lot of weight since the beginning of the pregnancy, even ordinary activities can make her heart race compared to when she is not pregnant.So in summary, as long as your wife is under proper medical care and receiving an evaluation, there really is no reason to worry. Furthermore, your wife's rapid heartbeat does not have any negative effect on the fetus so there is no need to worry about the baby in the situation.I hope that I was adequately able to answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Ok, I m 15 and I have sex with my gf quite a bit, but we use condoms and birth control correctly, the last few times I didn t cum while i was wearing the condom, but the other day we had sex and everything seemed normal, except when we went to go try again and she noticed she has a brown discharge on her pad. Could she pregnant? She said it s happened before and her period was just a week ago, and shes irregular, but she had lower abdominal cramping.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Bleeding after sex can occur in women of all ages, but it is not unusual at all when a girl is in her teen years because her own menstrual cycle is still maturing and also chafing inside from sex can occur. Furthermore, any bleeding from the uterus can produce cramps, even if it's at the incorrect time.Condoms are extremely effective in preventing pregnancy if they were applied before any genital contact and remain on during intercourse and when you pull out. Furthermore, the most common sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual period, so if your girlfriend has not actually missed a cycle she really does not need to worry about pregnancy.If your girlfriend herself is also on birth control pills, irregular bleeding and spotting can be a side effect of the pill as well.So in summary, there are lots of reasons why your girlfriend could be bleeding irregularly, but if you are using proper contraception and condoms, pregnancy is not really one of the things you need to be concerned about.If your girlfriend starts to bleed regularly after sex she really should be evaluated by a doctor, as inflammation or infections of the cervix can cause postcoital (after sex) bleeding as well.I hope that I was adequately able to answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor.

Stress, weight changes, traveling, or even worrying about unplanned pregnancy can cause you to miss your period. There are other hormonal conditions and medical issues that can also affect your menstrual cycle.What I suggest you do with this point is just wait and see. Your period is only one week late, so I would just see if you get it later this month. I would continue to use pregnancy protection with your partner during this time if you do not desire pregnancy, because just because you haven't menstruated doesn't mean you don't ovulate.Generally, I recommend evaluation by a gynecologist or medical doctor if you have missed your period more than three months. In addition, medication can be prescribed for you to restart your menstrual cycle if you have hormonal irregularities.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi Sir/Mam, My period normally starts from 25 or 26 of each month and stays for 3 days.

Am i pregnant???","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Contrary to popular belief, many women can miss a menstrual cycle once in a while for reasons other than pregnancy. Stress, weight changes, differences in your daily schedule, and even worrying about pregnancy can delay your cycle and sometimes even make you skip your period.What I can say for sure, which I hope you find reassuring, is that there is no way that you could be pregnant from an encounter that happened before you had to normal menstrual cycles. However, if you had have sex since your last period, I would recommend performing a pregnancy test as the most common sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual cycle.What I suggest you do at this time is, if there is no possibility of pregnancy, just try to wait and see what happens when you're period would be due this month. If you miss another menstrual cycle, it would be prudent to see a doctor for evaluation, as other hormonal problems and medical issues can also be a reason why your menstrual cycle skipped.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi I am 7 weeks pregnant and been throwing up lately. Not everyday but like once every three days or so. Last night I threw up and this morning while at work I coughed and felt i was goin to be sick but was not then when I looked at the tissue there was a streak of blood in the phlegm. I do feel a bit out of breath lately, the same feeling I get when I sometimes eat something that I have intolerance to.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Nausea and vomiting is common in the first trimester pregnancy, and if you manage to irritate your stomach or esophagus enough by coughing and retching you can injure yourself which can result in a small amount of bleeding.However, you may have an underlying stomach condition, such as an ulcer or gastritis, which is only now having symptoms because of the pregnancy. Furthermore, if there's any possibility that the blood was actually coming from your lungs rather than your stomach, there are a whole host of other diseases that need to be considered in that case.I strongly recommend if you have not yet seen a doctor for your pregnancy you do so as soon as possible, or even your family doctor could evaluate you at this point. Tests can be done to help determine if the blood is coming from your sputum or from your stomach.In the meantime, things that can help reduce nausea during pregnancy that lead to vomiting are avoiding eating anything that is highly spiced or fatty, eating frequent snacks throughout the day so you are never really hungry, and making sure that you eat something small before you even get out of bed in the morning. Dry starchy things like crackers generally stay down your stomach best when you are nauseous.There are prescription medications that can be given to help you with nausea during pregnancy. However, natural remedies also exist. Ginger, taken in teas, candies, or other forms especially if they are sweet are very soothing to the stomach. The combination of vitamin B6 and over-the-counter sleep aids, like Unisom, are very effective in treating nausea and vomiting a pregnancy.So in summary, severe nausea and vomiting in the first trimester pregnancy are not unusual, however if you are bringing up blood you really do need a medical evaluation urgently. I'm not concerned about any risk to the baby, however the bleeding may get worse if you are not treated for the nausea and continue to vomit on a regular basis.I hope that I was adequately able to answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 23 years old, I have a 4 month old little girl!! I noticed when i was around 30 weeks pregnant i had a lump in my left breast.. I asked my gyno and she said it was milk build up (something to that extent) i still have the lump!! I am getting a little nervous, i dont want it to be cancer.. I know my percent of having breast cancer at my age in very little!!! It doesnt hurt to touch but it does make me sick when i feel it!!! please help!!!","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Is understandable to be nervous about having a lump in your breast at any age. You are correct in your knowledge that breast cancer under the age of 30 is extraordinarily rare, however any lump in the breast that is present for more than short period of time really should be evaluated.It is not recommended that mammograms be performed in women who are breast-feeding because the calcium in your milk can sometimes cause abnormalities on the mammogram that mimic cancer. However ultrasound, a diagnostic test similar to that which are baby got while you are pregnant, can be performed on your breast to see if the lump is the cyst, or a solid mass.A specialist in diseases of the breast would be a reasonable person to see for this evaluation if your GYN doctor is not willing or able to properly examine you and refer you for the ultrasound. However, I do want to reassure you that most palpable lumps found in women who are pregnant or breast-feeding are due to some clogging or other issues of the milk glands and are rarely associated with cancer.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring.Best wishes and good luck,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi I have this problem, in January I had sex with my ex boyfriend and ever since then I havent had my period.. i have a feeling that I'm pregnant but I dont want to be and I dont want to tell my family because I already sent them through this problem..Im 18 and I can barely take care of myself...my stomach hasnt grown I havent had any symptoms but I thought maybe I had a miscarriage but I didnt have any heavy bleeding please help me","Doctor":"Hello and I hope I can help you today. I know it is difficult, but you need to have a pregnancy test to find out for sure if you are pregnant or not. The stress of worrying about pregnancy and other hormonal abnormalities can cause you to miss your period and pregnancy symptoms are unreliable. You can buy a urine pregnancy test over the counter and follow the directions if it has been at least three weeks from your unprotected encounter.The earlier you find out if you're pregnant the more options you have in terms of what to do next. So I encourage you to just do a pregnancy test as long as your period is late, and if it is negative, it can also ease your piece of mind about the other issues in your life. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I think i may be pregnant but im on the contraceptive implant. I have most of the symtoms like headaches, light bleeding constantly, sore back, sore stomach below the bellybutton, my sides hurt, tender breasts, hot flushes and sickness. Me and my partner have had alot of sex, around 8 - 15 times a week and its always been unprotected, please help?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. The contraceptive implant, if it is not expired (usually it lasts 2 years) is absolutely effective in preventing pregnancy by preventing you from ovulating. This you will not menstruate regularly while the implant is working. Actually the fact that your period is irregular is a sign that the implant is working, no matter how often you have sex. Furthermore, all the symptoms that you describe, like the breast tenderness, hot flashes, headaches and irregular bleeding are all potential side effects of the implant. These side effects tend to get better after the first 6 months of use. So to be on the safe side, you could check a urine pregnancy test, but it is extremely doubtful that any of your symptoms are due to pregnancy. Pelvic pain can also be caused by infections, and you shouldn't see your women's health provider to make sure you do my have a UTI or vaginal infection that could be complicating the issue. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.

I am not sure why your physician is treating your wife in this way. A normally developing pregnancy produces its own HCG, and as long as the pregnancy is alive, the absolute levels do not matter. Sometimes the hormone progesterone is supplemented in the first trimester if there has been bleeding or a threat of miscarriage. Regarding the frequency of ultrasound surveillance, individual management varies by physician. Uktrasound will not harm the baby, however, other than checking for a heartbeat, it has no benefit except to establish the dating of the pregnancy and, after 10 weeks, it can be used to screen the baby for certain abnormalities that can indicate a risk of genetic defects. That test, called the nucchal translucency, is only done once.I hope I was able to answer your question and provide a second opinion for you, and I wish you and your wife the best for the rest of the pregnancy.

So \\"dry humping\\" is completely safe as far as pregnancy and sexual disease transmission is concerned.Sperm dies when exposed to air, so any sperm that may get on your clothes, hands, or your girlfriend's skin away from the vagina will not result in pregnancy even if it accidentally touches her private parts after-the-fact.

There are uncommon causes of vaginal bleeding in the third trimester, namely, bleeding from the placenta or separation of the placenta which can compromise the baby and possibly you, rapidly.It is possible, and most likely, that you are just dilating further; however it is safest for you to go either to the hospital or to see your healthcare provider to get the baby monitored and evaluated and find out the reason for your bleeding. In addition, labor tends to be more rapid with a second child, and if you are significantly dilated it may be better to know that in advance so if you are discharge from hospital you know how quickly to return for symptoms of labor.So in summary, I suggest that you call your healthcare provider and either go see your doctor for evaluation or go to your designated hospital for evaluation.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I am trying to get pregnant, I had the mirena iud placed in march of 08, had it removed november 24 of 10, started trying to conceive that night until november 29th, on november 30th i started what i thought was a period, but it only lasted that day. the past few days i have felt queasy ever morning for about 3 days today, and today i feel crampy ,queasy and i have a clear thick discharge, could I be pregnant or ovulating?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Pregnancy symptoms can vary widely between women, and worrying about conceiving and even thinking about pregnancy can make you notice your normal hormonal variations more acutely than someone who is not trying to become pregnant. Thicker clear discharge could indicate ovulation, loss of your mucous plug (which occurs after ovulation is complete) or the early phase of your menstrual cycle (pre-ovulation) which normally occurs about a week after your period has finished.The Mirena IUD does not inhibit ovulation, so even though the IUD was removed it is unknown when exactly you ovulated during that cycle. To even though you have the IUD removed and tried to conceive for four days following, there is no way to know at this point whether or not you are pregnant.Irregular vaginal bleeding is also common after the removal of the IUD.What I suggest that you do is wait until 2 to 3 weeks from the time you try to conceive and take a urine pregnancy test at that time. Modern urine pregnancy tests are sensitive enough to pick up pregnancy hormone after 23 weeks after conception.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and I wish you the best of luck in conceiving.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"My Sistern in law had sonography yesterday.

In cases of abortions, if the pain is followed by bleeding, these pregnancies cannot be salvaged. In cases of pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy), there is severe pain in abdomen.

If you have never had a disturbance of the menstrual cycle earlier and if you are sexually active, please confirm/exclude pregnancy first. This should be done in the current scenario through an estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres as the urine test may not read well at this stage. A trans-vaginal sonogram also helps to know the status of the pelvic organs and thereby helps to know if you are pregnant. If positive, you can attribute your symptoms to this and the spotting could be an early implantation bleed. If negative, this spotting is likely to be due to hormone deficiency and can be corrected with supplements. This may be a transient defect only. Hope your query has been answered.

Now you have two intentions:1. Maintain the hydration: After each loose motion, please consume a glassful of oral rehydration solution like Electral. You should not get dehydrated. Ensure that you are passing good amount of urine. This is a good sign of proper hydration. Also observe your tongue which should be wet. If you pinch the skin on the back of your hand and release it, it should reform again without leaving the fold of skin. This is another test of hydration. Usually within 24 hours the infection gets washed off. 2. Report to the doctor ASAP. If the infection is not under control in spite of good hydration after 24 hours, you may require some antibiotics. Your Obstetrician will assess and decide about antibiotics. Since you have crossed 38 weeks of gestation, even if you go in labour, there is no harm to the baby; however you should land in labour in a healthy condition. Maintenance of hydration is a key factor. I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ? Please type your query here... I had sex wit my boyfrien in march I got my lmp around the 20 and tn had sex wit a new friend in april bit I didn t get a cycle that mnth and I m currently 16 weeks pregnant can you help me figure out who s the dad??","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,It seems from your history that you had menstrual cycle in March after the  intercourse with first partner and you have missed your period after the intercourse with the second partner in the month of April. If this interpretation is right, then your second partner has to be the probable father of your baby. However, if this interpretation is not correct and if you never had menses after the intercourse with the first partner, then you have to conclude about the probable father of your baby by some scientific tests. The age of the foetus can suggest you about the day when the conception has taken place; thus you can infer which intercourse is responsible for conception. If you do ultrasonography, you will be informed about the age of the baby. Ultrasonography calculates the age of the baby from its size; hence the age is calculated from the day of conception. This will give you the indication of probable father of the baby. Else, you may wait till the delivery and then get DNA test done which will definitely conclude the information about the father of the child. I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Good morning i would like to know my last menstural cycle was on the 13th August 2010 and had inprotected intercourse on the 19th the 20th, 29th and 30th of August 2010, my next menstrual cycle should start on the 8th of September 2010, could i be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,The egg release takes place 14 days prior to next menses. Egg has 24 hours life and the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a week around the day of egg release is fertile period. Your menses were due on 8th September. So the day of your egg release falls on 24th August. Your unprotected intercourses on 20th, 29th and 30th; all fall within fertile period. Hence there are good chances of pregnancy. Apart from missing a period, the early cardinal symptoms of pregnancy are:1. Frequency of urination2. Nausea & vomiting with pica3. Breast changes: Engorgement & tenderness, darkening of nipples & areola with increase in the areolar size and secretions through nipples.The best way to confirm the pregnancy is performing  pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample 8-10 days after missed period. Earlier, these tests may give false negative results. Another option is to go for Beta hCG test which gives reliable results even few days before missing a period. I hope this helps you.

They inserted a pipe by breaking her teeth once they saw her struggling for breath but could not get her to survive that moment. They managed to save her baby but she was no more. They did not even tell the family 1.5 hrs after she died in the OT. And gave a reason later on that a blood clot blocked the supply of oxygen and she had a heart stroke which proved to be fatal.

Not knowing what the symptoms were I took out the ring on Saturday and put it back in on Sunday 5 days later I had unprotected sex is there a possibility that I could get pregnant. I know when you first start the ring you have to wait 7 days however I had the ring in for a month and used it exactly as directed so I figured I was still protected even though I took it out that one day. & now its been 5 days since the unprotected sex and i m having cramping and breast tenderness. This happened last month when my original period was supposed to come before I started nuvaring. Is this normal or could I be pregnant its to early to take test","Doctor":"Hi there,Th effectiveness of Nuva ring is hampered if removed from vagina for more than three hours. Since you had removed it for a day, in the first week of the this cycle it is possible that the hormonal suppression that needs to occur due to Nuva ring might have been affected and caused to have ovulation to occur in this cycle.So yes its possible that you could be pregnant.You should test for pregnancy, 28 days after your previous period. As if pregnancy has occurred it is likely to show by then.Have you taken adequate treatment for the yeast infection?Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am 31 weeks pregnant and have just been very sick.

It is 3 days now since she started her injections to disperse it but in still in a lot of pain. Is this normal and should the pain not begin to easy by now?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.The complication of getting blood clots in the legs, called a DVT, or groin is uncommon but not rare during pregnancy. Normally, the clock will gradually disappear with the aid of blood thinners. It actually takes somewhere between one even more than three months for the clock to actually dissolve and be reabsorbed by the bloodstream. Therefore, the symptoms of pain, and swelling in the leg where the blockage occurred are not unusual while this is taking place.The most dangerous complication of a blood clot in the legs for pregnant woman is if a piece of the clot actually breaks off it can travel through the bloodstream towards the lungs and cause serious complications for breathing and sometimes even death.So symptoms your daughter-in-law should watch out for our shortness of breath, chest pain, or feeling very anxious with a rapid heartbeat.In terms of pain control for right now, applying a hot water bottle (comfortably hot) to the groin or soaking in a warm bath can help to relieve the pain symptoms at this time.Your daughter-in-law should discuss the further management of her blood clot with her doctor but in the meantime it is much too early to see improvement in the pain.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful.Best wishes to your daughter-in-law for the rest of her pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"ay I answer your health queries right now ?

If the pain is present for some time it could indicate that you may be in labor. Then the stitch will have to be removed immediately as it can tear the cervix. It is also necessary that you get examined to see if there is any infection or not, for which specific medicine will need to be given.Also you need to take steroid injection for maturity of the babies lungs,(if you indeed are in labor).Do not neglect these pains.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello Mam,   Iam 35 yrs with 3.5 yrs son.

If you want to be sure, do a urine pregnancy test as this will tell you how many weeks pregnant you are accurately.Ultrasound in early pregnancy is very accurate and can say for sure with a margin of just one week. And it is more reliable than the last menstrual period to tell about the expected date of delivery.

You should not experience any stress during the early weeks of pregnancy while the establishment of the pregnancy in the uterus happens. This means you cannot travel much, leave alone jerky rides. Sexual intercourse, lifting heavy weights also should be avoided during the early and the late trimesters. Do enjoy watching the rides, but please do not ride. As the movement is continuously on during a ride, there is intense pressure on the pelvic region and in turn on the uterus and this may cause hemorrhages and disturbance of the burrowing gestation sac.

Travel by train is the best way at this stage of pregnancy since this causes the least jerks.

During the travel, take as much rest as possible and keep watching the fetal movements and also for any abnormal vaginal discharge. Carry all your medical documents needed.

In the current scenario, I would recommend a proper clinical evaluation by an expert along with an estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres and a trans-vaginal sonogram to know the status of the pelvic organs. This will help to definitely conclude on the status of your possible pregnancy. If negative, you need to think of hormonal imbalances and a possible flare up of your ulcerative colitis causing disrupted cycles. If this is so,  specific management is necessary to correct the situation. Maintenance of a healthy weight is very important. Hope your query has been clarified.

Will the same thing happen again, i.e the problem of two sacs or since this is a normal pregnancy everything will be normal?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Your first pregnancy was a result of induction of ovulation by some tablets (mostly clomiphene citrate). With these medicines, multiple eggs release is known. That could have lead to two sacs (Multiple pregnancy). One embryo would not have been healthy and hence got dissolved. This time, it is your natural ovulation, so the chances of multiple egg release are less, still you have to get confirmed.  Particularly if there is family history of twins, it can repeat.

I understand your concern.  - Please exclude any infection/ fever/ pelvic infection after the miscarriage . consult a gynecologist for that. also get tube testing done if advised by the doctor.  -   It's good that you are calculating your ovulation day before testing for conception.. Actually a usg for ovulation study should confirm ovulation day.   Instead calculating ovulation, you can use LH surge test to know exact ovulation day. & try an unprotected sex  2 days before & 2 days after the estimated ovulation day.   Similarly it's good to confirm good sperm counts by semen analysis ,for geed conception rate.    Looking at your age with both ovulation & semen analysis normal.. you have good chances of conception.   Thanks."},{"Patient":"Me and my partner had sex three days this week, and during those three day are my ovulation days.

Moreover, you urine pregnancy tests performed twice are also negative. So it is unlikely that you are pregnant. First day of the menses were heavy, hence the remaining days were with light bleeding. Nothing to worry about it. Please forget about pregnancy due to this sexual relation and try again a fresh for pregnancy. Wish you the best of luck. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"HI!  I WANTED TO ASK A QUESTION LAST YEAR I WAS TREATED FOR GONRROHEA AND CHLAIMYDIA AND NOW I JUST FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT THIS MONTH JUNE MAKE ME THREE MONTHS AND I THINK I BEEN REINFECTED IF I GET TREATED WHILE PREGNANT DO I HAVE TO HAVE A C-SECTION","Doctor":"Hallow Mumma,Gonorrhoea and Chlamydia are sexually transmitted infections which can be completely cured with appropriate antibiotics treatment. Unfortunately, you have been reinfected by these organisms after successful treatment. Please get treated again with the appropriate treatment to get rid of these infections. These infections are sexually transmitted; hence it is obligatory for both the partners to undergo treatment simultaneously to avoid reinfection. So please counsel your partner to get treated. If there is no obstetric indication for Caesarean section surgery for delivering the baby, these infections - that too well treated do not pose any indication for caesarean section. Successful treatment of these infections will make you as normal as any other pregnant women. Wish you a healthy and bony baby to breastfeed exclusively. DR.

There was no fetal pole and heartbeat but a gestational , yolk sac is seen. Doctor has advised scan after 10 days and said this will be the max waiting time for a fetal heartbeat. I am advised to take hormonal tablets (Conest). I am very much worried and really hoping the best for my baby. Can you please tell me how much possibility is there for a fetal heartbeat and fetaql pole after 10 days. Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Usually by 6 weeks or so the foetal pole and foetal cardiac activity is detectable by ultrasound. If by 7 weeks, it is undetectable, there are following possibilities:1. The ovulation and conception might have occurred late in the menstrual cycle, which otherwise happens 14 days before the next menstrual period.2. There could be mistake in calculating the duration of pregnancy.3. The pregnancy could be without embryo (baby). This is known as blighted ovum. In such case, the ultrasonography image shows corrugated margins of the sac. If the margins of the sac are well rounded, in order to exclude the first two causes, it is a good option to repeat the scan after a week to 10 days. If still the sac is empty, then the diagnosis of blighted ovum is confirmed. However, if the edges are corrugated, it is blighted ovum. Pregnancies with blighted ovum do not grow. If such pregnancy does not abort spontaneously, termination is the requirement. I hope this helps you.

Also I was on the week of my pack where I don t take any pills","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Plan B contraceptives are quite effective provided they are taken in time. Ideally, this emergency contraceptive pill is to be consumed within 24 hours, however not later than 72 hours after unprotected sexual intercourse, to prevent the pregnancy. They have good success rate. If you had sex without condom or if the condom has fallen off in the vagina, Plan B is the most ideal way for you. It is just over 24 hours; i.e. less than 72 hours. So please take the pill at the earliest to have the protection against the pregnancy. If you are on regular pack of contraceptive pills, you have to be absolutely adherent to the pills.

These include:Physical problems, such as injury to nerves or loss ofblood supply to the penis . Other health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, anxiety, anddepression.Side effects of certain medicines. Stress. Drinking too much alcohol or smoking. The exam, lab tests, and sometimes mental health tests can help find out the cause of the problem. Tretament is based on cause and include avoiding tobacco and drugs and limiting alcohol.Also, talking about the issue with your partner, doing sensual exercises, and getting counseling may be beneficial. Finding and then stopping medicines that may be causing the problem. In some cases you can take a different medicine that doesn't cause erection problems. Taking prescription medicine that can help you get erections. These include pills such as sildenafil (for example, Viagra), tadalafil (for example, Cialis).

If there was no deposition of semen in your vagina then pregnancy cannot happen.2. For pregnancy to occur the sperm should meet the egg in the fallopian tube and for this semen should be deposited in the vagina. If your boy friend did not finger you and there was no semen in his fingers when he touched you then pregnancy cannot happen.3. You have written that you got your periods few days after going to the movies. This confirms that you do not have a pregnancy. If a woman has periods after a sexual event then pregnancy is unlikely.

Though her period didn't come yet, I wasn't given any clear answer from the hospital, please help! thank you","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.1. Home pregnancy test is by estimating the beta subunit of hCG in urine. This is positive after 15 days from sex if pregnancy has happened. However there are some limitations when the result can be false positive and pregnancy has not occurred.2. The blood beta subunit of hCG estimation is done in the hospital and this is accurate. This usually is a quantitative estimation and not wrong. Therefore if they have measured beta subunit of hCG in blood and it is negative then pregnancy is not a probability and the home pregnancy test is false positive.3. If in doubt then you can go for a transvaginal ultrasound after 6 to 7 weeks from the last menstrual periods and this will most likely show a pregnancy.

These sperms are very active and swim their way to the ovum for fertilization. Even if you have deposited precum at the opening of vagina, there is chance of pregnancy to her.

Alternatively, she can get intrauterine contraceptive device inserted which will prevent pregnancy. This device then can be further continued which will give her on going protection against pregnancy for few years. I hope this helps you.DR.

I understand your concern.   -  Your problem is both physical & psychological. The thought that the sex may result in pregnancy ( where as you want to delay it ).. has a nigetive approach towards sex.

You can use condom/ your wife can use intrauterine contraceptives or oral cyclical contraceptives - according to your doctor's advise .   - THe cause of your problem may be physical problem too(though, both physical & psychological factors go hand in hand )    You have to get your semen analysis done after 3 days abstinence & consult  a urologist for needful medication.  - Please don't worry, you can safely postpone child bearing for 2-3 years with use of suitable contraceptives.. it will not harm your health.

I am suffering from PCOS. my Beta-HCG report show 5189.2 and my doctor told me that I am 6 week pregnant and my sonography report show 5 week pregnancy. heart beat is till not seen. Doctor advice me to take INJECTION GESTONE DAILY, INJECTION HCG 250 TWICE A WEEK AND EMFOLIC DHA CAP DAILY. KINDLY SUGGEST SOME ADVICE.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, When you have been diagnosed pregnant clinically as well as by ultrasonography, the diagnosis is certain. Clinical estimation of duration of pregnancy is based on the date of last menstrual period (LMP) while ultrasonography estimates it by the size of the baby. Therefore the estimation of ultrasonography is from the day of conception which is about 2 weeks after the menstruation. Hence, there may be discrepancy of about a week or two between clinical gestational age and that by ultrasonography. It is very difficult to visualize baby and baby's heart sounds at 5 weeks duration. Repeat ultrasonography after about a week or more will clarify the picture. So shed off your stress and be ready for the next scan. Inj. hCG and Gestone are prescribed to you to stabilize the pregnancy. You need not be apprehensive about them. Folic acid that is prescribed to you helps the growth of the cells of the baby. It is a good supplementation. I hope this helps you.DR. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi I am suppose to be 6 weeks pregnant, however, last week I had an ultra sound and I measured at 4 (all that was visible was the sac). My last period was December 3rd and I probably concieved on the 17th. Is this normal to have a six week pregnancy only measuring at four weeks?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, The conception occurs 14 days after the last menstrual period. The pregnancy duration is counted from the date of last menstrual period (LMP) while the ultrasonography estimated the period of gestation based on the size and age of the baby; i.e. period of pregnancy from the conception. Hence there is difference of about 2 weeks in the initial phases of pregnancy. I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor My girlfriend have 3month pregnant So the problem is that she don t stop Vomiting ,special in the morning Last time she vomit a blood .I try to bought somethings.

My last period was February 13, 2010. I have a 7 day period. I think its a 28 day cycle. I had sex on February 26, 2010 and again on March 7, 2010. My due date  according to my doctor is November 28. My question is did I get pregnant in February on the 26 or March 7th. At first I mistakenly told my doctor that my last period was on February 18th instead of the 13th but even when I gave him the correct date he still said my due date was on Nov. 28th.  My first ultrasound on April 12th said I was 8wks and 1 day but according to him I was 7 wks because of the measurements of the baby. Can you please predict when I got pregnant?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, With 28 days periodicity of your cycle, the day of egg release (ovulation) falls near February 26 (February 27 to be precise) when your menses appeared on February 13. The chances of conception are more likely to be due to the intercourse on February 26 rather than that on March 07. There are various ways of calculating the Expected Due Date (EDD). 1. 9 months + 7 days from last menstrual period (LMP) : as per this formula, your EDD should be November 20.2. Ultrasonography decides the age of the pregnancy as per the size of the baby and then predicts the EDD. So as per the calculations of your LMP, your EDD is November 20. I hope this helps you.

Platelets are known to fluctuate in pregnancy. But the lowest level should not be less than one lakh. As this will need precautions during delivery. And platelet levels less than 50,000 do sometimes require platelet transfusions. But do not worry as most low platelets in pregnancy are gestational and revert back to normal themselves after delivery. There is not much relation of platelets to diet and there is no recommended diet.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I ve just started dating again after close to two years. I m 60 years old.

Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi, thank you for trusting Healthcare Magic.I understand your concern.Erectile dysfunction (ED) is one type of sexual disorder in men. By definition ED is the lack of ability to maintain the erection process to perform sexual activity well. While an erection is the ability of the penis to tighten with the process of draining blood because of stimulation as part of the process to have sex.Erectile disorders can be caused many things, including:1. Blood vessel disorders2. Abnormalities of the nerve3. Drugs4. Abnormalities in the penis5. Psychic problems that affect sexual arousal.In order to be erected, the penis requires adequate blood flow. Therefore, blood flow disorders can cause erectile disorders. Nerve damage due to diabetes mellitus, alcohol, drugs, can also be the cause of erectile dysfunction. Cigarette chemicals also affect blood flow, so it can also contribute to this erection disorder. Approximately 25% of cases of impotence are caused by drugs that is the type of antihypertensive drugs, anti depression, anti psychosis, sedatives, cimetidine, and lithium.Complete evaluation is required with additional required investigations on suspicion of cause. Nutrition that can help overcome your erection problems is zinc and calcium. Do not take any potent medication without a doctor's supervision to avoid side effects that can harm your health.Thank you,dr.

However, I would first try with clomiphene citrate. Success in ovulation is better to clomiphene than pregnancy rate. For this reason, some doctors prefer Letrazole to clomiphene citrate. Both these medicines do not have ill effects on the foetus. They are safe. During pregnancy, ultrasonography will guide to detect the defects in the baby. If risk for some defects is suggested by nuchal thickness in ultrasonography, then further diagnostic tests like amniocentesis / chorion villus biopsy may be performed. Hope this satisfies you. DR.

Deep insertion of penis or dildo is to be avoided to safeguard the pregnancy from irritating the uterus. The bleeding you are having after masturbation suggests:1. Deep insertion of dildo or2.

Erection problems can have many causes. These include:Physical problems, such as injury to nerves or loss of blood supply to the penis . Other health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, anxiety, and depression. Side effects of certain medicines. Stress. Drinking too much alcohol or smoking. The exam, lab tests, and sometimes mental health tests can help find out the cause of the problem. Treatment is based on cause and include avoiding tobacco and drugs and limiting alcohol. Also, talking about the issue with your partner, doing sensual exercises, and getting counseling may be beneficial. Finding and then stopping medicines that may be causing the problem. In some cases you can take a different medicine that doesn't cause erection problems. Taking prescription medicine that can help you get erections. These include pills such as Sildenafil (for example, Viagra), Tadalafil (for example, Cialis). In most cases this is sufficient for treatment but you should just be patient and do necessary tests.

At this stage of pregnancy, they are quite reliable. If you are breastfeeding your child, you may not get your menses (Lactational amenorrhoea). However, there is always a possibility of pregnancy in this Lactational amenorrhoea. During lactational period there is chance of increase vaginal discharge. The other symptoms do suggest the possibility of pregnancy; however are not exclusive symptoms of pregnancy. In lactational amenorrhoea, if pregnancy occurs, it is difficult to judge the duration of pregnancy. If you are still doubtful  about the pregnancy, please get Beta hCG test done. This test is very specific and sensitive and can give you reliable results even before the period is missed. If this test also reveals that you are not pregnant, please take Tab. Deviry for 5 days. 4-7 days later you should get withdrawal bleeding.

We beleive the water must have been slowly leaking for a month or so (not long but long enough to be concerned about myself and our unborn baby). While I am staying at our parents house until the mold is removed I was in the house for the last month until we noticed it tonight and I was also in the house for several hours while the wood was being removed and I am nervous about the exposure with spores in the air as well now.

If you had allergic signs like stuffy / running nose/ cough/sneezing/ asthmatic attack , in last one month.. that indicates you had health problems due to mold. Even if you you had them..  but it may not affect your baby because of your resistance. Still you can have a through pregnancy  check up  to exclude your doubt.     In case of absent reaction to mould, rest tension free.      Actually, it's the mold treating medication which can be more harmful to baby than direct exposure of mother. It's good, that you are away from home.. in these days of mold clearing.

I have read & understood your concern.   *  Pre eclampsia is a critical condition  in pregnancy, which is liable to turn in Eclampsia which has risk for mother as well as baby. So once pre eclampsia is noted, doctor tries his best to control the situation & avoid further complication.       But in case there is no response to palliative treatment.. delivery of the baby remains the only sure treatment to control blood pressure & avoid complications.Of course the decision   induction/ LSCS is taken with balancing the fetal viability & possible risk.   * Apart from this pre eclampsia itself can cause premature deliver ..on it's own.    So the possibility  of  early delivery  can be guessed by the known  course of the condition itself  , & one has to be prepared to accept it,, and try to control the symptoms & prolong delivery as far as possible.

Usually brown bleeding, which is old bleeding, denotes the risk to the baby. Most of the time, such bleeding starts after the baby has become non-viable (missed abortion). Ultrasonography will give you  information about the status and integrity of the pregnancy. If the pregnancy is no more viable, you will have to undergo the termination of pregnancy. Ignoring may lead to clotting disorders (DIC) or infection.Please report to your Obstetrician about this brown bleeding. I hope this gives you the required message.

This could lead to the values being read as abnormal.If you do not have high BP, HELLP, or abnormal itching or any other symptoms indicating liver diseases, then you need not worry yourself.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"this month i am having a very light period normally i have to use a super tampon adn this month i am easily getting away with a light one. i take birth control and have been taking it for a year or longer now. i take my pill around the same time every night and have not missed one. i usually always use a condom also. this month at around the end of my first week of pills my bf and i decided to try having sex without a condom. it only was for a few minutes and he did not ejaculate inside me. could my light period mean i am pregnant? or what could be the reasons for this? normal?","Doctor":"Hi,   Thanks for the query on health care magic platform.   I have read & understood your query.    If you have taken the oral contraceptives without having a break, this month.. there would be no chance of pregnancy with the unprotected sex you have mentioned.Condom you are using are not needed for contraception.. Yes, but use of condom is definitely helpful in avoiding STD.    Oral contraceptives being hormones tend to cause change in bleeding pattern over the time.. your menses must have been affected by the hormones , showing lesser bleeding this time.    Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have had sex several times this month. We used a condum everytime and I am also on birth control. I try to take my birth control on time but I dont always take it at the exsact same time. I usually take it in atleast a half an hour difference than the usual time tho. I am supposed to be on my period currently it was supposed to come yesterday. But today all I have gotten was clear/white spit like consistancy fluid. It comes out quite often and I feel like I have my period because of cramps and achie pain. I have also noticed my blood sugar dropping very low through out the day. I have never noticed problems with my blood sugar before. Could I be pregnant?","Doctor":"HI,   I have read your query & understand your concern.   Blood sugar level depends on the food intake,   Pregnancy does not have any effect on blood sugar.. except in case of diabetes/ gestational diabetes when blood sugar is raised in pregnancy.So low blood sugar can not be a sign of conception. Your blood sugar might have lowered due to psychological stress leading to less eating.   Yes, in pregnancy vaginal discharge is increased than normal, but it also increases before & after menses. So just rise in vaginal discharge can not be a sign of pregnancy.     half hour difference in  consumption of pill.. does not matter much.. if you have not totally skipped a pill. In addition you were using condom too.. so there is rare chance of conception. Any doubt can be ruled out by HPT after 8 days delay in period.    thanks."},{"Patient":"Hello, I m 27 weeks pregnant and just had my GD test. My results came back today and my fasting sugar level was 141. I m going in next week to take the 3 hour test, but I do have a sinking feeling that my sugar will, again, be high. My question is, is 141 considered very high for a fasting sugar level? Thank you, Sally","Doctor":"Hi Sally,Pregnancy, especially the later months can make women who are prone to get diabetes in the future have high sugar levels. Yes, 141 is a high value and you need to have a detailed sugar level done. Also you need to take care of your diet and check your sugar levels before and after meals.You will need the guidance of a physician trained in endocrinology or a obstetrician with special interest in diabetes in pregnancy.Also we need to monitor your baby, as in women with high sugar levels there are chances of baby putting on excess weight and also increased water around the baby, this may also need early delivery and you may require insulin injection on a daily basis to keep the sugars in control.Best to see a physician soon.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I recenlty discovered that an ex-boyfriend gave me Trich.

Please let me know if this involves any complications.I am worried a lot. Thanks in advance, Say","Doctor":"Hallow Mumma,A single loop of cord around the neck of the foetus is known to get resolved during the process of labour. In such event, normal vaginal delivery without any complication may be expected. If at all it does not and starts strangulating the foetus, caesarean section delivery is indicated. Close monitoring during labour is required to monitor the condition of the baby and the progress of labour. Unresolved loop of the cord hinders the progress of the labour before it causes threat to the life of the baby. You should deliver in a well equipped maternity hospital only. I hope this helps you.

I am 21 on my way to 22 this year and we've been trying for almost a year and no success. I started spotting brown discharge on the 22nd and 23rd of June. The next following day, June 24th, my period came and left July 1st. I had unprotected sex June 29th. On July 3rd, I starts spotting brown discharge and that lasted til the 5th. Also starting july 2nd, I felt like I was going through premenstrul cramps and felt jus a little sick to my stomach. Is there a chance that I'm experiencing pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, I can feel your frustration from your query. There are various ways to detect pregnancy. The cardinal symptoms of early pregnancy are:1. Missing period2. Frequency of urination3. Nausea & vomiting with aversion to the food.4. Breast changes which include engorgement with tenderness, dark discolouration of nipples & areola with increase in areolar size, small tubercles under the areola (Montgomery's tubercles) and secretions from the nipples. It takes about 10-15 days after missed period for the last 3 symptoms to appear. By that time even clinical examination by a Gynaecologist is also quite diagnostic. So just see whether you fit into this picture. However, early pregnancy is never diagnosed only on symptoms and need some confirmatory evidence. After 8-10 days, urine pregnancy test done on the overnight first morning urine sample is quite a reliable test. Earlier, these tests may be false negative. By this time, even ultrasonography also can give you direct visual evidence of the pregnancy. Beta hCG test is very specific and highly sensitive test and can give you the results about pregnancy even few days before missing a period. I feel instead of being stressed in just guess works, it is better you choose one of the above mentioned options to confirm the diagnosis of pregnancy. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I took a pill for abortion October 2 and the 3 and had unprotected sex November 18 is it possible to get pregnant but I took a pregnancy December 7 test it came back negative but I been having symptoms is possible my hcg level isn t normal and have a false negative","Doctor":"HI,    Thanks for the query under HCM forum.

So the pills you had taken on October 2-3 is not likely to offer contraceptive protection on November 18th.    Home pregnancy test is best done after 8 days delay in periods  OR after 3 weeks of unprotected sex.

This delay in the menses could be due to the apprehension for desired pregnancy. If you still want further confirmation, you have two options: ultrasonography and/or Beta hCG test. All the symptoms you are getting are likely to be due to apprehension of pregnancy. At this stage, sex would not be useful for conception. I would advise you to wait patiently for periods to appear. Another alternative is to take Tab. Deviry for 5 days and you will get withdrawal bleeding within 4-7 days. From day 9 onwards, you may go for ovulation monitoring by Ovulation monitoring kit or Ultrasonography. Try to adjust your marital relations on and around the day of ovulation.

Because I had unprotected sex on Friday & Before drinking the pill on Saturday night I had unprotected sex again. When we were done I drank the Pill and again after drinking it we had sex again, But this time with a condom. I need help please, I dont know what to do & I have 2 days left to drink this Pill","Doctor":"Hi,   I understand your query. Plan B is effective when it is taken 72 hours after unprotected sex.   ( Earlier it is taken, more sure is the action).- It is effective for any number of sexes within it's action time.because it acts by postponing ovulation/ not allowing sperm entry in female genitals  to allow fertilization.     I think you should not be tense , you will be protected for all three sexes you refer to. Only thing is as you have taken 2 doses of plan B, you are likely to get hormonal disturbance & delayed period this time-  *  So wait for period patiently,- If delay is more than 10 days, you should exclude pregnancy by urine pregnancy test & get your doubt cleared.  * Plan B has high hormonal content. It is not to be used as contraceptive on routine basis. When you take it once in month, it better to use barrier method contraception in remaining days rather than repeat the hormones repeatedly.  * In case you plan to have regular sex, better option is using monthly cyclical hormones ( Oral contraceptives.)

Use of corticosteroids during first trimester of pregnancy has been shown to be associated with an increased incidence of oral clefts. There is no reported rise in major malformations. Since you are term, there is no need to worry about malformations. Since you are being posted for an elective cesarean section, it is essential that your coagulation profiles are normal. A lowered platelet count carries with it the risk of increased tendency to bleed during surgery and this is why, your doctor wants the levels to be maintained in normal limits.

If I were to treat you, I would ask for a sonogram of the pelvis to look for any hemorrhages and fetal viability, get serial serum beta-hCG titres, put you to absolute bed rest and manage based on the results. In view of your previous history of abortions, it becomes all the more important to suspect another missed pregnancy with your persistent spotting now. Doubling serum beta-hCG titres are a positive sign of a healthy pregnancy. If there is no fresh bleeding now, it is likely that the bleeder may have arrested and hopefully, the pregnancy will continue. Hope you find this information useful.

If you have regular 28-30 day cycles, ovulation would fall mid-way in the cycle and hence easy to predict. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and hence, an intercourse that timed with this period, is the cause of the conception. 2. Serum beta-hCG titres can become elevated as early as a week after conception and there can be a variation from pregnancy to pregnancy. 3. A trans-vaginal sonogram done early in the pregnancy also helps to detect the gestational age with much accuracy. Hope you find this information useful. Take care."},{"Patient":"I am 34 years old.

General anesthesia can induce excessive blood clotting when hormone contraception is used simultaneously. As this is not so in your case, you need not worry about the after effects of surgery. Menstrual pattern can alter after any intervention due to stress and the associated hormone imbalance. Your current symptoms can be a side effect of the medication used during and after the surgery. Please take adequate rest, healthy diet and follow up regularly. Use medication to relieve symptoms. Hope you find this information useful.

I am not aware that i am pregnant that time so after my check up i took those medicines as my doctor recommended. now i am very worry about the effect of those medicines...please help me to answer my questions. thank you very much","Doctor":"hello,I have gone through your query. Here are your answers: 1. Clarithromycin has been shown to cause adverse effects in the fetus in animal studies at doses with serum levels 2-17 times that achieved in humans. Hence, it should be used only if absolutely needed. 2. Carbocisteine is preferably avoided in pregnancy, though no controlled studies are available to establish fetal harm. It is unfortunate that you took both the medications unknowingly. Please report to your gynecologist to plan further management. Fetal DNA tests can reveal some deformities and this is the earliest test available. Anomalies scan, chorion villus biopsy and amniocentesis are the other methods available to detect fetal anomalies.

Leaving smoking helps.   - Hormonal  imbalance can be controlled with  Cyclical oral contraceptives.   - Medicines like Mertformin, Clomiphene  are tried to stimulate ovulation    - If nothing helps, surgical drilling of ovaries is done. * For this you should approach a gynecologist & after pathological tests.    follow her instructions .

My partner and i basically had intercourse like everyday. i did my pregnancy test today 18th October and its negative My period wont be due till the 22nd of this month. How is that possible??","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You have performed the pregnancy test on the urine too early. For these tests, overnight first morning urine sample is the best sample as it contains concentrated hormones. It should be performed a week after missed period; earlier, there are chances of false negative results. Alternatively Beta hCG test is very specific and sensitive test and gives reliable results even few days before missed period. I hope this serves the purpose.

I had a normal period the first month on the Loestrin, and took the next two packs simultaneously to miss my period for a vacation. After the 3rd pack, my period was very light, much lighter than usual, and much lighter than it was when I was on Loestrin the first time. I take my pill at the exact same time every day, by an alarm clock. Should I be worried about being pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi there,It is extremely unlikely that you are pregnant, Loestrin 24 is a very effective contraceptive and you have been taking it for 3 months that makes you well protected. In fact the chances of getting pregnant on Loestrin 24 is less than 0.03%.So do not worry about it, periods are known to get lighter when on oral contraceptive pills. You need not worry about the light periods, even though you had normal periods before when on Loestrin and they have become lighter you need not worry, the way your body is reacting to the hormonal pill may have changed with time.If you want to absolutely be sure, just do an urine pregnancy test and if its negative be rest assured and continue with the pill without worries.Hope this helpsRegards."},{"Patient":"Hi I am 3 months pregnant.I am suffering from sever constipation.My gyno gave me salt of magnesium,and asked to take 4 teaspoons before dinner, it was on 18/08.2010.today it is friday and i took medication only on 18th.from that time i m having loose motions after every 1 or 2 hrs till evening,at night it happens before i go to bed and not that frequently.I am having lots of pain in the hole from were we pass stool.please help","Doctor":"HiI have gone through your complaints.you are having constipation.first it needs to be corrected otherwise anal pain treatment wil be temparory only.advised to take plenty of water,green leafy vegetables.avoid bread & biscuits.start exercises like walking.for anal pain ,if severe advised to insert lignocaine jel,or sit in luke warm water in tub.both wil releive pain.best thing is to prevent constipation.Thank youRegardsVadundhara"},{"Patient":"Hello, this may sound soo stupid but i was just wondering how likely it is to get pregnant on the same day i came off my period?

I need an advise if the ultra sound can make mistakes about giving the exact right age. hope to hear soon from you best regards","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and here are your answers: firstly, the age of any pregnancy is determined clinically from the first day of the last menstrual period. Secondly, the gestation age in sonogram also is determined on the same basis; a pregnancy detected one week after the missed period is considered as 5 weeks gestation, counting from the last menstrual period. So, based on this, it is more likely that YOU are the biological father. There can be a variation of 3-4 days in a very early pregnancy in a sonogram as this is the period when the age of a pregnancy can be determined most accurately. Hope your query has been clarified."},{"Patient":"Hi,I'm worried I am pregnant. I last had sex June 26, had my period from June 30 to Jul 3. Then 2 weeks after, I had this dark brown discharge from Jul 19-23. I took HPT Jul 20 and it said Negative. It's already August 3 now and I still don't have my period. The last time we did it, he didn't use condom but he didn't cum inside me. PLEASE  HELP! I'm going nuts!","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,If you had your period on June 30, you will not get urine pregnancy test positive on July 20 even if you had conceived. These tests give reliable results only 8-10 days after the missed period. The brown discharge you had could be Mittelschmerz - spotting at the time of egg release.  You had menses on June 30 - 4 days after the intercourse. So there is no possibility of pregnancy from the intercourse on June 26. If you had any intercourse around middle of July, there is a possibility of conception. Even if he has not ejaculated inside the vagina, there is always a possibility of precum being deposited unknowingly inside the vagina. Precum do contain sperms which can fertilize the egg. This pregnancy can be detected by doing urine pregnancy test after August 10. If you had no intercourse after June 30, there is no possibility of pregnancy. In that case, take Tab. Deviry for 5 days and you will get the menses 4-7 days after. I hope this gives you directions.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"iam 25 years old.ihad one baby.i took i pill after an unsafe sex(took ipill after 3 days}.but i became pregnant.after that i consulted 3 doctors.when i asked whether the i pll has any side effect on my featus,two doctors adviced me to abort.but one doctore told me to continue.i continued.now iam 6 month pregnant.but iam very much worried about the side effects.will it affect?please give me the reply","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, It seems, you had conceived before you took the emergency contraceptive pill. In fact they are very effective and you should not have conceived after these pills. Most of these pills contain levonorgetrel hormone. The comprehensive reviews provide strong evidence that exposure to sex hormones [both combination hormonal products and levonorgestrel-alone pills] in early pregnancy does not have a teratogenic effect. Hence there is no necessity for you to abort this pregnancy. Hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I m 15 years old, and I think I am pregnant.

However, if your menses were due on 7th, please wait till 15th and then get overnight morning first urine examined for pregnancy test. Done earlier, these tests may give false negative results. You have another option of performing  Beta hCG test. This test is highly specific and sensitive and will give you reliable result any day after missing the period.If you are pregnant, you may choose for Medical termination of pregnancy.

This month my period got delayed by 11 days as of now and i took two pregnancy tests (one today) and both show negative. is there a chance where i could still be pregnant and why does the home pregnancy test show negative.

If you still have any doubts , blood beta HCG test will be of help to rule out pregnancy. Negative pregnancy test with delayed periods can be just due to hormonal changes.

The other symptoms are:1. Nausea & vomiting with food aversions2. Frequency of urination3. Breast symptoms which include engorgement, heaviness, tenderness, dark discolouration of nipples & areola, increase in the size of areola and colostrum discharge from the nipples. Of course all these symptoms take varied periods to appear. By all these symptoms, pregnancy cannot be confirmed. For confirmation, the best option for you is urine examination for pregnancy test. This test should be performed on overnight first urine sample 8-10 days after missed period. Done earlier, the chances of false negative tests exist. Alternatively you may go for Beta hCG test which is very specific and sensitive even on the day of missed period or even earlier. If you do not want this pregnancy, you may opt for medical termination of pregnancy. Mifepristone and Misoprostol are reliable and effective medicines which terminate pregnancy safely up to 9 weeks of gestation. These medicines have to be taken only by Gynaecologist's advice and prescription.Hope this helps you.

But I have not seen a doctor yet just his nurse and ever time I ask a question i get to answer which makes me worry even more. my hcg keeps going went from 5000 to 32000 and now 42500. should I be worried","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,hCG is a hormone which is produced by chorionic tissue during pregnancy. The chorionic tissue ultimately forms the placenta. Therefore throughout the pregnancy, hCG levels go on increasing. In fact this high titre of hCG levels cause the pregnancy tests positive.For your ready reference, I am quoting herewith the levels of hCG during different stages of pregnancy: 3 weeks LMP: 5 – 50 mIU/ml4 weeks LMP: 5 – 426 mIU/ml5 weeks LMP: 18 – 7,340 mIU/ml6 weeks LMP: 1,080 – 56,500 mIU/ml7 – 8 weeks LMP: 7, 650 – 229,000 mIU/ml9 – 12 weeks LMP: 25,700 – 288,000 mIU/ml13 – 16 weeks LMP: 13,300 – 254,000 mIU/ml17 – 24 weeks LMP: 4,060 – 165,400 mIU/ml25 – 40 weeks LMP: 3,640 – 117,000 mIU/mlI would say that at 7 weeks the titre of hCG 32000 mIU/ml or 42500 mIU/ml are  within normal limits. The baby is growing normally and you need not be worried about. Hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I am currently pregnant. My due date is Oct. 21 which is projected by an ultrasound done in my first tri. I had intercourse with one man on Jan. 10th and another man thereafter... By my projected due date my conception date would have been Jan. 28th, I want to know how accurate this is and if i need to worry?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Due date of delivery is calculated as 9 months and 7 days from the last menstrual period date. You had intercourse on January 10 meaning thereby that the egg release and conception has taken place on 10 January. Thus if you had your conception around January 10, your probable date of menstruation would be 14 - 16 days prior to that as the egg release takes place 14 days prior to the next menses. So let me presume that your menses were on 26 December. Then in that case, the due date would be 2 October. This day happens to be 26 December + 9months + 7 days. 21 Oct is projected by ultrasound. Ultrasound measures the period of gestation as per the size of the baby and hence is supposed to be more accurate. It differs from the due date calculated by LMP by a week or so. I hope this clarifies the dilemma in your mind.

So I would not advise you car travel. However, if you are in a developed country where the roads are in very good condition, car travel is allowable. I would urge you to prepone travel by two weeks. Pregnancy is most stable in the second trimester; i.e. between 12 weeks to 28 weeks. After 28 weeks, the uterus becomes more irritable to stress and strain and thus there is always a risk of preterm delivery due to travel. So try to travel before 28 weeks. And then travelling at a stretch for 12 hours is going to be quite uncomfortable and strenuous for you at this stage of pregnancy. In the car you are in sitting position throughout the travel. I would advise you to have a break after every 2 hours for about 15-30 minutes when you get down from the car, ease out your legs and back, pass the urine and then restart the travel. I know this will increase the travel time by about an hour or more, still it is better for you and your baby. Otherwise the best travel is air travel; however airlines also accept the passengers under 28 weeks of pregnancy and that too with an Obstetrician's certificate.Hope you will reschedule travel by two weeks earlier.

Please include plenty of proteins in the form of bean sprouts, legumes, pulses, eggs, etc., equal amount of carbohydrates in the form of rice, chapatti, idli, jaggary, etc. in your daily diet. Thalipeeth is a very good recipe for Pregnant women. The consumption of fats should not be very high. Consume fats in the form of Cow's ghee or butter. In addition have plenty of vitamins through fresh fruits, green leafy vegetables, etc. They will take care of the constipation during pregnancy also. Total number of calories required per day by an Indian pregnant woman are 2500 KC. Proteins and Carbohydrates give 4 calories per gm while the fats give 9 calories per gm. Accordingly you can calculate the daily diet intake. Iron and Calcium are the needs of pregnancy. Jaggery, green leafy vegetables (coriander in particular) and chillies are good sources of iron. For supplementation of Calcium, take at least 500 ml of full cream milk in two divided servings.  Still they do not supply the required ntrients and hence supplementation with iron, calcium and folic acid tablets is necessary.

We saw a doctor then, got our tests, also got Folicular monitoring and regular sonography/ultrasound done. The doctor told me I was ovulating fine. After the ovulation period, the doctor prescribed Duphaston to me (once a day for 13 days). The treatment got over on the 9th October. Today is October 12 and am 5 days late on my period. I did a urine pregnancy test today and it came back negative. My questions are: 1. Is it too early to take the urine test at home? 2. Does Duphaston generally delay the period? 3. Will going to see a doctor help? Will she be able to tell me if I have conceived or not today? I plan to see my doctor today. Is it worth it? Please help. Am desperate to be a mom!","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Let me answer your queries one by one.1. Yes, you have done the pregnancy test on urine too early. Usually these tests are reliable 8-10 days after missed period; earlier the chances of false negative results are more. You have got another option to go for Beta hCG test which is very specific and sensitive and gives reliable results  even few days before the missed period. Else you may wait for one more week and perform urine pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample. 2. Duphastrone is a progesterone preparation which can delay the periods. I prefer to give progesterone preparations after missing a period; after ovulation, I prefer hCG injections to support the pregnancy. 3. You may see your Gynaecologist after confirming the status of your pregnancy by one of the tests mentioned above. If the tests reveal that you are not pregnant, please discontinue Duphastrone  and you will get menses within 4-7 days.

I stopped straight away but im scared i may have cause damage to my baby. Could this have caused any defects?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Many women find out they have become pregnant after ingesting alcohol, food, or medications that we do not recommend taking during pregnancy. However, in the very early stages of pregnancy, the fetus is not yet developed enough to be at risk in the same ways as it would be when the body and brain have begun to develop.In your case in particular, Duromine, is a mild stimulant that makes your heart beat faster and raises your blood pressure. For those reasons, it is not recommended to be taken during pregnancy, however there is no evidence that it or the class of medication that it represents cause any form of birth defects or harm to a developing baby.So at this early stage of your pregnancy, you not need to worry about accidentally having taken Duromine. In the meantime, you can prepare for healthy pregnancy by avoiding alcohol, eating a well-balanced diet, and purchasing a multivitamin that is designed for pregnant women (prenatal vitamins)I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.This for the rest of the pregnancy,Best wishes Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Is it possible for adderall to cause a false negative pregnancy test? I have numerous symptoms of pregnancy, though according to my calculations could only have conceived as early as the 6th of Feb. Starting this past Monday (the 14th) I became extremely fatigued, and since then became nauseous most of each day, dizzy, weak, headaches, food aversions and odd cravings, raised body temp (avg of 99.1 over the last few days), digestion problems, and am 2 days late for my period. I don t feel like I have a cold or flu, but just am miserable. Could I be pregnant or is there something else that might be going on?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Pregnancy symptoms widely vary between women, and nausea, bloating, headaches, weakness, and breast tenderness can all be caused by an irregular hormonal cycle as well as pregnancy. Furthermore, your basal body temperature goes up after ovulation, whether you get pregnant or not.The most common sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual period.So in your case, the fact that you've had a negative pregnancy test is reassuring, however you really do need to wait until your period is due and if you are late, test at that time. If you perform the test at that time, it is greater than 99% accurate in diagnosing pregnancy.Adderall is a medication that is in a class of stimulants, which will not affect hormone levels and it would not produce a false positive pregnancy test.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"My father, age 80, has type 2 diabetes (treated with Novolog and Lantus), plus cardio vascular disease (Lipitor and he had open heart surgery app. 14 years ago), neuropathy in legs (Neurontin), Alzheimer s (Aracept), and dizzy spells, has just come to live with us.

It was 117 a month ago then it dropped to 100 two weeks ago and now it is 93. My Haemoglobin has also dropped to 10.8 and my iron is 16. Should i be worried and if so what could be the reason for these low counts.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Low platelets during pregnancy the, called thrombocytopenia, is actually a relatively common diagnosis during pregnancy. Gestational thrombocytopenia is a condition where the platelet levels drop to a level around 100 or so as the pregnancy progresses. It is caused by pregnancy itself and usually the levels return to normal after delivery.Platelets are cells within the body that are designed to help clot your blood. Normally, a low platelet count can sometimes increase bleeding time, however during pregnancy your own body produces additional clotting factors that help protect the mother from excessive bleeding during childbirth. If a mother's platelet count is above 50,000, the chance of having bleeding related complications of delivery are extremely low.Your platelets will need to be continue to be monitored until you have the baby, because other diseases of pregnancy can also cause low platelets, and your prenatal care provider will need to watch out for those. In the meantime, your thrombocytopenia does not put your health or the baby's at risk.The only way a low platelet count might affect your labor and delivery experience, is regarding pain relief and labor. Epidural anesthesia is generally not recommended with a platelet count below 100,000. So depending upon your platelet count at delivery you may or may not be eligible for epidural anesthesia.Regarding the drop in your hemoglobin and iron levels, this is also common as the baby's need for iron rises in the third trimester pregnancy. Taking an iron supplement in addition to your prenatal vitamins will help to raise your hemoglobin and maximize your blood count for the lowest risk if you were to bleed heavily during delivery.So at this point, I would not worry about your anemia and your likely gestational thrombocytopenia. Your platelet level should be monitored at least monthly until you deliver, and you should have your hemoglobin retested after taking an iron supplement for an extended period of time.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"i feel like i am pregnant but i am on my normal period but i was over 15 days late then i started and now i am not sure i do have some signs though. my nipples are darker and the bumps on them are bigger and the nipples themselfs have grown. They are also very sensitve but not my boobs. i am haveing sever cramps and i am getting head aches, running to the bathroom, but i dont have any morning sickness or nothing","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Pregnancy symptoms can vary widely between women, and the symptoms of headaches, tender swollen breasts, morning sickness, food cravings, and fatigue can also be produced by an abnormal menstrual cycle, like when your period is late.The most common symptom of pregnancy is actually a missed menstrual period.So the fact that you are on your normal period is reassuring that you are not pregnant. If you desire, you can perform an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test which is just as effective as the ones performed in the doctor's office. If this test is negative, it really is not possible that you are pregnant.So in conclusion, you may perform a pregnancy test if you so desire, but I am sure that all of your symptoms will resolved by the time this menstrual cycle concludes.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"me and my fiance have been together for three years and we never used a condom. he pulls out usually but we have had alot of times when we did not pull out and i was glad i did not get pregnant but for the last month we have been tryin to get pregnant and i just started my period so should i be worried that i cant get pregnant or is it normal to take a while to get pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.When trying to conceive, 80% of couples will conceive within one year. Even though you used the withdrawal method previously, there still is no evidence that you would have any trouble conceiving as withdrawal does reduce the risk of pregnancy by about 75%.Many women assume that if they have not had an accidental pregnancy in their life that they are infertile. This is actually untrue, because contraceptive failure, even with natural methods, is still relatively unusual.So if you and your partner continue to have regular, unprotected sex during the fertile time of your cycle (which is the time between the end of your period until the time you start to feel PMS symptoms) you should be able to conceive eventually.While you are trying to become pregnant, it is recommended that you begin taking prenatal vitamins or of folic acid supplement to help prevent certain kinds of birth defects.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I have been taking cipralex for about 10 years now. I am currently taking 10mg a day. I think I may be pregnant and I am scared of stopping my medication as I suffer from severe anxiety, is there anywhere i can find out some up to date info on cipralrx and pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Cipralex is a medication that is used to treat a number of disorders including depression and anxiety. It is in a class of medications called SSRIs which overall have been widely studied during pregnancy.Some types of SSRIs have been shown to have a withdrawal effects on newborns when the mother has taken the medication in the last three months of pregnancy. These can include jitteriness, difficulty sleeping, and transient rapid breathing called tachypnea. All SSRIs have been shown to have a risk for this to some degree.However, use of the product during the pregnancy has not shown to be harmful or cause birth defects. You may want to speak of health provider about considering changing her medication or tapering it as your pregnancy progresses. There are other classes of SSRIs, like Prozac, which have been to your meant more widely studied during pregnancy and whose effects are better known.So if you are not yet pregnant, it may be worth having a discussion with your mental health provider about your pregnancy plans and possibly changing to a medication that may have a better known safety profile during pregnancy before you conceive. If you are already pregnant, you do not need to worry about discontinuing the medication in the first trimester, as the only ill effects of SSRIs have been noted with use in late third trimester.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your questions today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Im 37 weeks pregnant, and I have had really bad panick attacks at night since about 20 weeks.  They used to only be at night, and now they are during the day as well.  How can I cope with this? I feel as if im going to have a break down and cry, I dont sleep at night, and have a two year old to get up with first thing in the morning. Im exhausted, on the verge of going crazy and Want this pregnancy to be over?! Can I be induced or can I do anything to get this baby out now!!!?  I had this with my first pregnancy and it was alot easier to deal with then because I didnt have a two year old to deal with the next day. HELP!","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Panic disorder is a well documented psychiatric condition the can become worse in pregnancy because of the hormonal changes.If you are having problems coping now, pregnant and caring for your other child, I do not think that having a newborn at home will help your sleeping situation or the stress of your life.I strongly suggest that you discuss your situation with your OB prenatal care provider. There are medications you can take when you have a panic attack that can be used safely during pregnancy.Certainly, induction before 39 weeks of pregnancy is not recommended unless there are serious medical complications for either the baby or the mother. Furthermore, being induced early increases your risk of cesarean section, and recovering at home after cesarean section and caring for two children is certainly more difficult than after a vaginal delivery.So in summary, I strongly suggest you discuss your problems with your prenatal care provider. He or she may be able to give you medication that you can take when you have a panic attack, are also something to help you sleep, that are safe to use during the pregnancy and will help you get some more sleep and therefore feel better during the day.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi today my boyfriend put the head of his penis into me for a little bit. He only had about 2inches maximum of his penis inside of me. He did not cum but there was a clear liquid coming out of the top of his penis that I wiped off before putting it into me. I'm 15.5 and he's 17 almost 18 years old. I was a virgin until today. My last period ended last Thursday. It was 6 days long. Also he was sitting on a bench and I was ontop of his lap facing him ...if that makes a difference. I'm really freaking out right now and was wondering if I could be pregnant and what the odds of a pregnancy are? Also what time of the month is Ovulation? Thank you so much ...Nikki","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Even though your boyfriend's penis was inside you for only a short time, sperm can be present in pre-ejaculate (or pre-cum) and if you truly do not want to become pregnant it is really important to avoid any contact of the penis with your vagina during sexual play.The most fertile time of a woman cycle is in the middle, typically 14 days before your menstrual period would be due. So the time from when your period finishes until you start to feel PMS symptoms is your fertile time.So in this case, since your boyfriend did not ejaculate, it still would be quite rare for you to have conceived. The most common sign of pregnancy is a late or delayed menstrual period. So in your case, you just need to wait for your period to arrive, and if it is late, you can do an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test which is greater than 99% accurate. Pregnancy test do not become positive however until at least 2 to 3 weeks after conception.So in summary, your chances of having gotten pregnant in your particular situation is very very low. For the future, please make sure that the penis is completely covered with a condom if it has any contact with the opening of your vagina. As long as the area is moist, sperm can swim all the way up your vagina from the opening and result in pregnancy. However, the amount of sperm in pre-cum is extremely low so again I doubt that you need to be concerned about this one sexual encounter.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I m 8 months pregnant (my 2nd child), and noticed some dark spots on the inside of my labia majora. I felt it at first while washing. I squeezed/rolled it between my fingers because I get painless bumps at times down there that are just pores blocked with oil and skin cells. It didn t pop , bled, and is sore. I had my husband look, and there are 3 on my right and one on the left side--just the one I tried to pop is sore and raised. They look like blood blisters.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.There are many kinds of moles and spots that can appear during pregnancy on all areas of the body. The vagina and vulva are frequent sites of these lesions because of hormonal changes.If the small spots that you see on the inside of your labia are bluish in color or red, these are called hemangiomas. They are small growths of the blood vessels under your skin; if they are growth of capillaries, they will be bright red (called cherry spots) and if they are venous the spots will appear blue dark purple or black. They're filled with a small amount of blood to if you pop them they will bleed.  The one you already popped may be a little infected, so try to leave it alone and keep the area clean so it may heal.So in the meantime, try not to touch or traumatize them, and as the baby gets larger more may appear. They are simply cosmetic and will cause you no harm or harm to the baby. These types of lesions go away completely once the baby is born and your hormone levels return to normal.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"my wife check the pregnancy kit and found that she is pregnant. She taken some atibiotic drugs in this period of pregnacy because she don t konw that she is got pregnant it is now 15 days form ovulation[The doctor prescribed the atibiotics asked her that whether she is pregnant on consultation and she told that she she is not pregneant]. Is this will affect badly to the fetus?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Many women accidentally ingest medications or alcohol before they find out that they are pregnant.However, there is no fetus that even develops before the 7th week or so, so the effects of medications on a developing fetus would not yet be able to pose any harm to the pregnancy.Furthermore, there are only a few, very strong IV antibiotics that can actually cause significant harm to a developing fetus.  So it is unlikely that the antibiotic that your wife was taking was even unsafe during pregnancy.  Asking whether a woman is pregnant when prescribing medication is a common routine practice and does not mean that the medication prescribed is in any way.So in summary, I do not think you need to be worried about the medication your wife took in this very early stage.  To enhance the health of her pregnancy, she should follow a well-balanced diet, avoid alcohol, and begin to take a vitamin supplement designed for pregnant women.  Your should also choose a prenatal care provider for her and have your first visit about a month from now.I hope I was able to adequate;y answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Should i be worried because i want to have children and my husband and I have been trying {I was on the depo for about a year} when should i expect my body to return to normal {i have been getting a seven day period for the last two months}. My cervical mucus is not clear like egg whites (its like a mixture of clear and white). What should i do?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. It can take a while for the effects of Depo to wear off enough for a woman to ovulate again. However, in your case, the fact that you have had two normal cycles is reassuring that your hormones are working normally. 80 percent of couples conceive within 1 year of trying, so it is not necessary to have any evaluation for fertility problems unless you have been trying for at least a year. The best time to try to get pregnant is between when your period finishes and the time you begin to feel PMS symptoms. Once you get PMS symptoms, it means you are already pregnant or your ovulation had passed. Intercourse every other day maximizes the sperm count per ejaculate. I hope I adequately answered your question today and that this information was reassuring. Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi there, I had an xray done.

HElp, is thee a small chance?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You should be informed that some secretions are ejected from the male penis before ejaculation. This is called as pre-ejaculatory secretions or 'Precum'. Precum is expelled out unknowingly and the male is completely unaware of ejaculation of precum. Since he withdrew his penis just before he ejaculated his semen, it is most likely that he has deposited precum inside your vagina. Precum does contain some sperms. These sperms are capable of fertilizing an egg and cause pregnancy. You have mentioned the dates of your menses; however have not mentioned the date of your sexual exposure. It would have helped me to assess the risk of pregnancy. Now, I will give you the information by which you can assess the possibility of pregnancy yourself. Egg is released 14 days prior to the next menses. Egg is having 24 hours life while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence, a period of 8 days around the day of egg release is fertile window. If you had this venture during this period, you stand the risk for pregnancy. If you have not crossed 72 hours after the intercourse, it is best to take emergency contraceptive pill. If you miss your period, you may get pregnancy test done on the urine 8-10 days after missed period. Done earlier, these tests may give false negative results. Another very reliable option for you, though costly, is to get Beta hCG test performed. This test is very specific and hence highly sensitive and may give reliable results even few days prior to the missed period. If you are pregnant, you have option of Medical Termination of Pregnancy available. I am sure, this helps you.

To prevent-   - Keeping the nipples clean dry.    applying  masse' cream to it will keep it smooth .   Use cotton , comfortably fitting bra.. Using tight bras increase the friction/ injury / depressed nipples.   Skin tends to be dry in pregnancy.. this is due to increased thyroid hormones secretion.. for development of fetus.

While the submucous fibroids carry the maximum risk of causing an abortion, secondary to the submucous variety, subserosal fibroids are rare to cause complications in pregnancy unless they are large enough. If you have a retroverted uterus and hence the posterior fibroid is pressing on the growing uterus, postural treatment can be somewhat helpful. If the sac is getting distorted as has been shown in your case, myomectomy may have to be contemplated to save the pregnancy. This should be managed in expert hands so as not to disturb the existing pregnancy. Uterine artery embolization may not be suggested in view of an active pregnancy. Hope you find this information helpful. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, I was wondering why only some women s noses get bigger during pregnancy. I have researched the issue on the internet and can find little to no information on it. In fact, many women believe that it is only a myth. I personally experieced this during my last pregnancy and I have to admit that it was humiliating. I have no pics of myself during my pregnancy. It was just very swollen and large. It did return to normal after my pregnancy but I am now pregnant with my second child. What is the scientific reason for why this occurs and why some women do not experience this at all. Also, are there any foods, exercises, saline sprays or any other options to help reduce the swelling? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks F. Harrelson","Doctor":"Dear Harrelson,I have seem many patients with such swollen nose in my practice. Such swelling is due to oedema. It may be result of pregnancy induced high blood pressure or urinary infection. With this symptom, it is better to get urine and blood pressure examined. Both these conditions may lead to restrict the growth of the baby. I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Iam in 35th of pregnancy anabout from 2 weeks ago I fear ocasional hot feeling in my face and my head. Also I had rupture of amniotic membrane about 1 month ago, but at present time amniotic fluid is enough . My answer is that these hot feeling with sweating can contribute to infecion of amniotic fluid.","Doctor":"HI,   I understand your concern.    Hot feeling & sweating can not cause amniotic fluid infection.. actually amniotic fluid infection ( which might have started at rupture of amniotic membrane you had ) can cause feverishness & sweating. But that also has other signs of infection like fever/pains/ leaking with foul smell .     You should get examined by a gynecologist to find possibility of infection & management accordingly.      Thanks."},{"Patient":"hi i am 9-weeks pregnant, and today i found a white flaky thing in my urine, is it normal or do i need to see my gynecologist?? apparently it didnt hurt or have stingy sensation but i think i might be running very mild fever i am not sure about this but tomorrow morning i will get a clinical thermometer and check it out. so did the white discharge is a thing to worry??","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,During pregnancy there is little increased discharge due to raised hormones; however it is clear discharge. White flaky discharge you are describing seems to the Candida (yeast) infestation. This is fungal infestation. It can be treated by antifungal vaginal pessaries like Candid vaginal. Please report to the Gynaecologist for confirmation of diagnosis and treatment. You should follow following instructions to avoid re-infection:1. Since this can be transferred sexually, both the partners should take the treatment simultaneously and follow the instructions given below.2. Observe sexual abstinence till both of you are declared completely cured.3. Shave private parts clean.4. Boil underwear daily.5. Use panty liners (for you).6. Clip the nails short.With this you should be cured of the infestation. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"about 2 weeks ago i took a pregnancy test and it was positive. I got really horrible cramps on saturday and have been bleeding since. I have been passing large chunks of ?? which made me feel like i'm miscarrying...I took another test and it still says positive...I really don't think I am pregnant anymore though...I don't feel anything anymore....could I have lost the baby but still have the hormones in me? if so, how long does it stay in my test? when should i re-test to get a true accurate test","Doctor":"Dear Madam,Your history suggests that either you have aborted completely or you are in the process of abortion. Pain in the uterus followed by bleeding suggests that this abortion is at the irreversible stage. Urine pregnancy tests are based on the raised levels of hormone hCG. After the baby becomes non-viable, it requires about 8-10 days for these hormones to be undetectable in urine. Hence, even though the baby is no more viable or you have aborted completely, the urine pregnancy test will take its own time of about 8-10 days to become negative. At this stage, you have to confirm whether you have aborted completely or some tissue is still remaining inside the uterine cavity. If so, the cavity will have to be surgically evacuated. Ultrasound will make the picture clear. So please get ultrasound performed. Report to your Obstetrician for assessment of the condition and any medical assistance if needed. Hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, i am supposed to recieve my periods normally around end month normally but i last recieved last on may 22nd and 23rd and it was short(2days) i had sex severally after that till now july 8th and i would always take postinor 2 after each intercourse.i didnt recieve my periods in june n i took an HCG pregnacy test n i was confused by the result....it was one conspicuos line followed by a faint line...could be pregnant..","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Since you had taken Postinor 2 after each unprotected intercourse, you were well protected against the pregnancy. However, you did not get your menses in June and the pregnancy test showed faint positive results. Faint positive results indicate ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the uterine cavity) or non -viable baby. The former one is rather serious condition which may lead to heavy bleeding in the abdomen and requires emergency surgery. If it is missed abortion, termination is required. You have to report to the Gynaecologist to pin point the cause and get the appropriate treatment. I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"hello, i m mrs deeksha pathak...i m two months pregnant but the problem is i m suffering from hypothyroidism also, my latest report shows that tsh level is under control and i m taking thyroxin of 25 mcg.will you please advice me that i should increase my dosage or continue with the same.","Doctor":"Dear Deeksha,You are on right treatment. The dose of Levothyroxin is to be monitored by TSH levels. If TSH levels are increasing, the dose will have to be increased. As it is during pregnancy,  the need of Levothyroxin is increased. You will have to get TSH levels done repeatedly and frequently to monitor the dose of Levothyroxin. Keep the levels of TSH under 3 mIU.

Usually baby of the first pregnancy is not affected if there is no bleeding during pregnancy. After the first delivery, some blood from the baby leaks into mother's blood and the antibodies to the Rh+ve cells are formed. These antibodies in subsequent pregnancies enter the baby in the uterus and start killing baby's red cells if the baby is Rh+ve. If the mother is not given protection, each subsequent baby gets affected more and more.  Therefore after each delivery antigammaglobulin injection needs to be given to prevent the antibody formation in the mother's blood. The first affected baby of second pregnancy develops severe jaundice due to destruction of red cells in large number. Such baby's require exchange blood transfusion. Subsequent baby's are affected earlier and earlier while in utero. The extent of damage in the mother's blood is assessed by Indirect Coomb's test which measures the titre of the Rh antibodies in the mothers blood. Depending upon the titre, the mother is given injection of Rh antigammaglobulin and the baby may be given blood transfusion while in utero.

Usually such infections get washed off through bowel motions. However, during this phase of diarrhoea, you have to maintain the hydration of the body to avoid dehydration. Oral Rehydration packs like Electral are available with the chemists. Make Electral solution and drink a glassful of it after every motion. You can monitor your hydration by urine output. If you are passing sufficient urine daily, you need not worry. If you are dehydrated, you may have to take intravenous solutions to maintain hydration and nutrition. The pain under the ribs you are having is due to swelling of the stomach due to infection and will go away after the infection is under control. If within 48 hours the infection is not controlled, you may have to go for a course of antibiotics supported by probiotic preparations. Please report to your Obstetrician. I hope this helps you.

Backache at this stage of pregnancy could mean increased stress on the back muscles, cervical incompetence that could be causing the pain, fetal movements and position of the fetus in the uterus causing pressure on the cervix and so on. Urinalysis and a speculum examination can rule out local causes and infections. A sonogram can detect a short cervix and the need for further management including a cervical encirclage. Please get the sonogram done as soon as possible to clarify.

Here are your answers: 1. If you have regular 28-30 day cycles, you should have had a natural period at the time you got married. 2.The fact that you already had a missed period even before you got married suggests that you conceived earlier. 3.A trans-vaginal sonogram done at 6 weeks can give almost accurate gestation age and if you conceived, before consummation of your marriage, it would be evident. 4. If you had the consummation before you were due for your next period, it is difficult to say from which act you conceived, if both acts occurred during the fertile period of the same cycle.

The estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres is more sensitive and also specific and hence carries more significance in the confirmation/exclusion of pregnancy. The urine pregnancy tests can be erratic if not performed as  per the instructions. In the current scenario, you can repeat the blood test after 3-4 days and see if the titres are rising. Though the initial titres are low, a positive pregnancy is indicated when the titres double every 2-3 days. Please remember that tires so low as to go undetected in a blood test cannot give a positive urine test. A trans-vaginal sonogram done a week after the missed period, if you have one, also is useful to clarify the situation.

They can be treated by burning them off with medication you can apply yourself (you need to get the medication from a doctor- examples are Imiquimod, Podophyllin and some others)  or a doctor can burn or freeze them off for you.  A GYN doctor is the right kind of doctor who will be skilled in treating this condition.Condylomata do not pose a risk for pregnancy and it is not recommended to have a c-section to avoid baby's contact with them at birth.  However, the hormones of pregnancy can make them grow quite large, which can possible be uncomfortable or block the introitus (vaginal opening).Therefore, I recommend you try to have the warts treated and removed before becoming pregnant to minimize the chance of problems.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I had a miscarriage in Feb 2015 I got a depo shot straight away I was due a top up August 2015 but decided not to have it as I wanted to get back to normal to try again for another .

They appear during pregnancy. In fact they are one of the diagnostic signs of pregnancy. During pregnancy some milk is being produced which gets stored in the sacs present under the areola. They stand out as Montgomery's tubercles. If you press on these tubercles, some raw milk (colostrum) will be squeezed out of the nipples. So do not be under stress.

The egg is released way back, 14 days prior to the expected day of menstruation and has life of only 24 hours. The sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a period of about a week around the day of egg release is fertile period. Delay in her menses is likely to be due to the stress of the pregnancy. If she had any intercourse during the fertile period, then only she has to be worried about the pregnancy. Pregnancy test on urine about 8-10 days after missed period will confirm the diagnosis. The brownish discharge she is getting could be starting of her menses. If she does not get menses in few days, she may be given Tab. Deviry for 5 days and within 4-7 days she will get her menses.

This can cause infertility, yet, you cannot be branded as infertile within 5 months of marriage. Your husband also needs an evaluation to exclude male factors, if there is no success even after one year. Clomiphene citrate can cause hyperstimulation of the ovary leading to the development of several follicles and sometimes to cysts. Therefore, regular monitoring is necessary while on treatment. This pain you are experiencing needs to be assessed. A sonogram of the pelvis should be done to know the status of the pelvic organs. Please see a specialist for further help.

Tenderness of the breast is a sign of premenstrual phase as well as an early pregnancy. The breast can also be hard to touch at this stage. You should get a home pregnancy test done with a fresh early morning sample of urine. You can also get an estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres for an earlier and better clarification. If you are anxious to conceive, in view of your past history of repeated abortions, it is ideal to have an early evaluation. Sucking of the breast leads to release of hormones that may induce uterine contraction and hence are not good for a pregnant uterus. Hope you find this information useful.

Since your wife has her periods with a span of 4 days every time, she should wait for at least 3 days after the farthest expected day to perform the pregnancy test. That is to say, she needs to wait until the 5th of the month. If you wish for an earlier clarification, you can get the serum beta-hCG titres done. a trans-vaginal sonogram performed about ten days after the expected period also helps to confirm/exclude pregnancy.

If you have been taking the pill regularly without missing any of them, your cycle is protected and the chances of pregnancy are very minimal. Whenever oral contraceptive pills are initiated for the first time, it is mandatory to use additional protection for the first couple of cycles since inhibition of ovulation due to hormone effect may not happen in the first cycle itself. Abnormal menstrual pattern including absent or irregular periods is a feature of pill usage. In the current scenario, I would ask you to see a specialist for further management if you become overdue by ten days.

Animal studies have shown no teratogenecity while there are no well documented human studies. The medication may be used if benefits outweigh the risks.

Men often have prostate glands that enlarge as time goes on during their lives.

Now my period has been late by about 4days and Im starting to freak out if im pregnant or I just skipped a period. I have no spitting or bleeding whatsoever. Do I have a high chance of being pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi,   I understand your concern.   You are on contraceptive pills for last 3 months. This month alos you had taken the pills without any break... only thing is instead of taking the bland pills.. you straight way started with active pills of new packs....    The placebo pills are meant for getting breakthrough bleeding ( which we call menses ).. between two packs. But bu taking new pack gaain you have extended the hormonal effect  for one more cycle. That's why you have skipped one menstruation.     Please don' t worry, if you continue with the new pack regularly, your contraceptive protection would continue.. and you will get bleeding next month while you take placebo pills for 7 days.    - In case you have some doubts, you can stop taking the pills now, wait for 8 days without any pills . You would get bleeding in these days. NOw, you have to throw the pack you were taking & start with a new pack on 5th day again.    thanks.."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ? Please type your query here...

I use 3 months injection and i do not see my periods at all than I drink XANGO bt less than 50ml and it cleans everything in body, than i had unprotected sex on 28 october after i drink coke. Am not sure if am pregnent or not, i wanted to knw if it is possible to get pregnent and i want to knw if i can drink stametta to clean everything","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.The three months contraceptive injection is extremely effective in preventing pregnancy. There is nothing that you can take by mouth, whether it be a cleanse, or any type of medication, that will inactivate the contraceptive. It is also completely normal to have irregular periods when using the three months contraceptive injection.So if you have been current in getting your injection on time, neither ZANGO or Coke or any thing that you ingest orally will inactivate the medication. Things that \\"cleanse\\" the body are usually a combination of laxatives, diuretics, or both which usually result in loss of water from the body, which can result in short-term weight loss. Products like Stametta also are just made from herbs and of no proven medical effects.So again, as long as you are getting your injections every three months, you do not need to worry about pregnancy even if you do not get your menstrual cycle regularly. So it is not necessary to use any medication to treat unplanned pregnancy in your situation.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi there- I had been having blood tests for other things earlier in the year and came back with a GGT of 39. They checked it every few weeks for awhile and it slowly went back down to 29. Now, I am 6 weeks pregnant and new blood work shows a GGT of 43. All other liver number are fine. I m a social drinker (not anymore since knowing I m pregnant!) and I ve been taking omeprazole for the last 10 years for relfux-- I have a weak value between my stomach and my esophagus causing inflammation. I ve switch to pantoprazole a few days ago after find out about my pregnancy, as it is a B grade drug rather than a C. Please let me know what you think is causing the liver problem, as what, as a now pregnant woman I can do.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Many people have one mildly elevated liver enzyme value that is unexplained. GGT is a marker for acute liver damage and is frequently elevated with alcohol consumption, however other things can also affect the levels of this enzyme in your blood. There is even a possibility that the omeprazole that you have been taking could be causing this elevation as a side effect.As long as you've had tests to rule out a medical cause, such as hepatitis or other chronic liver disease, the mildly elevated GGT is not dangerous for you or the baby. Furthermore, it may go back to normal once the omeprazole is out of your system.So there may not be a way to know what actually has caused this laboratory abnormality for you, but as long as it does not get worse during the pregnancy and that you have been evaluated for any type of dangerous liver diseases or problems, it will not pose a risk for you or the baby.I hope that I was adequately able to answer your question today, and that this advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi I just had a Botox in my forehead and eyes and I am trying for a baby but did not no that Botox will effect me. I am now 8 days late from my period and I have done a pregnancy test which was negative. Does Botox effect my periods? I also had a Misscarrige in September. I am really worried and regret having Botox. Is there anything which I can do to get the Botox out my system. Thank you Joanna","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Botox is a medication that normally only affects the muscles that have been injected. If you do not have any unusual side effects from the medication, it is unlikely that it entered the rest of your body and could have any effect on your fertility and your menstrual cycles.The effects of Botox cosmetically persist for somewhere around three months. However, because this medication is not systemically absorbed, there cannot be any exposure to baby if you become pregnant now. The only risk would be at the time of injection, however there are no studies that have been shown that Botox is harmful during pregnancy.However, we do not recommend its use during pregnancy (meaning- not getting the injections during pregnancy) because it's effects on the developing fetus are unknown.There is no antidote to Botox topically in the skin, so you will just need to be patient waiting for the symptoms to wear off. However, because you've not yet conceived, the Botox you use previously does not pose any risk for in impending pregnancy nor will it affect your menstrual cycle or fertility.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was reassuring.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"hi im 27 and im on medication for depression im on amitriptyline 150mg aday for (\`12months now) and valium 5mg aday.ive been trying to concieve with my soon to be husband for 12months with no luck .I had a abortion 4 years ago and he has already a child of 8years old so surely we both are capable of having a baby together ,im really worried as ive read amitriptyline may be causing the problem if so if i stop taking them will this give me more chance thankyou","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Amitriptyline is an antidepressant medication which really does not have any effect on your hormones or ability to conceive.However this medication is known to have an increased risk associated with birth defects, and for this reason, is not recommend to be taken during pregnancy.So it is unlikely that your fertility issues that you have at this point are caused by either of the medications that you take for depression.I recommend if you have not yet done so that you consult with an OB/GYN physician or fertility specialist for evaluation. Even if you or and your partner have both had children previously, that does not mean that new problems can develop with one or both of you. A preliminary hormonal evaluation of you and a test of your husband sperm should be performed at this point. You also should consider discussing your impending pregnancy with your psychiatrist and possibly trying to switch to a medication that can be used more safely during pregnancy.So in summary, I do not believe that your psychiatric medications are actually the cause of your fertility problem, however it would be a good idea to have a plan to switch off these medications as once you conceive they can put the baby at risk for birth defects.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I'm 20 weeks pregnant and have a discharge that changes slightly throughout the day. Sometimes its whitish, sometimes its clear, and sometimes its clear with a yellowish tint to it..it also changes in consistency throughout the day..I have been tested for STDs...Is my discharge normal?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Hormonal changes during pregnancy normally causes fluctuations in the consistency, amount, color, and odor of vaginal discharge.Furthermore, during the second trimester pregnancy, due to changes in your cervix, more mucus secretion is normal. This may produce the yellowish tint that you have been noticing.As long as your discharge does not have a strong fishy odor, and does not itch, likely physiologically normal and requires no further diagnosis or treatment. If you ever notice any discharge that is tinged with blood, or that is accompanied by lower abdominal cramping or is more the consistency of water, you should mention this to your prenatal care provider or be evaluated as these can be indications of other problems.But in summary, the symptoms that you describe are completely normal and are not harmful to the pregnancy.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...hi i am 5 weeks pregnant and at night my anus and vagina itches why is this? It feels almost like I have worms. I get it a little during the day but at night it is so bad i cannot sleep.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.During pregnancy, the hormones of your body change, even as early as five weeks.The hormonal changes of pregnancy make the vagina and surrounding skin more susceptible to candida, or yeast infections. Frequently these infections can cause itching of the skin around and inside the vagina, and even on the perineum and anus.There over-the-counter creams that may be purchased in a pharmacy that are designed to treat yeast infections of the skin. The active ingredient should have the word -azole at the end as this indicates that it is an antifungal product. Examples of these are clotrimazole, miconazole, and terconazole. These products can all be used externally on your skin safely during pregnancy.When you see your prenatal care provider for the first time, if you are still experiencing these symptoms they can perform a vaginal examination and prescribe a different treatment if necessary.In the meantime, try very hard not to scratch the area and where loose fitting, cotton undergarments to sleep and that will not constrict airflow around your perineum.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hello- I am 7 weeks pregnant and I have noticed my husband does not really want to have intercourse anymore...I questioned why he says its just that it doesnt feel the same...he says my vagina is expanding inside..does this really happen during pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.It is true that in late pregnancy, the vagina begins to expand in order to prepare for birth. However, in the first trimester, there isn't really any degree of significant physical change of the vagina that would affect your husband's sensation.However, is extremely common for men to feel uncomfortable or fearful of having intercourse with their wife when she is pregnant. Sometimes it is due to a misconception that sex can in some way hurt the baby your pregnancy, or that somehow the baby can \\"no\\" what's going on or somehow see or feel when his parents are having sex. Many men have trouble verbalizing these fears, and instead have other excuses or explanations for their unwillingness to perform intercourse.Way to help to dispel these myths if possible, is to bring your husband with you to your prenatal appointment and ask your doctor in his presence if it is safe for you and the baby to be having sex. Sometimes hearing an explanation from a doctor can ease the peace of mind of a male partner who is ambivalent about sexual activity. Furthermore, non-intercourse sexual contact can also be used as an alternative if your husband would feel more comfortable that way.Again, I encourage discussion with your local physician, but perhaps my answer will help aid in discussion with your husband in the meantime.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I am 3 months pregnant. I had my last ultrasound after 9 weeks which showed everything to be fine. After that i have started feeling sexually excited. Its been 13 weeks now. I didnt have my ultrasound after that. I masturbated many a times after that. Please suggest if there is anything wrong in masturbating and if my babay is fine ir not?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Changes in libido, due to the hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy, are very common and many women report increase sexual desire during pregnancy, especially in the second trimester. The reason for that is that nausea and vomiting have largely resolved by this point, and yet you are still not large enough to feel physically uncomfortable.Sexual contact, by intercourse or by any other means, is safe and healthy during pregnancy. Masturbation itself is just one form of sexual activity and therefore will not hurt you or to your baby during pregnancy. Some women occasionally feel uterine cramping after orgasm, but this is normal and usually goes away in a short period of time and is not harmful.So in summary, masturbation is not a health risk for you or your baby during pregnancy.I hope that this adequately answer your question today, and that this advice was reassuring.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"my penis foreskin joint with head got torn off at dawn. then bleeding started and I cleaned it with cotton and applied antiseptic ointment over there.It bleeded profusely  then.

Ever since I've had a lot of clear discharge. Yesterday I had a little of pink blood mixed with watery clear discharge, I thought my period was starting but still nothing. Could I be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.The most common sign of pregnancy is a missed menstrual period.If you have been having unprotected sex, you are risk for pregnancy. Pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and symptoms of breast tenderness, vaginal discharge, mood changes, spotting, bloating and the like can be present both in pregnancy and in a premenstrual state.The best way to figure out if you are pregnant or not is to perform an over-the-counter urine pregnancy test. These tests are accurate to the same degree as a urine test performed in the doctor's office, and/or positive within three weeks of conception.So in summary, if you have been having unprotected intercourse, I recommend that you perform a urine test to rule out pregnancy. If you are not pregnant, and have missed your menstrual cycle for three months, it would be prudent to see a local GYN physician because hormonal imbalances and other causes may be the reason you have not menstruated for such a long time and the symptom should be evaluated.I hope that I've adequately answered your question today, and that this advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"hi,i am 7 months pregnant on my second child.had a kidney infection last week,and was with my doctor today.there is now protein and puss in my urine,and has been sent to the hospital for the urine to be examined.is this normal in pregnancy and what causes it..","Doctor":"Hello, I hope I can help you today.Protein in the urine during pregnancy can have many causes, including urinary tract infection of the bladder and/or kidneys. Furthermore, the pus, or white blood cells, in your urine can also be an indication of continuing infection. Therefore, if you had a kidney infection the week before, your doctor may be sending your urine to the hospital to be analyzed for culture to make sure your urinary infection is gone.Untreated kidney infections can be dangerous during pregnancy because the bacteria from your urine can actually pass to the blood and affect your whole body, a condition called sepsis, which can cause severe complications for both the mother and fetus.Sometimes, a kidney infection cannot be cured with oral antibiotics alone, and women need to actually be admitted to the hospital to effectively complete treatment.So I suggest that you follow your doctor's advice, and depending upon the results of your urine test, you may need additional antibiotics or even inpatient admission for treatment of your condition.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"yes i am 23 weeks pregnant and just today I noticed that i have this small piece of extra skin that was never there before at the very end of my vagina on the left side, near the anus, but still on the vagina. I dont know what it is, I know it cant be an STD, but i still dont know what it is.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.The most likely explanation for the extra skin that you notice at the vaginal opening is that it is a skin tag, or a small fleshy growth of extra skin that is caused by the hormones of pregnancy.  If this extra skin borders on the outer skin of your anus, it is also possibly a small external hemmorhoid, which are also common to develop during pregnancy.  You may also notice growth of dark spots or moles you have elsewhere on your body.Fortunately, both of these types of skin lesions will usually shrink considerably or disappear once the baby is born.

If your ultrasound showed a retro placental separation in early pregnancy, if it is resolved now there is no reason you cannot resume sexual activity. If there is any bleeding, however, you should stop and wait until your next ultrasound before attempting intercourse again.

Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 10weeks pregnant and i found that am pregnant only now.This is my second pregnancy.. since i have had irregular periods for so many years and my first pregnancy was achieved with the help of metformin, clomid, injections and artificial insemination, i did not realise that i could get pregnant naturally without the help of meds.Also i have had hypothyroidism for the past 4-5 years..i took levothyroxine and had my thyroid under control during my first pregnancy..however, for reasons of moving to a different country and travelling a lot, i could not follow-up on my thyroid levels and am currently off my thyroid meds since december 2009(for the past 6 months).I am greatly concerned that i had fallen pregnant when i am off my thyroid meds. My family physician took a blood work and told me that my T4 range is normal and my TSH is slightly elevated(went from 4.7 in feb to 6 now while am in the 10th week of gestation)..She put me on Synthroid 0.88 mcg(the dosage that i was taking earlier)..but i am already 10 weeks now and am concerned if my elevated TSH has had any adverse effect on the baby..trying to find answers...please help.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Even though you were not taking thyroid medication, when your doctor checked your levels your T4 levels were normal. Free T4 is the most relevant to pregnancy as this is the actual hormone that crosses the placenta to provide the baby with thyroid hormone. So at the time of your blood test, your baby was not deficient of thyroid hormone. Your TSH level shows how hard your thyroid gland is working to make the hormone. In your case your TSH shows that your thyroid is working a little too hard to maintain your normal level. The additonal hormone your doctor prescribed will help decrease the work the thyroid needs to do and that should make your TSH levels fall. But in summary, your fetus was not deficient in thyroid hormone in the early days of your pregnancy, so you do not need to worry about any consequences. Under the care of your physician, there is no reason that you cannot have a healthy pregnancy.I hope this adequately answers your question and that this information is reassuring.

I have had similar experiences before on the labia minora and my ob/gyn said it was likely due to an infected sweat gland. Any thoughts why this would happen during pregnancy? Do I need to be concerned?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Skin conditions, such as moles, rashes, and boils, can get worse during pregnancy from the hormones. You do perspire more when you are pregnant, so blockage of your sweat gland if it has been a problem for you before can recur. Treatment for this lesion however you did before, whether with warm soaks, antibiotics, or drainage can also be done safely during pregnancy if necessary.I hope I was able to answer your question adequately and that this advice was helpful.

Your falling HCG levels definitely mean your pregnancy is not viable and at some point may result in miscarriage. Depending aon how many weeks along you were, you can have bleeding, even with clots, before you completely pass the pregnancy. So I recommend you follow up with your GYN Doctor so they can perform an ultrasound and check your HCG level again to make sure all the pregnancy tissue has come out. I hope this adequately answered your question and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, I just found out i am 6 weeks pregnant, but the thing is I was on the depo shot. They did a pregnancy test before giving me the shot and said it was negative, but they didnt give me the shot during my period. So now im wondering if this can affect my baby?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. The reason that we try to avoid patients from getting the Depo shot while pregnant is that it does slightly increase the risk of a specific type of birth defect in male infants. This defect can cause blockage in the baby's urinary tract, but it is fully treatable after birth. It can be diagnosed prenatally via ultrasound, and is still a rare disorder. I recommend you speak with a genetic counselor about your individual risk and see a prenatal care provider to check that the fetus is viable.

And what I can continue to do to heal faster.....how long do theytake to dissolve???","Doctor":"Hello. and I hope I can help you today. You had an incision made in the opening of your vagina to help your baby pass, called an episiotomy. It was sutured at the delivery and normally takes 6 weeks to heal completely. The stitches dissolve by themselves by 6 weeks so they do not need to be removed. Being on your feet is not really a risk for injuring your sutures, so you do not need to worry about your visits to the NICU. Symptoms of infection in the area include increased pain over time, green pus discharge and redness. So as long as you keep the area clean, and refrain from sexual activity, the area should heal normally in 6 weeks. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.

Pregnancy symptoms can vary widely between women, and all the symptoms you describe- nausea, bloating, breast tenderness and feeling weak can also be caused by the hormone imbalance that caused you to miss your period. But you can trust the pregnancy test to be reliable if you took it at least 14 days frompossible conception. A delayed cycle can occur from sudden weight loss or gain, traveling or a change in schedule, or even stress. Worrying about pregnancy can even make you stressed enough to miss a period. All your symptoms will resolve once you do get your menstrual cycle again. I suggest you wait until your next period would be due and if you do not get one then I suggest consulting with a GYN doctor to investigate your irregular cycles. But I can reassure you that if your pregnancy test is negative, whatever symotoms you have are not caused by pregnancy.

As the uterus stretches during early pregnancy, it is common to feel cramping that feels similar to menstrual cramps. As long as you have no vaginal bleeding, there is no reason to be concerned. If you develop severe abdominal pain especially on only one side of your abdomen, you should seek emergency care as that can be a symptom of a rival pregnancy, which can be life-threateningIn the meantime, eat a well-balanced diet, begin to take prenatal vitamins, and schedule a visit with a prenatal care provider.

Prgnancy symotoms widely between women, and it is true that symptoms of ectopic pregnancy can include spotting and pain on one side.However, the key point is that these symptoms of ectopic  pregnancy are only relevant along with a positive pregnancy test. If your pregnancy test is negative, then you do not have an ectopic pregnancy.

Unless ejacculation takes place in direct contact with or in very close proximity to the vagina, it really is not possible for sperm to travel up the woman's genital tract to result in conception. Furthermore, sperm dies when it is exposed to air, so there is really no way any sperm survived on your hand to be transferred by touch.

I was prescribed Clarithromycin 500mg at 11 weeks. I took it for 3 days (5 tablets in all) before my midwife strongly advised me to stop taking it. What risk has my baby had as a result of taking this?I had taken Amoxicillin 500mg for 3 days before this but it had no effect on a severe sinus infection, hence my doctor changed over to the Clarithromycin.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Clarithromycin is in a class of antibiotics that can be used during pregnancy, however the risks of taking it are less known than a penicillin-based antibiotic like Amoxicillin. However, there is no evidence that Clarithromycin is harmful during pregnancy, so you do not need to worry about the doses you already have taken. If your infection has not cleared from Amoxicillin alone, I suggest you either finish the Clarithromycin or consult with your physician about an alternate choice for an antibiotic.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was helpful. Best wishes for the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi i have gad a positive pregnacy with my 1st go at ivf. Went for my internal scan 6w 6d but sac and baby there but no heartbeat but a 5mm bean, which they say is the size of a 6 week pg. Got to go back in a week for re-scan. Could I have implanted late?? And what s the chances I will here a heartbeat in a weeks time. Thanks littlemiss","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. The date of conception is known exactly with IVF, as it corresponds with your transfer date. Therefore, there really cannot be a discrepancy in the ultrasound dating with an IVF pregnancy. However, it can be too early to see a heartbeat on a 6 week ultrasound.   Usually, a heartbeat can be seen in 7 weeks, which is why you were recommended to have another one at that time. I hope I was adequately answer your question today and I wish you the best for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I am currently just over 22 weeks pregnant and my breasts have grown over 12 cup sizes already. I used to be a 32d and am now well over a 32k. I have been seen by the breast specialists at the hospital who have told me that my breast are very engorged, with blocked ducts and valves as well as inflammation of the breast tissue however there solution is that I just get on with it. I am absolutely beside myself, I can t sleep the pain is unbearable and the radiologist thinks I have a rare condition caused by pregnancy (which he couldn t give me a name for) and that I should just learn to love my breasts. He also said they probably wouldn t ever return to their original size. I have looked on the net and have now convinced myself I have gigantomastia which is distressing me greatly as some of the pictures on the net are horrendous. I have gained a stone in weight and yet my bump at the moment is only small. I am having trouble functioning and am desperate for help.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. I am sorry that your breasts have developed such a painful condition. You are correct that you may have breast hypertrophy, which is abnormal growth of the breasts, due to the hormones of pregnancy. Gigantomastia describes breasts that increase in size by 2.5kg or greater. Unfortunatley, there are no effective treatments for breast hypertrophy, especially during pregnancy. Hormonal medications really do not work, and elective surgery is not recommended until at least a year after the baby is born, as sometimes the size of the breast does go down on its own. In the meantime, ice packs and supportive, stretch bras, even when you sleep, can help with the discomfort. Limiting your overall weight gain will also help slow down breast growth, as a significant portion of breast tissue is fat. Applying lots of lotion and emollients to the skin will help reduce stretch marks. I am sorry that there is no immediate treatment for your condition, but your breasts may slow in growth as the pregnancy progresses. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi. I was on the depo shot for about 12 years and loved it. I didn t have a period the whole time. I went off of it about 7 months ago and felt awful. Not myself, terrible side effects, weight gain, etc... I decided to go back on it about a month and half ago and immediately felt great. About 10 days ago I started spotting-brown gunk. Not really a period but it s still here. Should Icall my doctor?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. Because of the time you were off the Depo, when you restart it your body requires an adjustment period.  Typically, women  experience irregular bleeding for even 3-6 months before their menstrual cycles stop. The color or amount of the blood really is not relevant, but typically after not menstruating for so long the blood is very dark and even can look black. So I would not worry at this point and I am sure the bleeding will stop and you will feel like you used to once your body re-adjusts to the medication. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hello! First of all, I am 15 weeks pregnant! I also have ADD and have been taking Adderall 30mg daily for almost a year and a half - up until I found out I was expecting, my family physician said not to take Adderall at all during my pregnancy - but my OBGYN said it was ok. She had told me Adderall was a medication C and that it will be safe to take during the second trimester. I am still unsure of how to handle this situation though because I cannot focus what so ever without the Adderall, but I also do not want to harm my unborn child. Thank you very much for your time.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. All prescription medications in the US are given a \\"pregnancy category\\" which reflects the level of research and effects of a given drug during pregnancy. Class A medications have been tested to be completely safe in human pregnancy. Class B medications have been tested as safe in pregnant animals and have had no detrimental effects in pregnant humans. Class C medications have been shown to be safe in pregnant animals, but there are not studies done on pregnant humans. So what that means is that Adderal has been shown to be safe from animal studies and there is no evidence it is harmful in humans. Most obstetricians will be willing to prescribe Class C medications if the benefit of the medication is worth any potential effects on the pregnancy. This is why your OB told you it is okay to take your Adderall, and I am in agreement with her, especially if it is so hard for you to function without it. I hope I was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"my daughter just had an ultrasound is 24 weeks pregnant and the ultrasound tech was concerned because the babes was in the same position it was in during the previous ultrasound.....head down and not moving much.

I have had decreased vaginal discharge this past week(hardly anything at all). Would this indicate that I may have lost my mucus plug? Does the plug have to be discolored? I do remember a large amount of mucus but it didn t have any discoloration to it.","Doctor":"Hi,   I understand your query.  * Vaginal discharge in pregnancy is influenced by hormonal changes during pregnancy.  It is a reaction of uterine lining & some normally residing bacterias in vagina. to the pregnancy changes.  it may be scanty or considerable depending on pregnancy hormonal pattern that time. So please do not be tense because the discharge is less.     It is usually thin,colorless, without symptoms.  The moment you start having symptoms like copious, thick,cheesy/green or yellow  discharge with itching or burning you should get concerned, consult your doctor immediately   * In pregnancy mucus collects at cervix, & comes out as the cervix dilates, It may be clear / pink/ red.       clear mucus  plug indicates beginning of dilatation, & may be followed by labor pains in about 15 days.

I am 30, and I had a mammogram and ultra sound today as a follow up-to a biopsy 6 months ago. Everything is fine, but my question is whether I should wait until next moth to try to get pregnant. Would the radiation affect the baby if I do get pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi, I understand your concern. Radiation  affects  fetus differently at differently.It depends on the time & extent of exposure to radiation.Actually radiation reaches fetus in comparatively less dose, as it goes through mother's body to reach it.   - Radiation exposure in first 2 weeks of conception may cause fetal death.   -  exposure to large  dose radiation(  Like dose received from 500 chest xrays) in early weeks of conception ( 2 to 18 weeks of pregnancy) is  hazardous to fetus- it causes developmental defects in fetus- specially brain developments.- leading to low IQ s & mental retardation or stunted growth./ likelihood to develop cancer in later life.   _ Same type of consequences are observed in fetuses between 18 to 26 weeks when exposed to double the dose of radiation.   -After 26 weeks baby is fully grown & there is no possibility of developmental defects after radiation exposure except for slightly more chances of having cancer in later life.  * Though no  bad effects of radiation exposure of mother  before conception are reflected on   fetuses , the conception should be postponed ,specially when it is a planned conception. It can be easily postponed till next month.   Thanks."},{"Patient":"Respected Mam, According to my LMP i.e 20.01.2015 I am nine weeks pregnant. But the growth shows 6 weeks some days.

One in 2007 and the other miscarriage is in september 2010. We had genetic testing done. Doctor said that they discovered it as chromosomal abnormality that is tetraploid (92xxxx) . Can you please tell me what it is? and is there any treatment for this?","Doctor":"Hi,Tetraploid state is a condition where there are four times the haploid number of chromosomes; in other words, there are two sets of 23 pairs of chromosomes observed. This occurs in 1-5 percent of pregnancies and is most often culminated in an early trimester abortion. Even if the baby survives, the expectancy of life is very short. In the current scenario, you need to take genetic counselling as you had two abortions, increasing the possible risk of another abnormal pregnancy. If it is deemed that you or your partner carry an abnormal karyotype,  sperm or oocyte donation can be thought of as a possible treatment option. Hope you find this information useful.

These include CVS and amniocentesis. Since, you are already 14 weeks, you could go for amniocentesis to confirm the Down syndrome.Also a detailed ultrasound and fetal 2D ECHO by an fetal medicine expert is required .Abortion is to be considered only if a definite pathology is found, with just a raised NT it is not advisable.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"i am 39 weeks and 2 days pregnant many times i get menstrual cramps and suffer from lower back pain so is it that i am in labour and if it is so then y i am not getting it properly and is it that i need to have artifical pain or what other things should be done in order to induce labour pain","Doctor":"Hi there,The last few weeks of pregnancy are the most uncomfortable and also filled with anxiety and stress.

You are still at 39 weeks and should not be worrying.A true labour pain will be increasing in intensity and length of time and will be from loin to groin and is usually accompanied by bleeding or breaking of waters.Do not worry, if you dont get labour pains by 42 weeks then induction of labour will have to be considered.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I recently took a HPT and the result was positive, but other than fatigue I feel like ive had no pregnancy symtoms.

I was married in 2004, and have a baby girl of 4.5 yrs old. Now I am planning for a second child since last 4-5 months. I even visited my gyn. She had suggested to go for a follicular study. My last cycle started on 26th June and then I conducted the Follicular study from 2nd July -till 8th July. Then the doctor told that the eggs are rupted on 8th July and to continue with the relationship for next 3 - 4 days. She also suggested to take the Dubagest - 200 twice a day for 5 days. I just want to confirm whether I have conceived. Does it means that the eggs ruputred is a confirmed pregnancy. It is mentioned in a report that RO - 1) Ruptured & 2) 11mm.      LO 1) 14 mm. Request you to please call me or mail me.","Doctor":"Dear Zainab,In fact the egg does not rupture; what ruptures is the follicle in which egg is situated. After the rupture of follicle, the egg is released (ovulation) which is picked up by the tubes in which the sperms meet the egg and by one of the sperms the egg gets fertilized causing conception. So evidence of release of egg is not an evidence of pregnancy, it is an evidence that you are ovulating normally. Meeting of the sperms is another event and then the pregnancy. The follicles which rupture between 18 to 21 mm of size and ovulate have got better chances of healthy pregnancy. The ovulation from larger follicles has poor chances of healthy pregnancy. To have the evidence of pregnancy, you will have to wait till you miss your period. 7-10 days after the missed period, urine pregnancy test may give you the indication of pregnancy. Done earlier, this test may give false negative result. The other option you have got for early diagnosis of pregnancy is to go for Beta hCG test which will give you reliable results even few days prior to the missed period. I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"hello my name is Samantha i am 36 weeks pregnant i am back pain that comes and goes about every 15 to 20 min and i am have numbness in my right leg that dose not go away i have also gotten sick 4 times today in the last 2 to 3 hours my stomach is very hard and hurts","Doctor":"Dear Samantha,Low back pain at this stage is highly suggestive of opening of the cervix or merging of the cervix into the uterus (effacement). In both these processes, the cervix (mouth of the uterus) gets stretched which causes pain in the cervix. Cervical pain is felt at the low back area as referred pain. If this is your first pregnancy, cervical effacement starts sometime after 36 weeks of pregnancy. Usually the pains start anytime after a week or so. So you have to be prepared for your delivery. You need not be concerned about delivery after 8-10 days as the baby is sufficiently matured after it attains 37 weeks of gestation. Wish you safe happy delivery with a bonny baby. Please breastfeed your child exclusively for 6 months, starting it within half an hour after delivery.

Later on you aborted completely as evident from the ultrasonography. So continuation of this pregnancy is out of consideration. Your belly has grown and you are feeling some weird movements in the abdomen. This is most likely due to over eating due to which your belly has increased in size and you have gaseous problems. Gurgling movements of gases in the intestines is perceived often as foetal movements. I would advise you to take some carminative mixture, plain soda to expel the gases. If needed, you may take some digestive enzyme preparations. Worms also can cause such symptoms. You may take deworming medicine. This should give you relief. Pregnancy starts showing visibly by increase in the size of the abdomen after 16 weeks. So this increase in the belly size cannot be correlated to pregnancy. However, I do  not wish to insult your feelings and perception. I am sure you are honest in describing your symptoms. Therefore, to confirm or rule out your suspicion, please perform urine pregnancy test on your morning  first urine sample.  This will clarify the dilemma. Even ultrasonography can give you direct visual evidence of the pregnancy status. I am sure, this should help you.

With the formation of lower segment of the uterus (retraction of lower part of the uterus), it gets separated and starts bleeding. The bleeding is very profuse. So, the moment you see bleeding, you have to rush to the hospital. In fact I prefer to have these patients hospitalized.The uterus is continuously contracting and relaxing. As you have rightly pointed out, these are Braxton Hick's contractions. However, they are not perceived as pain. Feeling these contractions to the touch should not bother you. It does not indicate the start of premature labour. Please take care and report to the Obstetrician even with the slightest of bleeding.

These infections lead to vaginal itching and pain with discharge. Since during pregnancy the immunological response is poor, these infections are commonly observed. If you are having curdy discharge, it could be fungal infection. Trichomonal vaginal discharge is frothy greenish white while the bacterial discharge is mucoid or yellowish pus. Fungal infections can be treated with antifungal vaginal pessaries, Metronidazole can take care of trichomonal infection while for bacterial infections, antibiotics are needed. Both the partners should have the treatment simultaneously. Please report to your Obstetrician for proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment. During the treatment, please observe the following instructions: 1. Observe Sexual abstinence till you are completely cured. 2. Both the partners have to follow these instruction.3. Clean shave the private parts.4. Cut the nails short. 5. Use soft panty liners.6. Boil the underwear daily. Hope this helps you.

(I am aware that this medication is under Category B, that;s why just want to make sure..) thanks a lot for the advice.. have a great day","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Piperazine salts are used for the treatment of intestinal worms infestation.Piperazine falls into FDA category B. Animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the foetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.Hence by and large this medicine is considered as safe during pregnancy. However, you have to verify the dose of Piperazine. The dosage depends up on the type of worm infesting. Usually this medicine is not prescribed for continuous one month. However, please get the dosage confirmed from your doctor. Hope this helps you.

What would you think?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Your Gynaecologist seems to be correct. However, the period of gestation will play  an important role. If your placenta is not near the opening of the uterus (internal os of the cervix), if the cervix is closed and having sufficient length, foetus in the lower part of the uterus should not cause any threat to the pregnancy. Please have frequent scans to follow the condition of the cervix. If the cervix starts funnelling due to opening of the internal opening, you will require encerclage stitch around the cervix to reinforce the cervix. This stitch will be removed before delivery, any time between 37 to 39  weeks of pregnancy. Meanwhile, keep watch on the uterine contractions. The uterus is continuously contracting and relaxing (Braxton Hicks's contractions). If they become painful, you will have to report to your Gynaecologist who will put you on uterine relaxants. Better take bed rest, avoid weight lifting and avoid exercises. Hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I am 33 wks pregnant with my second child (14 years apart). I walked into the hospital at 9 cm dilated and had no idea I was even in labor (I felt damp in my underpants and was curious since it was not a show) when I had him. I have been getting extreme hot flashes with a lot of tighting in the belly. Come to find out, I am 2 cm dilated, 60% effaced, baby went from a -3 to a -2 in a day....two days ago they gave me a shot to stop the contractions - which I found out it was the tighting that were contractions. since that time, I have had two spells of what seems to be heart palvations, fever and flushed. I am still have contractions, but I only know that because I am now aware of what they are. Should I be worred? 4 days before my appointment, I had the same type of feeling. I did not know I was in preterm labor until my appointment (and the doctor found all that out).","Doctor":"Hi there,To be in a preterm labour is a scary situation. Do not worry, even if you into into labour at 33 weeks the chances of the survival of the baby are very good.The doctors must be trying to delay labour till 34 weeks as that is what we consider to be a important milestone. Babies born after 34 weeks have as good a prognosis as those born at full term.The medications given to you to stop the contractions can sometimes cause the palpitations and flushing and if these symptoms are troubling you , you should not take further doses of that drug .They must have also given you a shot of steroid called betamethasone this is for lung development of the baby and so that the baby does not have any breathing problems once delivered.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"my wife had uterus prolift surgery for prolapse.

The chances of success decrease with increasing age.At 35, she does have a chance but its lesser than what she had before.The other concern is if she gets pregnant the mode of delivery has to be a cesarean delivery otherwise the chance of recurrence of prolapse is there and the prolapse surgery will loose its effectiveness.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"HI this Is Padmavathi..

And even if you took Clarithromycin, it is very effective in birth control, that is you will not get pregnant even though you did not use back up.There is a misconception that taking antibiotics makes birth control less effective, but this depends on the antibiotic, Clarithromycin is not an enzyme inducer, that means it will not effect the ability of the birth control even if taken together with birth control.

I normally have my period for 5 days, with the sore breasts & lower back pain etc. Now out of the 3 months, the 1st 2 months I got my period every 27 days, with no pain or symtoms & it only lasted 3 days.

I took 2 pregnany tests, both negative. I have no guideline now when I could possibly ovulate. Why is my body changing so much? Should I see a doctor?","Doctor":"Hi there,A shift of just 2-3 days in your period does not make it irregular. Periods every 21- 35 days are considered to be in the normal range and you need not worry about it if there is just a change of 2-3 days .I would advise you to try to conceive without medical  help for 1 year as 85% of couple get pregnant in the first year of trying. You should take Tab.Folic acid when you are trying to conceive, this is for proper development of the baby's brain and spinal cord.If at the end of 1 year you are not pregnant, you should consult a doctor, this is assuming you are less than 35 years of age.If you are more than 35 years contact a doctor after 6 months of trying for a baby.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello, I ve had a chesty cough for around 4 or 5 weeks now.

Please tell me on my email id YYYY@YYYY I shall be very thankful of yours.","Doctor":"Hi there,,The above medication are anti epileptics and your wife needs to see a neurologist urgently to see if she is getting the correct dosage and medications. During pregnancy we try to decrease the different anti epileptics to one, if her condition is stable and she has not has a seizure for the last year.This is because the chances of deformities in the baby due to the medication decrease if she takes only one rather than multiple medications.Also she needs to take folic acid 5 mg daily to prevent damage to neural tube.Both epilepsy and its medication can affect the baby, but it is important that her seizures are in control as if she has a repeat seizure during pregnancy that in itself could be more detrimental to the baby than the medication.She will need a detailed anomaly scan at 20 weeks with special attention to fetal heart.And also she need to be seen by a senior obstetrician in a  tertiary care center and by a neurologist throughout the pregnancy.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am 24 weeks pregnet with my 4th child Yesterday morning i woke up with Lower  back pain I stayed off my feet to see if that would help Last night I could not get any sleep becuase no matter which way I laid the pain would not go away i stil have the pain this morning I thought that it was just the baby growing is it something I should worry about?","Doctor":"HI,  I have read your query & understand y6our concern. Pregnancy hormones cause loosening of pelvic ligaments. As a result the pelvis is stretched due to growth of fetus .. this leads to pain in back in pregnancy.   Also as the baby grows, the abdominal weight increases. So there is much more load in front of body.. making imbalance due to shifting of line of gravity.. the  back muscles stretch the line of gravity back to normal by contracting & pulling the body back. This creates lot of stress to back muscles & so the pain.        * this can be managed by doing pregnancy yoga exercises to strengthen the back muscles.  * back pain also follows calcium & vitamin D deficiency. Replacement of these  controls the pain.    - some times vaginal/ pelvic infection or inflammation can cause the back ache.

My first c-section resulted in blood clots. This is why I m no longer on the pill, but receive the shot instead. Well I ve been experiencing symptoms of pregnancy. I vomit almost every time I eat. Sometimes I get nauseated just by smelling the food while I m cooking. My pubic area seems to be widening and my stomach hurts anytime it s pushed on or when I lean up against something, like when I do the dishes. My boyfriend has even heard a heartbeat when he lays his head on my stomach. He s listened to mine and he says they re 2 different heartbeats. I ve taken numerous pregnancy tests and all have negative results. I don t know what to do now.","Doctor":"HI,    I have read your query & understand your concern.    Depo provera when taken regularly has excellent protection from conception ( 99%) & your pregnancy tests are also are -ve so, apparently you are not pregnant.   Depo provera is known to cause menstrual irregularity/ Few digestion issues ( like bloating, indigestion & vomiting can be due to this ), weight gain also it leads to bony weakness This might have caused widening of pubis & also pain after pressure on abdomen.     Hearing of heart beats of  a fetus when pregnancy test is repeatedly -Ve seems to be impossible-- still you can get USG abdomen to remove the doubt .    Unless you do not have option for contraception, you should dicontinue Depo provera for couple of years & adopt some alternative method... for depo can cause osteoporosis weakening bones.      Take calcium/ vitamin D supplements / regular exercises/ healthy life style , in the break to upgrade your health.    thanks."},{"Patient":"i took primolut N for 6 days. i was not aware that i was pregnant. My last MC date was 17-aug-10 and i took primolute N ( 1 tab / day) from 11-sep to 15-sep. When i did pregnancy test on 30-sep-10 , i came to know that i was pregnent. I want to know does premolute N has any adverse effect on foetus? is it advisable to continue pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your worry, but, I would like to say, the dosage you have taken is very little and also very early in your pregnancy. Hence, the chances of affecting the embryo are very minimal. Norethisterone can cause virilization of a female fetus when used in higher doses, if used at 7-8 weeks of pregnancy, as this is the time of organogenesis of gonads, where there is hormone sensitivity. It is a category D drug contraindicated in pregnancy. In view of these facts, you can decide on the future of the pregnancy if you can get the fetal DNA tests done to detect any malformations early enough. If no abnormal test results come, you can continue with the pregnancy with regular monitoring. Hope you find this information useful. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"I am having a bloody discharge from my penis when I strain while having a bowel movement.

If i were to treat you, I would ask for a complete hormone profile including FSH, LH, serum estrogen and progesterone, serum Prolactin, serum DHEAS, insulin levels, ovulation studies and analysis of your partner. A normal pelvic sonogram mostly rules out polycystic ovaries as the cause of your hormone disturbance. If you did not get your thyroid profile done, please get it now. After your hormone levels are known, any deficiencies can be suitably corrected. If your partner has any defects that need correction, this also can be done simultaneously, since you are anxious to conceive. Meanwhile, please try to maintain a healthy BMI with diet and exercise. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello, I am writing in regards to more information about pregnancy. I am worried about an incident that occurred last month. My girlfriend is on the birth control pill and has been for the past 3-4 years, never missed a pill. My issue is that I am allergic to different substances and creams of any type; therefore we do not take any other protection rather than the pills. My girlfriend ended up having a urinary tract infection and had to take Cipro pills for 7 days. We read that it takes 3-4 days until the antibiotic is completely out of the system; therefore we waited for a month and a half before we continued in our intimacy. It has been 3-4 weeks now that she has been sick in the morning, twice that she threw up. She may think that she is stressed with all upcoming exams, but we are concerned for I have read online that the pills do not take affect until a month to three months.

Please reply.","Doctor":"Hi there,It is not necessary for you to take any tablets except for Folic acid during the initial months of the pregnancy. In fact Folic acid is also advised only till 12 weeks of pregnancy the stage at which you are now.Nexium is to decrease acidity, Zinc is just mineral supplement and Duphaston twice a day is not required unless you are having symptoms of threatened miscarriage.Please remember that most pregnancies are absolutely normal and do not require much medical intervention. You could relax and discontinue all the above medications.Iron supplementation is advisable if your hemoglobin is low and calcium is recommended after the 5th month of pregnancy for fetal bones growth.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"i have a very thick pasty white discharge not at all lumpy does not smell i have light cramping very very light comes and goes and now my breast are tender....I was wondering can this be a sign of pregnancy...Being that my Boyfriend and i had sex on the 25th of July and he climaxed in me..I got my period on the 28th of July...now i sit here and wonder im not suppose to get my period till the 26th of this month are these symptoms ofovulation or pregnancy","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion the 25 th of July comes under safe period provided your cycles are regular.So there are rare chances of pregnancy.The white discharge might be normal physiological discharge which is seen during the premenstrual phase.So relax.Avoid stress as it might cause hormonal imbalance and delay the period furthur.Overall there are rarely any chance of pregnancy.The first sign of pregnancy is missed period.So just wait and check for the period.Best regards..."},{"Patient":"If you fooled around 2 days before your period and then again a couple hours before starting your period and there was a little bit of precum on the guys boxers but his penis was no where near my vagina and he says he didn't touch the spot but im worried he may have touched the spot on his boxers and continued fingering me and he didn't ejaculate at all for about a week or so and I have a normal heavy period what are the chances I can be pregnant","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details.

We consulted a doctor and she found that I didn't ovulate normally. All other tests including blood, tube patency , ultra sound reported everything as normal. My husbands sperm count too was normal ( Vol. 3Ml, Count 90Mn/ml , Active -50%, sluggish -20,dead -30 , MOrphology - 75% normal, Ph-8.5) I am taking Glyciphase SR 500Mg(1-0-1) and Ebexid along with FA regularly. Then she put me on Clomoid 100 MG for 6 Months and then to Letroz 2.5 for the last two cycles. Though follicular study shows ovulation , I haven't conceived yet. She is trying Letroz for this month too If you could clarify some of my doubts , it would be a great relief 1. Prior to Clomoid induction, I haven't experienced any sort of Ovulation discomfort. Does that mean that I was not at all ovulating 2. My follicular study during previous cycle shows 10*8 on 13 DPO and on 15 I experienced Ovulation pain. Scan on 16 DPO confirmed ovulation. Will the egg be normal while considering the sudden growth? 3. Even after life style change and ovulation induction drugs, my cycles are not returned to the 28 day. The ovulation occurs normally on 18 th day ( except last) and my average cycle length is 33-32 days. Does it shows any sort of drug resistance? Does the egg released on 18th has any drawback while compared to the one relased on 14? We are quite frustrated , Please would you enlighten us with your suggestions","Doctor":"Hi there,,You have already tried 6 months of Clomid and 3 months of Letroze without success, and all other parameters are normal. I would advise you to consider ovulation induction using Gonadotropins followed by IUI or IVF.Usually Clomiphene is advised only for 6 months, if it doesn't work in 6 months its unlikely to give results. Letrozole is not recommended any more for ovulation induction.I would advise you to consider IVF, it will give you better success rates.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"my mensuration cycle is of 40- 41 days i had my LMP on 25 august and i supposed to get my periods on 6 oct but till now my periods not yet started and there s no sign of coming as well.

So you need not worry about pregnancy.Bleeding a few days later is a common symptom and does not indicate pregnancy .You can do  a urine pregnancy test 21 days after taking the pill, to confirm you are not pregnant.You need to consider some other long term contraception to prevent a similar situation in the future.

I have an appointment next week but I am scared now. THey said it would be implantantion bleeding but from what I have read it is to heavy for that. I have had no pain other that feeling a little swollen down there and it is not even really uncomfortable. IS there a chance that the baby is still ok?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,How and by whom your pregnancy was diagnosed? If it was a confirmed pregnancy, you cannot take this bleeding lightly.Any amount of bleeding during any stage of pregnancy is alarming; it is not a good sign. Implantation bleeding is never so heavy; and moreover, it should be labelled as implantation bleeding only after ruling out the other causes which can threaten the pregnancy. Fortunately, you do not have any pain. So even if it is threatened miscarriage, it can be managed by Progesterone. The other probable cause of such bleeding can be due to molar pregnancy which may be diagnosed by hCG estimation and/or ultrasonography. Any cervical lesion also may cause bleeding; however it would not be such heavy and continuous bleeding. Please restrict yourself to the bed, use sanitary napkins and save them for doctor's inspection. I am advising you not to wait for your scheduled appointment with the Obstetrician due in next week; report to the Obstetrician ASAP for proper diagnosis and appropriate management to save the pregnancy.

Also is there harm in edging and not ejaculat ?even if it was for a pre longed period of time?

Just because, for now, for body, semen is a waste product and needs to be ejaculated.

During the ultrasound, they were jabbing and causing extreme pain. 6 hours later, I started having red blood and have not stopped. Is it possible that they caused a perforation and if they did, what will that do to my pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hi,  I have read your query & understand your concern.   First thing, trans vaginal probe has a blunt( rounded ) tip.. & it mostly does not cause injury inside/ is not likely to harm pregnancy. The pain you had mostly is due to un co operation from your side ( not keeping the body relaxed )    They must have found cause of the bleeding.They also mention pregnancy status they have found while doing USG.. your doctor will advise medicines accordingly.please contact your doctor & get  specific consultation .

Due to the fact that the fetus might be in a hostile environment, we felt that accelerated pulmonary maturity might be a possibility; therefore, at this time, we elected to go with amniocentesis to help us manage her pregnancy. She had been fully informed of the risks and benefits of the procedure prior to proceeding. DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Ultrasound scanning was done by the technologist, and placenta was posterior. We prepped the abdomen and draped it. We used a sterile covered ultrasound transducer with guide and located a pocket of fluid (do not report the ultrasound guidance). The 20-gauge needle was inserted. As we got into the uterus, the baby moved into the area; therefore, the needle was immediately withdrawn. The fetus was palpated a little bit, and we stimulated the baby and it moved out of the area. We then repositioned the transducer, and we were able to drop into the pocket of amniotic fluid and withdraw 20 cc of clear yellow amniotic fluid. The fluid was sent for maturity studies. The patient tolerated the procedure without difficulty.","Doctor":"Hi,   I have read your query casrefully.  The ICD -9-DX codes consist of  international  statistical classification of diseases & there health problems. numbers  630 to 679  cover those conditions complicating pregnancy.- It provides multiple external links to help.

A foul smelling discharge in pregnancy indicates infection.It can be bacterial vaginitis / fungal infection.. both suggest  carelessness in vaginal hygiene/ use of bubble bath ot vaginal sprays .. which alter vaginal Ph & facilitate infection & foul smell.    - Visit to a gynecologist.. & get specific treatment,( metranidazole/ clindamycin )    - Use of vaginal pills with lacto bacilli ( to normalize vaginal flora & ph    - Utmost care to maintain vaginal cleanliness ( no use of cosmetics please ) use plain  clean water for washes & mop it dry.   thanks."},{"Patient":"I just used the restroom and passed a white glob it had no blood or anything it was completely white..i am 34 weeks and 3 days pregnant and was wondering if this was my mucus plug... also me and my boyfriend just had intercourse could it be sperm that came back out?","Doctor":"Hi,   I have gone through your query & understand your concern.   Mucus plug is thick mucus sealing cervix throughout pregnnacy & protecting it fro infection. Discharge of mucus plug indicates starting of opening of cervix. It may take few hours/ days or weeks when labor sets in after mucus plug discharge.    Usually when the delivery is in near future.. mucus plug is pinkish/ blood stained when discharged. AS you say, the semen along with sperms & vaginal mucus  can similate mucus plug.   So if there are no increased contraction/ pains.. you need not be scared & rush to your doctor. Continue your routine as usual/ special care for genital hygiene & avoid sex. You can inform your doctor about the incidence while your next pregnancy check up.

What should do?","Doctor":"HI,   I have read your query carefully & understand your concern.  - Cramping in 37th week of pregnancy is from various causes. The ligaments of pelvis which are softened due to pregnancy hormones allow decent of fetus in pelvic cavity this leads to over stretching of abdomen & uterus too.. giving rise to abdominal cramps,  - Uterine contractions to push the baby in pelvis ,, lead to cramps.  - Disturbed digestion & constipation can lead to abdominal bloating & cramps.  - Bladder infection & inflammation because of fetal pressure on bladder .. leading to frequency of urination/ retention of urine in bladder/ infection of bladder can lead to cramps.   This can be managed by-   - relaxing in between working schedules.  - having light food, taken more frequently with sufficient water & fibers to facilitate good digestion & less distension of stomach   - Trying to evacuate urine completely.( in  forward bending position with hands resting on knees ). treatment for bladder infection   - excessive uterine cramps can be controlled by medicines like Isoxuprine hydrochloride ( duvadelan ) pills taken with advise of treating doctor.

This is because, firstly, you had the intercourse during your non-ovulatory or safe period. Secondly, you took the emergency contraceptive pill within the stipulated period after the intercourse. This gives you high protection from conception. The bleeding you had after the pill intake is the withdrawal bleeding due to the high hormone content in the pill. The pill cannot protect you from a sexual act five days after intake since this is the time interval of the pill half-life in the blood stream. So, the second act is unprotected.

Heavy exercise is completely contraindicated during early pregnancy and if possible, throughout pregnancy. Your history suggests that you may have had a threatened abortion where there is no pain but bleeding is observed as evidenced by the old bloody discharge that you had. The current cramping pain with bleeding suggests a possible inevitable abortion. Please see a specialist immediately for further care.

From the given information, there are no chances that you can become pregnant. Your boy friend just rubbed his penis all over your vagina but did not enter inside your vagina.

Sperm cells require moist atmosphere, fluid medium and a certain temperature so that it can swim and move inside in search of ovum. Your vaginal walls do not have any liquid medium or temperature or moisture. Therefore the sperm cells cannot move and they will be dead.

Please understand that Progesterone suppositories would not cause bleeding during pregnancy; on the contrary, it is given to stop the bleeding during pregnancy. It is good that the cervix is closed. That means that you are having Threatened abortion. So long as there is no pain in abdomen, efforts can be made to salvage this pregnancy by the use of Progesterone. Once the pains start, usually pregnancy cannot be saved. If the bleeding is brown, could be that baby is already non-viable (missed abortion) and you may need evacuation of the uterus. Your history of 8 abortions is indeed not a favourable history. If by ill luck, you loose this pregnancy also, please get yourself thoroughly evaluated for repeated pregnancy loss. You abort at what weeks of pregnancy? If you are aborting after 12 weeks, you may be having loose mouth of the cervix which can be reinforced by tightening. You may have to get chromosomal work up of both of you, look for some infections, Thyroid study, etc. Please report to your Obstetrician for the investigations.

This precum ejaculates unknowingly, however it also contains some sperms which can cause pregnancy.If this precum entres in the mouth during oral sex, even if it is swallowed, it will not cause pregnancy as the sperms in the intestines have no access to the genital tract. However, when your penis touched the opening of vagina, if your precum was ejected even at the opening, the sperms can swim up and cause pregnancy. Now it is more than 2 weeks that she has missed her period. Get her urine test done for pregnancy. If test is positive, she is pregnant; if not, give her Tab.

I am healthy, and am not considered \\"high risk\\" in any way.","Doctor":". It is always better to avoid antibiotic use wherever possible during pregnancy.Ciprofloxacin is given to pregnant women with caution of keeping in mind that benefits should be far more than risks. It is avoided in lactating mothers for sure. But as you are in the start of pregnancy, try to avoid infection especially you talked about intestinalt infection. Keeping a good hygiene and balanced diet will help. Hydration is also an issue  when on vacation.I hope this is all you needed an answer for. I am at your disposal if you need further assistance.Healthiest Regards!Dr. Sumaira Kousar"},{"Patient":"Hello Dr. I m 30 weeks pregnant have detected with calculi of 3- 4 mm in both the kidneys. also pus cells with 150- 180/ hpf , protien, bacteria and yeast on 11.08.10 on 12. 07.10 my urine report was pus cell with 25-30 hpf.

Yesterday, visited large practice in major city that specializes in urology for exam.  Exam did not consist of PSA, digital exam or blood work and physician prescribed doxycycline hyclate 100mg twice daily for 21 days and wishes to re-examine me in six weeks.  I am severely allergic to all penicillins and cephalosporins, thus the prescription above.  After examining the very serious and potentially fatal side effects of doxycycline hyclate, I am inclined to not take this medication.  Question 1.  What are the probabilities of serious side effects with this medication.?  Extremely low, moderate or high?  Question 2. Is there another antibiotic that could be prescribed with less serious potential side effects?  I understand that the physician is just trying to eliminate the possibility of a prostate infection prior to doing a PSA, etc., but, I'm really lacking enough information to decide if this prescription is worth the risk.  Thanks,","Doctor":"Hi, Doxycycline is not used for BPH. It might have been prescribed for prostatitis (inflammation or infection of the prostate). You can consult a urologist and start on drugs like Finasteride or Tamsulosin. If medical management fails you might have to undergo surgical removal of the prostate. Hope I have answered your query.

Pregnancy with profuse bleeding off & on is not likely to be viable.If you want to exclude.. you should go for blood HCG testing.    Other causes for such bleeding are more likely.. namely FUH, PCOD, hormonal imbalance due to thyroid or ovarian problems.      uterine problems like fibroid uterus/ cervical polyp, or Ca cervix can cause such bleeding.

If so what treatment, exercise or medication could assit thw bone in the shifting?. Cheers","Doctor":"hi,    I understand your concern.  *  In pregnancy the pregnancy hormones cause softening of ligaments .. so pelvic & chest bones tend to expand due to development of fetus, overstretching of abdomen/ pelvis. This causes pain.   - In case of ribs.. the abdominal stretching is excessive due to gasses/ indigestion/ constipation. in 9th month.   - Similarly bony weakness due to calcium & vitamin D deficiency would increase the pain.  *  Though complete relief  from pain will be after delivery of baby, Some of the abdominal distension can be reduced to get some relief by-    - Taking small & multiple food servings,    - taking sufficient fibers in diet,    - drink lot of water ( 10-12 glasses ) in a day.     Continue exercise in form of walk for 20-30 minutes in a day. This will facilitate  food digestion/ excessive gas formation & bowel movements & offer some relief from pain.   - Consult your doctor for need of calcium / vitamin D supplement.

Are there any chances it is not a blightend ovum and could have 2 or 1 healthy fetus and rising hcg levels","Doctor":"HI,    I understand your concern. HCG is a pregnancy hormone essential for fetal development.So HCG levels are indicators of pregnancy status.     You had triplets.  In some cases one or two of the triplets can get aborted & one may remain intact.     *  IN early pregnancy up to six weeks fetus has just a yolk sac .. and at 6.5 to 7 weeks fetal pole appears in the USG      I feel you should follow both HCG testing & USG scanning for one more week .. to confirm the pregnancy status.     So, cheer up. hope for the best. Take rest, nurishing diet & medications advised ..& wait for a while before comming to conclusion.

Your symptoms may mean a very early pregnancy or some hormone imbalance subsequent to the miscarriage and the best way to identify pregnancy in the current scenario is to get an estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres at least a week after your last sexual intercourse.

We live in Saudi Arabia, Jeddah, where we don t have hematologists. Could you please suggest something that would give rise to both hemoglobin and platelets? Thank you.","Doctor":"HI,   I understand your concern.    * In pregnancy blood Hb% count is decreased due to increased demand of blood for circulation  of baby so, sudden increase of blood  occurs  by dilution - thus making less proportion of red blood cells in blood. This is aggravated by less intake or absorption of iron, folic acid, vitamin B12.     - Bleeding  due to any cause may add to anemia of pregnancy.     - It  is  treated by iron, folic acid, B12 supplementation/ blood transfusion if needful.    *Low platelet count after 6 months of pregnancy is seen in 6%- 8% of patients . & it comes back to normal after delivery.Persistent or early onset of low platelet count needs to be investigated for it's cause. It may be cause related to pregnancy like toxemia of pregnancy / non pregnancy related causes like auto immune diseases, enlarged spleen/ after certain viral fever.    After finding the exact cause , treatment is given to treat the cause/ in form of blood or platelet transfusion/ certain drugs like corticosteroids/ surgical removal of spleen,   * Aplastic anemia or bone marrow depression can cause less counts of all blood cells.

If pregnancy test is -ve with multiple testings, mostly you dont' have pregnancy. You should now get investigated to find other possible causes for your symptoms.     A usg abdomen would help to exclude pregnancy as well as will help in diagnosing conditions like PCOD/ ovarian problems which can cause your problems.

Home pregnancy tests read well when performed 3-7 days after the missed period with a fresh early morning sample of urine. If you did not do so, you may repeat the test in a couple of days.

At times, when I get up from bed after rest, I find it difficult to balance myself due to pain in the leg. Kindly educate me on this.","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion the difficulty in breathing especially at night needs a physical examination to rule out any respiratory or heart related problems.Also low Hb is also one of the causes so ruling oit anaemia is also needed.Nothing to worry.Avoid spicy and oily diet.Take antacids because sometimes the acidity also might present with similar complaints.Dont lie down immediately after dinner.Finish ghe dinner 2 hours before sleeping.The pain in the leg might be due to muscular pain.But if there is any associated swelling and redness then it need to be evaluated otherwiseneed not worry and take panadol if the pain is severe.Best regards..."},{"Patient":"I have a question I am 6 weeks pregnant.

My appointment with my OB/GYN isn t until next week. Could this uncomfortable feeling that I am experiencing be the corpus luteum?","Doctor":"Hello dear,i understand your concern.In my opinion the uncomfortable feeling in the abdomen might not be a major problem.It might be muscular origin as muscle cramps are quite common in pregnancy.The tripling of Hcg is a good sign.Nothing to worry.Avoid physical strain and intercourse.Take rest.Consider getting an ultrasound in the next appointment.Take panadol if pain is severe.Constipation might also cause similar problem so see to that the bowel movements are normal.Take adequate fluids upto 3 litres per day and healthy nutritional diet.Best regards..."},{"Patient":"I just took my blood pressure and it was 138 107...is that high?

Could you kindly suggesta remedy? And also can you tell me whether this is normal or something to be worried about","Doctor":"Hello dear,I understand your concern.In my opinion the acidity and reduced appetite might be normal in pregnancy.The acidity or gastritis is due to influence of progesterone hormone.Take antacids and avoid spicy and oily diet.Take food in small quantities every 2 hourly.Acidity itself might cause decreased appetite.So when acidity gets corrected it gets back to normal.Appetite increasing syrups can be tried.Nothing to worry.Irrespective of appetite take food on time.Best regards..."},{"Patient":"sir my bf rubbed his penis outside my genital organs (also outside vagina) for 2-3 minutes.

This scan is to check if everything is normal with the baby. And they are saying that the baby seems to be normal in every way except for a slight enlargement in kidneys. This would alarm you, but you just need to get a scan by a fetal medicine specialist and a regular follow up with them. It also says that urinary function seems normal that means, though the size they feel is slightly more its working seems to be normal.Sometimes things identified on ultrasound may be in not significant and any stress will not be good for your pregnant wife's health.Only a re-scan with a fetal medicine expert is necessary.and after delivery a scan of the babies kidneys at 3 months of age.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"is it easy to get pregnant right after a miscarriage i had a miscarriage and had unprotected sex 2 days are after and continued since then it has been a month since the miscarriage and now and i have been having sore and tender breasts and no period yet? whats wrong am i pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi there,Yes, it is possible that you are pregnant.

Is there any possible way i am able to know im pregnant in the first few days, it s urgent and i m stressing, if so is their anyway of privately getting an abortion behind my parents back? I need help please :(","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Your pregnancy can be detected by Beta hCG test which is reliable, very specific and sensitive test. It gives reliable results even on the day of missed period. If you do not want to continue with this pregnancy, it can be safely and effectively terminated by Tab. Mifepristone followed by Tab. Misoprostol within 24-48 hours. However these are not 'over the counter' medicines and have to be purchased only with an Obstetrician's prescription. However, you are just 16 years young - a minor girl. Therefore your guardian will have to consent for the termination of pregnancy. You will have to inform them legally. Do not be worried. After all they are your parents and will do all that is good for your life. I hope you got the message.

The Dr is checking it every few weeks for now and then more closely later. Does an uncoiled always effect the baby? Dr. also said it would be later in pregnancy if it was a problem, how much later?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Gestational Diabetes and Coiled cord are not interrelated, except the water may be more due to diabetes hence more space for the baby to move around. The coiled cord may get in shape in due course during labour. If it remains around the neck of the baby and strangulates the baby, then caesarean delivery will be the outcome. Hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Good Evening Sir/Madam, Pls. due to circumstances i took abortion since 3rd November, 2010 i have seen my menstral cycle so i do not if i am pregnant because i have been seeing water coming out from my breast when pressing it, Please doctor i need your help.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,The water you think coming out of your breasts is most likely raw milk - what is known as colostrum. After abortion, this secretion may continue. Please do not squeeze it out. More you squeeze, more milk will be formed. Give a tight binder to the breasts so that the milk secretion can stop. There are Oestrogen preparations available to stop the breast secretions. Your Gynaecologist will help you for that. The colostrum secretion despite of pregnancy may be due to increased secretion of Prolactin hormone from Pituitary gland. Please get your blood examined for levels of this hormone. Raised levels may require X-ray of the skull to find out any cause present in the Pituitary. Usually, such conditions can successfully be treated with Tab. Bromocryptine. Please report this to your Gynaecologist for investigations and appropriate treatment. I hope this helps you.

I will try to address your medical concerns and would suggest you the best of the available treatment options.Usually in near term pregnant women, loose motions or large bowel irritation provokes or initiates labour pains.That can be the reason why you might have started getting pains, after your diarrhoea episode.I will suggest pre probiotics like Cap Vibact DS once a day for a week.It's good that you are beyond 37 weeks , so even if get into labour  pains, it's safe for the baby now.I hope my answer helps you.Thanks.Wish you great health."},{"Patient":"I got stung by a hornet today and had an allergic reaction.

I may be pregnant and will have my missed period in 5 days (July 30) if i am. Could my baby be in danger?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Hornet sting does not affect the foetus. Moreover, you have not yet missed your period, so the pregnancy status is doubtful. If at all at this stage, the embryo is affected, it will get aborted. You will not have abnormal child. I think, you should not have concern about hornet sting. Hope this helps you,Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hey so I’ve been producing extremely little semen, I’m 21 not overweight.

My abdominal pain wasn't diagnosed, but I was given an antibiotic for the UTI. I took it twice a day for 7 days, and then about 3 days after I stopped taking it I began to vomit uncontrollably all day every day, and I'm still doing it. I was given blood tests at the hospital and would assume they would inform me if I was pregnant.Do u have any idea what else it could be?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,The first cardinal symptom of the pregnancy is missing a period, which you have not. So the chances of pregnancy are out of consideration. The nausea and vomiting you had is due to the antibiotics you were taking for urinary infection. You should not have discontinued antibiotics as the urinary infections are very nasty infections. By discontinuing he antibiotics, you have invited the resistant stains of the bacteria causing urinary infection. You should have continued it with some antacid like Pantoprazole and anti-vomiting medicine like stemetil.Now take Pantoprazole to control the acidity and stemetil to control vomiting, but complete the course of antibiotics. Please report to your doctor and follow the medical advice religiously. Hoe you got the message. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"i was supposed to start my period today it has been 28 days and i am regular and have not started i had this brownish spotting yesturday and it only lasted for that day and now today there is nothing could i be pregnant?or could it have anything to do with me just getting over a uti?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Not getting menses exactly on the expected day should not worry you. Variation by a day or two is acceptable and known. However, you had some brownish bleeding which should not be ignored. Urine pregnancy test is not reliable in the first week after missing the period. It may give false negative results. Best option for you is to go for Beta hCG test. This is a very specific and sensitive test and gives reliable result on even on the day of missed period. If you get week positive results, the brown bleeding will indicate either missed abortion, blighted ovum (pregnancy without embryo in the gestational sac) or ectopic pregnancy which may lead to bleeding emergency. Please report to your Obstetrician to get proper diagnosis with the help of appropriate investigations. I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, this is Asha from Bangalore.I am married and we r together for 6 months.This month I missed my periods and i did a velocit test and it shown positive.What is the next step?

Had you mentioned the period of gestation, it would have been much clearer.Sometimes, the pregnancy has a typical variety wherein the gestational sac is present without embryo (baby) in it. This is called as Blighted ovum. Such pregnancies do not grow and terminate by themselves; if not, termination of pregnancy is indicated. Your wife seems to have this type of pregnancy.

Semen examination of the husband to assess the quality and quantity of the sperms.2. Ovulation Monitoring: It can be assessed by ultrasonography and/or Ovulation monitoring kit. If you are ovulating regularly, try to plan your sexual activity on and around the day of ovulation. Study of uterine lining (endometrium) also can give evidence of ovulation; however it cannot guide you prospectively about the day of ovulation. Still it can give you information about the health of endometrium. 3. Patency of Genital tract and other abnormalities: This information can be gathered by Laparoscopy, Hysterosalpingography (X-ray of the uterus after putting radio-opaque medium in the uterine cavity). If any abnormality is found, may need correction. Worms should not affect the fertility of a woman. I hope this will help you to become mother.

Home pregnancy test is reliable after 8 days  of expected date of period. So the test you did will not be positive before the date of your menses.

Her menstruation started on 7. today it is the 31st day. she has her period between 26-28. we had sex thrice in the night but did not spill the sperm in (did without condom) she is 40 years now. so far no children. she had stomach upset and vomitting after 3 days of our relationship. Is there anything to fear of the delay in the period?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Your sexual relationships fall on the 7th day of menstruation. Usually the egg release takes place 14 days before the next menses; so considering het 26 days cycle, it would be day 12 of the cycle. Egg lives for 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence day 8 to day 16 would be a fertile period for her. Your intercourse happened just on the borderline days. Intercourse on borderline of fertile period, delay in menses of otherwise regular menses and nausea & vomiting are all raising a suspicion of pregnancy. However, the diagnosis has to be confirmed. Wait for 5 more days and then get urine examined for pregnancy test; done earlier, false negative results may misguide you. Else, you may go for Beta hCG test  which is far more sensitive and specific and gives reliable results even on the day of missed period. If pregnancy tests are negative and still she does not get menses, give her some progesterone preparation like Deviry for 5 days and she will get menses 4-7 days after that.

It can roughly tell you the probable date of fertilization.2. Usually the period of pregnancy is counted from the first day of last menstrual period.3. Ultrasonography and hCG levels tell you the gestational period from the day of conception. Hence there is a difference of about 2 weeks in the clinical gestational period and gestational period estimation by these investigations. When you are informed 5 weeks pregnancy, it refers to 5 weeks from last menstrual period; which actually is about 3 weeks from day of conception. This should clarify your dilemma.

I just want to ask that is ORAL SEX unhygeinic? & is it right to do with a pregnant woman? & if yes, then how should i convince her","Doctor":"Dear Friend,If the genital parts are kept hygienically clean and if there is no sexually transmitted infection, oral sex is not unhygienic. There are different steps - from just applying lips to the genital parts to swallowing the secretion or ejaculation of the sex. To which stage to proceed is an individual choice. However, if the partner does not like oral sex and hates it, it may create psychological trauma and she may loose sexual interest. Please do not compel. Oral sex is safe in pregnancy.

This disorder is not only restricted to ovaries but in addition is metabolic and hormonal disorder too. In this along with the delayed menses, there is high insulin and high male hormones. You have to bring down your weight to get rid of PCOS. High protein low carbohydrate and low fat diet is the key. Along with, exercise is mandatory. Brisk walk morning-evening at the rate of 90 steps per minute for 40 minutes in addition to the stretching exercises will help you bring down the weight. Eat good amount of fruits, fresh green leafy vegetables and sprouts. If you are keen on becoming pregnant, medicines like clomiphene citrate will help you otherwise birth control pills can regularize your menses. I hope this helps you.

I was prescribed 10 days of I believe flomax but it did almost nothing I feel. My problem now is that after being very patient a few weeks it s seemed to heal/reduce in size a bit but nothing too significant and the worst is that a clear/reddish liquid discharges out of the bottom of my scrotum pretty much all day long. It has me worried n I have no health insurance so I m scouring the Internet for answers? What is it, what does it mean, is it getting better if it s leaking or does that mean its worse?

I have consulted many docs with varied diagnosis. I was single then and made to believe it was fungal, it comes on its own and have been getting treated accordingly by a dermatologist. Recently i got married and again recurringly had red infection on my penis. Along with this, my wife also developed infecion and was put under Gynea treatment, again for fungal infection and Fas Kit prescribed to both along with aplication of fungal infection creams. For the reason not transfering infection bw me and wife, we have stopped having intercourse (unprotected) however my wife was ok but I kept developing these red spots/ infection. However on repeated occurances we consulted a different dermatologist and he suggested Herpes but blood test reports ruled out. However he insisted that indeed it is Herpes and sometimes the medical reports do not show the same. I was put on Famtrax 250 for 1 week along with application of topical anti-biotic(fusidic acid cream). The red spots kept going and coming but doc clamed it is Herpes geting cured and that takes time to cure as in past i have been exposed to steriod in form of anti-fungal creams. Post a week of Famtrax, i was put on antialergic and anti-biotic cream for a week. the red spots have gone but now there is recurring white spots (small pimple types) which come and go. On showing to doc, he said its miliaria of penis and common and due to non drying of the area. I was asked to take urine test (culture and routine) and culture cam normal.

In fact insertion of tip of penis (glans) inside the vagina is sufficient to cause pregnancy - even before the ejaculation. Before ejaculation, possibility of deposition of preejaculation secretions (precum) is always there. This gets deposited unknowingly and the person is not aware that he has ejaculated precum. Precum contains some sperms which are capable of causing pregnancy. However, in your case, since within two days after intercourse, you have got your menses, there is no possibility of pregnancy for two reasons.:1. The egg release is 14 days before the menses; while you had intercourse two days before the sex. Hence there was no egg present to get fertilized.2. You have got the menses 2 days after the sex proving that you are not pregnant. So dear, please remove the concern of pregnancy from your mind and enjoy your life. To avoid such stressful situations in future I would advise you to use reliable contraception method like birth control pills, condom or intrauterine device. I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"My leg has started hurting today..a deep throbbing pain behind my knee that is going up to under my bum cheek.

I would advise you to report this to spinal surgeon or neurosurgeon. You may have to get X-rays done, and if required, MRI also. If there is any disfigurement, get it corrected well in time.

Digestive  disturbances./ weakness due to heavy periods/ psychological tension can cause your symptoms of  back ache, abdominal weraed movements of weakness in legs.     Take rest, have healthy life style including genital hygiene, have B complex & calcium supplements,  take light diet/ digestive enzymes . you would be alright in few days.   thanks.    Thanks."},{"Patient":"I just started doing the Concentrated Bath Salts quite frequently. My Boyfriend and I are hoping for a baby. We think I might be pregnant, but only a few days. We conceived July 31st 2011. What effect is this Salt going to have on The fetus and I if I keep doing it until I get a positive on my pregnancy test? Also is there a way to get a pregnancy test that would tell me THIS soon? (NOW!!)

I tried going for a bowel movement, but it did not help. Pain only last for 30-45 minutes. The next day my period was supposed to start, and it still has not, i am 8 days past my missed period. My last period was 18th of Aug, and I am on a regular cycle of an average of 28 days. The shortest cycle (last cycle of 26 days) and the longest ever being of 29 days. Now I am on CD 37. Negative HPT, more than usual headaches. My husband and I had intercourse on 7th or 8th of Sept, and according to what i remember I had ovulated either a several days back or just couple of days (can't exactly remember, just remember ovulating). Is there a chance my hcg level is too low for urine test to pick up, and maybe I actually am pregnant, and need a blood test done???? Or was it bc of that weird pain I experienced the night before my expected period that caused me to miss it??? (I normally never experience any sort of pain during my cycles). I am not under any stress, no diet change, no exercise. Is it possible to have a negative urine test and actually be pregnant?","Doctor":"HiDr. Purushottam welcomes you to HCM virtual clinic.I have gone through your query.

But I have been unsuccessful in my efforts of quitting I smoke about three or four times a day but I want to quit so that I'm not at risk of loosing my baby when I go into labor. I'm not a bad person and I love my baby and don't want any problems. So my question is what can I do so that my system and clean and clear when I go into labor?","Doctor":"HI,   I understand your query.   Smoking is hazardus for you & your baby both.smoking nocotin/ carbon monoxide  causes less oxygen to you & your baby making more chances of getting abortions, premature deliveries low birth weights, still births, increased chances of congenital abnormalities , possibility of baby getting respiratory disease in later life.     You have already reached 35th week of pregnancy. I am afraid it's too late to prevent side effects of smoking on your baby, they must have occurred.  Still, you can-     Stop smoking at least now,, & hope for least effects your baby has,     Get your delivery done in best hospital & best doctors care.         Lets hope, your baby has skipped much of the problem & be careful of his health from first day of his life.  consult best pediatrician , tell himm frankly about your history, so that he can plan the best treatment for your baby.

Plz help","Doctor":"Hi,   I understand your concern.   Unwanted 72 is an emmergency contraceptive, & prevents pregnancy if taken in prescribed time. It has high dose of hormones which helps in it's action. & so it tends to to cause delay in period with excessive bleeding.       You have taken the pill s twice in a month( which should never be done- once taken, one can use other contraceptive major like barrier to prevent pregnancy in following sex in same month.....Unwanted 72 is to be taken only in emmergency, & should not be used as aregular contraceptive, Cyclical oral contraceptives are better)    Both the incidenses must have created a hormonal imbalance & disturbed your period... & on top of that you had taken dub 5 mg ( again  ahormone) & hoping for withdrawal!   Thus a lot of mess had been done in menstrual cycle... Now, please do not worry....     - Get blood HCG test done to exclude pregnancy,     - Wait patiently for periods to come/don't take any medicines for that.    - consult a gynecologist for regularising following cycles after you get bleeding.
