Lung cancer bone metastases are all too common with lung cancer, affecting 30 to 40% of people with advanced lung cancer. In addition to causing considerable pain and discomfort, bone metastases can result in fractures that interfere with daily activities and lessen your quality of life. The median survival –- that is, the amount of time after which 50% of people are alive and 50% have passed away -- is sadly less than 6 months. Survival is somewhat higher for women, those with adenocarcinoma, people with only one bone metastasis, and individuals who do not have any fractures. That said, some people have survived and done well for many years following a diagnosis of lung cancer with bone metastases.

I am concerned if its a possibility I could have anal cancer . I just want an idea of what it could possibly be?","Doctor":"Hi there. At the outset, your Genital warts need be addressed. In women, HPV (depending on the types) virus (human papilloma virus) does have a greater propensity to lead to genital/uterine cancers. Having said that, this does not happen overnight. So be prudent..get yourself & your partner 'treated' & fix a dermatologist / venereologist appointment asap in your region. If careful, one may try using topical wart creams like \\"podophyllotoxin\\" or \\"5% 5 Fluorouracil\\" as per the different recommendations & precautions that your local pharmacist would be happy to explain once you show him a  copy of this transcript. As for the lump & 'hole' , it is not likely to be any cancer. it is more likely to be a 'pilonidal' sinus or 'perianal abscess' or a 'hemorrhoid'. Please see a general surgeon & get it attended to. Please do practice safe sex & for the interim till this is cleared, i strongly recommend 'abstinence' in your cases. Ensure both partners' are treated & should you have had other partners' that you have associated with in the past checked & treated as well.

Firstly my dear, your history is incomplete for a definitive opinion to be given. How long ago did this 'cyst' appear ie when did it start? Is it long standing? How many days since it began to form an abscess? Who visualised it & started you on the antibiotics? What antibiotics were they? What report are you waiting for from your gynecologist? Are you a Diabetic by any chance or any other medical conditions in the recent past? What medications if any are you on? Have you been having regular PAP smears being done? Can you upload photographs of the area on this site. All this will help us give you a clear & more informed diagnosis & managment scheme. Off the cuff, I dont think you have anything to worry about, so RELAX..it appears like an infection of one of the many glands in that area most likely a Bartholin's cyst.

It is soft with a firmer center, non painful to touch, but I have had multiple symptoms that I have attibuted to other things....numbness in my left arm and hand, hot cold flashes, burning pain in my shoulder and neck as well as an increase in headaches. There is some area deep in my chest that at times does cause pain when I move a certain way or lift my arm it sort of takes my breath away. I have degenerative disc and history of headaches so wasn t too concerned. This is especially stressful to me as we have alot of lung cancer as well as breast cancer in the immediate family. Thanks for your help.","Doctor":"Hello, From the history you have given, ( a really lucid one) , the soft mass below your shoulder blade seems to be similar to a lipoma, which is nothing but accumulation of fat. The exact diagnosis can be given by the attending physician on examining it in detail. And your headaches and the numbness and burning sensations in the arm all seem to be the direct effects of the cervical disc degeneration which you have already been addressed about. So a good posture and physiotherapy should help you . The chest pain aggravated on movement can mostly be a musculoskeletal one with inflammation of the rib joints. Though these symptoms do not seem to be associated with the family history of cancers, I would suggest you to get evaluated for the swelling , probably an ultrasound of the swelling can give a clue. The xrays for the neck and chest can rule out any other suspicions. Talk to your physician about the family history of cancers and he might deem it necessary to screen you for the same if he suspects any from the complete history and examination findings. you can be reassured about the concerns of a Cancer . Take care! Hope everything goes on well!"},{"Patient":"My mother has just been diagnosed with gastric ulcers , I noticed that the doctor is checking for cancer- lymphoma , carcinoma and h. pylori .

She called us in at 4:00 am and asked if I wanted him to go to hospice and I said yes but asked how long in the state he was in could he have , she said through the night ot maybe three days. We decided we didnt want to move him so we kept him there. I asked her o tell me point blank if she would give the same dose of Morphine to my dad as hospice would, I have heard form others that hospice sometimes are easier to work with, she said yes she would. I know its only been less than 24 hours but they say his heart is strong it it may take longer. they went from Oygen mask to nose oxygen and now they are thinking of taking that out. I need to know is you think this will be soon or should we take him to hospice. I also know after ready the internet blogs for the last 8 hours that Morphine takes away pain , but does it take away the memory?

I am 30 years old, female, has very high level of anxiety , I m a type A that s why been suffering from stomach ulcer since ca 11 years old :( (duodenal ulcer, perhaps, since eating calms my stomach pain/hunger pangs). I always experience pain in the upper abdomen, bloating , hyperacidity , belching with sour taste in the mouth, feels regurgitation of food from stomach up to my throat, indigestion, feeling of lump in my throat at times, and my whole stomach is always big like I am pregnant. The pain usually subsides when I take antacids. If I do not do anything to relieve the pain or to do something to help in passing gas out, pain becomes more intense and lasts for days. Sometimes, antacids do not help anymore. I still feel bloated and gas won t come out, which makes the pain become more intense. I tried to research on the internet about my case, and then I found this GERD/GER/ Heartburn . I ve been comparing their signs and symptoms with what I always experience, and more or less they are the same. And then it says there chronic GER/GERD can lead to BARRETT S esophagus , which leads to cancer of the throat later on in life! I also have recurrent tonsilitis. My tonsilitis are always inflamed, they grow big and red, which makes me hard to swallow. I am very afraid, since the sister of my grandfather on the father side died long ago with throat cancer (I am not sure, though, whether it s laryngeal /throat/esophageal cancer---I am confused with their differences). I do not know exactly the cause of her cancer, but she used to be a singer during her younger days, also worked as a broadcaster/announcer, and as a saleswoman, using much her voice all the time.

I was concerned that they found two more nodules and my family doc seems concerned as well...looking for some advice","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for writing in. I would be in a better position to help you if you could tell me the type of thyroid cancer you were diagnosed with. Papillary and Follicular cell cancer remain the most common types of thyroid cancers which are diagnosed. These rarely, if at all spread to the liver. Papillary cancers spread to the lymphnodes and follicular cancers spread to the local tissues and to the bone and lung. Haemangiomas are some of the most common masses seen in liver and they do not cause cancers. They can also be multiple Having said that, the only way of definitely knowing whether this is cancer is by doing a Fine needle aspiration cytology. This could lead to bleeding if the tissue is haemangioma. Another way of differentiating would be the PET scan or an enhanced MRI but the availability, cost and insurance coverage could be issues.

It can be high is mild infections and inflammations. Jumping into the diagnosis of cancer straight away is not a good approach. First, rule out local infectious causes. Even normally, sometimes the WBC count is high. Cancer in the scrotum usually presents with a painless swelling or nodule of one testicle. In addition, sometimes it presents as dull ache or heavy sensation in the lower abdomen. Without actually confirming the cancer by histopathological examination, nothing can be said for sure.

However, TB should not be diagnosed on blood tests. Chest Xray, Mantoux test, FNAC or sputum are usually used to diagnose TB. Fever post chemo is more likely to be due to other bacterial infections than TB."},{"Patient":"My 77 year old mother with recurrent uterine cancer has contracted klebsiela,she had just completed her first chemo treatment.

Her eyes are also buggy and glassy","Doctor":"Hi welcome to HCMForum. Your mother is already old enough. The capacity to bear the chemo therapy will be less. there may be secondary infection of klebsiella. Dont worry as she is inpatient doctors will take care of her.

I weigh 150 pounds and am 5 4! today i came home from school and i have a bad headache , nausea , my stomach is hurting pretty bad and i am dizzy and shaky and really tired! I have trouble with my stomach all the time so the stomach thing is normal for me but not everything else because i have been tested for many things for my stomach problems since i was 13 and they have found nothing! But i am just looking to see if i can find out something without having to go to the doctor!","Doctor":"Hi ! I would like to know your dietary and bowel habits.If you eat frequently from outside, and that too some junk food kind of thing, then that may be the reason for your stomach problem. Many kinds of parasitic and bacterial infection may arise for those who eat frequently from outside. Apart from this, some people react to a particular component , e.g., glutten which is found more frequently in junk foods from outside. This glutten enteropathy  may cause all the symptoms of yours. Such eating habits can also be a reason for your being overweight if any other hormonal causes are excluded. Try to add more roughage and liquids in your diet. Get investigated for parasitic, bacterial infections and also for glutten sensitivity. Till that you can take a proton pump inhibitor drug along with an anti spasmodic drug.Wishing you an early recovery."},{"Patient":"HI I have a diagnosis- severe dysplasia and Carcinoma in situ of the cervisis. ( PAP 18). I had a conization two weeks ago, the result was, that the edges were clean. But for 4 months I have had pain in my tailbone. Only accurs while sitting. I dont feel any pain while walking, sitting, lifting things, going to the toilet, having sex etc. When leaning forward while sitting- again no pain. The harder the chair, the more pain. It just appeared at work in the middle of the day and does not improve. But I am still concerned. I am scared about the cancer , maybe its already everywhere. I am 32 years old. 1 child born in 2002. My job includes both- long periods of sitting and some weeks a lot on lifting heavy things.","Doctor":"Hello dear, The biopsy showed carcinoma in situ with clean edges, which says that the cancer was removed completely. Still if it wasn't, then it would first present in vagina or uterus and the symptoms would be abnormal bleeding or dirty discharge. Pain in the tailbone occurs in many people who have slightly longer tailbones and sit on hard surface, because the tailbone presses against the hard surface. In my opinion, this pain is not because of cancer spread. Try using a soft mattress when you sit on something hard. You can do hot fomentation for pain relief. I'm sure the pain will be relieved. If it still persists, then you can consult a gynaecologist. Hope I have answered your query. Dr Juhi"},{"Patient":"Hello, I am from XXXXXXX. I am 27 years old and a breast cancer patient-Stage II. had surgery in February 2012, now taking chemotherapy . 1st 4 chemo has completed and now taking texotere medicine as a result my SGPT becoming high after taking texotere. I started to taxotere (60mg each week of total 12 weeks) on 5th june and then SGPT was 89.. afetr 3 weeks while it came 60 i took 2nd doz on 24th june and then had test for sgpt which result was 130. yesterday i did test again and result is 390. I am really tensed about this. For increasing SGPT i am not being able to taking chemo weekly. Is it very harmful for my treatment? FYI i am doing service, My doctor told me to take bed rest. please suggest me How can i reduce it. can i get a food chart ( what i can't eat) Thanks & Regards","Doctor":"Hi It appears that the high level of SGPT is due to taxotere. With this level (>5 times of upper limit), you have to stop taxotere for time being and wait for it to come down. After that you may try its alternative, Taxol and see what happens. By the way, the better way to give taxotere is to give it 3 weekly (dose is higher), while Taxol is usually given weekly. You can discuss this with your oncologist. You can continue your normal diet."},{"Patient":"After rectal cancer,good blood test and CEA,just a little low platelets and WBC . Oncologist not worried.He told me to lose weight .

Low platelet count could be the result of some form of chemotherapy you might have received after surgery. I am sure your oncologist will be monitoring the blood tests. As for excessive gas, there are several reasons. Some people ingest a lot of air like during smoking or during chewing a lot of gum.Intestinal gas is also produced from firmentation of certain foods. If you are lactose intolerant (Milk,Dairy) you can try switching to lactose free milk or lactaid added milk. Eating too many fruits can also cause excessive gas. There is a product called \\"Beano\\" which does not require prescription. You can try taking that once a day.Essentially cutting back on fatty foods and have more protein rich foods and also limiting sweets combined with moderate excercise would help you lose weight.

She started out having it only in her breasts now she has it pretty much around most of her body (recently found in her stomach ). However, oddly enough she wasn t admitted because of her cancer, it was because she had fluid in her lungs. Did this happen because of cancer? The doctors are saying she is in horrible condition and may not even last long....","Doctor":"Hello Thank you for getting in touch with us. As I see, you aunt is suffering from breast cancer which has spread to various parts of the body. If treatment is delayed for any kind of malginant cancer, it usually starts spreading to the lymph nodes and other parts of the therapy. Therefore, treatment is started as soon as the diagnosis is made and sometimes even with a provisional diagnosis in hand. Sometimes, even the medicines which are used in chemotherapy have many side effects and can lead to severe morbidity. One of them is fluid in the lungs. The fluid needs to be eliminated as soon as possible as it can lead to severe complications like infection, inflammation etc. Sometimes that fluid needs to be drained while in some cases, it can be taken care of by medicines. The prognosis for your aunt does not look that good at the moment and you should make sure that you guys provide her full support. Hope this helped.

Welcome to HCM Depending on age there there are many types of testicular cancers. Almost all of these have a common symptom in the form of painless testicular enlargement. Some tumours also manifest with virilization/ feminising symptoms. Apart from these, there can be other symptoms e.g weigth loss or lymph nodal enlargement (in case of a systemic lymphoma involving testis). In any case the best approach is by HRUS followed by biopsy procedures if clinically indicated.

Looking at your USG report, you are having polycystic ovary which is a hormonal imbalance leading to irregular cycles. Your endometrium is thick, so your doctor thought that you might get your period soon. But, as you did not get your periods,you should consult gynaecologist.

I m not sure what any of that means but she seems convinced the doctor will tell her it s cancer since her mother had kidney cancer a few years ago, but her mother started with lung cancer due to chronic smoking . What are some of the possibilities the white spots could indicate?","Doctor":"Hi there. Cystic kidneys are found in 1 to 2 persons per 1000 persons. This means many persons do have cystic kidneys but do not know it yet. Usually cystic kidneys are harmless but are known to cause high blood pressure, possible cysts in pancreas, liver, heart and brain. This is seen in Polycystic kidney disease or Autosomal dominant variety. Your mother needs to discuss this with her Doctor and get required check ups for early diagnosis and prevention of any problems. There is not a problem unless your mother has lost significant weight recently. Cancer may be a part of the differential diagnosis but less common, so not to worry. Wishing good health.

It is incurable but patient can can be provided with good life by palliative gastrectomy and chemoradiation. Average survival is 14-15 months with 5 year survival of 4.6%.

There is no harm if you get the review of the biopsy. I hope you have gone through the tumor board to explore other modes of treatment like brachy therapy on your cheek.

Fever medications reduce fever only for four to six hours and fever usually recurs again, hence it needs to be repeated 4-6th hourly once. Antibiotics take atleast 48hours for response to occur. Hence it is always better to wait for atleast two days of antibiotics provided child is taking some amount of food and adequate quantities of water. Fever can be due to virus(Dengue), bacteria(typhoid, urinary infection), malaria. If fever doesn't subside even after 48 hours of antibiotics, he needs blood tests, urine tests to know the cause of fever and treat accordingly.

I shoyld also let you know that about a year ago my right breast was hurting terrible and hurts whenever I m closed to my period.

I will however like you to tell me what you think about the lump in my left breast. Added to that the partition where my left breast separates from my right hurts a litttle whever I pass my figures there. Can u please help me Thank you very much","Doctor":"Hi. 1. What you are having (I would not use the term 'suffering from') is called 'benign nodularity'. This is a common problem having a hormonal basis and there is nothing to worry about. 2. Now I will tell you the way to feel your own breasts to confirm benign nodularity. If you pick up the breast between the fingers, you will feel a big firm mass (even normally). And if you feel the breast with the flat surface of pulp of your fingers with gentle rotating movements, you will not feel that firm mass which you felt earlier; instead you will perceive a granular feel (similar to the feel of a gunny bag filled with grains like rice for example). The granular feel suggests benign nodularity. 3. Remember while feeling the breast with the flat surface of pulp of your fingers if you feel a firm or a hard mass (irrespective of its size), then it is a cause for concern and you must consult a surgeon at the earliest. 4. Regarding pain overlying the breast-bone, well, it has nothing to do with the breasts. Such pain is usually self-limiting though it may take some time (maybe months) to disappear. Try some simple symptomatic treatment like local application of a little Iodex (or any other similar ointment) followed by hot fomentation. In short, at present, you have nothing to worry about. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi, I m a 51 year old woman and I ve just found a lump in my arm pit thats about the size of a peanut and only hurts when i push it, it moves a bit and I m going through the menopause, thankyou.","Doctor":"Hi. 1. First and foremost, the swelling in the armpit has nothing to do with menopause. 2. Feel your breasts yourself carefully to look for a swelling. The correct way to feel the breasts: Feel with flat surface of pulp of your fingers with gentle rotating movements. Feel systematically starting in one quadrant, then all the way round coming back to the original spot and finally the central area (containing nipple and areola). 3. If the swelling in the armpit feels hard or if you find a swelling in the breast, then consult a General Surgeon at the earliest. Otherwise, observe the swelling in the armpit carefully over a couple of weeks and then see a General Surgeon even if it has remained stationary. It is essential that a swelling in the armpit be physically examined by a Surgeon at some stage to know its exact nature.

In case of fistula it need to be drained, which is already done by you. After that pain medication to reduce the pain and antibiotic to prevent and check the infection. In case absess if it is small there is no need of stiches, the pain is uaually well managed by pain killers, you need not to worry about the pain.

My dad passed away last year of bowel cancer (actually had mucosal melonoma) does all of this sound normal?","Doctor":"Hi kirstie, Your history points towards some insect bite allergy. It may be even due to other cosmetic or dye allergy. You have to visit a physician and get yourself examined. If there is any suspicion of cancer you may hv to undergo mammogram and an FNAC.

He also must be suffering from paralysis because of the same. At present there is no curative treatment for such a disease at this terminal stage. He is being appropriately managed already. Mannitol is being given to reduce the brain edema. You can even add tablet acetazolamide to be given through ryles tube to reduce the edema further.

He doesnt have hemmoroids","Doctor":"Hi jenny, I would like to know whether it is multiple myeloma or malignant melanoma. Both this can occur in sinus cavity. If there is any brain metastasis due to melanoma he can have some behavioural problem depending upon the the size and location of the tumour metastasis in brain. If it is myeloma then there is a chance of platelet abnormality which may cause bleeding after passing stools. Whatever it is a biopsy from the lesion in the sinus cavity will rule out cancer.

Based on the information provided, your father has recurrent attacks of Tuberculosis. Recurrent Tb is seen in people with compromised immunity like malnutrition, malignancy, HIV, diabetes, treatment with steroids and immuno suppresants etc., or due to drug defaulting or Drug resistant TB. As you have mentioned your father had lung cancer the possible causes for recurrence in your father's case are malnutrition, malignancy and usage of immunosuppresants( used to treat Malignancy). You have not mentioned what is the type of lung cancr with which your father suffered. So i can not comment on that. As far as Treatment of TB is concerned AKT4 should work. As it has been just 10 days since the treatment started, please wait for 2 more weeks. If the fever and body pains still persist, then taking Streptomycin Injections along with AKT4 should help your father.

This bleeding can happen if there is any bleeding in the intestinal tract.

But, you should also be concerned if there is possible cancerous cells. With regards to diet, I am glad you have noticed that sweets do not work well with you.

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. Although it requires a physical examination, from the history alone, the lump could be an inguinal hernia which in its initial stages would cause some discomfort and pain. You would have to get it examined by a general surgeon in your area for confirmation.For the acid reflux specially at night, you could do the following:1) Elevate the head end of the bed with two blocks on each side, so that the regurgitation does not occur while lying down, and the contents of esophagus and stomach flow down with gravity.2) Some modification in your diet like more of roughage, enough liquids, avoidance of oily, fried, and fast food, and avoidance of alcoholic beverages and smoking if you do.3) Regular routine exercises like morning walk depending on your medical fitness.4) Prescription for a prokinetic agent and a proton pump inhibitor for symptomatic relief and to have a control on the acid production and facilitate movement of gastric contents downwards.5) Routine stool test for ova and cyst and treat them if positive.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Since there is painful limitation in the range of movement but no bony changes on xrays you need to rule out other musculoskeletal or systemic or infective problems.This requires a step by step evaluation first by physical examination of the child by a pediatrician or pediatric orthopaedist and depending on which further investigation may be done like ultrasound or mri of the affected limb, ultrasound abdomen and pelvis. blood tests like complete blood counts, esr, crp, bleeding profile etc Since there is a strong history of malignancy in family, it is better to be investigated and be on the safer side, however it's less likely as most bone tumours should be visible on xrays.

My brother has had 2 endoscopy procedures in the last week. he has been diagnosed with stomach cancer . I should note: he is mentally retarded & epilleptic. It is a difficult situation.

I am spraying his throat with chloraseptic (as per my pharmacist s suggestion, although it only works for a very brief period). Also, giving him clear tea with honey . He still suffers considerably. Any suggestions?? Note: he will be undergoing surgery to install a port to receive chemo. Thank you","Doctor":"Dear, If stomach cancer is vomitting after eating, usually it means that tumor is blocking the passage of food through stomach. In your brother's  case, surgery is the most appropriate treatment if  he do not tolerate oral feed and vomits out nearly completely what so ever he had ingested within few hours to 1-2 days. If blockage of food passage is partial, then stent (tube) can be placed without surgery though mouth using special instrument (endoscope). Chemotherapy help to prevent spread of tumor.

You and all well wisher of your Boss should support and motivate him for proper treatment. To minimize the ill-effect of jaundice on liver and remaining body, stent (tube) may be placed across the blockage of bile-duct cancer to facilitate bile flow to intestine. So jaundice, itching will be controlled. Surgery is best treatment as it removes tumor from body, provided tumor is well localised and this is assessed on CECT or MRI of abdomen.

Newer chemotherapy drug are used in clinical trial with some more better results. To participate in trial, patient and family should be well motivated.

Non-hormonal options:  over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs, or similar prescription drugs 3.  Surgery:  removal of the fibroid, removal of the uterus, or a procedure called embolization (where the fibroid is essentially killed by cutting of its blood supply) Painkillers is not a good long-term option.

Based on the information provided by you, the breast lump could be a Fibroadenoma or fibrocystic disease. Fibroadenoma is benign swelling which moves freely with in the breast tissue and is usually pains and often requires no treatment. Fibrocystic disease is usually seen in women in their 30s and present as a painful mass which does not move freely in breast tissue. It presents as pain during menstruation ( Cyclical Mastalgia). You have not mentioned anything about pain in the swelling during menstruation. The possibility of fibrocystic disease can be ruled out as you are 22 and you dont have any pain. So, the breast lump you have is a Fibroadenoma. FNAC does not remove the swelling. FNAC is a test where some sample of the lump is taken through the needle and tested to know what type of swelling. Evion Capsules contain Vitamin E and you can take them with out any doubt. You need no special precauations and just stop worrying. Please get the FNAC done and if it turns out to be fibroadenoma, you do not needs any surgery. Surgery in Fibroadenoma is required only when the lump is too big and causes mass effects.

Two years ago I had a large (20cm) benign schwannoma tumour removed surgically from a nerve behind my lung , and I also had blood clots across both lungs, which I was treated with warfarin for for 6 months. I have for the last 4 years been suffering from right lower sided abdominal pain , for which I still don t have a diagnosis. The pain varies from mild to occasionally very severe. My GP is of the belief I have endometriosis , but unfortunately I cannot have a laparoscopy as I am too overweight. I suffer from fatigue regularly, and regularly pick up chest infections and water infections. Just recently (one month ago) I had what my Doctor believed to be a kidney infection, and had a persistant high temperature on 3 different occasions. Following antibiotics and paracetamol it didn t bring down my temperature for 3 weeks. My GP now also considers that this wasn t a kidney infection, but I often have microscopic blood in my urine. The problem that I m having now is that my legs are aching horribly, and I have unexplained bruising on my arms and legs, as well as a chesty, wheezy cough. The pain in my legs is so bad that I cannot pull myself up off the bed/chair. I am suffering fatigue badly at the moment and I also have mild asthma which isn t helping the cough. My worry after having suffered from blood clots is that this may be a blood disorder. I also suffered from a nose bleed about 5 days ago, and it s very rare for me to have them, the last one must have been over 10 years ago. I do get a bit nervous when I am unwell, as when I was diagnosed with a tumour I spent about 4 weeks unable to breathe and with chest pain (and also had calf pain) which went unnoticed by doctors, who just thought it was a chest infection and gave me antibiotics. I m worried about something being missed again. Any advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

General Data This is a case of a 27 year old female, single, Catholic from Samar, admitted for the first time due to severe throbbing headaches and enlargement of the abdomen. History of Present Illness Condition started 8 months PTA, when she suddenly felt severe throbbing headaches while lying down, occurring alternately between the right and left sides of the head, lasting approximately an hour with associated nausea. The pain would be slightly relieved by Paracetamol . This was also associated with blurring of vision. The patient was noted to have light perception , but other figures were described as “cloudy”. There was also notable enlargement of the abdomen prior to headaches, no change in the frequency of bowel movement (defecates every other day) as claimed by the patient. She denied of any intimate contact. Seven months PTA, the headache and nausea persisted, this time associated with dizziness. Symptoms progressed until 5 months PTA, when the patient consulted a neurologist . She was diagnosed to have an intracranial tumor. Ophthalmologic examination was also sought by the patient. She was also referred to a surgeon and gynaecologist for the evaluation of abdominal enlargement. There were episodes of difficulty in urination, more felt at the latter part of voiding. Four months PTA, consultation was done in another institution. A skull x-ray was taken and was found to be unremarkable. A cranial MRI examination was advised to patient but deferred due to financial constraints. 1 week PTA, the cranial MRI was eventually done and the patient was subsequently advised admission. Ultrasound of the abdomen was also done which revealed a large complex mass in the left ovary. Review of Systems (+) unquantified weight loss (-) loss of consciousness (-) cough nor colds (-) dyspnea (+) easy fatigability (+) slight chest pain (+) slight tenderness on the abdomen (+) dysuria (-) bleeding tendencies Personal History: occasionally smokes 3-8 sticks per day since 18 years old. Family History: (+) Hx of diabetes mellitus , hypertension, and emphysema Past Medical History: No previous asthma, no food and drug allergies; S/P appendectomy 2 years ago Physical examination: conscious, coherent, ambulatory individual who was not in respiratory distress Weight: 46kg, Height 5’3”  BMI: 17.99 Vital signs: BP 120/70, PR 72/min, RR 28/min, Temp 37.9C SHEENT: (+) pale palpebral conjunctivae, anicteric sclerae, no naso-aural discharge; tonsils and posterior pharynx were slightly hyperemic with thin film of yellowish secretion, neck was supple, no palpable lymph nodes. Chest/Lungs: (+) symmetrical in expansion, with prominent rib cage, (-) retractions and clear breath sounds. The breasts are symmetrical but there was a palpable nodule approximately 4cm which is movable with delineated borders. Heart: precordium was adynamic with normal rate and rhythm Abdomen: globular with fundic height of 29cms, slightly tender, no fluid wave, vague bowel sounds Extremities: No gross deformities noted, Pulses were full and equal. Course in the Ward: On admission, CBC showed anemia of 8.0mg/dL, leukocytosis of 13,000/cu.mm, platelet count of 284,000. Two units of FWB were transfused. Urinalysis revealed sugar - negative, albumin - 3+, pus cells - 50/hpf. Blood chemistries showed: Blood Chemistry Results FBS 120mg/dL BUN 24mg BUA 5.5mg/dL Creatinine 1.4mg/dL Total Cholesterol 179mg/dL Triglycerides 125mg/dL HDL 55mg/dL LDL 120mg/dL ALT 24mg/dL AST 21mg/dL CXR: slight prominence of the hilar lymph nodes with minimal infiltrates The patient still experienced throbbing headaches, still feverish and was given antipyretics and was hooked with IV line. On the 2nd hospital day, nephrology consult was done for proteinuria. Ultrasound of the kidney, urinary bladder, liver, gallbladder, biliary tree, pancreas and spleen showed these organs to be normal. Ultrasound of the pelvic organs revealed an enlarged complex left ovarian mass. There was a low-grade fever with throbbing headaches notably milder than the 1st day. On the 4th hosp day, the throbbing headaches still persisted. CT scan revealed an extra-axial tumor with few calcification and cysts formation, probably benign. She was scheduled for CP clearance prior to surgery. On the 5th hosp day, the patient was still febrile, given antibiotics and antipyretics. A few hours later, the patient experienced headaches not relieved by NSAIDs. On the 7th hosp day, high grade fever recurred, notably drowsy, anasarcous with no significant change in the urine output. Blood chemistries showed hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperglycemia and elevated levels of AST. Potassium replacement was done. Insulin was also given. Few hours later, the patient became stuporous and hypotensive with coarse rales from mid to base on both lung fields. Dobutamine and epinephrine were started. She was subsequently intubated. On the 8th hosp day, the patient remained febrile and hypotensive. Furosemide was given and titrated due to further increasing abdominal girth and edema of the face and extremities. Fluconzaole 200mg/NGT OD was started. Patient unfortunately expired several hours later.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM,I will try to focus on the positive findings in your long and exhaustive history.1. The head aches associated with 'aura'- nausea, visual disturbances, pain relieved by paracetamol suggest migraine. An extra axial tumor with calcification and cysts (? meningioma) can also produce headache, focal neurological symptoms but 'aura' is less likely to be associated with a brain tumor.2. There is a history of painful abdominal mass, uterine enlargement and detection of a complex ovarian mass on the left side abdomen. This is likely to be an ovarian tumor. Constitutional features- weight loss, fatigue are constitutional symptoms associated with malignancy. So, the second most probable pathology was an ovarian tumor.3. Hyperemic pharyngeal mucosa suggests focus of infection due to which the patient was febrile.4. Biochemical abnormalities- hypernatremia, hypokalemia, hypoalbuminemia and albuminuria suggests renal pathology.Albuminuria is a feature of glomerular membrane damage.Hypernatremia and hypokalemia are seen in tubulo-interstitial diseases.So, these findings suggest pathology of all compartments of the kidney.Hypokalemia is a dangerous condition.As you have mentioned that, potassium replacement had been given, however, a recurrent fall in potassium levels can cause dangerous arrthymias and sudden death.Moreover anasarca suggests a decompensated kidney.Ovarian tumor or a brain tumor are unlikely to cause sudden death.I hope my answer is of some help to you.Thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"I am a male over 45 years old, I am unable to hold my urine , I urinate frequently and it is always alot...should I be worried about prostate cancer","Doctor":"seeing age generally prostate cancer is disease of old age(>60 years ) . this is more likely either UTI or benign prostatic hypertrophy. but to rule out cancer of prostate you should get done Serum PSA Level done. along with digital examination of prostate(per rectal examination) this digital examination should always follows PSA estimation as this examination falsely raise level of PSA.

Also if a PET scan shows inflammation in the lymph nodes, but the lymph nodes appear normal how likely might it be that the inflammation is residual effects from the radiation,or rather that the cancer returned?","Doctor":"Hi, PET scan will certainly be able to differentiate between scar tissue and cancer. But the timing of PET scan is very very important. After radiation therapy, it is ideal to wait for 12 weeks before radiation induced inflammation becomes normal. If FDG uptake occurs after 12 weeks from completion of radiation, it is not radiation induced inflammation. At 7 weeks, it become difficult to conclusively say if its  cancer or radiation induced inflammation. But the dictum if radiation induced FDG uptake is usually diffuse and low to moderate grade. A focal area of uptake usually indicates another problem like cancer or infection. Recurrent cancer usually is focal and intense, though its not a dictum in all the cases."},{"Patient":"hi and thanks my 26 year old daughter was diagn with castlemans disease . she has an enlarged lympnode on her neck which they did a biopsy the doctor is sending her for a ct scan of the body to make sure its only that one . question why would they not do a pet scan (only doing a cat scan ) ?","Doctor":"FDG (the medicine used in PET scan) uptake in castleman disease is modest.

They do no dissolve and have to be removed few days after adhesion of the wound edges. Pain is usually present post-operatively. pain killers are prescribed in the post-operative period. However, if the pain is constant not relievd by common pain killers, there can be a possibility wound infection or wound dehiscence. Wound dehiecence is a condition in which the deeper layers of the wound give way. It is associated with oozing out of blood and serous yellow colored fluid. Burning pain in the abdomen can be due to nerve injury during surgical procedure. Heaviness and puffiness that you are experiencing is due to baby weght that you have gained during pregnancy. Consult your doctor for clinical examination of the wound to look for features of wound infection and/or wound dehiecence.

She may need a  Endsocpoy to do a biopsy of the growth to rule out the type of cancer. Because there are two main types of esophageal cancer which exist, squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. When the cancer is only in the esophagus and has not spread, surgery is the treatment of choice. The goal of surgery is to remove the cancer. Sometimes chemotherapy, radiation, or a combination of the two may be used instead of surgery, or to make the growth smaller so that surgery is easier to perform. If she cannot tolerate surgery or the cancer has spread to other organs, chemotherapy or radiation may be used to help reduce symptoms. This is called palliative therapy. In such cases, the disease is usually not curable. Speak to her Doctor about all these aspects and Discuss it with your Family and friends to come to a Final conclusion.

The treatment includes medicine that decreases acid production in the stomach and gives the esophagus a chance to heal. This is sometimes associated with improvement in the extent of the Barrett's tissue.

I dont see any harmfull effect of it in cancer patients infact it is beneficial as in chemotherapy and radiation recieving patients the demand of nutrients in body increases because of regenration needs of body cells. So you can continue using it in my view without any apprehension. Still it would be in your favour if would consult this with your treating doctor as well.

I have been tested for Turburculosis, lupus, stds, arthritis, hepatitis, limes disease and other blood tests. I was just tested for mono, two strands of limes and my thyroids. I tested positive for ANA antibodies. I'm scared. I feel like the little girl who cried wolf.

The duration of each complaint is not mentioned. You were referred to a Rheumatologist and infectious disease Dr.  You say that you have problems with inflammation in your whole life. What do you mean by that word inflammation.From this history and by the investigations, I presume that you have been suspected for an autoimmune disease.Normally when there is an infection (foreign protein) our immune system in the body produces plenty of proteins called as antibodies (collection of WBC) to fight against the infection. Infectious diseases are diagnosed by the estimation of the specific antibodies.Sometime the antibodies by mistake identify the normal protein within the cell nuclei as foreign proteins and fight against them. These antibodies are called as Antinuclear antibodies (ANA). A positive ANA test means auto antibodies are present, but is not an Auto immune disease and treatment is not needed. Even for some normal individual these ANA may be present. You were referred to Rheumatologist and infectious disease Dr for this suspisian of auto immune disease.Eliminating autoimmune disease as a diagnosis for you, I think treatment of all your complaints will be much easier. Till then don't get tensed up.I hope you understand thatBest wishes for you"},{"Patient":"Sir, Good after noon One of my relative 60 yrs aged is suffering from small cell lung cancer spreaded to brain .

Stage III cancer of esophagus would mean that the the cancer has progressed beyond the wall of the esophagus and nearby lymph nodes to surrounding tissues, but other organs are not yet affected. Usually for this stage III, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the main stay of treatment. However some oncologists also prefer to combine this with curative surgery which follows chemo-radiation therapy,however the risk from such surgeries is quite high at this stage. Chemotherapy along with radiotherapy alone has shown a survival rate of 3-5 years for around 30 percent of the stage III patients. Therefore the survival would depend on overall factors including the form of treatment. Hope this will answer you in someway. Regards."},{"Patient":"I have pea sized lump on my left buttock cheek.

From the history you have mentioned, it could be just that starting of oral food was early, and so there is persisting paralytic ileus due to which the  present problems arose. It may get relieved of its own by conservative management.One perplexing finding is of loose stool post opertively, which usually occurs due to any kind of peritoneal irritation to the colon. I am not sure, but there could be some fluid accumulation due to very many causes resulting in peritonitis which caused the secondary bowel obstruction. The vomiting of bilious fluid points to obstruction of the intestines. The treating surgeon is the best judge and he may go for some investigations like complete blood count, ultrasound abdomen, X ray abdomen in erect posture to exclude pathological processes in the abdomen. If diagnosed as a mechanical obstruction, he may be in need for a relook surgery in the hospital.I wish him an early recovery."},{"Patient":"sir, i am from bangladesh,my sister is thyroid cancer patient age 35yrs. 19th may 2011 CT scan report was thyroid cancer level iii, now doctor in bangladesh saying to take operation.then take chemotherapy .5th may 2011 she got one thyroid operation. now what can we do . if we come india which hospital will be better for us .","Doctor":"You can contact Indo American Cancer Institute at Hyderabad.

I have read that neoprene found in the rubber of the waistbelt has been found to cause cancer in California.  I am a healthy adult female trying to use this belt to trim my waist line.  Thank you","Doctor":"Hi Terry, Welcome to Healthcare Magic forum. I believe you must have see this message on the belt. WARNING! This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm. So, yes it does pose a health risk. If you are planning to use this belt to reduce/trim your waist line. My opinion is that it will not do the job. Because you must understand that there no such thing as spot fat reduction methods. Unless and until you specially cut the fat out of those areas which is done by liposuction only. Even liposuction is not a permanent. Fat will get deposited again those areas at the shortest possible time. You must understand that fat is distributed all throughout the body. In order to reduce the fat at the waist line you have to reduce your total body fat, which can be done only through strict diet and exercise regimen. If you still insists on trying to reduce your waist line with waist trimmer belt, I suggest you buy a waist trimmer belt which is made of different material.

Taking a 5 mg valium and 5mg oxycodone can help stop the attack.  I am 60 years old and have had a gynocological ultrasound but nothing was found.  What;s going on?Sharon","Doctor":"HI Sharon ! From the history of a bulge in your lower right groin, the first diagnosis one can think of is a possibility of Right Inguinal Hernia in its initial stages which gives rise to pain. This will occur whenever you go for a heavy activity which increases the intra abdominal pressure.Apart from this there could be a separate intra abdominal pathology altogether. If it is a grumbling appendix, then the ultrasound may not show anything positive. A urinary tract infection or a infection  of the pelvic organs can also give rise to such symptoms and your doctor may advise you for a routine urine test and a clinical pelvic examination to exclude the same.Do you frequently eat outside specially junk foods ? In that case one has to exclude intestinal infection specially amoebiasis. I am not sure to which region you belong to. One has to exclude chronic granulomatous infection of the intestines in people who live in endemic areas where such infections are common. Your family physician can investigate you to exclude this kind of infection.Wish you an early recovery."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, my mother has been detected Stage IV Gall Bladder carcinoma with multiple Liver metastasis.

Benign conditions which can elevate CEA include smoking, infections, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, and some benign tumors in the same organs in which an elevated CEA indicates cancer.

After reading your post, it seems that you are having your symptoms due to gastritis caused by excessive acidity and gas production in your stomach. You can take an antacid like Omeprazole 40 mg along with Domperidone once a day before breakfast. Following precautions will be helpful :- 1. Do not miss a meal. 2. Avoid spicy and oily foods. 3. Avoid smoking/alcohol, if any. 4. Avoid emotional/mental stress. 5. Do not self medicate, especially with pain killers and steroids. 6.

The reason is that blood levels of this protein can be increased in many different benign and malignant conditions. In the patient who is being evaluated for a pelvic mass, a CA 125 level greater than 65 is associated with malignancy in approximately 90% of cases. However, without a demonstrable mass, the association is much weaker. If it is due to ovarian cancer treatment depends upon stage of cancer. Treating gynecologist/oncologist will be in better situation to comment on prognosis( curability ).

Although it could be one of the reasons, but is not a must. It could be just simply be an attack of collitis or could be a pelvic organ like ovary giving rise to such sensation. Normally these organs do not give rise to discomfort while playing. In your case, it could be just a temporary phenomena if it is a collitis. You have to stop eating fast food and junk food in case you do eat outside. Even if it is appendix or pathology of other pelvic  organ, I presume you can play again once it is corrected.

Cancer is a world which has not been fully reseached yet. Cancer affects the body the mind and spirit, all three need attention when dealing with cancer. From the date of me being told I had grade 3 colon cancer (during an operation to remove my painful appendix) to the date of the latest MRI, six months later, my doctor read the MRI report to me. YOU ARE CLEAN, so sign of metastases in your body, from head to toe!  I refused Chemo having read Ty's book.  Order the book, should you so wish, email Ty, he helped me in my darkest hour.  Suffering cancer entails deep emotions and getting through one's darkest hour is not easy. The problem with most cases is that the first sign of being afflicted with cancer takes place too late when tumours have already formed with damage. Early detection is a key element and keeping ones immunse system strong by a healthy vegetarian diet, lots of fruit and veggies, etc. and reducing stress, goes a long way to retaining one's health.

In case of advanced cancer, the release of cytokines by the body, as a reaction to cancer, could cause degenerative changes in the bones. the treatment in both cases - is Vitamin D & calcium supplements (To strengthen the bones) and supportive medications like alendronate which can prevent bone loss and deterioration.

She is going to find that everyone around her will do everything they can to avoid talking to her - not out of meanness, but because they simply don't know what to say and feel really bad about this fact.  People also sometimes feel guilty because they're fine and the other person's not.  I would sit down with her during recess or lunch or whatever and just talk to her ... don't be afraid to ask her questions about her illness, how she found out, what her treatment options are, etc.  She is probably really wanting to share all her thoughts and fears about this with someone her own age who won't react badly to it - you need to be that person, if you can.  Offer her a listening ear, a shoulder to cry on if she needs it and a helping hand in any way you can (like making sure if she misses something at school, that you'll help her to pick it up later, etc.).  Try to be as positive as you can about her prospects, and try to help her to not get really down (which she inevitably will at varying stages of her treatment, which can be really harsh).  Remember too, many people survive cancer, and she could well be one of them.

With that, I don't have insurance to go see an oncologist currently, and with the pain from the lump from simply burping or swallowing, difficulty breathing at times, and difficulty talking (the vibrations send pain extremely horribly). I have a very high tolerance level for pain but at times its unbearable. Furthermore, my husband heard me wheezing while I slept a bit. I have checked my tonsils, nothing out of the ordinary there, no sore throat. Mainly the symptoms are pain in the neck/throat, a lump or two in that area, swelling, difficulty breathing, swallowing, talking. I am on the verge of going to the ER without any other options. I have tried Tylenol for pain, and IB Profen for swelling, ice wet rag, and none of it has worked for me. I'm concerned that when I go to the hospital they will send me home because I don't have a current oncologist for admitting me to do any tests.

Have stem cells already been used to treat diseases like blood disorders?","Doctor":"Stem cell therapy is the replacement of diseased, dysfunctional or injured cells with either adult or embryonic stem cells. It's somewhat similar to the organ transplant process but uses cells instead of organs. Stem cell therapy is sometimes called regenerative medicine. Researchers grow stem cells in the lab. These stem cells are manipulated to make them specialize into specific types of cells, such as heart muscle cells, blood cells or nerve cells. This manipulation may involve changing the material in which the stem cells are grown or even injecting genes into the cells. The specialized cells are then implanted into a person. If the person has heart disease, the cells would be injected into the heart muscle. The normally functioning implanted heart cells, in theory, could replace the defective heart cells. Yes, stem cell transplants, also known as bone marrow transplants have proved highly successful in treating a number of cancerous diseases such as leukemia and aplastic anemia."},{"Patient":"How does one produce gas or an bile movement after colon cancer ?","Doctor":"In the surgery the part which has cancer is removed and it is anastomosed to the part which is normal.

If domestic, is it vaccinated?If not vaccinated, or if it is a stray dog, we have to start vaccine without further delay. No need to worry about 10 days delay- rabies has a comparatively longer incubation period of 1-3 months, so even now, vaccine might be effective. The vaccine is only as painful as it is for other vaccines. Nowadays, most centres give intra-dermal one, which is less painful than intra-muscular ones.If the dog is available for observation, and has been asymptomatic throughout the 10 days period, chance of rabies is extremely rare, but stick on to the advise from authorities.Take care.

Most common cause of wrist drop and arm weakness in babies is Erb's palsy (injury to nerves supplying arm muscles) during the time of delivery.

Her friends knew about this. She is really depressed. Please help her","Doctor":"Hi, I can understand the cause of her depression because of regular bed wetting at night . She is in a hostel with her friends who most likely  must be teasing her  worsening her condition further . This problem is called as Nocternal Enuresis ( since she is only wetting her bed at night ). Many children suffer from this problem and with every passing year many of them stop doing so.Bed wetting can be due to : - A urinary infection which is a common cause in females more so if the bed wetting is of recent origin. However in your sister's case, she was never dry and you have rightly ruled out Urinary infection as the possible cause -Some children have a very deep sleep and they are able to get up when the bladder is full. This is common in children also with adenoids hypertrophy. -She may be having a small bladder capacity. -Since she is otherwise normal I should not suspect a neurological cause for her problem. It has been seen that medicines used for the problem are not very effective and many children relapse once they are stopped. I will suggest these measures to be tried first : 1. Ask her to stop taking any liquids at 2 hours before going to bed . She should empty her bladder before going to bed and set an alarm after 4 hours to get up and walk to the toilet to pass urine. There are Enuresis alarms available commercially. They can be attached at the diaper area . The alarm starts ringing as soon as the first drop of urine is passed in sleep. This will wake her up .

This is their learning phase, and we have to gradually and slowly change the consistency from semisolid to solid items to allow a smooth learning. Avoid items with risk of aspiration, like hard candies and nuts.Promoting self eating over forceful feeding also help the child to learn chewing and swallowing in a better way.

There are blood disorders that rarely can cause spontaneous bleeding from nose and mouth, but bleeding from ear is not expected here, and this strongly suggests a traumatic cause.The only possible cause for bleeding from ear, nose and mouth is a significant head injury with skull base fracture. Head injury or significant bleeding can cause apnea and cold skin.

Thanks, J","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for using this panel for your questions.I am sorry about what you are experiencing right now.Thinking of the worst possible  diagnosis is most common among health professionals. I am not surprised you are thinking of pancreatic cancer. I am not exactly sure why you have this pain but i will tell you why Pancreatic cancer is not anywhere near the top on my list.Pancreatic cancer occurs in older individuals who have a significant smoking and alcohol consumption history...They present with wasting, jaundice, and this really constant annoying pains at diagnosis....You are no where there. Also, high lipase levels are more common with inflammation of the pancreas and not cancer of the pancreas. If the lab says this falls in the normal range, though close to the upper limit, please it is normal and you should consider it so unless otherwise.I will strongly suggest that you get this thought of cancer out of your head. The mere thought of this is enough to make this pain very real which in reality may not really be the case. Tell yourself I am okay and say that as many times as possible until you get the feeling of having cancer of the pancreas out of your head. If you need the services of a psychiatrist to do this, then please consult one.

I took him to a nurse practioner and she said he was just a noisy breather and he would grow out of it. He is now 15 months old and it is just getting worse. what is wrong with him","Doctor":"Hello, I can see how that is worrisome.  I don't think the two issues are connected.  Many babies have blueness around their mouths when born. That's because it takes a bit for their blood circulation to switch over from being dependent on the umbilical cord, to having to establish itself without the mother. You son shouldn't stop breathing at night.  He can have pauses in his breathing pattern that last less than 20 seconds. In general, even if he is moving and making noise, he should not really waken.  Then, that may be normal. It's amazing how much noise and movement sleeping babies can make. But, if he is snoring loudly, not having chest movement for more than 20 seconds or waking up because of breathing problems, you could record his night sleep for the pediatrician to hear and take him back in for evaluation.

Since here it happened on both sides, the later cause is more likely. In such cases, we need a basic metabolic workup including urine pH, urine calcium excretion, serum levels of calcium, phosphorus and arterial blood gas analysis.

It will increase with exercise, crying, anxiety/stressful situations or feeling, straining (like to poop), and fever. Also, the best way to check the heartbeat rate is to use a watch and tap out the heartbeat for a second person to count. Also, counting for a full 30 seconds and doubling gives a more reliable number than counting for just 10-15 seconds.

If that's all there is, that can be normal. Sometimes you can feel a little 'dent' or 'groove' where the skull bones come together in a baby. As this area changes from cartilage to bone, sometimes there's a change in how it feels or a temporary depression. Once it all changes into bone, it will smooth out.

Her basic urine report show the appearance as cloudy, presence of protein, and it is reported that the sample is loaded/hpf with puss cells ,with 2-3 /hpf of epithelial cells.can you please explain what does it mean.","Doctor":"Hello, That sounds like a urinary tract or bladder infection. This is not unusual in children, especially girls. This is because the anus is relatively close to the urethra (peeing tube). A minor infection like this often causes burning while peeing, a feeling of having to go all the time (frequency), and a inability to control peeing (urgency). The most important parts of the basic urinalysis (urine test) is a measure called \\"leukocytes\\" which are white blood cells and Nitrites, which is a substance released by bacteria. When these 2 are positive, there is a good chance of an infection. Lots of pus cells seen is also a sign of infection. Protein is released by your kidneys, sometimes normally and sometimes it's the product of bacteria. Epithelial cells are another name for skin cells, and these just come from our skin into the sample. The urine sample should be sent to the lab for a 'culture' which means to see if it grows a germ.

My question is what could be the cause of this? How serious is this?","Doctor":"Hello,It sounds like the doctor thinks your son has a Urinary tract infection. Usually this is treated with a single antibiotic, either ZIFI or Oflamac that you mentioned would be OK. Usually symptoms go away in 1-3 days with treatment. If he has a fever, it might take longer. However, usually an infection is not diagnosed based only on the number of White Blood cells (pus cells) in the urine. On the same test, there is also a measure called \\"leukocytes\\" and one called 'nitrites'. If these are positive the test is about 80% true that he has an infection. Also, the urine should be sent for a culture - meaning a test of growth - for the actual germ. In adults, this is often not done, but for children it should be. If it is the most common germ - E.Coli - that is reassuring that this is just a minor easily treated infection. But if the germ is unusual, or not very sensitive to the antibiotics you've already started, then more evaluation would be needed. Also, if you son's symptoms don't resolve quickly and easily, more evaluation would be needed. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Even her favourite cartoon channel is now a no go area. Please what is going on? Should I be worried.","Doctor":"Hello, In general, children develop all sorts of strange fears. Most don't usually last very long. If she does not have any hearing issues in general, then I should say it is not a hearing/sound problem. I would try to slowly reintroduce her to the television, in tiny baby steps. You and your daughter should come up with ways to slowly, slowly get back to normal with the TV. First, just have her sit with the TV not on - try talking about it, describing it, talking about things you used to watch, talking about what you parents like to watch. Then, talk with her about putting pictures on the TV, without sound. Or vice versa- put music on the TV without a picture. You could start with you putting on the picture and watching it without her - she can be brave in another room. Keep moving in very small steps over a long time, like 1 month to get her back to tolerating it. I wouldn't push, but I would stand firm on moving through little steps together. One other suggestion - ask her what she needs to feel calm - could it be a flashlight she shines on the TV, or a blanket to put over her head when it is on?  Always leave that (hopefully beloved) object near the TV so that she only has it when she's making progress on getting closer to how she used to be.

Sometimes, a viral cough can irritate the lining of the throat making it painful or dry. Hoarseness of voice and harsh cough is more consistent with croup - a common viral infection that will go away in 7-10 days. Croup usually causes seal like cough or barking in the early morning hours (2-4 am) and gets better with steamy showers or cold air. Having runny poo is also a sign of a viral infection, and can come with croup.

She doesn t appear to be fussy or uncomfortable. I do hear the congestion in her nose when she is breathing. Does this sound like a cold, or an allergy?","Doctor":"Hello, This sounds like a reaction to pollen and changing weather. But in general, we don't consider babies to have true seasonal allergies until they are a bit older. You have to live through a few seasons of pollen before you can have a true immune allergy response. But, pollen is an irritating molecule and babies little noses and little eyes can get irritated and make mucous just upon exposure to varying levels of pollen (or dust, or animal dander, smoke). If there is no fever or cough then she probably doesn't have a cold. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

The best way to determine if this is a problem or not is to check his weight. If he is losing weight, then he needs more evaluation.  If he is not losing weight, then you could adjust his diet and give it some time. Normal toddlers diarrhea often takes a few weeks to resolve on it's own. While you are waiting, I would not change his milk, but I'd make sure he is not getting fruit juice (the sorbitol and fructose can be hard to digest) and is getting some fatty foods to see if that slows down his stooling. Often at this age, a baby's appetite will go up and down. Again, if his weight is OK, then I would follow his lead about his appetite. Don't force him to eat if he isn't hungry.

My 4 yrs Son was Diagnosed with acute ITP 3 weeks back since he had some rashes in legs(Plt count had gone down to 7000). IVIG was given @ 2 gms / KG. count went up to 36000 then 100000 and then backto 58000.Bone marrow was conducted and ITP confirmed .now is fine no medicines being given yesterday again count carried out it was 48000.Just now his left top lip has swollen,the way it swells when an ant bites,no reddish or clot signs anywhere in mouth or lips.Child does not know whether it is an ant bite or not. my question is can it be due to ITP or a simple ant bite am worried. Now I have been told to wait and watch no medicines.I wanted your opinion PL?","Doctor":"Hello, Having a child with ITP is a bit of a roller coaster, isn't it! This may or may not be related to his ITP, but without any visible bleeding, and if the swelling stays the same as usual, then I too would counsel you to just wait and watch. I know that is hard. Most swelling of the skin, especially that caused by minor trauma such as a bug bite, is not actually bleeding but an increase in inflammatory fluids in the superficial layers of the skin. It feels squishy and looks mostly pale. This is not affected by ITP. Sometimes, swelling seen on the body is really a bruise or bleeding under the skin. This can be a problem in children with ITP because it is related to bleeding and clotting. In this case, the area should look more like a bruise. But even then, you can help stop the (inside) bleeding by applying gentle pressure. Even with treated ITP and platelets above 20,000, this is usually all you need. In your case, I think you are doing the right thing by waiting and watching. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

The fact that there was no growth in the urine sample means there was no bacterial infection. White blood cells are also released when there is inflammation - serious or not.

Even a goiter or an enlargement is not usually felt by the person, but seen or felt when touched by others. Sometimes a clearing noise is a simple motor tic.  Many children develop tics - unrealized short muscular or vocal contractions - that will resolve with 1-3 months time. Other common tics are blinking or eye squeezing.

But often, it is made worse by the child being worried and touching them. Sometimes because they hurt, sometimes because touching them causes new sensations. I suggest putting Vaseline all over the nipple area to help. Another thing to keep in mind - At any age, a girl can have a \\"mastitis\\" which is an infection of the nipple or breast tissue. So if it is really red and not pink, or if there is any discharge, or it is very tender beyond the nipple - then she needs to see a doctor to check for infection. Hope I have answered your question.

If her stool is watery but yellow/gold and has sesame seed-like pieces that's normal also!  And a good sign of good breast feeding. You may be having some gas because of changing from formula to breast milk, but most babies do have some air/gas in general. Usually, until babies are back to birth weight, I ask you to wake them up and try to feed about every 2 hours (8-10x/day).

They are hard to tell the difference sometimes, but different medications are used. These two diagnoses also can be inter-related. Cough at night is a subtle sign of asthma and may respond to medications like albuterol or steroids.

Please advice can i give Calcium, Iron and Zinc all together. or should i stop giving Iron till Zinc suspension is over.","Doctor":"Hello, You can give those vitamins all together. In fact, trying to increase those in her food would be best. Is she not drinking milk? That's the easiest way to get Calcium in. Also, if she needs calcium she probably also needs vitamin D. Milk is the easiest solution to that (or yogurt, ice cream, cheese). Will she take mushed up prunes for iron? Lentils and nuts are good for zinc (if she doesn't have allergies).

They were flat for the full week we were there, and now they are raised. They are not spreading, but just raising up considerable more. They look just like the pictures of bed bug bites. Is this the usual pattern when they are going away? It doesn t seem to bother her at all, but looks awful. We just wondered if this was the normal appearance, going from flat, to raised over a week or so, or if she might need a little help from a dr. Thanks","Doctor":"Hello, It's so hard to say. In general, that can be a healing pattern. As long as you are not seeing an open sore, or any redness, or pain when you touch or squeeze her where they are, it's problem OK.

I m thinking that maybe something got up his nose, but can the nose produce lots of white mucus very suddenly?","Doctor":"Hello, I think you are right to consider that something got up in his nose. Yes, little noses still can produce lots of mucous even over a short period of time. Other things to consider - did he get close to a plant/flower/outside and get a sniff of pollen that caused his to itch and sneeze out a mucous glob? In general, if it is gone, it's gone and you don't have to worry. If something is stuck up there you should continue to see mucous that will become very smelly and grey.

He should be seen by another doctor. Some possibilities include regular viruses for which reassurance can be given - that will resolve with time. For instance, mononucleosis can cause this.

After this course was started the coughing has reduced a bit in last 2-3 days but I am wondering if his coughing can be stopped completely and what could be the cause why he keeps getting this cough back every week.","Doctor":"Hello, I would wonder about asthma with such a long time cough. But it would be helpful to know whether there is complete clearing between episodes or not and whether you think the cough vs runny nose/congestion is the major symptom. The antibiotics were probably given to treat a sinusitis, and if so, there should have been improvement around day 3-4 or 5-6 and then continued improvement until no runny nose. Has he tried any albuterol? I don't know where you are located, but in the US we use an inhaler or nebulizer machine to blow in medicine to the lungs.

Once in place, they won't be felt. The purpose of the grommet/tube is to make a good way for fluid that builds up in the ear to drain without bundling up pressure and hurting. Sometimes this fluid is just congestion fluid from having a cold. Sometimes, this is infected fluid from having an ear infection. I've found that some kids are very sensitive to fluid in their ears - draining or not! Like the pressure you might feel when flying. Or the dripping in one's ears from getting out of the pool. Acetaminophen does seems to help as does explaining to the child what is happening and trying to re-frame the word pain, to \\"Mommy, I'm feeling my ear!\\"  If it isn't infected, the antibiotics aren't necessary.

Most children with autism have a deficit in the skills that lead to sharing emotion, interests, attention and ideas with other people.  A great resource is 16by16, the First Words project, which helps. Here is a way to think about this.  If he is sensitive, he may cry about many things, but he would respond to soothing and holding and reassurance.  A child with Autism might not respond to this physical parental intervention. If he is going round and round on his bike and then stops to experience the sensation of dizziness, this might be OK. But if he is going round and round and no amount of interaction with other children or adults trying to participate with him in that activity can break his attention, then that might be more concerning.

The cause can depend on a lot of things.  When you look at the patch is it white because it is scaly or white because there is a loss of pigment? Most often, it's pityriasis alba, a fancy medical term for a white spot!  Most likely on the cheeks, but I've seen them everywhere.  Also, friction can cause an area of whiteness in comparison to other skin. Sometimes it's a birthmark that has enlarged and become noticeable as the baby grows.  But there are some more concerning white spots. Much less likely, but possible, is a depigmented white spot called an \\"ash leaf\\" spot because it is irregular, mostly oval and shaggy-edged. This can be indicative of a very very rare disease called Tuberous sclerosis.  This can be related to seizures, so I'm glad you're already scheduled to see a Neurologist.  So while you're there, ask them to take a look at the white patch so they can tell you if it is just normal or not. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Is there anyway that the mouse droppings and the mice in my house could be causing her to be sick instead of an infection? also i called health inspector no one has shown up in nyc, i contacted landlord and they made it seem like it is my fault because we do have exterminator that comes every month but im a single mom and cant afford to take off the 1st of every month. when i did let the exterminator in all he did was put in a bait trap on the floor and recently someone came over the house and said it smell like the bait in my house, could that make someone sick too? i cant remove it only the exterminator can","Doctor":"Hi, Yes, there are diseases that come from mice and rodents, but believe it or not, it's not all that common.  And those diseases have well known symptoms and problems.  Fevers really are common in a baby/child. If there are causes, and if the baby's growth (height and weight) are at the expected levels for each age, then 4-6 fevers every year is normal. Bait can be poisonous to humans, but most exterminators don't use that kind of bait in a house with children - you'll have to ask them. Hope I have answered your query.

He behaves great for his daycare provider, and is with a group of 5 other children each day. But while at home he is tempermental, aggressive, and literally cries about everything. We try to engage him, but nothing seems to keep his attention for more than 30 seconds, and virtually no punishment for his behavior (time-out, yelling, and in extreme matters spanking) seem to work. I am at my wits end and have no idea what to do.","Doctor":"Hello, This sounds very tough and frustrating.  First, a note of reassurance - children mostly act out and show their frustration and inabilities with the people they know will love them no matter what - their parents! However, this doesn't change his behavior at home.  I have a lot of questions for you.  But let's start with one - is he getting enough sleep?  Meaning 10-11 hours of sleep in 24 hours? That would be the first thing I'd work on.  Also are you and any other adult caregivers consistent with short, pointed directions and expectations?  And finally, have you discussed with the daycare provider whether it's his/her style or just the fact of the other kids being there? Hope I have answered your query.

Benadryl seems to be helping and lips look a little better and he seems to be acting ok. What about the white inside the mouth? Thank You.","Doctor":"Hello, There are a couple possibilities.  The white area inside his mouth could be a common yeast infection called thrush, which can be treated with dropper medication.  It should look like pieces of lace stuck on the inside skin of his cheeks, tongue, or gums. It could also be a healing sore from hand, foot and mouth infection.  Most sores or cuts or bites inside the mouth go through a healing process with some pink/redness, then a white membrane or white looking skin, then back to normal shiny pink mouth lining. Nothing has to be done for this. More concerning is the swollen lips.  If this has not resolved, or your grandson has hives on his body, your daughter should call her pediatrician.

First, as babies grow they irregularly increase and decrease the amount of calories they need. So sometimes they eat you out of house and home, and other times it seems like they don't drink or eat at all.  If her weight is fine on the Pediatric growth chart, and she has no other symptoms, that could be what's going on with her. But, sometimes, something more is going on, for example, gastroesophogeal reflex, meaning baby spitting or vomiting, could be getting worse, causing pain and leading her to not want to eat.

I've not seen a link to diabetes.

I often tell parents that it is normal to notice, soon after feeding, that a newborn's belly is lopsided. What I mean is that it seems more full (although soft) on one side than the other. There are several reasons I think of:  the liver is bigger in proportion to the baby as a newborn, their stomach muscles aren't as developed so they don't tighten and clearly \\"hold everything in\\", the baby drinks faster than she digests so you see a big stomach after feeding then it goes down, and there isn't a lot of subcutaneous fat until a few months of age, so you see and feel more in their abdomen.

It sounds like it could be a \\"simple tic.\\"  Children often develop involuntary small muscle contractions that they aren't even aware of. A tic just comes for no reason and goes away for no reason, anytime between a couple of days, to more typically a few months or so.

Of course it could be, kids do get 4-6 infections, some would say even 10/year. The first thing I'd suggest is that you write his symptoms when they occur on a calendar so you and your pediatrician can see if there is a pattern. But, if it the symptoms are  really reliable, and really spaced at exactly 4 weeks, then I would take him to see his pediatrician. More questions needs to be asked and answered.  Although unusual, there are migraine patterns that could cause this, including abdominal migraines. There are some periodic fever syndromes, such as Familial Mediterrean Fever, or cyclic neutropenia (low white blood cells) that could account for this. And finally, I would always consider stress and anxiety as a reason.  For 3-4 year olds, this is a big time for normal separation anxiety - consciously or not.  Children in general often have more physical signs and symptoms of stress. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

And in fact, can be quite helpful for toilet training! You know how to plan! Some kids will sometimes have very fast \\"gastric transit\\" time.  That's how long food goes thru the system. Sometimes it's one of those \\"always been true\\" things about a child, sometimes it comes and goes.  Most often the food that comes thru it of high fiber because it doesn't sit in the GI track long enough to fully digest. And that's OK, he's still getting the nutrients.

Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello, If she is truly crying when she passes urine, she should see her pediatrician because that's pretty unusual in babies. And take there temperature.  But if she is already crying, getting upset and then peeing, that is normal. All the muscles in her little baby body tighten when she's upset and then release (including those of the bladder). On the second matter, often babies are congested in their noses for awhile because they are still learning how to feed and their muscles are immature. So instead of swallowing everything down cleaning, their muscles aren't so coordinated so when the tummy muscle squeeze - some liquid goes back up into their noses and far back nasal passages. Then this makes congestions and sneezing so it will eventually come out.  If she is growing well and doesn't have fever, that's probably all there is too it. You can use the drops/vaporub if you think it helps, but usually it just goes away with time.  Sometimes until after solids start between 4-6 months.  I hope that helps.

He hiccups alot and sometimes it sounds like he burps after each hiccups. He spits up some but I don;t know if it is more than normal. Sometimes he does it when he sleeps because I see it on his clothes.

There have been very good studies that have shown that for a time period of usually 3-6 weeks of age, babies naturally cry more than any other time. We don't understand the reason for this.  In my experience, just knowing this is normal is helpful.  I often tell parents, just when you're really worried/losing your mind, you baby will crack their first smile and all is well in the world. I would not call this colic for a couple of reasons.  Colic is a predictable period, usually in the evening or intense crying for 45-2 hr.  So my first advice is to give it another 1-2 weeks. But, you may be right, he may have \\"silent reflux.\\"  There have been times this has been treated aggressively with medications, but the question was did that help or was it just the passing of time. Now, there are serious concerns about some of those medications, so we aren't using them if a baby is gaining and growing well.

A way to think about it is that you have sensitive skin.  What might lead to dryness in another person causes your skin to become super dry, itchy and scaly. It comes and goes, and some children (especially those under 2) may just grow out of it.  In my experience, it takes families a lot of trial and error to see what works for them. But most commonly, it takes lots and lots of lotions/ointments, applied very frequently - like 3-5 x/day and especially after lukewarm baths to lock in hydration. Hope I have answered your query.

But let me try to reassure you, it is very, very unusual for children to have breast cancer.  I don't know what stage of puberty development she is in, but it is not uncommon to have breast changes at this time. As long as it is pink not redness, painless without manipulation, located near the center or to the side of the nipple color and not leaking, you don't have to treat this as an emergency. Some adult women have very fibrocystic breast tissue - meaning lumpy, bumpy - and if she's destined to have that kind of breast, it has to start at sometime.  That may be all your feeling. Sometimes kids get abscesses or boils in any fatty part of their bodies - like the buttocks or breast, under arms - so if it's hot red, tender to touch and looks \\"angry\\" you should take her in to check that possibilitiy.

Is this something to be worried about?","Doctor":"Hello, I'm glad you're already been to your doctor so you know it's not an infection. The most common reason for something \\"white\\" in the ear is either normal wax (which can look like different colors) or a bead! So you may have to take her in again for visualization.  Itching is a very hard symptom to deal with because it is more felt than seen.  Some kids just like to play with their ears because they hang off their bodies (just like other things for little boys :)).  Is that what's going on? Does she do it to self soothe?

Try to be less sensitive, confident, don't think what people may say and be expressive.When you make a mistake, don't get angry or embarrassed rather laugh at it when others laugh so that slowly you get comfortable and your friends start enjoying your funny comapany. If you think you lack topic to discuss or talk, buy joke books (read it) and start cracking jokes from time to time. Everyone loves a happy person.Social anxiety is a fully treatable and can be overcome with effective therapy, work, and patience. Physical, sexual, or emotional abuse in the childhood sometimes make people anxious, come out of your hurt, fears and bad memories. You can contact a counselor or a psychotherapist, cognitive behavioral therapy is effective. It will help to build confidence, learn skills that help you manage the situations that scare you most, and then get out it face the world comfortably.Avoid people with whom you are not comfortable, stay positive about yourself, do not undermine yourself, cut on addictions if any. Stay well nourished and well hydrated. Medicines like SSRI's may help, you can take it initially for a few days after getting clinically assessed by a GP. Do not depend on medicines, the symptoms may get worse because of dependency. Switch to healthy lifestyle, do exercises, make new friends, stay cheerful. Never let negative thoughts overtake you.

Several hours later I noticed it had spread to the inside of her arms. The rash resembled hives as the red areas were raised and irregularly shaped. She did not have a fever. Could the rash be an allergic reaction to something that I ate? I have not changed any detergents/soaps. The only new thing was that I ate some strawberries the about 6 hours before her rash developed. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,Sudden onset of raised, red and itchy rash over body indicates an acute urticaria. This can be a manifestation of allergy to some insult (but unlikely to your diet), a viral illness or to an infection somewhere in the body.But, since she do not have fever or other symptoms now, we need not worry. Just apply calamine lotion over the lesions 2 times a day for 3-5 days. If it is not coming down by then, or if she develops fever, kindly take to her to pediatrician, as this will need antihistamines and steroids for few days along with treatment of any infection.Hope I have answered your question.

He did go swimming today but he said it was ok then. Have you any ideas or advice please?","Doctor":"Hi,Does he complain of any pain on penile tip even when not passing urine? Is the glans swollen or red? Presence of these features indicates balanitis / balanoposthitis (infection of glans and foreskin). If you are able to retract foreskin without force, there is no phimosis.If no such symptoms, and pain is only during urination, this may suggest a urine infection. This is usually associated with increased frequency of urination also.Kindly take him to doctor, as both these conditions needs antibiotic treatment.

Is this a puberty thing or should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Hi,This is common in boys during puberty and indicates normal physiological hormone changes. The lumpy feeling under nipples is because of normal glandular tissue that becomes a bit prominent during puberty. Discharge is coming from the same glands.No need to worry, just reassure him that this is normal. Avoid squeezing, as this may lead to secondary infection and abscess formation.

This can reduce the breathing and reduced brain function. When it is reduced, the baby would not be able to breathe. It is best to trust the doctor and get her treated by a neonatologist.

Anyone out there who can help?! This pain is unbearable!","Doctor":"Hi ! I think the home pregnancy test is not a confirmatory test to exclude a pregnancy, specially if it is somewhere else than its normal position in the uterus. From the history of your symptoms two possibilities are coming to the mind :   1) A neglected Urinary tract infection or pelvic infection, which has spread and causing the symptoms of a peritonism. 2) A chronic ectopic pregnancy, which might have  partially ruptured and causing such pain leading to a diagnosis of peritonitis.I would suggest you to visit your gynaecologist at the earliest, who may advise you for a serum HCG test, and an ultrasound of the abdomen to arrive at a diagnosis to decide on further course of action.Take care."},{"Patient":"my son dipped his hand in hot boiling water 10 days back his whole front and back hand portion has burnt he is 14 months old. the admitted him and gave antibiotics and dressing every day. the front area is slowly healling but the the inside part is still having dead tissues. how much time it will take to recover. will the new skin appear and will this hv an effect in his future","Doctor":"Hi,Time needed for healing and chance of any future issues like contracture actually depends on depth of scalding and presence of any secondary infection, which your doctor might have discussed with you.For superficial scalds with no secondary infection, wound usually heals in 10-14 days. Chance of future problems like contracture is less if no wrist joint is involved. But it will take much longer for colour to get normalised, sometimes leaving residual marks.

Are the lesions itchy?If no fever, raised lesions which are not fluid filled can suggest an urticaria (will be itchy), a contact dermatitis or a purpura.

This is because of abnormally high muscle tone. If we are able to straighten the knee fully passively, this indicates a dynamic contracture which will respond to intensive physiotherapy. If stiffening is severe enough to prevent full straightening, this indicates static contracture demanding surgical release, as done before for ankle joint.

I went to 2 doctors but they just prescribed zinc,AD vitamine, and folic acid and adviced me to wait while assuring me that she will get better by herself. Now after 18 days she just poops 4 to 5 times a day. Her poop is green and I saw a little mocus and a track of bright red blood on her diaper yesterday. We did a stool and urine test and the results indicated sever infection and blood in both, we decided to repeat it because we are not sure about the labs in here they are used to give wrong results without feeling any responsibility. My little baby is still lively, she gurgles, smiles,plays and feeds well without any other symptom, I m really worried and depressed what do you think, is she really sick? Thanks for your help Anita","Doctor":"Hi,Firstly, as she is active and playful, absolutely there is nothing to be taken as serious. Also, having bowel 4-5 times a day in a 3 month baby can be taken as normal. Anyhow, if there is blood streaking of stools, there is a chance of bacterial dysentery, although it is quite uncommon in an exclusively breastfed baby.What you can do now- just keep an eye on her stools- if no further blood streaking, your baby is absolutely fine and just leave it. If blood staining continues, kindly show to your pediatrician, as this may need antibiotic treatment.Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Later found blood urea as 145. After giving fluid dextrose 10%, it came down to 77, 30 etc. After removing her from ventilator support, she is started feeding breast milk and after 4 days again Urea shoot to 60. Once the fluid is given, the urea level comes down very fast. Otherwise she is sucking breast milk without any issue. This repeated twice in the hospital - like increasing of blood urea. Kidney scanning & tests are done, but could not find any issues. We noticed that whenever the urea is starting to increase, the kid will not urinate and also heavy vomiting occurs. What could be the reason? Please answer in layman s language. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi, Urea is a waste product formed after protein digestion in our body. This is usually removed by kidney. For kidneys to function normally, good blood flow is must. When blood flow decreases because of dehydration(>90% of our blood is water), as occurs in diarrhea, vomiting, low fluid intake- blood flow decreases, leading to decreased kidney function and hence high urea level. If serum creatinine(another test for kidney function) is nearly normal and urea decreases after giving fluids, this indicates that kidneys are normal as such but the main problem is dehydration. In short, here we need not worry about kidneys, but have to look for causes of recurrent dehydration. This can happen in frequent vomiting or vomiting, improperly prepared formula feed and rarely some metabolic disorders. From given details, it is difficult to comment on the cause here.

I took her to the hospital and they took a blood test,urine sample,ultra sound,intestine track,appendix and ever thing came back negative. I don t know what s going on but even her doctor is baffled.","Doctor":"Hi, Have you ever recorded fever? If significant, it is unlikely to disappear in 1 day without treatment. So try recording fever with a thermometer and keep a diary of the same to see whether it is truly fever or not. Only if this reveals frequent fever, we need to look further. Some abdominal pain, especially around umbilicus is quite common in children of this age- called functional abdominal pain, which we need not worry about, and she will overgrow with time. A normal blood test, urine test and ultrasound supports this diagnosis. Deworm her once with albendazol 400mg once, if not done in last 6 months. Avoid caffeinated items as far as possible. Include fibre rich items in diet. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards, Dr. Muhammed Aslam TK"},{"Patient":"My daughter Anwesha is 10 yrs old. I am facing a problem of bed wetting with her. When she is sleeping she doesn t come to know about that she has done urine on the bed.

Any history of inability to hold bladder when awake(urge incontinence)? No such issues and physical examination is normal, I would have given a bladder stabilising agent like desmopressin for 3 months. If getting good response, which is the usual case, we can taper and stop. Before this we need a physical examination for any uro-genital or neurologic issues, and a urine routine examination. Kindly discuss with your pediatrician. Meanwhile restrict fluid intake after 5pm, avoid caffeinated drinks(tea, coffee) and sugaries after 4 pm, Insist to void before going to bed, try setting regular alarm once midnight to void, Keep a voiding diary and complement for dry nights at end of each month.

She does not have a fever and her pulse seems to be normal. What is this, and do I need to take her to the ER?","Doctor":"Hi, This can suggest a viral prodrome. Sometimes rash and body aches precedes fever. If she is otherwise active and playful, nothing to worry. Just give paracetamol three times a day for 2-3 days. This will help chest pain, and fever incase it appears. You need to take her to doctor if the pain increases, other symptoms adds up or fever persists beyond 3 days. Hope I have answered your query.

He was having fever today and my family doctor got his blood report done in which WBC is showing close to 11500. He also shown a sign of my son having a heart murmur. Can you please share the criticality of this 2 points.","Doctor":"Hi, If he do not have any other symptoms apart from fever, this is probably a viral fever and we need not worry. A total count of 11500 is also expected here, and of no concern. Just give him paracetamol three tomes daily. He will be alright in 2-3 days. Get back to doctor if fever not subsiding in 3 days, he becomes lethargic or not taking feeds. It is quite common to have minor heart murmurs in children with anemia or during fever. This is because of hyperdynamic state(physiological increase in blood flow during fever). Let your pediatrician recheck the same after fever has subsided.

He has a cold and possible had a low grade fever and Sunday night was sleeping on my husbands lap. He jerked awake and went tonic with his body, legs. His arms were drawn up and fingers were clawed. What caused this? The neurologist says this just sometimes happens. He is 3.","Doctor":"Hi, Is this the first episode? How long the jerking and posturing lasted then? Any drowsiness or sleepiness following the episode? If first episode, sudden jerking and tonic posturing in a child who is suffering from fever and cold is likely a febrile seizure, especially if this was associated with up rolling of eyes or frothing from mouth. Usually this needs nothing other than treatment of fever. Only in recurring cases we give anti epileptic prophylaxis. Startle response is likely if such episodes comes during sudden sensory stimuli like loud noise or flash of light- this will be just momentary with no disturbance in sensorium or posturing.

We removed dairy from his diet and have seen a subtle improvement but still can t manage to go more than a few weeks without another episode. In February of this past year, his eardrum ruptured, and we were prescribed an ear drop. We found out the hard way that the drop did nothing to help the infection; he spiked a fever which triggered a 30 minute seizure that left him on life support and in the PICU for several days. We are at our wits end, having visited numerous doctors, a chiropracter, and a naturopath. Any recommendations for what we can do? He seems to be getting another infection as we speak, and lately we have noticed a definite sensitivity to noise. Additionally, he contracted MRSA from his childcare, so we are hesitant to continue putting him on round after round of antibiotics.","Doctor":"Hello, This is a very complete and remarkable history you provide.  However, it is not so remarkable, but par for the course, in a child with an immunodeficiency. The hallmark of an immunodeficiency (of which there are many kinds) is a patient who suffers many infections.Sometimes, these deficiencies run in families. Following a prolonged febrile seizure, doctors might wish to place the child on an anti-seizure medication prophylactically to lessen the chance of another seizure should your son get another fever. After he recovered from the seizure has he been developing normally?  With so many ear infections, I hope you are making certain that his hearing is being closely monitored. Allergy and immuno-deficiencies are often studied by the same physician.  In one children's hospital where I trained it was the allergist who saw both of these kinds of children.

In next three month (8-11 month) he was not gaining Wt. properly. Pediatrician advised for Urine R/E and C/S. In Urine R/E Pus cell was: 25-30/hpf and C/S is positive with colony count more than 1 lakh. He is given full course of Antibiotic and after recovery his wt. gain was better.He is kept under Prophylactic Antibiotic. After the first attack USG KUB Region done twice at age of 11 and 13 month were with in normal limit.DMSA Scan done at age of 13 month, Impression: Both kidneys are of average size and show satisfactory cortical function with evidence of minimal parenchymal inflammation. There is no evidence of scarring in either kidney. Differential function-Left kidney-51%, Right kidney-49%. MCU done at age of 1year and 5 month. According to MCU Report Posterior Urethra is dilated with residual urine in bladder but no Reflux. He is referred to Pediatric Surgeon. Surgeon is advised for Cystoscopy which was done at his age of 1year and 6 month. According to Operative note posterior urethra is dilated. Flimsy cusp on rt. side, fulgurated. Both Ureter openings are normal. DTPA Scan was advised 6 weeks after cystoscopy. Impression of DTPA Scan: Both kidneys are of average size and shape with normal perfusion and normal cortical function. There is no evidence of obstruction in either kidney. Total GFR estimated 114.14ml/min, Differential function- Left kidney-46.67%, Right kidney-53.33%. He is advised for follow up after 6 month. At age of 2 year and 1 month again MCU done. Posterior urethra was till dilated with residual urine in bladder with no Reflux. I consult with another Pediatric Surgeon who advised for repeat Cystoscopy.

Just give ibuprofen every 8 hours and give frequent small sips of ORS / pedialyte to avoid dehydration. Also give a soft diet in frequent but small amount. If he not excessively thirsty, passing urine as usual and eyes are not sunken- there is no dehydration. Do tepid sponging if temperature doesn't come below 100 after 1 hour of ibuprofenIf fever is not coming down after 48 hours, he becomes lethargic and not taking orally, or signs of dehydration persists despite giving fluids- you need to take him to doctor, as this may need antibiotics & fluid therapy.Hope I have answered your question.

As he had received TB treatment in the past, a positive Mantoux test alone need not be taken as significant, provided he don't have symptoms like recurrent fever, anorexia, weight loss or chronic cough.Just give him a healthy diet, that includes enough green leafy vegetables, fruits, pulses, nuts and dairy products.

Yes, they are contagious, and others, especially children in the household can get infected. Most of these are benign and will recover in 3-5 days, and no need or use of isolating them (infectivity will start before symptoms) from others.If the fever is not coming down by 3rd day, or if there are painful oral blisters turning into ulcers, kindly review with your doctor to rule out herpes stomatitis, that may need anti-viral treatment.

Fucidin is an antibacterial cream and will help to clear any infection there, but won't help granuloma to disappear. Treatment of granuloma requires the excess tissue to be burned / destroyed by some or other means (and hence any treatment modality will cause some pain / discomfort). We commonly use salt application or chemical cauterisation with silver nitrate. Salt, by its osmotic effect, clears the granuloma and can be done at home. Although somewhat irritating, most babies will be comfortable after initial few applications. Your doctor has given the right advise- need not worry.Hope I have answered your question.

Sometimes, hematuria from conditions like urine infection is mistaken for vaginal bleeding.You can keep the area clean(avoid too frequent or too infrequent washing), apply emollients like diaper rash on vulva in case itching / burning.

It is common for children to have few episodes of crying during recovery from a flu- the commonest explanation for this is eustachian tube dysfunction causing negative ear pressure/serous otitis. This will respond to paracetamol or ibuprofen if severe, along with a nasal decongestant., both three times a day for 2-3 days.Any severe pain can cause excessive sweating followed by transient hypothermia, as an autonomic feature. So just wipe it off and cover her in blanket- measure temperature after 1 hour- mostly will be normal. You need to take her to doctor only if temperature remains low or she develops the above said warning signs.Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

What is this smell???","Doctor":"Hi,When there is foul smelling discharge from one side only, and you are seeing something sponge like (sometimes this may be just an enlarged or inflamed turbinate from rhinitis), there is high chance of a foreign body being lodged there, causing secretions to pool up and secondary infection with foul smell.

How are the lesions- itchy / fluid filled / pus filled? It was helpful if you can send us a picture. In hot and humid climate, most likely this is milia- small pimples over the skin due to clogging and blockage of sweat glands. In absence of secondary infection (painful / edematous / pus filled), this does not require any specific treatment other than avoiding direct sunlight and keeping the skin cool with wet moping 3-4 times a day(apart from routine bath). If itchy, I used to give calamine lotion and antihistamine like levocetirizine for few days. In short, if she is not febrile and the lesions are not with surrounding edema / pain / tenderness / pus filled- this does not indicate bacterial infection- hence no need of antibiotics and no chance of blood contamination.Hope I have answered your question.

Iam afraid because i read online that if left untreated it could result to astigimatism. Pls advice","Doctor":"Hi,The need for surgery depends on the degree of ptosis. In significant ptosis, it is better to correct, as, apart from cosmetic issue, it may cause abnormal head posture, astigmatism as you said, and amblyopia (here brain starts to ignore signal from that eye) from sensory deprivation.Regarding safety of surgery in heart disease, it will not be a problem unless the child have inadequate oxygen saturation or cardiac failure.

Acute onset fever with painful blisters probably indicates herpes infection, a highly contagious disease. From your description, probably you had the illness first as cold sores, which then transmitted to her. She manifested the disease as herpes ophthalmicus. Uncomplicated stye is unlikely to be associated with fever and should respond to the treatment given already (during initial visit, signs might have been minimal and non-specific).

Sometimes such such reaction occur as part of the underlying infection also. Since the clinical features are typical of drug reaction, we have to take it as drug reaction unless proven otherwise, and discontinue the drug. If it is not getting down with benadryl, it is better to take him to ER, as there is chance of progression to a severe reaction with stridor / wheezing / breathing difficulty.

My instinct tells me she must have irritated at school, making it more pronounced.... not sure what to do. Thanks, Meg","Doctor":"Hi,Round ring around eyes, associated with swelling most likely indicates a trauma/collision there. Although this is called black eye, colour can vary depending on age and depth of blood collection. Superficial bleeds will initially appear red and later change to blue and the black. If there is no complaints of severe headache or vomiting, you need not worry- just apply ice pack and give paracetamol for minor pain.But if she also complains of photophobia (hurting by light) and watering of the same eye, there is chance that she got a corneal abrasion/ulcer during the hit- for this I would recommend to see an ophthalmologist, as this may need antibiotic drops and eye padding after slit lamp examination.Hope I have answered your question.

He has had medical problems his whole life, was very delayed and still is to a certain extent, He has very severe asthma and has been hospitalized many times for asthma exaserbation... His pulminologist did a bllod allery test in September2010 and his IGE level at that time was 571, about 2 weeks ago we were shipped off to the hospital again for asthma exaserbation and spent 7 days in Kosair childrens hospital. A week before being sent to Louisville, ky we were referred to a pedatrice allergy doctor for the scratch test to check for allergies, but absolutely nothing showed up... The doctor redone the blood allergy test and yesterday we got the results and his number has went from 571 to 992... I have seched the internet and cannot seem to find any answers for what causes this level to be so high... I was instucted to take him to his doctor here at home to have his spleen and liver checked and tomorrow morning we have to get an ultrasound to see if either is enlarged... I have been trying to find answers for years to see what causes all of my sons problems... He also has epilepsy and has bowl problems, hard stools and has to take miralax to help him go sometime.... My main concern at this time is to figure out what this number means and why it is so high!!! If you could help at all I would greatly appreciate it! Thank you Melissa Cameron","Doctor":"Hi,From what you said he has some delay in development, epilepsy and constipation- these 3 are interrelated- epilepsy and constipation are very common in delayed children, and we can control with anti-epileptics and laxatives as he might already been on.The main worry now seems to be asthma and high IgE levels. Asthma basically is an allergic disorder. Some has intrinsic asthma (allergy not related to environmental allergens but part of our inherent body habit) and some have extrinsic one(allergy to environmental allergens like dust, pollen, certain food). Extrinsic one can be controlled if we can identify and eliminate the trigger, but intrinsic is somewhat difficult- here our body over reacts to minute insults / triggers because of inherent characteristics which we cannot alter much.In both types, IgE will be high and symptoms can be managed with inhalers and certain drugs. Treatment is a step wise process needing regular followups and gradual up-gradation of treatment depending on the level of control.Meanwhile take care of few things- avoid dust, tobacco / other smokes, playing in cold environment, feather, woollen clothes etc. Keep the bedroom free of dust. Use wet mopping for cleaning. strictly adhere to treatment protocol advised.Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

As your doctor suggested, ultrasound will clinch the diagnosis.Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

The pain comes and goes, but has really been bad these last couple of days. Ice and Ibuprofen don t seem to do much. I do have a doctor s appt scheduled on Friday, but just curious as to what may be wrong. Can kids tear things like adults??","Doctor":"Hi,If the pain persist beyond 3 days of insult despite analgesics, its likely that he suffered a ligament injury- which is common in children as well. Kindly see your orthopedist. Meanwhile, continue analgesics and immobilize the joint.Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

For such cases, I used to give a 5 day course of antibiotics after confirming diagnosis. Kindly discuss with your doctor.
