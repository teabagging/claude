It is not good to know that the colonoscopy could not be completed due to sharp curve in the colon. This is seen in a few patients although.

The first time it came (August 2009), he had a terrible sinus infection blew out a giant blob of reddish material - after that, he got better quickly but the tiny red dots appeared shortly after. It lasted about three weeks then went away. Since then, it appears every beginning of February, last year it last about a week, the year before two weeks. As you can imagine, he has an outbreak now that is going on about four days. To understand what they are - they are not spots, splotches, etc. like I ve been reading about. They look like the pores have turned red, that s how small they are (like someone poked him with a red pen point a bunch of times), and they start in his midsection area randomly and spread to arms, neck, chest, armpits (but not where the main sweat area is oddly, maybe something to do with sweating or deodorant?), and generally NOT below his lower back/ upper buttocks . He itches like crazy. It s not folliculitis , it does not have consistent symptoms with that. There is no raised bump, no crusting, no pus, no indentation, no pustules, no blood, no oozing fluid - they simply look like red sweat pores. Other things suggested that he simply does not have the symptoms of: Scabies , Morgellons , Psoariasis, Grover s Disease, Eczema . Bed bugs and fleas also seem suggested, but we live in a rural mountain region, don t travel often, we have wood floors (no carpet), and absolutely no signs of bed bugs or fleas. Our animals have never had them, and I FrontLine them for ticks. It s too cold right now anyway. Another reason to rule out bug bites is I don t have the spots or itching and these do not look like bites at all. We live rural, we know bites and plants. No one else in our family (four of us) is affected. None of his family has ever had this. We don t have poison ivy (as suggested) in our region, and when he does get poison oak it is very different from this. We have not changed our soap or laundry detergent - his skin is sensitive usually anyway so we keep it always the same. We have not purchased new clothes recently, and he wears cotton, not polyester (another problem suggested). We think it might have something to do with an allergy to the plants waking up, seeing as they generally start that in Feb. here. Regular Benedryl helped slightly, Benedryl Sinus Headache and Allergy did nothing, and what has helped the most is the Benedryl topical gel after he takes a shower. He said it makes the itching turn to a burning, tingly sensation that s better than the itching, and then he has relief for a little while. The gel doesn t make the spots go away though. He does have minor seasonal allergies through spring where he gets typical runny nose/sneezing symptoms. He does have hypertension, but it s controlled with a low dose of Lisinopril and his blood pressure has been normal for a long time now. We eat healthy, lots of fruits and veggies, cook our meals, the last time we had fast food was...four month ago I think? Soda is only a treat once in awhile and it s generally Ginger Ale or Sierra Mist. We are rarely sick, we take our vitamins, we exercise. The point of all of that is that we are healthy. One thing I should mention is right around the first time this popped up (2009), he also got a rash right above his well, butt-crack, and also on his shins (like I said, sensitive skin). This is what you would think a normal rash would be...it s pink/red, irritated, hurts, causes the skin to feel thicker and sort of crack/crust, can also crack and bleed. The doctor prescribed basically the over the counter stuff that you would use for athletes foot, and we ve used antibacterial, antifungal, cortizone, he took antibiotics, etc. It helped at first, but it has never fully gone away and its worse again. He applies the cream after his showers twice a day but it s not helping and we are looking into natural stuff like Cedarwood and Deem oil. It s kind of desperate now. The doctors aren t sure what it is now because nothing has worked like it should have. The butt one is still there, the shin ones cleared up for the most part but on hot days when he sweats a lot pink spots appear but don t bother him or turn into anything worse. The butt one is worse during hot weather, but it s pretty much the same all year. So we don t know if those are related, but we haven t found answers for either. Any ideas on A. the red mystery spots and B. the butt rash and how to help him out with both problems and possible future prevention? We don t have health insurance, so each doctor visit is expensive to be told they are stumped and to be told to do things that we ve already done. It s been more effective to research it on our own online. I thank you in advance for your advice and expertise.","Doctor":"these ARE ALL ALLERGIES YOUR EPISOOE OF SINUS CONVERTED TO ALLERGIC URTICARIA THE ALLERGY COMES IN SEASONal waY IT CAN IBCREASE LATER I GIVE YOU TIPS NO USE OF MUSTARD CCONUT WALNUT GRUNDNUT ALMONDS SOYAO OILS USE OLIVE FOR APPLICATION AND COOKING USE NON TOXIC SOAP SHAMPOO CREAMS ABD BODY APPLICATIONS CAN USE ANTIALLERGICS FEXOFENADINE 120 MG OD TO REDUCE IT WHEN IT OCCUR YOU CAN TAKE LONG WITHOIY SIDE EFFECT GO FOR ALLERGY TESTS FOR DIADNOSING THE VAUSE OF ALLERGIES"},{"Patient":"I have been sick since december 23 with a cough that has become significantly rough.

I had suffered from Bronchial Asthma since the age of 10 years. I used to have severe attacks and during that period I was dependent on steroid and antibiotics ( or made dependent should I say) for around six- seven years of intense asthmatic attacks. Slowly and gradually the frequency of attacks became less and dependence on steroids also became less. These days I have to take salbutamol inhaler and a medicine called Telekast L. After procrastinating for quite some time and after consulting doctors I married at the age of 38. Unfortunately after two years of short marraige my wife also expired.My questions pertain to my sex life and the problems I am facing. For the most part I had suppressed my sexual needs and often resorted to masturbation.I noticed that I suffered and continue to suffer from premature ejaculation and after ejaculation there is pain in my testicle sac and at the root of the penis. The erection is also not strong enough.Moreover I also feel absolute lethargy and get exhausted very quickly. Most of the time I feel sleepy. With increasing age and a small child to look after I am getting increasingly apprehensive about myself. Many in the family are asking me to go for second marriage so that my child who is only three and a half years can be adequately looked after. But I have my concerns about my sexual potency.

The premature ejaculation is typically psychological in nature, so it is likely that a sex therapist may be helpful.  As far as the pain in your penis and scrotum, I would recommend being examined by a doctor, as this could represent an infection or an anatomic abnormality requiring surgery to correct.  Your fatigue and poor libido could be caused by a number of things, including low testosterone, poor physical condition, sedentary lifestyle, other medical problems (such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and others), just to name a few.  This should be evaluated by a doctor as well. I wish you good health, and thank you for posting on HCM!"},{"Patient":"i have aches on my side especially by lower right abdomen.

The doctor priscribed Aten 25mg for her. But I got to know from our family doctor that the prescribed tablet \\"Aten\\" will actually worsen her Asthama problems and he suggested to take Losar H 25mg. Now i am actually in a delima for to which tablet she should take. Can you please help?Regards,Pradeep.","Doctor":"Hello Pradeep, Welcome to HCM and thanks for posting your query here. Bronchial Asthma is due to narrowing of the bronchial airways. As it is more than 15 years it is a chronic disease. What was her BP? That you need to check. BP is not only a single cause for headache. Before starting the therapy her pressure levels should be checked. Aten is a beta-blocker. Definitely it aggravates the asthmatic problem. It lowers the pressure levels and the other action of the drug is constriction of bronchial smooth muscles. This complicates the asthma problem. Hence it is contraindicated in asthmatic patients. Losar H can be used without any contraindications in asthmatic patients. Hence please check her BP levels and continue the medicine. Hope this is helpful to you.

I have no known allergies and am a male, 32. Yesterday I woke up after going out for the night and in the dark I awoke & could feel my lips were swollen tremendously. About 3 to 4 times their size and looked like tiny little blisters were forming all the way across them, almost unnoticeable unless looked at closely. I thought my lower eye lids looked a little puffy too, but they didn t hurt. I had to go to school so I kept putting the chapstick on all day because it was driving me crazy. I must have used it every ten minutes or more frequent. It seemed the first two hours of the morning the lip swelling went down just a little. It was still bothering me though and I switched to vaseline all day and evening at home. The skin got so soft from all this (I think) that it turned white and rubbed off when I rubbed my lips from the itching. Leaving little wounds even There is also a little numbness in the lip with the pain on the outside. I think it started to swell up again some more that night, I used ice for a while and it went down slightly. I woke up today though and they were just about or as big as yesterday morning. My eyelids look normal, they were never really bad. My lip is all blistery looking with tiny bubbles all over it that you still have to look closely to see but It is scabbed over a bit kind of yellowish. Could just be the raw part healing over but it hurts and is definitely swollen awkwardly, just bulging all over the place and i can feel the tightness. There is kind of a sore in the center area inside the upper lip that was there from the start of this. I am really freaked out and have been looking online (I know not the best thing to do) at things such as allergies, Cheilitis , and staph infections and am wondering what this is and what it usually is. I have no other symptoms, mouth throat swelling etc. Just pressing my lips together slightly makes them hurt inside and out like I got punched or something. I shaved with a cheap razor on my chin and around my mouth, I don t use them normally. my chin is a little irritated but nothing like my lips, no swelling just razor bumps. Besides that I ate chicken alfredo and salad for dinner right before this happened. I feel like I have to keep something on them because the dryness causes constant irritation but don t want to aggravate it. l already skipped two important college quizzes right before finals because I felt like I couldn t leave the house today.

It is the dry lips and angular stomatitis, neglecting the fact you got them secondarily infected with bacteria, and had swelling. Or it may be due to allergy and secondary infection. Angular stomatitis is due to deficiency of vitamin B complex. I advise you to consult a physician for diagnosis and treatment. Wishing for a quick and complete recovery.

I took my blood pressure just on one of the machines at work and it read 138/86 with a rate of 93 bpm. Should I be concerned or monitor it for a bit and see what happens. I know the pill I m taking shouldn t be taken with high blood pressure, but I was unable to find an information on whether not it can also cause high blood pressure.

I went to walk in clinic and was prescribed amoxicillin for blocked ear. Took decongestants regularly. Fullness never went away and I have crackling noise and bad pain that comes and goes. Pain and cracklings is always worse when my sinuses are running. I went to Cleveland clinic ENT who inquired about chronic sinus infections (I ve have seasonal allergies) and he recommended sinus surgery and said my ear problems should later go away. I had my passageways opened up wider. Surgery went fine but didn t fix my ear. He told me to wait it out. Six months later still had bad ear pain. Went back to see him he looked inside ear and said it looks good and that it always looked good. He referred me to another clinic ear ENT who told me I must have neuralgia and should see neurologist for Botox injections to cushion the nerves behind my ear. My pAin travels to my temple, behind ear wear mastoid is and into front and back of shoulder and arm. The pressure I feel in and behind my ear always gets worse when my sinuses act up. My ear gets itchy on the inside and sometimes it feels warm to me, but doesn t feel warm when I feel it. No fever. My sinus scan in the first couple months of symptoms showed thickened mucis in the one maxillary on the right side, but they said my ear looked good. No other tests performed. Please help, I m in pain and I don t think it s nuralgia.

Its been here for the past week and happens only once a day, usually when I wake up. The pain isn t sharp but as if someone is squeezing whatever is there. I m over-weight for a 21 year old but haven t had this problem before this week.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query and an elucidate history.Since you have given a classical history of pain only once a day and that too when you wake up; and is related to the upper abdomen, the cause of this typical pain which is not sharp and appears as if someone is squeezing is most probably due to Colitis of the transverse colon.This is the part of the large bowel lying in the area you mentioned to have pain. The pain is in the morning as it is normal to have the body-clock to cause the contraction of the large bowel (colon), to facilitate the passage of stool (bowel movement).Hence you are getting the typical pain.I would advise you the following:Get a course of an antibiotic and metronidazole, probiotic for 5 days and see the results. If it cures up, you are fine.If no relief, you have to undergo colonoscopy and CT scan of the abdomen and stool test to see whether there is an internal problem. The further treatment will depend upon the results of investigations."},{"Patient":"Dear Sir / Madam, I am suffering from Allergic Rhinitis since 16 years back.

I am a female, age 40, 5 2 , 140 lbs, & in good health other than fibromyalgia & allergies. I am currently on no Rx medicines other than Chryselle, though I take ibuprofin as needed, chlorpheniramine usually once or twice a day but up to 4 depending on allergy symptoms, a daily multivitamin , a B complex, and Vitamin D daily, & melatonin on occasion for sleep. I do tend to run a low fever at times (99 - 100) although there is not always any kind of infection present & it seems to be something related to fibromyalgia symptoms. I am not & have not been pregnant any time recently, & check-ups have all been fine. My concern is about some lingering symptoms as well as a new one; for some time (at least 6 months now after I realized it was occurring regularly) I have noticed occasional nausea & an odd taste that seems to come from my nose (somewhat metallic, not like blood or mucous, but unpleasant & almost with a bit of bile taste to it). At first I had just checked these off as something due to stress, something I ate, and maybe something odd due to my allergies. After some time I began to notice these recurring more frequently to the point where on their own they had become bothersome, seemed more pronounced when I m at rest but occur at other times as well, and occurred without any obvious link I could attribute to anything else. I have not had any history of stomach problems or ulcers , and don t feel that this is the case now. I have also had headaches, but had been blaming them on needing new glasses or allergy symptoms, but have noticed they have also been occurring even when I have no sinus problems, & have been more intense than just my usual slight ache. I also have what sounds like fluid in my left ear at times, especially during exercise when it makes a very distracting clicking & sucking noise, and I had just written that off as allergy related, although it has become more of a nuisance in the last year. I had been planning on having this all checked out at my next visit. Last weekend however, I bent over to wrap my head in a towel, and when I stood up an orange colored fluid ran out of my nose. I have since then been keeping a tissue handy as my nose does seem to leak unexpectedly now & then, although not as much. It does feel at times as though it has come from above in my sinus somewhere, & other times it has just caught me offguard. With my allergies I have never had this issue. I had a cold recently, & I did visit the doctor last week. No signs of infection were found, but my symptoms were basically brushed off & ignored & not even discussed. I was a bit annoyed at not feeling like my symptoms were taken seriously at all, so I tried to address the issue & I was given an appointment to see a neurologist next week. After looking my symptoms up online, the only thing I find that matches is Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak. I would be more than happy to find out that s not the case, but at the same time I don t want to brush off the symptoms as nothing & treat it like an impossibility. Am I right to be concerned & what should I do or say at a next doctor s visit?","Doctor":"Hi welcome to Health care magic forum. Thanks for choosing H.C.M.Forum. You have got fibromyalgia, and getting treatment for it. You are having allergy and getting treated with only antihistamines.

I have no drippy nose only stuffiness that includes day and worst at night.  I went back to the ENT and he prescribed oral steroids for 6 days which made minor improvement and to continue to use Nasonex.  It is now week 8 and the morning and evenings are the worst.  I am at my wits end on what to do next.  I am up every night 2-3 times as my cannot breathe.

I am 26 years old and 30 weeks pregnant with our third child. I have recently discovered a quarter sized lump ball inside the right side of my neck. It is accompanied by an uncomfortable numb like feeling that is very constant especially when thought of. I am also having terrible sniffles, sneezing, runny nose, sore throat and irritability like fatigue. I'm not sure what this could be but I do know it has gotten bigger since yesterday and more apparent. I feel apprehensive of the results due to my pregnancy and am hoping that there can be promising results to take care of this after the baby is born if life threatening. Hopefully it is something minor that is able to be resolved before the baby gets here. Only concern is that I usually go into labor fairly early, my first pregnancy he came at 37 weeks and my second pregnancy he came at 36 weeks. So hopefully within this time frame I can do something about it.","Doctor":"Hello,  thanks for the query to H.C.M.C. Here I want to make very clear that you need not to fear about this swelling.

I have been to the E.R. and they prescribed inhalers for asthma which only made my cough worse, and by worse I mean much much worse, I cough so hard I vomit up all my food/liquid, I went to the E.R. again last night and they gave me fluids since I was dehydrated as well as a nebulizer which made me cough so much more! I was given my records and am going to see my family doctor in the morning but they mentioned that my xrays and blood work is all normal, they prescribed hydrocodone just so I could sleep and eat without coughing but I still cough - just not as much.

Considering a chronic allergic rhinitis is very important. Treatment might require systemic steroids even up to three months, associated with steroid containing nasal sprays to be taken even for over a year depending on the response. Nasal polyposis could cause similar necessitation of nasal sprays, and an appropriate spray might be indicated. Certain sprays like local anti histamines give instantaneous relief, but the effects are short lasting, and in a very short run become ineffective in some individuals. Remember that poorly treated allergic or chronic rhinitis could predispose to conditions such as sinusitis. I suggest you book an appointment with an ENT specialist for a proper evaluation and management.

Firs the treatment might be inefficient, diagnose common causes of poor response to usual antibiotics like pulmonary tuberculosis, indirect signs of asthma and exclude any localized pneumonia, abscess or pleural effusion.

It was caused by a virus that's kind of run it's course through the region over the past 30 days. For the most part, I have recovered and just had a little dryness in sinuses and an irregular cough. Earlier this week, I awoke in the middle of the night and couldn't breathe. i was suffocating and couldn't seem to get an airway open. My nose was stopped up and somehow, opening my mouth and attempting to breath through my mouth didn't work. It was a loud wheeze. i was somewhat in panic, because i could get perhaps 1/10th the amount of air into my lungs as i needed. The episode lasted for about four or five minutes. Unfortunately, I was in a hotel room in Bermuda and could do little except unbolt the door and try to dial front desk. Of course, i couldn't speak and could only produce a very loud wheeze sound, like someone who couldn't get their breath.  I have had this happen two other times in my life. The first two times, were when i was awake. Each attack was separated from the other by five or ten years. i am 50 years old an in good health, with regular check ups. Each time it has happened, it's been on the backside of a sinus infection. It seems as though my airway is flapped as if i am breathing through my nose, but of course that passage is blocked. I can't seem to regain control and breath through my mouth.  Each time, i have gotten to the point of falling down and almost passing unconcious, when suddenly and slowly, i can regain the ability to breath. over the course of a few minutes, i can return to regular breathing. Of course, the fear and some panic of what just happened remains.  Is this perhaps and asmatic condition? is it just an enlarged and inflamed sinus? Could some form of inhaler reopen the airway?  It's disturbing and the last thing I want to do is die over something like this. I can tell you that suffocation is not fun.  Any thoughts?","Doctor":"Hello Mark, thanks for the query.                                                                        Frankly I would say you are the patient of Asthma ( two forms 1-cardiac form 2- bronchial asthma). Since your 's age is above 50 yrs  so any type of asthma may be. Now a days asthma is not a serious disease but definitely it gives some trouble to the patient. Sudden wake in the night due to episode of asthmatic attack is a most common feature. Since in the night temp fall down so slight constriction ( of bronchi in lungs) is there hence patient feels suffocation. Cessation of breath is there and feeling of uneasiness is also. Regular health check up and do excercises which increase your's lung capacity. Once lung capacity increase you will feel slight relief. Beside this you have to take some good quality type inhalor. If option is medicine orally i.e. Bronchodilators late in the night 3-4 hours before sleep. Anxiety is sure but please relax.

Is ther any family history of atopy (allergy), asthma ? It is very important to be known, whether the child is experiencing this for the very first time is also important. A physical examination shall search for signs of acute inflammation, nature of lesions, redness, itches, eruptions and the degree and rapidity of spread. appropriate therapy first involves prescription of anti inflammatory drugs, usually steroids, which could be injectable or oral depending on the case, and an  active search of an allergen. This is very important to determine the particular substance the led to symptoms. Eliminating or avoiding this allergen in future shall therefore avoid future episodes. Cutaneus anti histaminic drugs can be prescribed to diminish itching. When very recurrent of failure to respond to therapy, immmunosuppressive therapy under the supervision of an allergist might then be required.

Can apply antiallergic creams and calamine on the affected part. Take a lot of warm water.Hope I have answered your query.

She was recently diagnosed with an iron level of 6 a few months ago. She was told to take iron twice a day for 3 months and then be checked. Her hand shakiness/tremor stopped while taking iron twice a day. She did a repeat lab and her lab came back at 37, which is on the low side but normal. So they had her drop down to 1 iron tab per day. Within a few days, her hand tremor/shakiness started again. Since it was during the weekend, I told her to go back up to 2 tabs and her tremor stopped! I spoke with her pediatrician who has known her since birth (she is a twin and was born at 37 1/2 weeks and has asthma (not bad) and anxiety ), and she doesn t think the iron has anything to do with the tremor. She said to let her go back to 2 pills a day for 3 months and then have her labs checked again. After that, switch her to a daily vitamin that has iron in it to see if that works.

I am a 29 year old male, 80 kgs (176 lbs), 5 feet 11 height. I was a heavy smoker for an year of my life i.e. 2012-13 almost a pack of 20 a day. I had an allergic attack in the month of December after eating a combination of non veg food, though i am a regular eater of white meat. The attack as guessed by the doctor might be because of the prawns i ate along with its shells. I had chicken, mutton, fish and prawns at the same time and probably the prawns got me the attack after which i had to be rushed to emergency. I went home after the symptoms subsided. After this episode i stopped having non veg food. On a few occasions i.e. twice or thrice i had to be rushed to the doctor for having shortness of breath and heart palpitations along with some tightness in the chest. On 25th of January i had the same symptoms and this time really frustrated and frightened i got myself admitted to hospital. They did all the heart related tests, i.e. twice ECG , 2D Echo, stress test, blood and urine tests, ultrasound of the abdomen, glucose tolerance tests, etc. which all came out to be absolutely normal after which they discharged me. The final conclusion the doctor gave me that i was allergic to all forms of animal protein as coincidentally the episodes happened when i had either chicken or egg. But there were occasions when i did have chicken and nothing happened. After this diagnosis i completely quit diary products, non veg food etc. I am the kind of person who is generally very concerned about my health. One more thing i forgot to mention was that i had completely quit smoking and alcohol i.e. cold turkey. After this episode i visited my parent s place and got an allergy test done. The IGE count came out to be around 325 and i was found allergic to tomato and mildly allergic to ground nut, cucumber and garlic. In the span of two months i have consulted almost six doctors, majority of which suggest i have anxiety. i have been having heart palpitations, bouts of tightness in chest and occasionally shortness of breath and they just dont seem to go despite the fact that the heart tests have come out to be normal. I will be getting married, joining a new job and shifting to a new city all in a months time. Is it related to this. Another thing i have noticed that my stomach has got a heart beat kind of an action while lying down.

I was hospitalized and eventually recovered. The red rash peeled off everywhere. About 2 months after recovery, I had baffling moderate to severe, itchy rashes that were different in appearance to the red rash. 2 biopsies suggested a possible immune/allergy/sensitivity(psoriaform, squamous hyperplasia , focal spongiosis, papillar dermal edema , superficial and deep perivascular mixed cell infiltrate-Eosinophils, Nuetrophils &Lymphocytes). Lab interpretation suggests a drug reaction or allergic eruption. I also have moderate to severe bouts of bone pain . The doctors just gave and still give me medicines to alleviate symptoms and to help me mentally cope. These meds (8 different types of topical steroids, tricyclics and two types of antihistamines don t make the rashes go away and relief is VERY brief, so I stopped using the topical steroids. The docs won t send me to an allergist . I tested negative for autoimmune by a rheumatologist , but she wants to test me again, thing that it was a false negative. . . .

The rash is on other, localized parts of my body too. The bumps on my outer vulva and other areas are driving me to distraction.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, I would advise your son not to eat from outside specially fried and fast food along with the aerated drinks, as some components of these might cause hyper sensitivity reactions in the intestinal mucosa giving rise to such symptoms. Also intestinal infections could creep in from outside food. I would also advise for a routine stool test for ova and cyst and treat it if positive in addition to a urine routine/microscopic test. However, he would need a clinical assessment of his abdomen along with an ultrasound of the abdomen not to miss out any other intra abdominal pathology. Therefore, I would advise you to get him clinically assessed by a general surgeon/family physician in your area for further management.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Your father is of age of 62 years, at this age it obvious to have hair fall due to low levels  of testosteron harmone. Of course there is possibility of involvement of drugs also for hair loss. Anaemia also may one of the causes of anaemia. Lack of lipids ant proteins also expected to be there inthat age group which can cause hair loss. Of course it not wise to search for the causes of hair loss, we go for ways to stop hair loss and improve hair grouth.

Seretide is a mixture of salmeterol and fluticasone. 50mcg of salmeterol and 50/125/250mcg of fluticasone strengths are available. So Seretide 50 means 50mcg of Fluticasone as Salemeterol is generally constant. There are various combinations of chemicals available, but these are more potent and called combination inhaled devices. If you are using Seretide disk, then Ventorlin should be used only in an emergency. Please get yourself checked by an Asthma Specialist to discuss your current need.

You should see that you use medicines till you get complete relief,till all the secretions are expelled or dried up. Otherwise the remnant secretions may aggregate at the bottom of the lungs. These may cause pain after few such attacks. The pain could be due to gastric irritation caused by a number of drugs, of course inevitable. It can be confirmed by gastroscopy.

I have been taking salbutamol inhaler but I wish to stop it as it is creating shaking / tremors in my hands etc. What are the alternatives please ? (with less side effects) AK Agarwal","Doctor":"Hello Mr. Agarwal, Salbutamol is a reliever medication for quick, on the spot relief for asthma. If need of inhaler has been on every day or more than once daily, then you need a ‘preventer’ medication. This prevents an allergic attack, by acting on the inner tubes inside the lungs. They may contain a derivative of steroid or sodium chromoglycate. Preventive drugs are directly given into the lungs in micrograms. So they are not likely to produce the widely known bad effects of steroid consumption. Inhaled steroids are safe in the prescribed doses. Please get evaluated by the nearest chest physician. An x-ray of the chest and lung function tests, plus blood test may be necessary. The doctor will prescribe a suitable preventer medicine (e.g Budesonide inhaler) or a combined preventer cum reliever medicine (e.g. Budesonide with formoterol). Both of these have less chances of producing tremors of hand. Hope you control your asthma without tremors of hand.

The only thing that I know I am allergic to is penicillin , which gives me a minor skin rash . I have dry skin on my body but not overwhelmingly so.","Doctor":"Hello, Tiny little bumps that are itchy is usually cholinergic urticaria, that happens due to change in skin local temperature. Dry skin can cause you to scratch and itch, and urticaria can appear again. The best thing is  to keep calamine lotion handy that helps with the itch, or a levocetirizine 5mg tablet as and when required. You will require a tablet for your seasonal allergies at which point youwill notice less of the itch skin rash.

Metformin itself can cause cramps, diarrhoea.3. A stat capillary glucose check is important.4. Itchy skin rash can be taken care with antihistamines such as cetirizine 10mg or levocet 5mg. People with diabetes can get a fungal skin rash that is varaibly itchy and not much red, for which antifungal creams are required. See your doctor if the antihistamine tabelts do not help.Best Wishes."},{"Patient":"I am suffering from seasonal allergies. The symptoms are runny nose, irritation in nose, sneezing etc. I take Levocetirizine which usually helps but some times it does not stop runny nose.Than I use Sinerest the combination contains Phenylephrine + Caffeine + Chlorpheniramine Maleate + Paracetamol . This relieves the problem. My question is - instead of this combination taking only Phenylephrine should be sufficient ? If yes is there any preparation that contains only Phenylephrine ? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Phenylephrine  is added in the combination because it relieves nasal block. It does not have anti allergic action and does not help in  runny nose. Chlorpheniramine in this combination is useful for seasonal allergy and is the substitute for Levocetirizine. Chlorpheniramine is more effective than Levocetirizine but it causes drowsiness. So, Phenylephrine alone will not help for seasonal allergy. Nasal drops containing only Phenylephrine  are available as nasal decongestant. Besides, Phenylephrine drops  can cause sneezing as side effect & may aggravate your problem."},{"Patient":"I am a 39 year old female, relatively healthy. For the past several months I have had an aching/pinching kind of twinge of pain that I feel on the left side of my chest. It comes and goes at different times (while at work, at home resting, etc). The discomfort generally only lasts a few minutes. I have also experienced some difficulty breathing in the last few months and a breathing test done at the ENT indicated asthma . I am now taking medications for that and I am scheduled to see a pulmonologist soon for a consultation. I am wondering if the recurring chest discomfort/pain is anything to be concerned about. I am also seeing my primary care doctor soon.","Doctor":"Hi and hanks for the query, recurrent chest pain especially of acute onset deserves a careful evaluation. With a past history or clinical symptoms suggesting asthma, proper taking of medication could be sufficient to manage the problem. However, other common causes of chest pain like angina pectoris of cardiac origin, inflammatory causes, chest infections, acute pericarditis must also be considered. A chest X ray might be very important in discarding other common causes of chest pain. I do not think its time to be bothered for real. A pulmonologist's opinion is most welcome under such circumstances and you really need not worry. thanks and best regards, Luchuo, MD."},{"Patient":"We used dettol to wipe the furniture, after a few minutes, a 5-year-old child started to feel itchy and eye redness, after a few hours, the redess started to spread on his body. 1.

But attributing this reaction to Dettol is a possibility, but not actually conclusive. Wiping furniture means mobilizing but, and they child instead be reacting to other dust particles or some other allergen that was released during the wiping process. Dettol could be allergic to some people for people s make ups are actually different.

If you have sneezing and associated itching of eyes , throat and ear  , you are probably having allergic rhinitis. If you ever had any history of injury to head or nose , there is a possibility of CSF rhinorrhea ( fluid from covering of brain leaking through roof of nose ). Other reasons could be vasomotor rhinitis. If you are having allergic rhinitis and are fed with tablets , the option available is nasal spray. Nasal spray containing azelastine and topical steroid can give very good relief in allergic These sprays do not produce sedation or other side effects. Consult ENT surgeon or pulmonologist nearby who can decide from symptomatology whether you have allergic rhinitis. If allergic rhinitis , discuss about using nasal spray. For allergic rhinitis not responding to treatment sublingual immunotherapy gives promising results"},{"Patient":"hi i have a question.. i had asthma when i was still a child it disappeared when i turned 7 yrs. old. i think i got this ailment from my father s side, my grandma had asthma and it was pretty bad. i am a premature baby, my mom gave birth to me on my seventh month on her tummy. i am fourteen years old now and i sort of kinda feel like somethings wrong with my breathing . i am usually a hyper person but my breathing is okay but now i get tired and i always feel like my lungs were heavy and sometimes it hurt. i m not telling to my parents about this because i think its not right, i m afraid they would just think that i m lying or something else... thank you and please answer","Doctor":"Hi your asthma seems uncontrolled. kindly visit a pulmonologist to have a simple test done called spirometry, which is a just non-invasive breathing test, both pre and post bronchodilator.

No supplement can substitute the correct treatment. Was your wife forced to take all these supplements because she was not getting adequate relief with prior treatment? Regarding safety of these supplements nutrilite tripple guard - it is claimed to contain extract of the plant Echinacea, a central american herb. This plant is claimed to boost immunity and thus prevent common cold. Your wife is suffering from asthma , not common cold. There are reports of  worsening of autoimmune disease after taking Echinacea So your wife should stop taking this product. You may try tulsi leaf if available . Must be cheaper than Echinacea nutrilite daily - it contains 24 vitamins and minerals             similar to the multivitamin tablets available over the counter ( like cobadex czs , polybion czs , surbex xt , reconia etc) . Will not be harmfull . She may continue to take it Bio C  - it conatins 250 mg vitamin C the daily requirement is 60 mg only you are already getting 90 mg from nutrilite daily. So unnecessary siberian ginseng with ginkgo biloba - they claim it improves mental sharpness Not necessary for your wife's current  disease.

As you are having allergic asthma, it is quite possible you get frequent attacks of chest pain/tightness due to inflammation of airway tissues.

After reading your post, it seems that you are having an acute attack of bronchial asthma and needs medical attention. Salbuatmol is a bronchodilator and needs to be repeated in severe attacks and can cause shivering in hands. It seems that in addition to salbutamol, you may need a steroid inhaler for more relief from your symptoms. I would suggest that you should get yourself clinically examined by your doctor and start a steroid inhaler like fluticasone under medical supervision. You can also discuss with your doctor of replacing salbutamol with salmetrol, which has longer duration of action and needs less frequent administration. Also take an antihistaminic like fenofexadine 120 mg once a day for some relief in cough. I hope this is helpful to you.

Could this be a sign of colon or rectal cancer rather than just hemmorroids or related to my untreated hernia?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.This is not related to a hernia. Such symptoms are usually caused by hemorrhoids indeed. The blood appears on the surface of the stool, is never mixed with it. Itching around the anus can be also present.Colon cancer or a polyp can also give bleeding similar to hemorrhoids. However the blood is usually mixed with a stool. Colon cancer is related with age. It appears over the age of 50. It is rare at your age.However, as the bleeding is present for a long time, I suggest you to have colonoscopy done. You should also consult proctologist.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am 28 male and have been on Micardis 80mg. for best part of a year now my asthma has started worsening again so have started Seretide 250/50 twice daily but am finding my micardis is no longer effective and my bp is up to 141/83 should I be overley concerned? is this bp level ok to leave thouggh winter as my asthma was cronic and very difficualt to controll last winter.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM, You are Hypertensive and having Bronchial asthma it is common to have worsening of asthma in winter.

My question is how long should this take to clear up.

Rosacea commonly affects the skin of the face, nose and forehead but can also affect the eye. Tetracycline group of drugs help. While allergic conjunctivitis is far more commoner and viral infections can also cause conjunctivitis. Antibiotic eye drops such as ciprofloxacin helps, while antihistamine tablets help with the redness and swelling as well. Viral infections normally take about 10 days to resolve, but can be slightly longer if there is super-added bacterial infection. Your cold seems to have taken a lot longer, but is possible you have been exposed to several different viruses in the change of season. Allergic conjunctivitis can occur secondary to dust mite, tree pollen allegy that is also common at this time. You can get allergy testing done to these allergens by your doctor.

It is possible that bacteria could cause similar symptoms, but viruses are more common causes. treatment is mainly symptomatic. Draining the nasopharyngeal passages, giving local anti histamines of general if necessary to reduce congestion and simple analgesics or non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs would be sufficient to control the pain of fever. However, a clinical evaluation might be useful to exclude a bacterial cause which might require antibiotics. We cannot talk of allergies in this case, for it needs to be repeated, acute, almost permanent, should have a past history of family history of allergies or other atopic conditions.

If you or any member of your family is having history of allergies or asthma then it strongly suggests you might be suffering from eczema. Eczema is a chronic skin condition marked by itching, inflammation, redness, and swelling of the skin. It occurs in many varieties like atopic eczema, allergic contact eczema, dyshidrotic eczema, and seborrheic eczema. Uncomplicated eczema is generally not a serious condition, but itching and scratching can lead to increased inflammation, open breaks in the skin, and a secondary bacterial infections. A diagnosis of eczema can often be made by taking a thorough health history, including symptoms, and performing a physical exam. Treatment of eczema includes avoiding exposure to irritants and allergens and minimizing skin dryness.Ice bags or cool wet compresses may be helpful to help relieve itching, u may use over the counter anti itch creams.Therapy can also include taking an oatmeal bath and using oatmeal soap, such as Aveeno.

Infection of lower portions of chest may have abdominal symptoms as well. If abdominal symptoms repeat along with chest infection, the child needs to be tested for infection occurring at the same spot over the lower aspect of his lungs.

Culture of sputum for antibiotic sensitivity tests is advisable to pin point the infecting microbe as well as to choose appropriate antibiotic.

The inhalers you have mentioned will help in bronchodilatation and help you in asthma. For dry cough you should take antihistaminic like cetrizine 10 mg once a day, preferrably at night. I would suggest that you should have following investiagtions done :- 1. Complete Blood Count(CBC). 2. Absolute Eosinophil Count. 3. Chest X-Ray (PA view). 4. ECG. Steam inhalation can also help in relieving your symptoms. You should eat fresh fruits and vegetables for increasing the immunity and regaining health.

Do you think I can do my regular exercise? about 30-45 minutes. I would, first of all, like to thank for your cooperation. Fantu YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hi there, Thanks for writing in. Allegra will help reduce your symptoms of allergy. Do try the following measures: 1. Drink at least 8-10 glasses of warm water a day. You can have a glass of warm water every hour or so. 2. Sign up for yoga classes. Yoga if practised regularly is very beneficial for the body and mind, and will help reduce the chances of allergy in the long run. 3.Avoid exposure to dust by using a mask. 4. Warm saline gargles 3 times a day will help reduce the sore throat. Also have a teaspoon of honey mixed with a pinch of pepper powder. 5. Try Steam inhalation 3 times a day. If you dont find symptomatic relief at all with the above mentioned measures, please visit your physician. Hope this helps. Get well soon.

Montair FX is a better choice and you can use both on the long term. Side effects are usually dryness of mouth, and sedative effects of montelukast. Other than that, worrying side effects are pretty much rare. The previous 1st generation antihitamines used to cause rhythm disturbances in the heart at high doses, but these 2nd generation antihistamines do not.

However, there is a particular ascernal of drugs and lifestyle changes that could avoid the frequency of these attacks. Asthma triggers differ from person to person and need to be avoid. In your case, I suggest you should actually keep very warm, and it would be great if your work schedule could be modified if possible. Your nasal spray to use during attacks should always be with you where ever you go. Consult a pulmonologist for a proper treatment plan.

Singulair itself is unlikely to be effective for pollen allergy unless you combine with an antihistamine like fexofenadine. There is no special diet for pollen allergy; but addition of a nasal spray will help with the symptoms of rhinitis (sneezing, runny nose, white discharge, blockage).

Inhaler- provide symptomatic relief by causing broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs) So, it can be used during an acute attack. 2. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of seasonal allergies & asthma. 3. Antihistamines can also be used to provide symptomatic relief. 4. Protection from exposure to cold, dust or other allergens. So, the medications prescribed by the Pediatrician is correct. Please continue them as advised. If symptoms still persist, it will be better to consult the Pediatrician again. Wishing your daughter a Good Health. Let me know if I need to clarify further.

The cast is there for two reasons, first it maintains the shape of your nose, second it has a protection function.

Your condition is chronic idiopathic urticaria but can be said idiopathic only after the following tests are negative or normal: 1. Hemogram and iron levels (or ferritin levels) 2. Liver function tests 3. TSH fT4 and thyroid autoantibodies (TPO, TG) 4. antinuclear antibody 5. C3 C4 Abnormalities in the above tests will need to be dealt with as per results. You are on right treatment and usual triggers for acute attacks of urticaria may be infections; stress; physical or pressure (carrying heavy things or wearing tight clothes); diabetes or thyroid abnormality. Regular prednisolone can cause infections to be common, so please get a Chest X ray done if the coughing continues. Zantac or esomeprazole should be taken BEFORE the prednisolone everyday.

Food, other contacts could also be causative. Blood test to find out a cause may help in the long run - if a cause is found, desensitisation can be attempted. Oral anti-histamines  are useful - quite a few of them are available over the counter. Nasal decongestants (like phenylephrine - used in 'cold' medicines) help See your GP - he can prescribe. And finally a practical tip! If sneezing is continuous - just touch the philtrum (groove between the nose and upper lip) with your finger / A second sneeze will not come!

I went to emergency room & they kept me overnight for observation. I ve been sitting & laying around alot this past week also.

I am also taking Levaquin for a bladder infection right now. Do I need to see a doctor?","Doctor":"Hello Well come to health care magic Dear patieny, hope salads don't cause allergic reactions , this problem of lump in the throat and nusea seems to be more related to your acid reflux problem which might have got aggrevated by the pain killers that you took after surgery , if you feel that the pain is persisting there and you have vomiting also along with nusea then you can go and consult a doctor , other wise if you are feeling ok, you need not to worry, just make sure that you don't eat too much of spicy foods .

The only remedy is to slowly coming out of it by reducing the amount of cream very slowly. The problem is the QUADRIDERM  has affected your bodies natural cortisone production and slow withdrawal of cortisone will allow your body to slowly come back up to speed regulating it's natural levels. Sudden change in cortisone strength should be avoided. It is better to taper off very slowly so your body can catch up.

It can have a variety of micro-organisms that are usually healthy. The cream content of fromage frais can vary as well.

When you introduce dairy products, watch for development of symptoms of allergy. Keep an epi-pen at hand. In case of a bad allergic reaction take the kids to nearest emergency room. Could the twins have allergies? Food allergies can be tested by a doctor by doing a skin prick. It can also be tested by doing blood tests and checking for immunity. Since the twins have been exposed to dairy products, they can be checked for allergies by the doctor. It's possible that the symptoms to fromage frais were caused my milk allergy. Family history can matter in case of milk allergy. Milk allergy is also common in younger population and can improve as a kid grows up.

What is the best way to avoid such occurances of cough and what all to eat and care.. I would really appreciate any help in this regard. Thanks, bhupa","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for using HCM. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that brings about constriction of small airways leading to the characteristic wheezing and cough of asthmatics. Cough is a symptom indicating an irritation of the respiratory tract. Such irritation could be a foreign body, or mucous that is produced. In asthmatics, there is a characteristic mucous production and an attempt to expel this mucous which is blocking the respiratory tract leads to cough which is mostly in the night or early mornings. Asthma is a chronic disease and the treatment depends on how advance or severe the asthma is. Mild forms require just fast acting  beta mimetic drugs such as salbutamol  with severe forms requiring more or less permanent steroids to reduced the inflammation. Yes steroids have side effects side  such as increase weight, diabetes, hypertension reduce immunity but then all drugs potentially have side effects and are given when the potential benefits out weigh the side effects. Your father needs to be evaluated to get the severity of his asthma and to rule out an associated chest infection and then he will be prescribe drugs according to his degree of severity. In advance cases, long acting beta mimetic drugs and steroids will be given. He has to avoid getting into cold, polluted air, dust and  avoid drugs that will cause broncoconstriction like propanolol.

I did take decongestants for a while but started to worry they could do more harm than good. Can you suggest what I should do next? I have had a blood test but not the results as yet.","Doctor":"Hi Erinioo, Thank you for your query. Your symptoms sound very frustrating. It sounds like you have developed chronic sinusitis, or chronic allergic rhinitis. This is is a constant inflammation of your nasal passages. The initial sneezing may have been signs of hypersensitivity of the nasal passages but things appear to have progressed so that the lining of your nasal passages are permanently inflamed interferring with drainage of mucus and making it difficult to breathe. People that suffer with this condition often complain of feeling clogged up with fullness around the face and throbbing headaches, especially if they look down at their feet. Other likely causes are that you have developed nasal polyps. These are small nodules that develop in the nasal passages and again disrupt the normal drainage of mucus and passage of air. Or you may have a prolonged allergic response from being constantly exposed to the trigger of your allergy. I would suggest your next step is to see an Ear Nose and Throat specialist (ENT) to have them examine your nasal passages. If it difficult to pinpoint what is going on by direct vision, he mat suggest a CT or MRI scan. The treatment can be very different depending on which of the three is causing your problems. In the meantime you can try washing out you nasal passages daily with saline solution. Mix 1/2 a teaspoon of salt and a pinch of baking soda in 1 cup of warm previously boiled water. There are already made nasal lavage solutions in pharmacies.  Put this solution in a nasal bulb or squeezable bottle with a a funnel end. Leaning over the sink, tilting downwards, place the tip of the bulb in your nostril and squeeze a generous amount of the solution into the nostril with moderate force. You will see the fluid draining from the other nostril. Repeat on the other side. Do this 2-3 times a day to prevent the build up of mucus."},{"Patient":"I have asthma and I am wanting to work out to lose weight, but it feels like i cant get enough air.

Well done for trying to lose weight. I understand that it is hard to do when you are unwell. Don't be discouraged by the periods during which your allergies and asthma flare up. Since you seem to have noticed a seasonal pattern to you asthma and allergy episodes I suggest preparing for them by: 1. Taking a long acting antihistamine (eg citirizine) two weeks before and during the three months that things flare up. 2. Escalating your asthma treatment during these periods so you are on more preventers. Ask your doctors to review your medication. You may benefit from an increased dose of inhaled steroids, a long acting beta agonist inhaler or something like daily Singulair. These two changes should be able to keep you breathing comfortably and active. To get the most from the exercise you are doing, review your diet so it is healthy and also not aggravating your allergies and consider taking up a wind instrument to increase you lung capacity. If you have been on asthma steroid treatment for long you should ask you doctor to check for adrenal suppression. This is a side effect of prolonged steroid use which could be contributing to you weight problem."},{"Patient":"I have been treated for seasonal allergies for about ten years, ever since I retired and left Alaska.

In your case, you are on systemic anti histamines and may be, simply associating a systemic steroid might help. A proper physical examination to exclude sinutis, allergic rhinitis or asthma could be of help in orienting or modifying the treatment. A better evaluation of your environment could help identify the allergen causing these symptoms. Consulting an allergologist with much expertise in this domain shall be very helpful. Better options, even in severe cases due exist for severe allergies like immune desensitization regimens. Consulting an allergologist or allergy specialist shall be of great help.

My search on Euphomin syrup shows that it is a combination of many medicines including some natural ingredients. Shivering can be caused by caffeine, along with other ingredients of the syrup.

A laryngoscopy could be done to determine if any inflammation. If bacteria throat infection is also possible. Clinical evaluation will be necessary before you can take any treatment. Maybe you could allow some few days before you go see a doctor to see if the itchiness can clear off on its on. Possibility of another allergy developing inside your throat is possible, hence you will require another antihistaminic (if you have developed side effects as a result of zyrtec it is better you ask your doctor for another prescription).

Hence i wanted to ask is why are the medicnes so addictive and whAT are its side effects.","Doctor":"Hi Joy, Thanks for writing your query. I would like to reassure you that taking inhaler is not addictive. Rather it is very helpful in management of acute attack. Since it takes few hours to few days(if severe) for complete recovery from bronchoconstriction, there seems to be need for repetition of inhaler. It is not addiction but the most effective management at that time. Since the medicine from the inhaler goes directly into the air passage and is not dissolved in the blood, it is the safest mode of management for bronchitis. It has practically no side effects. Always try to avoid the allergens which trigger the attack. I hope this is helpful to you.

For eyes, you should see Ophthalmologist and probably certain drops will be prescribed which will prevent the watering. There is no cure for these problems only way is to prevent them.

The first exam that will act as a triage is a chest X ray. Infectious causes like pneumoniae, pleurisy, aspergilloses and some heart anomalies could lead to breathing difficulties. It is interesting to carry out a sputum exam especially with chronic coughs. Pulmonary Tuberculosis must be excluded in this examination, and presence of specific allergic bodies called charcot Leyden s bodies could suggest an allergic origin. Blood tests like measurement of Immunoglublin E levels and a complete blood count, to show a rise in levels of Eosinophils to suggest an allergist origin.

Management of scabies is not fundamentally medical. We could actually treat it, but if we do not treat our surroundings, we might always continue getting it.

Corticosteroids decrease airway inflammation in acute asthma and prevents late-phase attacks, hence the prednisolone as you well know. 80mg is a big dose, but that depends on body weight and max would be 1mg/kg body weight, so take this after an antacid (such as pantoprazole or rabeprazole) or after a full meal. That you are continuing to require nebulisers every 4 hours is NOT a good sign, and arterial blood gas tests may be required. So please get yourself seen by your doctor or go to the ER, saying no improvement. I hope an ECG, Chest X Ray was done to ensure there was no other problem, an special tests such as V/Q scan may be required to exclude a lung clot if there is a significant risk (such as a long travel before this acute asthma episode). Usually long-acting beta 2 agonsits such as salmetrol should be avoided at this stage until you improve. I hope that was useful. Best Wishes."},{"Patient":"22, Male, 6 0 , 210 lbs. Hello. Tonight, about 2 hours after eating tortilla chips and hot salsa (which I eat on a fairly regular basis) I suddenly broke out in a hot rash that gradually spread over most of my upper body and head. it almost felt like a sun burn . I ve never had an allergic reaction before in my entire life. I eat spicy foods all of the time and also have no known food allergies (Have always been able to eat peanut, gluten , wheat, and soy products.) Any idea what this could have been? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM. Thank you for your query. If there was such a sudden outbreak, this could most probably be a hypersensitivity reaction requiring the administration of anti-histamine medication. Depending on your situation we can administer either an injection or give you a tablet for the same. Please visit the ER at the earliest for treatment. I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for. Please feel free to write back to me for any further clarifications. I would gladly help you.

When I woke up I was fine, but during the day I began to notice a rash around my neck and where the line of the collar of the sweater was. On the back of my neck and collar bone and extending almost up to underneath my chin . It hasn t spread and it hasn t gotten worse but I don t have a wool allergy . Was it just irritation from dust or something?","Doctor":"Hi there ~ It is probably allergy to the dust that was present on the collar of the sweater than the wool itself.  It will go away after some time, however it is advisable to apply some hydrocortisone cream or any other anti allergy cream to help with the inflammation and irritation.  I hope this helps.  Take care and have a lovely day !"},{"Patient":"after eating mixed vegetable of Capsicum and paneer, my son got pain in throat , unable to drink smoothly, continuously coughing, doc says it was allergy .

All these symptoms indicate that your son might be having Pharyngitis. Management includes: 1. Gargle with warm salt water to relieve throat pain. 2. Analgesics like paracetamol 3. Antibiotics (if bacterial infection is suspected) 4. Antihistamine preparations can also be used to provide symptomatic relief. So...it will be better to consult an ENT specialist & start treatment as advised.

He doesn t have a fever but since yesterday afternoon all he is doing is sleeping all the time. Should I take him back to his doctor ?","Doctor":"Hi Its better to take him back to the doctor. It might because he din\`t drink or eat anything- he must be tired and sleepy. If he has been prescribed some anti-histamines like Benadryl too- he must be drowsy because of that.

He was also given 2 baby asprin to maybe help with a leg crap he s had for a couple of days. (Think he pulled a muscle). After 1.5 hours his eyes started to get better. At supper, hours later his upper lip swollen some and he said it felt numb. He also had orange juice for supper. He is breathing fine. No other symptoms. Could this be an allergic reaction to asprin or orange juice?","Doctor":"Hi The aspirin, egg and fruit juice are all potential allergens in people with allergy and asthma. For a child of 7 you must avoid aspirin. paracetamol is a better choice. It can also cause gastric irritation. It is very likely that your son may have variant type of asthma who manifest allergy to aspirin and fruits. Fruits can cause rash with itchiness around the mouth and around the eyes. Aspirin and polyps of the nose with asthma occurs in a group of asthmatics. They should avoid other drugs like brufen and diclofenac which are called NSAID. or non-steroidal anti inflammatory. Subsequent exposures to these allergens can make the symptoms worse, so take care. Skin allergy test is not very specific, but there are doctors who strongly believe in it. I suggest that you avoid these for the time being and as he grows older you can check him out for asthma with a pulmonologist. You need to educate your son about his allergy and communicate with his school's nurse and friends not to offer him fruit juice. it is good to keep an epipen at home and also at school which is a life saving drug in case of emergencies. You need to learn how to use it when needed.

I wanted to know what could be the cause of this?","Doctor":"Hi there ~ Having veins on your upper arms hands and legs are common in people that are lighter skinned.  It has nothing to do with whether you are vegetarian or eat meat.  Pleas use a deodorant if you feel like the body odor is intolerable.  I feel like this will take care of your problems.  It is advisable to see a dermatologist if the condition does not improve.

I have never been swabbed or cultures taken as there was not the obvious postules and lesions. However, I have had allergic reactions since childhood that prompted me to take such tests in the first place, the first being after a pine wreath was placed over my bed and perhaps debris accumulated on my pillow. My lip swelled up tremendously.. I visited an allergy Dr. and was diagnosed to have severe allergies to spider bites, cat hair, grass and a bunch of other stuff, not food related that I can t remember now.. Every year or so, around a stressful event, funeral, mental breakdown etc.. I will usually get sick with a head cold/ nasal cold, and the runny nose will redden but never develop a sore like the pictures on web demonstrate. At 42.

High sensitivity and specifiity means that there are few falsely negative and falsely positive results. If you've had repeated results that are negative then it is unlikely that you have herpes. If you wish you can repeat the test to see if infection occurred since you were last tested, but with this highly accurate test, negative usually means negative.

I ve been having trouble with my breathing for about a week or so now; I don t really have trouble drawing the breath, the problem is more that when I breath, even deeply, I do not feel that air has been exchanged satifsfactorily. It s somewhat hard to describe. This issue decreases when I breath through my moth instead of my nose, and decreases when I am outside or if I have fans ventillating my place (but it s still winterish, so I can t leave the fans on all the time). I ve got a form to go get my pulmonary system checked out, but in the meantime, I m wondering as to potential causes. The last times I had this issue, in this same building, were after eating certain foods from a certain chain restaurant, and diphenhydramin hydrochloride would ease them. I ve tried diphenhydramine HCl once during this week or so of troubles, but the effects of the dHCl on my mind were such that I can t recall if it really helped with my breathing or if I just stopped caring off in la-la land. So, searching for anomalous events of late, I came up with that the troubles started after the first time, and may have worsened after the second time of the following: heavy masturbation for probably over an hour, but probably less than two hours, in a closed bathroom with the shower running. The air quality was quite poor as the air was basically steam. The air was saturated with warm vapour and then some. After the first event, I had nearly blacked out. Then again, after the first event, for maybe a day it seemed like I could breath better. The second event (spurred on by the damned dHCl) nearly made me vomit from exhersion, at the end my chest started to really burn, I nearly lost control of my bowels, and I was nauseus for minutes. Could these breathing issues have been caused by these activities?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for your query.Your problem is really disabling.

Considering the fact you are on an atopic/asthmatic terrain, drugs like flixonase might have to be taken continuosly even up to two years at times. Antihistaminics, steroids and in case its a collection, a culture and sensitivity test to orient anti biotherapy might be useful. For the moment, you got to avoid any nasal congestion, use flixonase as prescribed and see your ENT specialist for a reevaluation.

I would then advise for a stool test for ova and cyst and treat it if positive and in addition would advise you for a proton pump inhibitor for a symptomatic relief. Fatty liver could be due to the dietay habits and life style issues. A LFT test would be appropriate. I would advise some modification in your diet like more of roughage, enough liquids, avoidance of oily, fried, and fast food and regular routine exercises like morning walk depending on your medical fitness. This would be for a long term improvement in your health. A repeat ultrasound after six months might be helpful.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I have not had anything to drink in over a year, because it normally has very adverse effects on my body and mainly my heart, but the other night, giving into temptation I consumed about 5 standard drinks over the course of about 6 hours–not too excessive. Unfortunately, the same symptoms hit me that I used to experience. It has been three days since that night, and I still have a headache , I feel slightly hazy, my left arm is numb and tingly, my chest feels tight, and my heart beats periodically at random in very hard, fast, and arithmetic sequences. And I also seem to get random fevers through out the day as though my temperature is out of control. Also yesterday I got light headed out of nowhere and my face got extremely tingly and I felt like I was going to pass out. Often when I have had these feelings I am afraid of having a heart attack .

Perhaps it is a blessing in disguise for you to avoid completely. These symptoms you are having is the adverse effects from the allergy to alcohol. Your system does not agree to the basic ingredient of spirit/alcohol. You could try chlordiazepoxide for few days to see if this helps even though this is normally used to help people who are  known alcoholics.

I wore a monitor for two weeks in September of last year, but it didn t show anything abnormal. My stress test didn t show any abnormalities either. I just started noticing the missing beats in December. It doesn t happen every time I eat. I know my heart is missing beats because I ve monitored my pulse and it coincides with the feeling I get in my chest. I ve read that it could be a symptom of food allergies or a lack of magnesium . Of course I m writing because I want an opinion.","Doctor":"Hi, Was it a holter monitoring? If it has not picked up any arrhythmias then it is unlikely that you have some major problem. Was there any of such symptom like missed beats during continuous monitoring? It is unusual and rare to see this type of aggravation after meals. Food allergy may not cause this.

Some patients are intolerant to nirtofurantoin, and if the vomiting is severe, then you should contact the treating doctor for a review who might change the antibiotic depending on the culture/sensitivity reports. Otherwise, she could continue with the same medications along with a proton pump inhibitor and a anti emetic drug and a probiotic drug.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

The spill happened 2 days ago and today I was throwing up and completley dizzy I couldent even stand up. This lead to severe vomiting . I am not sick with the flu or any colds. Do you think this is an affect from the vapors of the spilled kerosene?","Doctor":"Hello dear... Kerosene is a volatile hydrocarbon liquid. Because of this nature, the inhalation of kerosene vapors can lead to various complications involving the respiratory system & central nervous system...such as coughing, sore throat, dizziness, headache, confusion, unconsciousness, etc. So...the symptoms as mentioned in your post can be attributed to inhalation of vapors of the spilled kerosene. Management involves movement to a safer place to avoid continuous inhalation of the harmful vapours, breathing of fresh air & symptomatic treatment.

The symptoms as mentioned suggest that the red blotches around mouth were caused due to any particular food products. Benadryl being an Antihistamine preparation provides relief from allergic symptoms. But it is always better to administer a medication as per advise of a Pediatrician...otherwise it may lead to side effects. So...if such episodes occur repeatedly, then it will be better to consult a Pediatrician & find out the exact cause of development of red blotches around mouth and lips.

I am Dr. Prasad Akole (Critical Care Expert-  and am glad to address to your query here. Many times people are labeled asthmatics when they actually have vocal cord or airway problems in early stages. As your specialist thinks you have a vocal cord dysfunction and your symptoms are also pointing to some vocal cord or tracheal pathology, you should take it seriously and seek ENT specialist’s advice. You may be asked to get evaluated with Xray, Barium swallow, CT scan and such modalities on evaluation. At your age tumour growths, strictures are possible. Do you get breathlessness, hoarseness of voice or voice fatigue? Any fever, blood in sputum? It could also be asthma with infection. I hope you are fully satisfied with the guidance I gave.

Wheezing is caused due to broncho-constriction (obstruction of smaller airway passages) which is indicative of Hyper-responsiveness of air passages (seasonal allergy or asthma). Formoterol will provide symptomatic relief by causing broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs) Budesonide is a corticosteroid which takes care of the inflammatory process in airways. Other than that, Montelukast preparation can also be used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of seasonal allergies & asthma by reducing broncho-constriction.

Sputum examination You can take antihistaminic like Fenofexadine 120 mg once a day along with cough expectorant syrup to get relief from cough. Bronchodilators can be needed if there is bronchoconstriction, which  can be judged after auscultating your chest. Antibiotic, if needed can be added according to the culture/senstivity reports of the sputum. Avoid smoking as it can worsen your symptoms. If the problem persists, get yourself examined by a physician. I hope this is helpful to you. Thanks."},{"Patient":"hi...i am suffering from severe sneezing ...its an allergic reaction to something which i dont know...i get it too often....almost daily .....whats the reason for this allergy ?....i use Duonase nasal spray ..but i want to have complete remedy for this ...my day gets disturbed ..i get watery eyes and pain around the eyes and severe nasal congestion . regards, Renju","Doctor":"Hello dear... The symptoms as mentioned in your post suggest that you might be having Allergic rhinitis. Duonase contains Azelastine, an antihistamine preparation which provides relief from symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis. And Fluticasone, which takes care of the inflammation. Also...Montelukast preparation can be used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of seasonal allergies. If symptoms still persist, it will be better to consult an ENT specialist. Other than that...maintain adequate hydration & take a healthy balance diet. Also make sure that you are well protected from cold, dust & other allergens. Wishing you a good health. Thanks & take care."},{"Patient":"Hello, I have been getting sick a lot lately and it all seems to start in my throat . It gets very swollen and sore and it makes it impossible to do my job (I teach). I have had strep or tonsillitis many times in the past year, and I get white spots on my tonsils, some of which never fully go away. I have seen a number of doctors, have had blood work done, and I have seen an allergist . All they offered me was a nose spray since my blood work didn t offer much explanation. I m getting sick every other week it seems and it s not going over well at work. Do I need to see a specialist about possibly getting my tonsils removed (I m 27)? Or is there something else I should look into?","Doctor":"hi there, you need to get a throat swab taken for culture and senstivity and take a complete course of antibiotics. Also get your immunity level assessed and then visit an ENT surgeon who will be able to find a specific cause for your condition. IN the meanwhile you could use betadine gargles, anti-inflammatory tablets and give voice rest .Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, I was told when I was young that I had a heart murmur . My mom and uncle also have this, and it has not caused them any problems. Very occasionally I will feel something that resembles a single pound/gurgle. Usually it is just a wierd feeling with no pain and has not caused any symptoms. I do have asthma and I ve noticed it more lately when I try to breathe in deep, this will sometimes occur. Last night, I had a palpatation, but it suprised me because it was strong and kind of painful. I went to the doctor and he did an EKG test and said everything was normal. He did not suggest any further tests. Since the EKG was normal, does this mean I have nothing to worry about?","Doctor":"Hi friend, Welcome to Health Care Magic It is advisable to have it investigated, especially with a history of murmur. A single routine ECG does not exclude.  It can miss, unless done during the episode. 24 to 48 hour ambulatory monitoring (HOLTER) is done to analyse and plan for further management, if a routine ECG does not show, ECHOcardiogram is necessary to see the heart valves (Mitral Valve Prolapse) / heart muscle (Cardiomyopathy) and heart function (Ejection fraction, wall motion abnormality).  TMT (Treadmill exercise ECG) is done to exclude Ischemia (reduced blood flow). LABORATORY work-up is routine - like blood counts, sugar, urea, electrolytes (potassium in particular), thyroid (over-active) and so on. There are advanced techniques of investigations of increasing complexity – Electro Physiological Studies (EPS) / not generally done unless there are compelling indications.  The treating doctor may suggest them depending on need, based on his assessment of the situation. Take care Wishing speedy recovery God bless Good luck"},{"Patient":"Hi, I had asthma since I was little, and I had a problem In the upper stomache sphincter which made me suffer from acid reflux , Making my asthma worse. Lately I have been feeling something in my Throat as if I was chocking, and its been very difficult to breath, especially exhalation . In order to breath, I have to force every breath, which exhausted me. My doctor did all sorts of tests, including a ct scan but didn t find anything.","Doctor":"Hi, In every asthmatic patient asthma is exacerbated by some preceding factor. The sensation of lump in the throat may be due to infection as the throat becomes congested. Acid reflux disease is another factor that causes the inappropriate sensation of lump in the throat and retrosternal burning. You should take medicines for Asthma and Acid reflux disease on regular basis. For Acute exacerbation of Asthma use combination of Antibiotic, An inhaler that is the combination of steroid and bronchodilator and Nebulization for acute attacks with ventolin or clenil and tablets such as Monteka that is leukotriene receptor antagonist. For acid Reflux disease use Proton pump inhibitor such as Esomeprazole once before breakfast. I hope I am sucessful in solving your query if you have more you can ask me.

If I m sitting down and bend my head down and cough a little it starts dripping. Its never done this before. Help.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome, Thanks for your query. I will need a little more information to be able to help you. Like at first, do you have any other symptoms? Any phlegm/sputum being produced, either with or without any cough? Is it white or transparent (most probably no infection) or green, yellow or blood stained (possibility of an infection)?Any fever? Or just a feverish feeling? Based on the description you are giving me, I suspect a dust allergy. Which is quite common. Are you constantly exposed to dust or have you noticed these symptoms to crop up when you are exposed to dust? If this is the case, some mild anti-histamines will help you. But then again, taking medications often is not considered to be healthy. What would be best, is to always carry a hand napkin with you, or even the use of a face mask, to protect you from dust when you visit areas with a lot of dust. Contemplate the possibility and discuss this with your father and/or your family doctor.

During normal breathing, the air we take in is first warmed and moistened by the nasal passages. Because people tend to breathe through their mouths when they exercise, they are inhaling colder and drier air. In exercise-induced asthma, the muscle bands around the airways are sensitive to these changes in temperature and humidity and react by contracting, which narrows the airway.

As there are many manufacturers, the egg protein in the vaccines vary and now the companies have to quantify the amount of egg protein for egg allergy patients. A 2-step approach is used (if the egg allergy is severe or anaphylaxis, and you definitely need the flu shots because of asthma, COPD etc). 10% of the vaccine is given s/c, then the patient is observed for 30 minutes, and if fine, the rest of the 90% of the vaccine is administered.

Allergy? poison?","Doctor":"Hello,You have had 2 anaphylaxis attacks with Caribbean Lobster and you are lucky to have pulled through without any treatment (if that is correct, since you have not mentioned any treatment that was given in the acute situation).You must AVOID all shellfish, as allergic reactions happen after you have consumed foods and been sensitized; which if eaten again develops into allergic reactions and the most severe of these reactions is anaphylaxis.If you have eaten shelllfish SINCE the two reactions with the Caribbean Lobster WITHOUT any reactions, I would have thought cooking was an issue, and what you mean by posioning.Fish poisoning can present with the same symptoms, called scromboid toxin poisoning and happens with sardines etc.You definitely need a specific IgE blood test against crab, lobster, shrimp, including house dust mite and any related pollens or nuts if you have had any reactions to. You also must keep an emergency kit containing EpiPen (adrenaline) autoinjector [note: must get help if you have used it yourself], antihistamines and steroids. A salbutamol inhaler is also recommended if you have asthma.Best Wishes."},{"Patient":"I had been having severe lower abdominal cramps on and off for over 24 hours.  It felt like I was constipated.

Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. Any pain abdomen is not necessarily be an attack of appendicitis. As you have got this pain for quite some time which got worse now, I would suggest you to get it assessed clinically by a general surgeon, who might advise you for some routine blood tests, urine test, a stool test for ova and cyst and an ultrasound abdomen if considered necessary. Further management would depend on the results of clinical finding and investigation reports. Till then, you could take some mild anti spasmodic drug and a proton pump inhibitor for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

So there is no need to worry that you will lose weight if you have rhinitis. However, you lose weight in untreated rhinitis and rhinosinusitis through a round-about way in not having good night's sleep, fatigue in the morning and unable to concentrate through the day. If the rhinitis is bad, I would suggest getting allergy testing done to exclude the triggers and treat with flixonase nasal spray 2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 3 months at the first instance.

The chest pains could be secondary to coughing or a chest infection with pleurisy (inflammation of the linings of the lungs) that would require antibiotics for 7-10 days. If the pains persist with sweating, an ECG is a must to ensure all is ok with the heart side of things. Antibiotics plus a course of antihistamines with inhalers or montelukast should suffice.

This is not related to the gall bladder problem and hence not solved by the gall bladder removal. The causes of such a problem may be either of :::-IBS- Irritable Bowel Syndrome.Appendicitis or Typhlitis,-Any inflammatory process related to teh intestines , this can be ulcerative colitis, large lymph nodes in the vicinity if intestines, procto-colitis as this is a reflex procedure. I would advise you the following:-Relevant tests of the blood, urine and stool.-CT scan of the abdomen,-Colonoscopy.IF all the tests are negative this may be taken as a case of IBS, and stress is one of the most important factor which increases your problem.

He will be two at the end of January and we noticed his mastocytoma abotu 6 months ago.","Doctor":"Hello, I think you had meant solitary mastocytoma (the correct terminology) but it means the same anyway. I am not sure of the location or the size. They can regress spontaneously and the one blood test that would be very helpful to know his risk of anaphylaxis is mast cell tryptase levels. I am sure this test must have been done, as the diagnosis of mastocytoma is difficult, unless a bone biopsy was done that showed sheets of mast cells. There is a theoretical risk of anaphylaxis in patients with mastocytosis, but is more patients with systemic mastrocytosis. Having an emergency pack of antihistamines, prednisolone, adrenaline injector (if possible) is the ideal management plan plus couselling on how to recognise anaphylaxis. Insect bite stings do cause problems particularly bee and wasp (including hornet, red fire ants etc), so you have to ask him to be careful about these things.

But she was not treated for any viral fever at any time. We changed her shampoo from Johnson baby to Dove. She had allergic reaction on her forehead only on the day we apply shampoo and lot of hair loss from head. We found that at 4th time that it was because of shampoo and changed back to Johnson baby shampoo. Now she doesnot have any allergy and no hair loss from head.

Simply losing hair from specific areas (such as eyebrow or eyelash) is not a sign of contact dermatitis (also know as delayed hypersensitivity). It is also unusual to develop this at this age. Chemical hypersensitivities are checked using patch tests that must be discussed with your dermatologist or allergist. Systemic disorders such as thyroid abnormality, lupus (with the screening ANA test), other features such as weight loss or eating disorders (such as anorexia nervosa) need to be considered if they are relevant. Please discuss these with your doctor. Blood tests such as complete hemogram, VitB12, folate, iron levels, ANA, LFTs, TSH fT4 are minimum investigations to exclude systemic disorders.

Cough occurs every 10 min or so during the day. Should I wait it out and just drink a lot of water or go see my family physician ?","Doctor":"Hello, Runny nose, sneezing, nasal discharge (usually white), cough are signs of an allergic process. Once the rhinitis goes beyond control and affects the airways, you develop breathing difficulties as in asthma. That the CBC is normal, suggests the eosinophil count is also normal, that would exclude severe allergies. However, house dust mite or fungal allergies are common at this time of the year. I would suggest long-acting antihistamines like cetirzine 10mg (maximum twice daily) and/or a nasal spray like Flixonase 2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 1 month and see the benefit. If things worsen after you stop, please get a blood test or skin prick test (must stop all antihistamines for at least 1 week if skin tests are required) to exclude allergic triggers. Hope this helps. Best Wishes."},{"Patient":"I am coughing up a lot of mucus over the past several weeks. The mucus hacking episodes last for 15 minutes of gagging to get this stuff out. It doesn t stop for me until I get out the clump of mucus which is sometimes a dark brown, yellow, or red color. The majority of the mucus is a thick and white. It is to the point where I can t eat or drink until the stuff comes out. It makes me dizzy by the end of the episode of hacking. I don t have any food allergies . My dad s side of the family has thyroid, heart, and digestive problems. My grandma and dad had some procedure done to their throats.

I haven t done anything for this except gargle warm salt water and mucunex stuff. Nothing is working. I don t smoke or do drugs. I don t know what s wrong with me.","Doctor":"Hi Montoya, Thanks for writing your query. After reading your post, it seems that you are having bronchitis and lower respiratory tract infection. First of all you should get the following investigations done :- 1. Chest X-ray PA view 2. Complete Blood Count (CBC) 3. Sputum examination (Culture and Senstivity and AFB testing) Yellow and thick mucus can be due to some infection in the respiratory tract. Red colour in the sputum can be due to some leakage of blood from thin blood vessels as a result of severe coughing . You can take bronchodilators like Levosalbutamol along with mucolytics like Bromhexine. Antibiotics, if needed can be started according to the culture/senstivity report. Steam inhalation and chest physiotherapy will also help to cough out mucus easily. You should get yourself examined medically and investigated before starting any medication. I hope this is helpful to you. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Good Morning. My 9 month old had a reaction to what we thought was strawberries. Head to toe rash . Saw my doctor and allergist . Turns out he had serum sickness. My question is what foods should I be careful with as far as allergies (my husband is allergic to many things, dust mites, pets, dust, some seafood). Thank you Autumn","Doctor":"Hi! basically serum sickness is immune complex mediated type 3 hypersensitivity reaction caused by exposure to protein of nonhuman animal sources occuring 4 to seven days after exposure. Main agents causing this reaction are vaccine, antitoxin, and several drugs like penicillin, sulphonamide, quinidine etc. This reaction may present as rashes, joint pain, fever, abdominal pain, lymphadenopathy, malaise, itching, shock if further exposure occur. So try to prevent further exposure to the offending agents, for the management of present symptoms corticosteroids, antihistaminics, analgesics or plasmapheresis if the symptoms are not responding to medical treatment. As you are worrying about food allergy and atopy to environmental agents the I want to tell you that it is type 1 hypersensitivity reaction mediated by Ig E immunoglobulin and it can be diagnosed by clinical examination and family history, it has genetic basis of occurence but most commonly from maternal side.food causing allergy most commonly in these patient are peanuts, milk, egg, fish, shelfish, soya, wheat etc. but you can get the complete list by going for allergy panel test and then you can avoid exposure to all allergents. You can keep epinephrine injections for emergency anaphylactic reactions.

Now after applying soap you developed itching red bumps for which also you used destin which gives relief. Any anti allergic drugs will give relief for any form of allergy. First we must try to analyze the cause (if possible) for the allergy. Your history and dermatologist's examination are the deciding factor to find what may be the cause for the allergy.

Phenytoin can cause a severe drug induced systemic reaction called Drug rash, Eosinophilia, Systemic Symptoms (DRESS for short) where there is fever, big glands, skin peeling off and liver problems. Other drugs implicated in DRESS should ten be avoided. I am certain your mother did not have this...but maybe just a rash that can be itchy and known as urticaria. Prednisolone is occasionally used a last resort but antihistamines are more than effective in treating urticaria. The alternative antiepileptic is a good choice, and suggest you discuss with your Neurologist in tapering and stopping the steroids after 5 days if the diagnosis was not DRESS.

I have read a few internet blogs saying that they are parasitic worms, they do look like worms but are not moving. They look like blood clots but wanted to double check if there is something that I can do about them or if they are a final result of my coughing and blowing my nose.

It does seem that you have moderate to severe persistent rhinitis/rhinosinusitis. House dust mite allergy must definitely be excluded. You can get skin prick tests or specific IgE blood tests to know all your allergies. Blood mixed with nasal secretions can appear like streaks and are NOT worms. If you have parasitic disease in your airways and coming out of the nose, it happens in tropical pulmonary eosinophilia due to filarial worms and believe me, you will be quite unwell!

I have been doing some reading about how strep bacteria can spread and cause rheumatic disease. About a week and half prior to having this sore throat, I have felt my heart palpitating and beats at abnormal rate everyday. I queried if it was my asthma but it s definitely not my lungs but my chest/heart that felt odd. Five days on and the sore throat feels worse, and also I started feeling something stuck down the trachea everytime I swallow.

Is this normal with tonsillitis? Regards.","Doctor":"Hello, Sorry to note that you are having a rough time. It is most likely exudative tonsillitis (on examination, there is white pus covering the tonsils) and streptococcal bacteria, diphtheria are main causes. Penicillin V, erythromycin, azithromycin (for penicillin allergy) are first line treatment options and also noted that you are allergic to almost all antibiotics except sulphur ones. The secretions (or exudates) from the infected tonsils go down the throat (causing sore throat) and then to the chest causing feeling of tightness. If you have asthma, then you feel this coming on quicker. Epiglottitis is an indication for hospitalisation. Conservative treatment involves: staying at home to prevent social contact and you may catch other organisms; throat gargles may help; ibuprofen or  paracetamol syrup to lower the pain and temperature.

You will definitely require allergy tests either in the form of skin prick tests or specific IgE blood test to exclude house dust mite, pollen, mould allergies.

What could be wrong?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome and thank you for posting in HCM Per your description you are suffering from an respiratory tract infection and an associated pharyngitis (inflammation of the pharynx). This affections are typically caused by viruses  (but with very moderate fever 37.5-38.5 degree Celsius) but when fever is very high with swollen throat (tonsils, uvula and pharynx ) it is generally bacterial infection ( strep). Having respiratory signs like shortness of breath, chest pains etc typically indicate a respiratory affection which could be an extension of the germs in the pharynx. For diagnosis, a rapid streptococcal test or a throat swap + culture have to be done to rule out possible bacterial infection. Chest x-ray is also important to rule out pneumonia. Your asthma symptoms are present as a result of the affection which has provoked the crisis since you are a known asthmatic and microbes affecting your respiratory tract might induce asthma symptoms and even exacerbate them. You will need to see your doctor soonest for prompt management before it gets any worst. Steroidal/non-steroidal antiinflammatory, antipyretics and antibiotics would have to be administered either orally or intravenously depending on the severity of your condition.

The rased eosinopihil count, constant rhinitis (runny nose), mucopurulent discharge does suggest an allergic rhinosinusitis. A fungal rhinosinusitis needs to be excluded.

It is also important that immune deficiency (antibody deficiency) is excluded with serum immunoglobulins, functional antibody levels. A sweat test may be indicated depending on chest findings (i.e., if there is lung scarring or bronchiectasis) then yes, the test is indicated.

Thanks for your query. Your rash-like skin eruptions could possibly be due to an allergic reaction or a heat rash (if you are living in a tropical country or exposed to heat / sun). I would suggest the following remedial measures: - you can take an anti-histamine (anti-allergy) medication like Pheniramine or Cetrizine (which should be available over the counter) - you can apply an emolient like calamine lotion to soothen the skin and relieve the itching - avoid sweating or dirt accumulation by taking frequent baths - avoid exposure to dust or irritants - avoid perfumed or strong soaps, perfumes or lotions If the rash is worsening or you develop any other complications, please see a doctor for further evaluation. Wish you all the best.

We had the apartment tested and there were no signs of CO in the apartment. They then said that there was probably a miss reading of the level of CO in his body, however how is this related to the severe allergy reaction that he had with the peanuts?","Doctor":"Hi cia-fmly, Thanks for writing to us, Generally there is no relation between CO level and peanut allergy you have stated above, The symptoms for peanut allergy could be different for different persons, An allergic response to peanuts usually occurs within minutes after exposure, and symptoms range from mild to severe. Peanut allergy signs and symptoms can include: 1)Skin reactions, such as hives, redness or swelling 2)Itching or tingling in or around the mouth and throat 3)Digestive problems, such as diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea or vomiting 4)Tightening of the throat 5)Shortness of breath or wheezing 6)Runny nose. 7) sometimes it may lead to anaphylaxis Carbon monoxide level in the body could have increased due to exposure to pollution , since our blood absorbs more % of CO than Oxygen easily . But since you have said that there  were no chances of such , I think the report has to be reevaluated . I hope this was informational and wishing a good health to your son, Dr.G.Gayatri devi"},{"Patient":"At 0130 last night I was woken up with severing itching hands both itched the same and burned when I stopped scratching them.

It was jsut the hands and they ertr equal in intensity, I got up washed them with soap and water. and used 1% otc cortisine cream on them I used it like hand cream, But I was carful not to use too much. Just enough to cover my hands only. It seems like they were better the next am. But I noticed that my lips on the right side, ( I sleep on my left ) both upper and lower to midline felt swollen, did not look so much swollen. But felt that way, and I also noted that my throat ( again on the right side ) was slightly sore and scratchy. It seemed swollen and I had trouble swollowing. The coffe of the day seemed like it helped reduce the swelling in my throat. I have no idea what the cause is and I was quite concerned as I am not sure if this will lead up to something more troublesome in the future. Are ther any ideas as towhat this may be other than the apparent allergy to something? Thansk for the consideration..","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for writing your query. After reading your post, it seems that you are having some allergic reaction in your body, which needs immediate medical attention to limit its progress. I would suggest that you should immediately contact the Emergency Department and get yourself examined and record your vitals like blood pressure, pulse rate, etc and if needed get injected to stop this allergic reaction. Also try to determine the cause of your allergy or insect bite and try to remove it. I hope this is helpful to you.

It took all I could do to try to breath some air without letting this food piece go down any further and catch enough breath to be able to cough it up. I had to run outside to feel fresh air while having a violent coughing attack which is when I started to get inmense chest pains accompanied with sharp sensation of needles and pins throughout my chest and shoulders.

Thanks for your query. LCZ (Levocetrizine) and Allegra (Fexofenadine) are anti-allergy medication which are called \\"anti-histamines\\". They act by preventing the release of allergy-mediating chemicals called \\"histamines\\" These anti-allergy medication do not cause any addiction and generally, there would be no necessity to keep increasing the medication as time goes by. However, usually, these medication are prescribed for short periods only, with the hope that the body will slowly get 'sensitized' or adjusted to the allergen and will be able to tackle it without the necessity of the medication. Both LCZ and Allegra are usually prescribed as once daily doses, because their duration of action is roughly one day - i.e. the optimum effects of the medication last for one day. But in your case, you mention that one tablet is effective for 4 days. If you are comfortable taking Allegra once a day, then it should be quite okay. There is no hard and fast rule that they have to be taken daily. Wish you all the best. Regards, Dr. Sheeba Stephen"},{"Patient":"I am suffering from amoebaiasis for last four days .

I am staying with my inlaws right now and as soon as we arrived 6 days ago I got some sort of rash on the inside of my arms. It appeared after I had a nap on their fold out bed. Although I dont seem to have any allergies I do often have itchy eyes, a runny nose and sneezing when I sleep there. Now I dont have any of those symptoms but I do have the rash which itches intensely and it seems to be getting worse. It now looks like I have mosquito bites all up the inside of my arms, around my armpits and up the sides of my torso. My back is also itchy as well as my tummy and under my breasts but there are not as many visible spots. Does this sound like an allergic reaction or could it be something contagagious? Should I go to the doctor since I have had this for 6 days? Besides the itching I am not really affected. Thank you","Doctor":"Hello, Thank you for writing to us. House dust mite allergy is a likely possibility given the itchy eyes, runny nose and sneezing. Urticaria can happen (itchy hives) sometimes due to the dust allergy but usually unrelated. You will need skin prick tests or specific IgE blood test to find out what your allergies are (aeroallergen panel). Long acting antihistamines like cetirizine 10mg or fexofenadine 180mg plus flixonase nasal spray 2 spras/nostril twice daily is recommended for severe house dust mite allergy. You will need to take both for at least 2 months to have a good effect. The antihistamines will also work for the urticaria. I hope that was useful.

Thanks for your query. I understand that you must be going through a difficult time with your aniety / panic as well as the other physical symptoms. All your symptoms seem to fit into the category of an anxiety disorder. The panic attacks, health anxiety, fear of dying, physical symptoms like palpitations, etc. can all be explained due to anxiety. It is important to understand that anxiety can present with not only psychological symptoms but also with physical or somatic symptoms. Shakiness, dizziness, fast heart rate (palpitations), etc. are symptoms which are commonly seen in anxiety disorders. So, you needn't worry about the palpitations. Since you seem to be having a lot of distress due to your symptoms, I would suggest that you seek professional help to deal with the anxiety. There are effective treatment options - in the form of medication or counselling / psychotherapy which will help you overcome your problems. So, please consult a psychiatrist for further treatment.

When I put in my soft lenses after a period of time, it felt as if the left lens was a piece of glass. I took out the lens as soon as I came home and wore my glasses. Because I was concerned, I went to my long time opthalmalogist. He did a complete dialation of both eyes and examination for abrasions. He said I had no abrasions, no infection. My pressure was 12 and 16 which he said was normal. He prescribed another allergy drop. When I used the drops, my eyes got red, itchy and achy. I called him and he said to discontinue using the drops and use warm compresses. I wore my soft lens for about 5 hours yesterday. My eyes were red when I took them out. They began to ache especially over the left eyebrow at night. I woke up at 4 am. with a real ache. I ve worn my glasses all day, but it s 5:00 pm and the ache over the left eye is like a migrane .

My eyes are white and clear, but the ache persists.","Doctor":"Hi Copilot 12, I have read your question, The eyes have been called the most sensitive organs in the human body. That is because they are with pain receptors—extremely sensitive, finely tuned nerve endings that help protect these vital organs. The Symptoms you said above do show the signs of sinusitis , glaucoma or normal headache.But without physical examination and medical history ,it is difficult to come to any conclusion. Pain inside eyes and itching are sometimes signs of allergy due to pollution etc. contact lens sometimes dont suit few people as well.

Your children are suffering from allergic bronchitis/asthma. Due to exertion during swimming, bronchoconstriction i.e. narrowing of air passage/bronchioles occurs resulting in reflex in the form of cough. Antibiotic donot play a role unless there is added infection. In bronchial asthma or in bronchitis, bronchodilators are needed as they dilates the constricted air passage and gives relief in cough. Bronchodilators can be given in the form of rotacaps or inhaler as this route is safer and more effective. Antiallergy medicines like levocetrizine can be given to decrease the allergic reaction. Get them examined by a Paeditrician and give medicines under medical supervision only. I hope this is helpful to you. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Please help. I am itching all over.

You need to take your asthma medications regularly and get it evaluated at routine intervals from a pulmonologist. Your abdominal complaints could be due to a condition of diabetic gastroparesis. You can take antacids like Tb PAN D for symptomatic relief once in the morning on empty stomach. I would suggest you do a repeat blood sugar fasting and post meal levels along with gycosylated HbA1c levels for your current diabetes status. Also an ECG and stress test need to be done for the palpitations. Thus you need to get yourself re evaluated at present as mentioned above and get managed accordingly.

She however has developed allergic asthma and gets pains in the chest where the pneumonia had occurred. It is unusual for the pain to be related to the previous pneumonia episode, unless she has had further lung problems and has left lung scarring, in medical terms this is known as fibrosis. Lung fibrosis can lead to several complications, and if there is evidence of bronchiectasis on HRCT scans, pain in that area can happen as sputum production continues and the constant cough leaves one with pain. My suggestion would be to get proper investigations done, such as HRCT Chest, lung function studies with DLCO (that shows the current lung function with regard to oxygen diffusion) and get these reviewed by a Chest Physician. Rib pain can also be a possibility if there has been a recent fall, and the CT will pick this up as well. Please ensure that the asthma is also optimally controlled.

A diagnosis of ABPA (Allergic Broncho Pulmonary Aspergillosis) can be considered in such a scenario. Do get your total serum IgE levels, Serum IgG and IgE specific for aspergillus, sputum fungus examination. If it is detected then oral steroid therapy will have to be started to which your condition should respond. Regrading the autoimmune profile, if your physician is suspecting then collagen vascular diseases are a possibility for which you may undergo a extranuclear antigen profile. For episodes of pneumonia antibiotics will have to be taken as per culture sensitive reports of the organisms isolated from the sputum/ bronchoscopy samples.

For Asthmatic Complaint Pls take him for all Baseline Blood and Urine investigations/Chest X-Ray/Pulmonary Function Tests. For maintainance dosage regularly use brochodilator inhalations.In an acute attack pls nebulise him with locally acting Glucocorticoids and Bronchodilators.Avoid Tablets and Parenterals to prevent systemic side effects.

I had severe acne on my face.so i went to a skin specialist .i also told him that i am having problems like loose stool , asthma ,cough and cold.So he suggested me drugs called mebeverine , Azithromycin and mizolastine inn . but after taking those medicine for few days i started to have loose stool,abdominal discomfort,gas, mucus in stool.Since then i have been loosing my health rapidly and now it has became worse and i am still suffering.what can i do now?","Doctor":"Hi Munaz, Thanks for writing your query. After reading your post, it seems that you are having symptoms of abdominal discomfort and loose motion due to antibiotic Azithromycin. Antibiotic usually disturb the normal flora of beneficial bacteria mainly lactobacillus, present in the intestines. These bacteria help in digestion and absorption of food. Antibiotic disturb this normal flora and result in loose motion and abdominal discomfort. Taking of Lactobacillus preparation in the form of pre and probiotic will be beneficial. Taking yoghurt will also be good for you. I hope this is helpful to you. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I am a 29 year old female and I have a lot of allergies-dust, dogs, cats, fresh cut grass.

This year I have already got lots of these bumps. I m the only one in the house that gets them and we have had our place Che Jed for bugs-nothing. These bumps appear at any time during th day.","Doctor":"Hello, Thank you for writing to us at Healthcare Magic. You seem to be getting cold-induced urticaria, that does only partially respond to creams, as it removes the scratching component. Physical urticaria is when you get more lumps after scratching the skin and therefore you must avoid doing this. House dust mite allergy gets worse in the winter, especially in the western part of the world (due to central heating etc) and once daily long-acting allegra 180mg plus nasonex nasal spray is recommended for the entire winter. The long-acting antihistamine will also help with the skin condition, and occasionally you may have to resort to sedative antihistamines like hydroxyzine 25/50mg (sometimes 75mg) at night to control the difficult urticaria. Hope this helps. Best Wishes."},{"Patient":"I recently had a biopsy of my neck lymph nodes that showed sarcoidosis . Had a pulmonary function test which definitely shows asthma. Been on steriods for one week, noticing improvement in breathing but still wheezing and need to use inhaler three to four times a day. I still have watery eyes, nasal congestion, and lymph nodes are still swollen. I was wondering if there is any questions that I should be asking my doctor. Should I be getting any other tests? Pulmonary doctor doesn t feel the lymph nodes in my lungs should be biopsied at this time.","Doctor":"Hi sixguysandagirl, Sarcoidosis being a chronic disease it cannot be cured in days. A week of steroid treatment cannot cure the symptoms of sarcoidosis. Sometimes it wont be cured with steroid treatment alone needing more powerful immunosuppressive drugs but sometimes it may be cured spontaneously also, so continue taking the drugs....Since the diagnosis has been confirmed and pulmonary function tests done no need to take lung biopsy.. If at all you want, you can see complete blood count, electrolytes to look for associated comorbidities and liver function tests to see for liver involvement...

If she has such allergies- its better to inform everyone who ever takes care of her- as allergy can cause life threatening manifestations. You may see your Pediatrician for her oral lesions.

Me and my step-brother were in the back yard, I had just come outside, and he was talking to the neighbor next door (mid-aged woman) about our park league baseball team as I started to double over. He kept telling me to get over there and was intent that there was nothing wrong.  I tried but I could not stand up.  Finally I noticed that upon trying to get up some pain was relieved when my right hand was on my right knee (both hand and knee had to be tensed or it would hurt).  So I slowly managed to get back on my feet but had to stay bent over and had to keep tensed.  I joined the laughs a little as I wobbled a few feet.

This time i got caught up with severe nose block for past 6 days. I used otrivin to get around the nose block.( At the max i use it twice in a day). I dont have any other discomfort (head ache or body pain). Should i consult a ENT specialist rather than a general physician now?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting your query. There is high possibility of sinusitis and allergic rhinitis. Presence of nasal blockage and running nose suggests the diagnosis. You should also consult with ENT surgeon and internal medicine specialist simultaneously. As such there is no correlation between vitamin D3 & B12 deficiency and development of mentioned symptoms. You should go for x ray PNS view along with complete blood count,  absolute eosinophil count and IgE level. You should take complete antibiotic course along with nasal decongestants.

For the next three days I experienced severe stomach pain near the belly button that would come and go. Friday night I developed sinus symptoms that I believe has lead to a sinus infection . Headache , fever, stuffy nose, sneezing , yellow snot, etc. I think it s starting to go to my chest. I have a dry cough but it s not constant. I do have to clear my throat. I m also experience an ache in my lower right rib when I touch it. Could these all be symptoms of pneumonia or something else? I m not sure if the vomiting was related to my sinus issue.","Doctor":"Hello Melissa, Your initial symptoms of a stomach bug and the ongoing symptoms of sinusitis, headache, sneezing, cough could all be connected with a viral gastroenteritis followed by a chest infection. The pain in the rib is usually an inflammation of the lining surrounding the lungs, called pleura, and hence referred as pleuritis. I hope the stomach or gastrointestinal symptoms have now cleared up and if not, you will need a stool c/s followed by a Chest X Ray to ensure there is no pneumonia; and urine c/s (if there are urinary symptoms as well). Additional blood tests would be a complete blood count, liver function tests, CRP. The treatment will then depend on the results. Typically a viral gastroenteritis does not require any therapy, but you must ensure you drink a lot of water, take rest, have some anti-emetics (anti-sickness drug) if nausea is severe. Antihistamines such as cetirizine and paracetamol will help with the sinus symptoms. Hope that helps.

My eyes were so swollen that I could hardly see. I went to emergency and the doctor there just told me to take an antihistimine and if it doesn t go away then come back. Well I did as he suggested and the swelling didn t go down, so I went again to emergency and this time a different doctor asked all that I had been eating and doing etc. I am allergice to sulfa drugs and was taking hydrochlorthazide (sp?) which he told me contains sulfa and he suggested i stop it for a couple of weeks and in the meantime prescribed prednazone for 5 days. After 3 weeks my face finally went back to normal and I am going to look further into what I am allergic to. However in the mean time I have just contracted a cold and I ve had it for 3 days now and every morning my eyes, especially my upper eyelids are extremely swollen and this is not normal for me......I have been applying ice packs but is there something else you can suggest...is this normal for some people to have extremely swollen upper eyelids...or should I be looking further into this?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for your question. From your history there are two things that stand out as possible causes of your eyelid swelling. You mentioned that you noticed the swelling and your cold around the same time. A common cause of eyelid swelling is conjunctivitis that could be caused by the some viruses that also cause a cold. Look out for associated \\"pink/red\\" appearance of your eye with discharge. This should resolve in a few days by maintaining proper hygiene of the eye. You mentioned that you had stopped taking hydrocholothiazide as you are allergic to it but you did not mention why you were taking it. If it was for blood pressure control, then were you put on an alternate drug? If not, the stopping of hydrochorothiazide and subsequent use of Prednisone could cause your blood pressure levels to rise with subsequent swelling of the eyes either due to kidney disease secondary to hypertension or due to the hypertension itself. Please look out for swelling of the feet, breathlessness and changes in your urinary habits, these would entail immediate medical attention.

Can you please confirm if the use of this inhaler can tend to become habit or is a curable method?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting your query. As your wife has past history of asthma, there is high chances of persisting asthma. Foracort 200 is meant for the same purpose. Still you should consult with internal medicine  specialist/ chest physician and should go for thorough check up. Inhalational therapy (by foracort ) has been defined the best therapy. By this route, medicine directly reach up to the lungs and whole body is prevented from the side effects of the medicines. Medicines available in inhaler is in microgram while medicine taken orally is in miligram, so by this route body is exposed to less dosage. Asthma is an allergic disease and if it is occurring in adult age then chances of permanent cure is least likely. It can be controlled but can't be eradicated.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.As your husband already had all kinds of investigations done and had a cholecystectomy, with the persisting pain post surgery, I would advise you for the following if I were your doctor:1) Avoid eating food from outside as recurrent intestinal infections might creep into the intestines giving rise to pain abdomen. To rule this out, I would go for a routine stool test for ova and cyst and treat it if positive.2) Some of the components of the food he consumes might be causing sensitivity reaction to the intestinal mucosa giving rise to such symptoms. In this case a hit and trial exclusion of diet to see if excluding some component of food from his diet would relieve his symptoms. For this , consultation with a dietician would be worth while to rule out an unsuspected gluten sensitivity or a lactose intolerance.3)Some modification in your diet like more of roughage, enough liquids, avoidance of oily, fried, and fast food, and avoidance of alcoholic beverages and smoking if you do.4) A serum amylase and lipase if not done till now.5) Till then I would advise you for a proton pump inhibitor, an anti spasmodic and a probiotic drug for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

An immunologists assesment regarding the allergen which has been responsible have to be found out by injecting various antigens. later they will do desensitisation therapy for a period of time. Pls avoid dusty places/vehicular smoke/passive/active smoking. Regularly do steam inhalations.Take anti allergic medications such as Oral fexofenadine/Oral Cetirizine/oral Chlorpheniramine Malleate tabs as per your MDs prescription for a temporary relief.

Chronic Asthma/obstructive/restrictive Airway disease produces permanent dilatation and destruction of the alveoli/bronchioles/terminal bronchi thereby reducing the overall surface area of the lungs available for effectve exchange of gases at the level of alveoli.The condition is termed as Emphysema .This can be easily made out by a doctor by looking at the chest itself whose anterioposterior diameter is more than the transverse diameter. Have you done all the routinne investigations (Blood counts including eosinophil absolute/blood chemistry/urine analysis),chest X-ray PA view and lateral/Pulmonary function tests) 1)The only solution is to stop further deterioration by immediately quitting  smoking without a second thought. 2)Use brochodilator inhalers and locally acting /short acting steroidal(Eg-Budesonide/fluticazone) inhalers. 3)In an acute attack pls get hospitalised and nebulised with above medications. 4)Mast cell Stabilisers such as Sodium Chromoglycate inhalers are also available.It is very useful for prevention of acute attacks. 5) In addition breathing excercises will help. 6)Avoid dust and house dust mite /keep your residence dust free.Avoid vehicular emissions. 7)In addition Desensitisation by identifying a particular allergen can be done by an Immunologist. If the repeated attacks are not prevented premature onset of right heart failure may set in due to pulmonary hypertension. In addition pls be under the follow up care of a pulmonologist to avoid /treat acute episosodes and by following these steps the further attacks of Asthma and deterioration of Emphysema can be checked. wishing you a speedy recovery., Best regards., Dr Lt Cdr ASN Bhushan.

Can this burning and itching be relavent to the stabbing incident, or is it something else?","Doctor":"Dear Adnikki15, your friend's symptoms are not related to his asthma, also if it was because of nerve injury after stabbing and stitches ,it would have presented earlier and not after a year.

It appears that you may be suffering from the common flu and you need to take plenty of fluid, rest, some anti-histaminics and painkillers.

You need to adjust your lifestyle and avoid allergens even though it is difficult to do, at least you will reduce the chances of you getting some allergy episodes. Then you can use antihistamines such as cetrizine or a  nasal steroid spray to  relief the symptoms when they present.

To treat you will need analgesic ( acetaminophen), chlopheniramine or any antihistamine to reduce any allergies and a nasal decongestant ( here i usually prescribe vibrocyl or marimar or prorhinel nasal puffs). I don't know what you have there. As for the infection since it is likely going to be viral just a few days of symptomatic management will get it gone. If after a few days it persist then it is likely going to be a bacterial infection (in that case, antibiotics will be of choice). Also try using general methods like keeping warm and hot soup or tea or coffee. As for the abnormal hearing of sounds (tinnitus) it might be as a result of ear infection or just symptom associated with the nasal congestion. When this will clear off, you'll feel better. In any case see with your doctor if symptoms persist Best regards"},{"Patient":"I have a red rash on my face, it can become very hot, like burning.

If the rash gets worse on exposure to sunlight, then it is a photosensitive rash and you need sun creams with SPF30 before you go out. If the rash becomes very red and burning, you will also need blood tests such as complete blood count, ANA profile to exclude an autoimmune nature of the rash.2. If the rash comes and goes without a scar, and occasionally you get lip swelling, urticaria is a possibility and long-acting antihistamines like fexofenadine 180mg is the treatment.3. If the rash was after applying a make up, you will need to get patch tests to know what chemical allergy you have and avoid it in the future.Overall, an antihistamine tablet or calamine lotion can be tried to see the effect as they are not harmful.Best Wishes."},{"Patient":"Hello I ve had a persistent cough for over two months now.

Metallic taste may be due to antibiotics and phlegm production (common during asthmatic attacks). You should consult with internal medicine specialist and should get thorough check up.

Pain below the ribs due to frequent coughing is quite common. So, your pain is most likely due to the muscle strain due to the cough. You don't have to be worried about it as it will subside on its own within a few days. I would suggest that you continue the course of antibiotic for the prescribed time period.

From the nature and sudden onset of your symptoms after taking Doxycycline, it is possible that they could be indicative of an allergic reaction. Since you have stopped the medication and your symptoms are subsiding, you don't have to worry much. It may sometimes take a few days for your symptoms like tiredness and fatigue to completely settle down. I would advise you to take plenty of fluids and eat a healthy, nutritious diet. If your symptoms remain persistent or worsen, then I would advise you to see a doctor for further evaluation, since certain conditions like anaemia or vitamin deficiencies can cause persistent fatigue.

Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello, If the rash that you describe is red, itchy, has raised skin that you can feel, goes away after a few hours only for new ones to appear in their place, does not leave a mark or bruise, then this is acute urticaria. That you have had it for >6 weeks, makes it chronic urticaria. 80% of people with urticaria do not have allergy, although a pre-existing allergy to (say) house dust mite, pollens or shrimp does not make it more likely for this type of urticaria to appear. Infections, underlying thyroid problems, diabetes, inflammation inside the body (can be several conditions, say endometriosis) and stress makes these lesions appear and can last quite long. The treatment (that you don't like) is the right one, long-acting non-sedating antihistamines like allegra 180mg once in the morning, and cetirizine 10mg at lunch time or evening for 6 weeks (max 3 months).

Now i started having a mild pain near my left ear and feel the pain more when i open and close my mouth. i have been prescribed antibiotics Azythomycin. need help","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for your query Your history suggestive of post-infectious upper airway cough syndrome and nasal congestion. For that you need to take azelastine-xylometazoline nasal spray twice daily along with intra-nasal corticosteroid for quick relief like combinase-aq spray. Your ear pain is probably due to eustachian tube blockage due to congestion which will be releived after these medications. So dont worry. Its very common problem after upper respiratory tract viral infection or infection by atypical organism. You must undergo the therapy which i have prescribed and you should be releived within 5-7 days of therapy for sure.

I went through FESS but no benefits. Can u pls tell me how to live a normal life. I am also doing breathing exercise. I am waiting for your valuable suggestion. Its a completely depressed situation for me.","Doctor":"Hello, It seems that you have had skin tests or blood tests for allergy that all came back as negative, and hence the diagnosis of non-allergic rhinitis. The treatment is long term use of nasal corticosteroids plus or minus oral antihistamines (although of limited benefit). The nasal corticosteroid recommended is mometasone furoate 1 spray per nostril once daily (start with twice daily for a month). You can also use Azelastine spray 1-2 sprays three times a day for bad itching if required. It is a difficult condition to treat completely and you are not alone. Best Wishes."},{"Patient":"My husband has had 5 back surgeries over the last 19 years. About 7-10 days after each surgery, he starts breaking out in itchy lumps all over his body. He ends up taking benadryl every 4 hrs and sleeping his days away. The dr said they switched the type of suture and used staples to close his external incision. But he s obviously allergic to something. Can u help?","Doctor":"Hello, There are two possibilities: 1. He is allergic (note this is delayed hypersensitivity, not immediate) to the metal in the suture; like nickel allergy etc 2. The stress of the surgery leads to the urticarial eruptions that manifest as the itchy red lumps which settle with antihistamines. The first option can be excluded by knowing the type of suture and getting a patch test done by an Allergist or Dermatologist The second option can be treated with long acting non sedating antihistamines like Allegra 180mg once daily for a week; you can start this before the surgery if need be. I hope that was useful. Best Wishes."},{"Patient":"I have a reoccuring problem where only my right eye and right nostril will water for a full day then I m completely fine the next. This has been happening for a number of years (at least 20 yrs). This is the third time in as little as a month and half. I had allergy tests when I was in my 20s (I m 49 now- no allergies), saw an ENTafterwards and was told I had non- allergic rhinitis as I felt stuffed up all the time but no watering. The problem stopped a number of years after and I havent had that constant stuffy feeling since except for the watering today. Normally it affects me once or twice a year but this is the third time in a short amount of time.","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for ur query Non-allergic rhinitis has two varieties - vasomotor rhinitis and NARES. Your history seems to me that you are suffering from vasomotor rhinitis as there is watery discharges only. For that you need to take nasal spray containing anti-cholinergics like ipratropium bromide on long-term basis. If there is itching along with watering then you should have undergone eosinophil count in the nasal secretions. If eosinophil count in the nasal secretion is raised in the absence of positive skin allergic testing then the diagnosis of NARES will be established and treatment for that will be intra-nasal corticosteroids for atleast 3 months and treatment should be stepped up or stepped down as per response to therapy.

I am not running a fever , but today my cough seems deeper and is hurting my chest more too. I have been extremely tired yesterday and today, too.","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for your query If you are a smoker then you should quit it completely as soon as possible and if not possible totally you should quit it in a phased manner. Secondly pneumonia may be associated frequently with chronic bronchitis though absence of fever goes against the presence of pneumonia. You must have the following tests at the very outset before starting any treatment 1. routine blood investigations 2. sputum gram staining and culture sensitivity 3. spirometry with bronchodialator reversibility 4. chest x-ray PA view 5. sputum for acid-fast bacilli smear Consult a pulmonologist and get yourself locally examined. depending upon the report of the above tests you may have to start inhalers, oral antibiotics, nasal spray, oral bronchodialators to control your symptoms.

Since having the Swine Flu in 2009, my exercise tolerance has dramatically decreased. I avoid stairs in most cases, because they make me so SOB and my legs just get too tired.","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for your query. You have to follow the following steps- 1. First you have to confirm whether you have asthma or COPD. For that you need to undergo spirometric testing with reversibility. If there is obstructive pattern with reversibility then you have asthma and if there is only obstructive changes with no reversibility then you have COPD 2. Secondly you have to assess the control of your asthma or COPD symptoms based on symptoms, asthma control test (ACT) , COPD assessment test (CAT). 3. IF you have uncontrolled situation then you need to step up your persisting therapy to acheive the necessary control. 4. You never ever start smoking. You have to maintain smoking cessation. 5. You may take influenza and pneumococcal vaccination to decrease the exacerbation rate. 6. You may undergo pulmonary rehabilitation programme to increase your exercise tolerence and reduce the morbidity. All you can get after consulting a good pulmonologist.

So if your symptoms are well controlled now you can omit this drug now. Better to go for local application of azelastine fluticasone nasal spray now after consulting your doctor. For stomach pain you need to take local anesthetic gel like mucaine gel for symptomatic releive and pantoprazole tablets for healing of the erosions if any by montek-lc.

The best treatment is to find out the cause.Completely keep the house Dust Free.Nebulise with Broncho dilators and Steroids(Budecortil).Prophylactic Antibiotics. As the child crosses into boyhood , the airpassages size will increase and the child will definitely overcome the problem as the Bronchoconstriction will not have marked effect and there will be no precipitation.

Anyway, you should also exclude other reasons for your headaches like sinus problems, refractive errors etc. It is because of the asthma that you feel tired even after rest. Since you stay in a cool place at high altitude where the atmospheric oxygen concentration is lower, you can use a nebulizer for better relief. Also, steroid inhalers are needed to prevent attacks as they reduce the need for bronchodilators which usually have unpleasant side effects. Permanent cure for asthma is not possible but you can keep the symptoms at bay by avoiding triggering factors and taking anti-histamines whenever needed. You can try yoga and pranayama when when there are no attacks. Please consult a pulmonologist for further advice.

Levocetirizine is a very safe second generation antihistamine. Use of the nasal spray sometimes allows you to withdraw the montair LC. You have to avoid dust as much as possible.

The treatment that you had with antibiotics, steroids, nebulisers is standard as most infections resolve and the Chest X Ray shows complete clearance at 6 weeks. So the important thing now is rest and plenty of fluids, and medications, but getting that repeat Chest X Ray and making sure all is right. If there is still evidence of a lung collapse, a bronchoscopy is a must and perhaps a CT scan before this. STOP SMOKING if you haven't already done so, and well done if you have never smoked.

Infection may be a precipitating factor for precipitation of asthma or chronic bronchitis. Prednisolone may help during acute exacerbation of asthma.Oral antibiotics also help to control infection during a period of exacerbation. They have no role in controlling inflammation in asthma. Short acting bronchodilators will also give you temporary releif. You have to use MDI formoterol-budesonide BD through spacer or salmeterol-fluticasone BD. Inhaled corticosteroids are cornerstone of management in asthma  without having much side effects. You should also use a diary to record the symptoms or peak flow meter for objective monitoring. Frequent nocturnal awakening means your asthma is uncontrolled. I can not give you a definite management without physical examination and laboratory tests.

In allergic reactions that involve the eye, one gets red itchy sore eyes known as conjunctivitis. There can be some swelling around the eye; and along with runny nose, itchy nose. The tight feeling that you get - is it because it is red and inflamed and you are unable to open it; or because it is swollen? If you do get headaches, in front of the head, then all this could be related to allergic rhinosinusitis. If you think all these are plausible, then blood tests (specific IgE) against dust mites, tree and grass pollens, animal dander should be done to see if this is the case. If allergies are proven, long acting antihistamines such as cetirizine or loratidine 10mg tablets taken once daily (maximum three times a day) should suffice. Hope this helps.

Long acting non-sedative antihistamines like allegra 180mg ad nasonex 1 spray per nostril once daily are required for a 3-month duration to see the effect.

Buf after a detailed analysis it has been found that I have been suffering from very sever allergy. What is the best treatment for this?","Doctor":"Hello, Thank you for writing to us. As you now already know that you have severe pollen allergy, you must also know if that is tree pollen or grass pollen allergy. Depending on which part of the world you live, there are specific seasons when these pollen counts peak in the environment. You need to start taking long-acting antihistamines like Allegra 180mg morning and levocetirizine 5mg in the evening followed by Montelukast 10mg at night. Nasonex nasal spray 1 spray per nostril once daily and/or asthalin inhaler when required. This should be started 1 month before the pollen season and continued throughout the season. 1 in 5 people will fail the above optimal medical therapy and will need immunotherapy. This therapy involves giving low doses of the allergen either in the form of injections or drops and started 2 months before the season. Some practitioners lower the amount while in the season, while some do not. This lasts between 3 to 5 years. I hope this helps.

Right now I am going through Homoeopathic treatment.But whenever, allergy increases I have to go for allopathic medication. Please advise me if there is any permanent cure for this.","Doctor":"Hello Protush, Welcome to Healthcare Magic. Your symptoms are suggestive of allergic rhinitis and rhinosinusitis, that if it remains like this may develop into allergic asthma. You will need to know what the allergies are by either skin prick tests or specific IgE tests to aeroallergens such as house dust mite, animal dander, mould allergens etc. A complete blood count, IgE level, TSH fT4, Vit D levels are additional tests that help n understanding why the allergies have become severe. Long-acting antihistamines such as fexofenadine 180mg taken once daily with Nasonex nasal spray 1 spray per nostril once daily for 3 months is recommended. The allergy tests will help in determining which season you should use the treatment. Failure of medical treatment means immunotherapy over 3-5 years remains the last option that will also be decided on the basis of results of allergy tests. I hope that was useful. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, I am suffering from large red patches appear and dissapear in an holf an hour like that since from last 3 years while in that condition feel itching in hand , stomach and other parts of the body but I under gone so many tests but the Doctors say no problem in body and it is due to some stress and some psychiatric probem and in IGE level seems to be high range in value means shows 519, for this I took tablets one year back but still not recovered. Please suggest how to proceed for the next treatment Thanks and Regards BABU.B","Doctor":"Hello, Your condition is called urticaria and most people (80%) do NOT have allergies although the raised IgE level would suggest an underlying allergy. Stress compounds the problem and causes the lesions to last longer but is not the cause. You will need tests such as full blood count, iron levels, CRP, ANA, TSH fT4, TPO antibodies to exclude a secondary cause. Long acting antihistamines such as Allegra 180mg plus cetirizine 10mg in the evening for 4 weeks is recommended. For an acute generalised eruption that does not respond to antihistamines, you will need a short course of steroids (Omnacortil 40 or Prednisolone 40mg once daily after food for 5 days) as the last resort. I hope this helps. Thanks."},{"Patient":"For bout 6 months I have felt like crap. It started with just feeling exhausted all the time. Im a usually active person and other than smoking ...

To clarify, MPV 6.9 is not significant but the other values such as Hb, MCV, MCH, TC DC, platelet count are more important but I presume they were normal. I do not understand what the thyroid 1.055 is ; if this is TSH value then it is pretty low and am surprised that you are not on treatment for this. Please get a repeat TSH fT4 value and if the TSH is low or undetectable with raised fT4 then the diagnosis is thyrotoxicosis and that is why you are getting the chest pains, stomach cramps, skin problems. An ECG with a thyroid scan is also important. Carbimazole with propranolol (beta blockers) to reduce the pulse rate and close monitoring of bloods is the management. I hope this helps. Get these done as soon as possible.

When I arrived home I took a hot bath and got out of the tub and had a rash on my stomach , sides, under my arms, and on my legs. I took benadryl and it seemed to diminish. Late in the night my hands became itchy and swelled up. Yesterday the rash seemd to diminish and the hands stayed swollen, but went down some. During that night my feet became itchy and red, and my hands started to itch badly also. Does this sound like an insect bite?","Doctor":"Hi there Dave. This sounds like a condition called acute urticaria to me. Yes it may very well be caused by an insect bite reaction or due to a variety of other reasons. Is there any fever, joint pain or any difficulty in breathing? It may be better for you to go across to a deramtologist or to the ER to get a  prescription for an antihistamine that works around the clock & also perhaps to be started on a short acting tapering dose of steroids. The rash should subside in a couple of days & then once the acute phase is passed, you can try to isolate what the allergen was at a later date 2 weeks after stoppage of the steroids et al .

Your symptoms and progression to difficult asthma is a story shared by many and is the natural progression of allergic rhinisinusitis to asthma. You must ensure allergies are checked either in the form of skin prick testing or specific IgE against the extended aeroallergens/inhaled panel. If specific allergies are identified, then you need to optimise the asthma control with combined inhalers (long acting beta 2 agonists + inhaled steroids) like Symbicort or Seretide and continue on MontekLC. Immunotherapy against the inhaled allergens is currently the most effective way of preventing allergic progression and occasionally combined with anti-IgE therapy (Omalizumab). The anti-IgE therapy is quite expensive and would depend where you are now or how easily you can get or afford it. This must be given by physicians experienced with anti-IgE therapy. I hope this helps. Best Wishes."},{"Patient":"Hi, My sister shifted to Mumbai 7-8 months back after marriage. But in this time span, she is constantly suffering from sneezing or nosache.

Regards, Varun","Doctor":"Hello Varun, Sorry to note your sister's symptoms. Dust allergy has become a major problem with the growing urbanisation, changes in housing with little natural light or air and reliance on A/C units that increases the humidity. Allergy testing is highly recommended to know the extent of her allergies, whether it is house dust mite, or mixed with animal dander, moulds, fungal spores, grass pollens etc. There are various private labs in Mumbai that offer blood test (would recommend specific IgE test rather than others) such as Metropolis etc and these need to be reviewed by an experienced Chest physician with interest in Allergy or an Allergist. Long acting antihistamines such as allegra 180 oce daily, nasonex nasal spray 2 sprays/nostril for 3 months is recommended. The tests will guide duration and seasonal therapy. I hope this helps.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Once you are diagnosed with an appendicitis, the ideal treatment should have been a surgery for confirmation of diagnosis and a cure. However, in modern medicines, strong antibiotics available in the market not unusually control the infection of the appendix and the patient might be relieved of his symptoms. Moreover, I would also advise an abdominal ultrasound mostly in female patients to rule out any pelvic pathology on the right side.

I am from india, Aged 24. Thank you","Doctor":"Hello and welcome. Thank you for your query. The food you have mentioned could very well be the allergen (cause of the allergic reaction). Sea food is a very common allergen, so is oil, which you would have fried your cutlets in. I would request you to notice anything different that you have consumed, may be a new brand of oil, or different source of meat, and if this food was consumed from an eatery outside, I would advice you to avoid the particular joint in the future. The description of your rash, does match that of an allergic rash, but there are many more rashes that do still match your current presentation as well. I would advice you to visit any physician, and show him the rash, as a rash has to almost always be inspected by a physician or dermatologist before prescribing treatment. I am from India too, and as we have the privilege of having many clinics, in almost every nook and corner of our Indian streets, consulting any one of these doctors should help you, as they can help give you immediate relief from your problem. If it is an allergic reaction, a shot of an anti-histamine (anti-allergic) medicine, should give you relief in 15 minutes maximum. I hope this has helped you to find the right treatment option.

Beside keeping warm and avoiding cold beverages you have to see a Chest Physician and a detail examination with proper history . Then a Pulmonary Function test with effect of bronchodialator will confirm the diagnosis and quick relief medicine may be given in inhalation form. Allergic status can be checked with serum IgE level an allergy testing. If you take anti allergic and bronchodialator and if required steroid in inhalation or oral form will help you a lot antibiotic if required.

This will help identify what the allergens are and take avoidance measures to lower further exposure. Montek LC is a combination of levocetirizine and montelukast; levocet being an antihistamine and montelukast being a leukotriene inhibitor that works well for the airways. He will also need a lung function test with reversibility studies to see if he has developed asthma or is in the early stages. Only then the recommendation of bronchodilators as inhalers can be made. Asthalin is a short acting bronchodilator that he can use whenever he feels short of breath but it is important that he keeps a note of the number of times and puffs he has used to let the chest physician know when the lung function report is in front of him. Long term use of both the medications has little side effects so it is fine to continue provided there is a reason to continue this.

I showed no reaction to any of the environmental allergens tested for, but to help me out she gave me a small cup full of liquid prednisone , an Allegra tablet and some nasal spray (she said earlier would not aggravate my existing benign heart irregular beat I get from time to time.) That was at noon today. Then tonight at 5pm I started suddenly getting an increased heart rate along with bad irregular beats (PVCs I believe from past experience). Three hours later I am still getting them. Can these be a result of the prednisone the allergist gave me? I told her I had a history of benign irregular heart beats and couldn t take any nasal sprays that had a decongestant effect because of my heart. That is why I m surprised she gave me prednisone which I just read online can cause palpitations and rapid beat. Do you think the one dose of prednisone caused this fast beat and irregular heart beats and, if so, will it subside soon or by morning? Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello, There is in fact very little evidence to suggest prednisolone can set off premature ventricular contractions; but certainly can set off palpitations if the dose was higher than required. Some patients with adrenal insufficiency who require steroids for life also feel the same once they start and novice patients will feel more of the effect. You have not mentioned the dose you had, or whether you took it on an empty stomach or without PPI cover. Gastritis is a problem when taken on an empty stomach, and that set off palpitations. It should subside within 24 hours, but if you still feel unwell, I would suggest you get seen by a physician as soon as possible for an ECG and a thorough evaluation.

I normally use it for two or three days and then discontinue use for a month or two. I have seen an alergy specialist who recommends immunising him.

If he has asthma, he will need optimal management for that to prevent a worsening of the allergies. Constant rhinitis leads to asthma in the long run, so you must remember that. His medical treatment for now should include: cetirizine syrup 5ml twice daily, olopatadine eye drops, nasonex nasal spray 1 spray / nostril once daily with addition of montelukast 4mg at night if required.

Although it is well known that eosinophil counts go up in asthma, allergies, parasitic infections; I am sure these have been checked and are not relevant here. You have not mentioned the absolute count or percentage but raised levels in patients with renal failure is mainly due to a vascular cause. If there is any skin rash, vasculitis is likely. If there are eosinophils in the urine, then the diagnosis is interstitial nephritis. Drug induced eosinophilia like interferon use should be considered if this drug was used, or for that matter blood pressure lowering agents such as ACE-I like enalapril, captopril, trandolapril cause chronic dry cough with raised eosinophil counts. A thorough review of the causes is required that should be addressed by your renal physician (nephrologist). I hope that was useful.

A detailed liver function test (LFT) would have helped to secure this diagnosis if the alkaline phosphatase was also raised. But as you mentioned no obvious jaundice, it is important to know that the other LFT parameters such as the enzymes are normal. An ultrasound liver/GB is important at this stage.

The condition that you describe is consistent with urticaria, and very itchy red hives that fade away but reappear within a few hours. Some attacks on the skin are raised and known as angioedema due to the chemical called histamine released from mast cells. These cells are present in the lips, tongue, skin, chest, gut etc and therefore wherever histamine gets released, you get the specific organ related symptoms. Another condition called urticarial vasculitis definitely needs to be excluded and moreso when there is no response to antihistamines. 80% of people with urticaria do not have any allergies which is the case with you. Long-acting non-sedating antihistamines like fexofenadine 180mg once daily plus/minus cetirizine 10mg at lunchtime/evening is required for 3 months. Occasionally the treatment may need to be longer if there is a recurrence. Tests such as CBC, LFTs, renal profile, TSH TPOabs are standard investigations to exclude a secondary cause. Most people go into remission so do not worry. Thanks."},{"Patient":"my daugter is ten years old and I will say she has never seemed to be a well child.

Thanks Paul","Doctor":"Hello, You seem to have had a delayed allergic reaction (referred to as Type IV hypersensitivity) to a chemical in the hair dye. The antihistamines you are taking is a bit weak for this sort of reaction, therefore would recommend allegra (fexofenadine) and eumovate for the face but avoid prolonged use on the face. Ensure you get seen by a doctor before getting this cream (eumovate) as a prescription. A patch test is recommended to find out what you are allergic to for avoidance advice."},{"Patient":"I am suffering from allergic coughing and sneezing . My doctor prescribed me Clamist and sensival.

Even the drugs prescribed were not effective against sneezing. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for your query. Your words suggest you are having allergic rhinitis. Use Azelastine+fluticasone nasal spray twice daily along with montelukast+levocetrizine tablet once daily. It will relieve your symptoms. Allergic rhinitis is often associated with asthma.

You are either prone for recurrent sore throat, tonsillitis etc that causes the lymph nodes to swell up. Rhinosinusitis (bacterial) can be very troublesome and difficult to treat, and a CT scan is the best modality of investigation in this setting. Penicillin can decrease lymph node swelling in infections, but not recommended for sinusitis or for hair loss. If recurrent lymph node enlargement and hair loss is a feature, suggest you get the following tests done and seen by a physician or Rheumatologist if any of them are abnormal: CBC, fasting glucose and lipid profile, LFTs, creatinine, ANA, TSH (thyroid profile).

Was this after a drug you had taken? If so, you must ensure there are no other rashes elsewhere in the body and no oral ulcers as this is a serious adverse drug reaction and you need to stop all medications if you are unsure what caused it. If this was a random event, then take antihistamines for a period of 7 days (cetirizine or loratidine) even though the swelling has largely gone. Continue to apply the lip balm and the colour of the lips will return. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi, So I have no food allergies . 2 days ago I ate seafood jambalaya and did not feel anything. yesterday i had crabs for lunch and did not feel anything again. For dinner though I has shrimps and 2 eggs . I suddenly felt itchy and later on had allergies. I took Celestamine and i felt sleepy and fainted. I couldn t hear and I lost my vision for minutes. Back in high school I had sudden allergic reaction to egg too, but I m not allergic to eggs. Now a college student by the way.","Doctor":"Hello Game, So you had a moderate to severe allergic reaction and even though you mention at the start you have no food allergies - which usually means 'never' - you say you had egg allergy. You definitely need skin prick test against the common food panel - peanut, cashewnut (if you had a reaction), fish (sardine/cod), shrimp, crab, lobster and aeroallergen such as house dust mite. Or a specific IgE blood test against the above to understand why you reacted. You can get over egg allergy (at least 75%-80% do by age 5 years), but you retain the susceptibility of 'food allergy' only to become allergic to a specific food later. You must keep an anaphylaxis kit with cetirizine , epipen, steroids and dial the emergency number if you get in trouble again. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi, I was 4 weeks pregnant and had a miscarriage and now I have a rash on my legs and torso. I miscarried about 2 weeks ago and I m itching all over now. I had a miscarriage 2 years ago also and I remember having a similar reaction afterwords. Is this because of he pregnancy? How do I stop it? And can this mean that I will not be able to have a normal pregnancy? I had 2 cysts in my ovaries when I was 15 and my period has never been normal. I think I have PCOS .","Doctor":"Hello, PCOS is easily diagnosed and am sure your obstetrician would have told you by now considering the many scans you had over the years when you were pregnant. The cyst size is important as well as the numbers of cysts. Knowing pregnancy within 4 weeks is very early and not sure how you confirmed it, by the urine spot card method or by a blood test. People with urticaria can occasionally get a flare up when pregnant in the early stages of pregnancy and is also important that you get liver function tests to ensure the bilrubin levels are normal. There is yet another important test known as the antiphospholipid antibody test, ANA - that if positive will give you the reason why you are having these early spontaneous miscarriages. Suggest you take long-acting non-sedating antihistamines like fexofenadine 180mg or cetirizine 10mg twice daily for a month and see the response. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I m allergic to bleach.

My cough is horrible and I ve been spitting up the green phlegm after constant cough attacks. What should I take to stop this horrid coughing and phlegm?","Doctor":"Hello, You are having hyperreactive airways and may indicate you have underlying asthma. However, bleach releases chlorine that is a respiratory irritant and it does not necessarily mean you have asthma. If you do not cough most of the time and feel breathless when exposed to other types of smoke, dust you do not need a lung function test. A Chest X Ray is important to know that you do not have any lung patches or shadows and the source of the green phlegm. Sputum c/s is a must before starting any antibiotics. A combination of antihistamine and montelukast (Singulair) with (as per sputum c/s report) +/-azithromycin 250mg twice daily for 5 days. Avoid using cough syrups. Thanks."},{"Patient":"As of tomorrow evening it will have been an entire week that i have had hives and swelling. It started last thursday, about two to three hrs after eatining various fish fry samples and two different samples of soup that I later found out had crayfish and lobster pieces in it. By friday evening (the next night) it had gotten worse (even though I took loratidine and a few doses of hydroxyzine ). I should note that Ive never had a seafood allergy so I didn t think anything of associating eating it with the problem. However I had started dicyclomine for a different issue 3 days prior to the onset of symptoms, which I discontinued immediately assuming it was the source of reaction... So that friday at dinner I didn t think it would be a big deal to eat steak and 3 shrimp. Within 2-3 i hrs my lips/face swelled up significantly. Took more hydroxyzine, the face swelling went down a bit by morning, but throughout that day, saturday, my hands and feet swelled up before my eyes to the point that making a fist hurt and became impossible, and when walking the bottoms of my feet hurt like I had bruises. That evening I switched to benadryl , added zantac , and began zyrtec instead of loratadine the next morning. Finally on Sunday went to urgent care as swelling/hives/itching was intolerable. Was prescribed 5 days of 60 mg of prednisone and advised to continue antihistamine regiment, and given a epipen rx to keep on hand if breathing became difficult. Tomorrow will be 5th day on prednisone but still wake up with hives, severe itching and mild swelling. I almost used the epipen on Monday because I thought my chest was tight but after taking my dose of prednisone it eventually subsided. What do I do? Prednisone helps but relief is mild and seems to be short lived, lasting a few hrs to 12 hrs max. I can t take it anymore. Why would I still have reaction if it was the seafood? I have never had food allergy, only hives and mild swelling when taking various antibiotics. I did have a retreatment of a root canal by an endodontist on a molar the friday afternoon prior to the reaction (almost an entire week went by with no hives, just mild swelling on cheek near tooth). Sorry for so many details but I need help! Am I going to end up needing longer prednisone therapy? Why hasn t it helped more by now? Is that typical? Any advice on what to do and expect? I am a 27 yr old female, and am allergic to at least 10 antibiotics. Lastly, am in anatomy and have been working with a human cadaver and dissecting cats twice a week for several weeks, and earlierly on the day this all started I dissected a cow eye, but wore latex free gloves of course. I can t pinpoint the source so maybe I m still being exposed? Im clearly going to have to go back to the doctor but I d like to know what to expect... Thanks in advance!","Doctor":"Hello, You are clearly in distress with the acute generalised urticaria and angioedema episode and not helped by the fact that even prednisolone is taking its time. It is unlikely seafood allergy as the reaction does not proceed for so long even though all of us think of an event as the trigger. Most allergists though would like to ensure you have a blood test against the food panel that you had on the day and of course, shrimp crab lobster etc by a specific IgE blood test. Skin testing would be required at a later stage (if blood tests are negative) and you are off all antihistamines for 2 weeks. Saying that, I think all of them will be negative (i.e., no allergy) and at the same time you ought to get a blood test for CBC, LFT, creatinine, Mast cell tryptase, IgE, TSH TPO antibodies as the 'urticaria' may have an autoimmune component. Prednisolone is reserved for the end if antihistamines do not work, but ultimately all will work once this acute phase is over. If you have required 30-40mg for more than 10 days, it is best you slowly taper it down and stop at 6 weeks. By then, fexofenadine 180mg and hydroxyzine 25mg at night only would have started to work. 20% do not respond to several antihistamines, and would need steroid sparing agents that must be discussed in detail with your doctor. Thanks."},{"Patient":"HI Doctor , I have always been getting allergy (Body Rashes ) after using Dependal Tablet for Loose motion, i always kill allergy with Avil Tablet.

It may even end up seriously.  Be careful.   Taking a drug to cause allergy and then taking another drug to treat allergy is bad approach - it is simply inviting more trouble See a Gastro-enterologist and get investigated for loose stools..

Are there any other symptoms such as irritability, vomiting, diarrhea, red rash on face when fed with milk? If none of the above happens, milk allergy is very unlikely. She definitely needs to have allergy tests done before you switch her to another milk preparation and allergy tests to other foods/aeroallergens to ensure we are not missing anything obvious. Please ensure her immunisations are up to date. Cough and colds at this age especially if she is going to the nursery is common as viral outbreaks occur at times of season change. Please also ensure she is seen by a paediatrician to ensure she is not having bronchial hyperrectivity or an asthma like episode when she gets the cough. Asthalin syrup will prove to be very useful in that situation. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hello, I am constantly itchy. I have a tickle on the roof of my mouth, my inner ear itches and my anal area can be downright unbearable! I occasionally have itchy skin, watery/itchy eyes and a cough that doesn t seem to go away. My biggest annoyance is the anal itching. Bit isn t everyday at every moment, but when it occurs it is rough! I always had it to a degree, but it increased when I got pregnant. It tends to be more prominent at night and near my period. I have told my doctor about and have been checked for parasites just in case. I think I must be allergic to something. Could it be wheat?","Doctor":"Hello, If 3 stool samples for parasites have been negative, it is then quite unlikely. There are other surrogate markers on blood tests to check for allergies like eosinophilia on blood count or IgE levels (raised). Allergies to house dust mite, animal dander (if you have pets), grass pollens, weed pollens (in asthmatics) must be definitely checked either in the form of skin prick testing or blood test (specific IgE test). A specific IgE to wheat can also be checked although very unlkely. Do you get these symptoms after eating wheat products everytime? If no, then allergy to wheat is very unlikely. Eczema and dry skin can make the skin itchy so keep it well hydrated and use moisturisers. Long acting antihistamines will help and avoidance measures once the allergies are identified. I hope that was useful.

If an extensive allergy panel was not done, it would be helpful to ensure you do not have mould allergy or a condition called allergic fungal sinusitis that can be difficult to treat. Post nasal drip does occur in non-allergic rhinitis and causes the dry irritating cough so nasal corticosteroids long term use offers the best solution. Try and avoid very strong perfumes, or chilli that aggravates the rhinitis. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I am having sharp stomach?

It was over a year before I was able to get everything under control. It s been 7 months since my last battle with bronchitis and I am in bed with it again. I was around a tractor that was pushing a lot of dust around and exhaust from a jeep. I was struggling to breathe. Within a few days, I was sick.

It scares my child so much every time I get sick because of how ill I have been the last couple of years. Please tell me anything you think I can do to prevent me from getting bronchitis. Thank you so much!","Doctor":"Hello, If the lung function test was suggestive of asthma and hopefully you had skin tests to find the environmental triggers, the most important thing would be to get your asthma under control. Combination inhalers will be the choice such as Symbicort turbohaler if budesonide 400 has not helped. You must keep asthalin (or the blue salbutamol) inhaler with you at all times and take 4-6 puffs as required but maximum 10 puffs at one go. Montelukast 10mg addition at night will also significantly help. You also need to know the current status of your immune system with IgG, IgA and IgM levels and functional antibodies against Hib, pneumococcus and tetanus if available. These tests if normal exclude an antibody deficiency, as these control recurrent chest infections (bronchitis). You will also need a yearly influenza jab due to your asthma. Hope that helps.

Long-acting non-sedating antihistamines like fexofenadine taken once daily along with cetirizine or atarax (very sedative) over 4-6 weeks help.

I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"hello, i have been suffering for upper left stomach pain for seveeral months now, i have had blood tests, stool tests, and a endoscopy, they found a stomach ulcer, and i am on 30mg lansoprazole a day, these tablets dont seem to be doing anything ,ánd possibly making it worse, do you have any advice for me","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query and an elucidate history.You have got a pain in the upper left abdomen and can be due to many other factors too as follows::- Stomach ulcer has already been diagnosed and you are already treatment with Lansoprazole , but not helping.-Left colon inflammation,-spleen enlargement-Tail of Pancreas having inflammation or tumor.-Left kidney fullness or stoneI would advise the following:-CT scan of the abdomen-Colonoscopy-Physical examination and clinical evaluation bya Gastroenterologist , preferably a Surgical one.Once the proper diagnosis is done treatment will be fruitful:Continue LansoprazoleAdd RanitidineDomperidoneantacid gel 3 hourlySoft bland dietTreatment of the stress and anxietyIn this way your proper diagnosis and treatment with cure is possible.

During the game I started to become light-headed and had lots of trouble breathing . I probably over-exerted myself. My lungs began to ache and still are aching, an hour after the exercise. My lower back also hurts and I have a headache . What is going on?","Doctor":"Hi, You told you had asthma. Was it diagnosed by a physician and what are the medications you are taking? You also did not mention about your age. There is a different entity called as exercise induced asthma which starts 10-20 minutes after completing exercise and persists 30-45 minutes. It is more common in dry, cold weathers and while running. On all other occasional, patient do not has any other symptoms. If your symptoms were consistent with this, then you should  take metered dose inhaler Asthalin 2 puffs before starting exercise atleast 15 minutes ago. But if you have asthma also apart from the time you are exercising, then you should use formoterol-budesonide MDI 2puffs twice daily BD through spacer along with montelukast-levocetrizine for two weeks followed by levocetrizine once daily. For your current problem, please take MDI asthalin 4 times daily. Go to a pulmonologist and consult. Hope, I satisfied your queries."},{"Patient":"I have been having trouble with my asthma/ chronic bronchitis . I have been to the ER 2 times in 4 days. Lots of things have been done and one of the treatments is nebulizer treatments. Albuterol/Atropine every 4 hrs. I have the jitters from these. I am not sleeping because I keep jumping and waking myself up. I have had massive doses of Solumedrol , been on Azrythromyicin, now doxcycline, and prednizone. I can t be without the med nebs almost cant even make it to the 4 hr mark. But these jitters are driving me crazy!! I even took 4 Nitetime sleep aides trying to get some sleep. What do you suggest? I am getting worn out.","Doctor":"Asthma has to be controlled with steroids. You will have to take oral or injectable steroids till the severe symptoms are controlled along with nebulization with asthalin/albuterol. Atropine inhalation should be avoided as it may dry up the air passage and cause restlessness. As the symptoms are controlled, you will have to switch over to inhalers like foracort or seretide accuhaler."},{"Patient":"sir, i have a allergy problem from last 6 years with dust and cold things and pollution also, what precaution should I take and can I take antiallergitic tables for a whole life names levotiz -m containning salt montelukast sodium and levocetrizine dihydrochloride tablests, this tables relief me from cough and breath problem plz guide me sir, what I should do for my health fit","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for query. You told you have allergy to dust and cold things and pollution. You did not mention what were the symptoms you were suffering from. Did you have recurrent cough, cold sneezing, cough, rhinorrhoea? You may use Tablet montelukast-levocetrizine for two weeks followed by levocetrizine tablet once daily . You may also get benefit from fluticasone- azelastine nasal spray one puff twice daily. As you told, you got releif after using levosiz tab so you may use it for two weeks followed by levocetrizine once daily. You should also undergo pulmonary function test. Allergic rhinitis is associated with asthma in a significant percentage of patients.You should always rule out possibility of asthma in presence of above mentioned symptoms. Please consult a pulmonologist."},{"Patient":"My sister (21) just suffered from cardiac arrest about 3 hours ago; she is an asthmatic and was experiencing difficulties breathing . She was taken to the ER and that is when her heart stopped. The doctors said they performed CPR for about 5-10 mins before the heart began beating again. She is now in ICU on a ventilator and being sedated. The doctor stated that there is a possibility of brain damage and I m scared. What extent of damages should be expected? Was 5-10 mins too long of a time period?","Doctor":"Thanks for coming to Healthcare magic for your query. When there is cardiac arrest, there is cessation of blood supply to different organs in the body including brain. If the duration of cardiac arrest is sufficiently prolonged (>20 mins)- there is very high chance of brain injury. For shorter duration of cardiac arrest, outcome is difficult to predict. From the description given, she had cardiac arrest in ER (and thankfully not on the way to hospital). In-hospital cardiac arrest has better outcome than out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, as prompt treatment was given. In your sister's case - the next step over next 48-72 hours will be try and get her off the ventilator and sedation and assess her brain function. Your doctor may ask for a MRI Brain/EEG to get some idea about any neurological damage. I hope I've able to answer most of your queries. Wish your sister good luck for complete recovery.

Allergies and allergic asthma - has this been proven in your case? A total IgE is helpful in this setting to know if you are atopic and that the eosinophilia actually is allergic. 2. Discussion with a Haematologist to ensure you dont require a bone marrow 3. Parasite infections Filariae, worms (helminths) etc with stool c/s x 3; filarial antigen test etc 4.

However, you must remember that a one-off course of antibiotics may not do any harm but if you need antibiotics again, do consult your doctor to see if this is really required. Allergies can feel like a constant flu infection, and testing is recommended. You may already have had tests but skin prick testing or specific IgE blood test for house dust mite, animal dander, molds (alternaria, aspergillus, cladosporium etc) can be difficult to avoid and treat unless you know that these are also problems. Rhinosinusitis or just rhinitis resolves on long acting antihistamines and nasal steroid spray like nasonex taken for 6-8weeks.

However, if your skin appears completely normal, then you will need several tests in order to ensure there is no specific organ related pathology. Some of the tests include liver function tests with gammaGT, liver autoantibodies with ANA if LFTs inlcuding alk phos very abnormal (and raised bilirubin); thyroid function tests. Typhoid and a viral hepatitis can very rarely co-exist or happen so it is important that viral heptitides are excluded.

If you are hyperventilating, or having a panic attack this will change the electrolytes in your blood and make your fingers and legs numb. However, a flu-like illness and legs numb could also mean you are having sensory neuropathy (nerve disturbance affecting sensation) and is a sign of an inflammation of the blood vessels and referred to as vasculitis. CBC, LFT, Urea creatinine, urine dipstick, CXR, autoantibody profile are mandatory tests if this diagnosis is considered and your doctor will be best placed (after a physical examination) to ensure whether or not the tests are required.

Doctor has advised budecort inhaler 100 mcg (pink coloured) to be given twice 1 day for 6 months and montair granules 4mg (oral) once in a day for 2.5 months. Also, doctor has advised nebulisation with budecort / duolin / budesal / asthalin repsules whenever she feels uneasy / breathe fast. I would like to know what are the side effects of all these steriod being taken by my daugther at so early age? What are the other options available? We are really worried? Please advise. Thanks","Doctor":"Hello Inhalational steroid has minimal systemic side effects because it mainly acts locally. You have mentioned that your doctor has advised nebulisation with budecort, duolin, budesal and asthalin. Budecort contains budesonide and budesal contains both budecort and salbutamol, while duolin contains salbutamol and ipratropium and asthalin contains salbutamol. During acute exacerbation only salbutamol inhalation is prescribed. Some physician also uses ipratropium and budesonide during acute attack. But using all these four drugs at a time is not justified. According to guidelines there is no substitute of steroid if asthma is diagnosed. You need not to worry as side effects are minimal. Wash her mouth each time after use of steroid inhalation as this decreases the side effects further. Consult your doctor to be clear about the drug used during acute attack.

Infection or inflammation in the body provided this was repeated at some stage. Just one high value does not mean much as it could be a transit problem with the sample. With your fast pulse rate, either you are having some sort of infection or because you have anaemia and iron-deficiency anaemia is quite common.

Autoimmune urticaria (thyroid problems or otherwise) is now a major form of this condition and therefore you need tests such as CBC, ESR, LFT, TSH fT4 fT3, TPO antibodies, ANA and must be on long acting antihistamines such as Fexofenadine or cetirizine for 6 weeks (minimum) or 3 months if still getting eruptions more than 2 times per week to control this condition. 80% of sufferers do NOT have allergy, so allergy testing is usually unhelpful.

One thing to note is that I am a non-strict vegetarian. I have never switched to a heavy meat diet for experimentation due to price and the amount of fats in meat itself. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello, A restricted food diet is never a good idea as you keep taking things out of the diet and will find it difficult to re-introduce. Food allergies worsening ezcema are not very common while some observational studies report eggs, milk, shrimp to worsen eczema in children. Other studies have suggested an association with wheat. Therefore it is always best to get a skin test (when you are NOT on antihistamines) as specific IgE blood test for eczema may sometimes give false positive results if the total IgE is high (>1000), confusing the picture. If you definitely have any food allergies, it is worth mentioning to your allergist before the test is done. Eczema can flare due to house dust mite or animal allergens so it is important these are also checked at the same time. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have not felt well for almost 3 weeks now.

A /Q scan is a better test to pick up lung clots and suggest you immediately get a consult if you continue to feel unwell.

Aerocort rotacaps contain levosalbutamol along with beclomethasone. As you are having frequent nocturnal symptoms you are probably having uncontrolled asthma. I will advocate you to use Foracort inhaler(200) twice daily through spacer along with duolin inhaler when required. Asthma probably can't be cured but it can definitely be kept under control. You can also take montelukast- levocetrizine combination tablet once daily for 2 weeks followed by levocetrizine once daily. There are only few side effects of long term inhalational steroids. These were oral candidiasis and hoarseness of voice. Always wash your mouth and gargle after having each inhalation. other long term side effects such as osteoporosis, glucose intolerance,hypertension do not occur with the dose of MDI you are taking.It is always more important to keep asthma under control rather than worrying about the side effects of the medications.You may also use a diary to note down the symptoms you are having to assess the control status. Help of a peak flow meter can also be taken to objectively assess asthma control. Don't get worried. Asthma can be kept under control if you use the above mentioned medicines at correct doses regularly.Hope, I satisfied your queries. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have acid reflux and a heital hernia .

I take an allergy pill and use a nose spray at night. There have been some times lately that I have acid reflux also. What can I do to alleviate the chest pain and get rid of the mucus. I also use a neti pot every other day.","Doctor":"Hello Colleen, It is likely that you are suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis with post nasal drip (i.e., the mucus buidup in your throat) that causes cough at most times and a continuous sensation of 'needing to clear' the throat. Allergy testing must be done to exclude aeroallergen sensitivity such as house dust mite, mold allergens, animal dander etc by skin prick or specific IgE blood test. Gastroesophageal reflux disease does not help with the allergies, causing more throat problems and heart burn. You definitely need an upper GI endoscopy if this is going on for some time. Please STOP smoking if you do. Chest X Ray, paransal sinus CT will be helpful in knowing the extent of disease. Long acting antihistamines and nasal sprays are required for long duration than only a few weeks. If the allergens are found and the rest of the investigations are normal, oral or s/c immunotherapy will help and that is the long term solution.

You may also take influenza vaccine as you gave history of frequent cough and colds. You did not mention which medicines are your taking for your hypertension. If ,you are taking betablockers, it may worsen your asthma control. Asthma can not be cured but it can definitely be kept under control if you take above prescribed inhalers daily.Hope, i answered your queries. Thanking You."},{"Patient":"i have irritable bowel syndrome for many years. If I am in a place like XXXXX and eat beef, ham, burgers, sausages, cheese etc. my stool formation is solid and I have no irritable bowel syndrome. The moment I come agack to XXXX and start having XXXXX food I get irritable bowel syndrome again. Pls give me the address and contact number of a food allergy test center in XXXX","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for your query First of all you must know that irritable bowel syndrome is not an allergic disorder. Life style modification is the main treatment of it. Certain foods, such as cruciferous vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, brussels sprouts) and legumes (beans) may worsen bloating and gassiness. Dietary fiber may lessen symptoms. Individuals with IBS should drink plenty of water, and avoid soda, which may cause gas and abdominal discomfort. Eating smaller meals may lessen the incidence of cramping and diarrhea. Low fat and high carbohydrate meals such as pasta, rice, and whole grain breads may help IBS symptoms (unless the affected individual has celiac disease). Stress may cause IBS \\"flares.\\" Doctors may offer specific advice on reducing stress. Regularly eating balanced meals and exercising may help reduce stress and problems associated with irritable bowel syndrome. Smoking may worsen symptoms of IBS, which gives smokers another good reason to quit. Among medicines you may take colospa retard tablet 200 mg twice daily. Even then if you need food allergy test then i will suggest u to go to rittwik allergy centre near moulali charch in central calcutta for allergy testing. Thank you."},{"Patient":"About 10 days ago I went to the doctor because I was itching all over my body and developing a rash; they prescribed some anti-histamines. I still wake up with a rash and have just started getting itchy hands and feet at random times, sometimes with white bumps on my wrists. I also have smelly urine . What do you think I should do?","Doctor":"Hello, Your urticaria may have been triggered by an urinary tract infection, but if the symptoms of smelly urine has happened after the urticarial eruption it is generally due to either long acting antihistamines or steroids (occasionally given for bad urticaria) that tends to concentrate urine. Have plenty of water, get a urine dipstick or c/s studies and if there is evidence of an UTI, get antibiotics but continue the antihistamines until 4 weeks or at least a week after the infection has cleared as well as the itchy rash. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Dear Sir, I am suffering from tonsil problem after every season change, morning sneezing , redness in eyes and my family doctor used to give me Mox-500 mg and some other medicine but yesterday night i was suffering from the same issue but i had some problem with breathing and some noise also came from neck i am very afraid kindly help me","Doctor":"Hello Dear Thanks for your query. Did you have such attacks before ? You are having attack of bronchoconstriction. Are you having fever too? May be you are having bronchitis.You will need antibiotics as well as bronchodilator to relieve you from the respiratory distress if its so. Take CoAmoxiclav 625mg thrice daily for five days. If there is no fever and only respiratory distress then may be it is due to allergic reaction and no need to take antibiotics in that case. Take 2 puffs of Salbutamol inhalation during acute attack. If the breathing problem persists and continues for days then it is better to shift to salmeterol fluticasone combination inhalation twice daily. For the allergic reactions you mentioned you can take levocetrizine 5 mg twice daily. Get a clinical checkup from your doctor and dont take medicines without his prescription. Hope this helps. Take care."},{"Patient":"my daughter has small red bumps which I thought might be flea bites. She has several on her legs in different spots.

She has had lots of allergy type things in the past YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hello, Insect bites such as mosquito bites would be likely if you live in the area where mosquito bites are common and as children's skin is delicate, they appear as red small bumps. An antihistamine syrup and a moisturiser cream should suffice, but if picked or scratched will release the watery liquid (flitrate from capillaries). I am not sure what allergies she has (as you have not mentioned) but the above treatment should be enough.

I also get very sharp pains in my anus and have a very big hemorrhoid . I have lost quite a bit of weight. I was around 135 this time last year and now am just under 120. Lost most of the weight within a month which was last December or Jan. I wasn t sick or anything and was eating normal. Then steadily lost weight till august/septmber where I plateaued to just under120. It hurts when I push on my left side of stomach. My bowel movements vary but mostly I m going three times a day. Or will hit a day where I don t go at all. I find I m very thirsty sometimes(an unquenchable thirst) and get full very quickly. I have also been having heart palpitations every day. This started in September I think. I also have been getting quick intense sharp pains in lower abdomen. They don t happen as often though. Also had this cirrhosis like rash on neck that has mostly gone away except for these two small raised red bumps. Think it was an allergic reaction to several mosquito bites. I m also very sensitive to smells. I am on tricyclen lo birth control and have been having my period regularly and not so irregular( was still getting period every month bug would be few days late sometimes. Would be nice to know what is going on. I should also mention that sometimes I would get nauseous for no apparent reason and would vomit several times in the night. Other times I would wake a up and be nauseous and very sweaty and warm and feel the need to defecate.

It is likely that all are unrelated apart from the rashes on the neck and red raised bumps that is likely to be urticaria. You may have fibromyalgia but it is important that you exclude other medical causes before coming to that diagnosis. Blood tests such as CBC, ESR, Liver profile, ANA, lipid profile, fasting sugar, TPO antibodies, thyroid profile would be a start. U/S abdomen for your pains + UGI endoscopy to exclude GERD.

He may also be suffering from allergy/asthma. He should undergo a PFT test to know the severity of COPD. He must stop smoking as this is the most important part of the treatment.

Unless you are examined, it is difficult to exclude a fungal infection for which topical antifungals will work. For the dry and itchy skin, you can apply 0.1% hydrocortisone cream twice daily for a week and stop. Do not apply more than a week. If after 2-3 days, it is no better, a combined cream will help.

This is called tachyphylaxis, meaning you develop tolerance to the chemical quickly and get the worse symptoms. Antihistamines, nasal sprays for 2 weeks would be worthwhile (antihistamine nasal spray like azelastine or combined with a steroid for 6 weeks).

A CT Paranasal sinuses will help in determining the extent of the sinus problem. Nasal steroid sprays with the correct technique (use) will help along with long acting antihistamines.

The condition is urticaria, that does get difficult to manage with allegra/zyrtec if you are stressed as well. If these hives are definitely after eatinh wheat products, then a blood test while on normal diet for IgA-TTG can help to decide if you have coeliac disease. If the test is positive, then yes, gluten-free diet is the treatment Otherwise, you have to persevere with the antihistamines for 4-6 weeks and eventually they will stop.

Most of the time it is just a discomfort, but when its bad I get physically sick, the pain shoots down my cervix, into my legs and behind.

I have done some research of my own and came to the conclusion that it is endometriosis, but every doctor brushes it off. I'm at a loss of what to do. I hate being in so much pain, and being tired all the time. When it gets bad, I can't even get out of bed. So I generally will camp out in the bathroom in case I have to throw up.

Therefore a trial of beta 2 agonists is given, something like Ventorlin and combined with oral montelukast 4mg. A natural solution is possible as he grows and may outgrow the asthma, but he definitely requires allergy testing to find out what the allergies are. At this age, it is common to have food allergies, that changes to pet dander or dust mite allergies as he grows older but it will at least tell you what to avoid and when to avoid.

He has gotten an endolscopy and colonoscopy . They did a biopsy and confirmed he was lactose intolerant. I have took him to an allergist I ve taking anything lactose away from him and he still getting the diarrhea. I feel hope less","Doctor":"Hello Kersy, Sorry to note that you feel helpless with your current situation. Chronic diarrhoea in a three year old can have several reasons: 1. Depending on the geographical location, coeliac disease (immne reaction against wheat proteins) definitely must be excluded. Blood tests such as IgA-TTG and IgA-endomysium are available, and duodenal biopsy is the final test if serological tests are inconclusive. I am not sure why a diagnosis of lactose intolerance was made with the biopsy as it is NOT possible to say, this needs to be discussed with your doctor. 2. Lactose intolerance is far commoner than coeliac disease, and complete avoidance usually leads to normalisation of GI system, unless he has a concominant wheat intolerance as well. 3. Irritable bowel syndrome can happen in kids, although toddler's diarrhoea at this age is also a possibility that settles on its own as he grows up. 4. Infection-related diarrhoea needs to be excluded, or whether he is antibody deficient (such as IgA deficiency, or hypogammaglobulianemic [all 3 Ig isotypes low] which can be diagnosed with a simple blood test.

Is a surgery recommended to remove the sebaceous bag once and for all.","Doctor":"Hello, If this is occuring in the armpits and groins recurrently and always painful, you may be suffering from hiadrenitis suppurativa. It is a condition that affects apocrine sweat glands, that can cause chronic scarring and pus formation. Several treatment options are available including surgical resection. Tight cloting, obesity exacerbate the condition, and humid climate conditions do not help. Combination of rifampicin and clindamycin helps in most cases, and 2nd line drugs include Vit A agents like roaccutane. Hope that helps. Thanks."},{"Patient":"hi my name is AAAAAAA ive been coughing none stop for the past 3 days my throat itches, i feel like i cant breathe, my head and chest hurt. it could just be allergies but its never been this bad before. is there anything i can take to get better soon that is pregnant friendly (im not sure if im pregnant yet)?","Doctor":"Hello dear Thanks for your query Did you have such episodes before? Do you have episodes of wheezing and breathing difficulty since birth? How did this episode start ? Are you having associated fever ? How long this episode of breathlessness continues? or is it whole day ? Dont neglect and get a checkup from your  doctor. You will need the lung function tests, blood investigations and chest radiograph done.Culture sensitivity test of throat swab may be needed if its respiratory tract infection. Do warm saline gurgling 4 times daily for 5 days take steam inhalation 4 times daily for a week take Vit C 500 mg tablet once daily for a week have plenty of fluids take levocetrizine 5mg twice daily for 5 days [levocetrizine is considered a pregnancy Category B medication. This means that it is probably safe for use during pregnancy, although the full risks are not currently known .] Take paracetamol500mg twice daily for 3 days and thereafter sos for breathing difficulty you may need salbutamol inhalation during acute attacks but its category C drug so proper data regarding its safety in pregnancy is not available. You may need antibiotics if you are having respiratory tract or lung infection. So go get a check up from a chest specialist.Dont self medicate. Hope this helps. Take care."},{"Patient":"i have had allergic reactions in the past in which a rash begins on my wrists and extremities and then moves up my arms and legs. It seems to show up on the more sensitive skin first and then spreads from there. Sometimes my throat begins to close up and I have to go to the hospital for a Hyrdrocortizone shot and 500MGs of Benadryl to bring it back down. This started last night, I took a bunch of benadryl last night, thought I had it under control, but it seems to be spreading again. I took all of the tests for allergys and all they could find was rag weed and other airborne allergies. I have not had this happen in 10 years. I think it is just a buildup over time, but would like your thoughts","Doctor":"Hi friend Welcome to Health Care Magic The causative agent may not be necessarily air borne - in can be ingested! Is there anything new? - pets? carpets? / or something old meddled -  air conditioner? The diagnosis and treatment are proper indeed!  It may be a question of time only. They run their own course - with time, the body develops blocking antibodies and they may disappear. If it is very troublesome and interfering with life style, a short course of oral STEROIDS may be  tried - but they have their side effects and hence the hesitancy.      Or DE-SENSITISATION may be tried – they are cumbersome, costly and not guaranteed A different anti-histamine like levo-Cetrizine may be tried. It may be combined with a leukotrine modifier like Montelukast Take care Wishing you speedy recovery God bless Good luck"},{"Patient":"Sudden itchy bump on right hand while at work. Next day woke up with another bump right next to it. Over the course of a few days, new bumps will randomly appear on my arms, neck, lower back. And today, they have appesred on my shins. They are either single bumps, or maybe two or three in a straight line. Very tiny and clear. Once one bump goes away, it seems like a new bump appears elsewhere. No changes in diet, detergents, hygiene products, ect. Although we do use wood heat, but this has never been a problem before. Took cipro for uti a month ago. Currently take one 50mg tramadol a day(since 2008). I work at a hospital and was afraid i contacted scabies . Spoke with er doctor who said it is in no way scabies, but looks like some sort of bug bite or allegy. Was prescribed lindane , but will not use it! When these bumps appear, it is very sudden. With a sting/intense itch sensation. Itching will last a few moments, then fade for a few hours to days. No bed bugs or other insects that i am aware of are present.","Doctor":"Hello, Scabies is very unlikely and the symptoms you describe are against scabies and therefore no need for lindane. This is acute urticaria and occurs due to histamine release that is occasionally triggered by nfections such as UTI, pneumonia etc and (also scabies incidentally) but the histamine continues even after the treatment for the infection is completed. The UTI may have triggered the urticaria in your case and am not sure why you need the tramadol. Opiate analgesics can worsen urticaria control, so please ensure this is not the case. Long-acting nonsedating antihistamines for 3 months is the treatment and upto twice daily is standard treatment. 80% of urticaria is non-allergic. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi. Im xxxxx. I usually have no problem eating seafood. I love seafood. But yesterday, I had a dish which contained crab claw, crab meat, shrimp, and chicken breast . My chest and around my upper rib felt as if needles were trying to stab through it. I know its the seafood that may be the reason because i eat chicken almost everyday. I wanted to know what may be the issue.","Doctor":"Hello, Seafood allergy is very different from allergy to meats (be it chicken or pork etc) therefore do NOT ignore the symptoms that you had as they can become serious the next time if you have true seafood allergy. You have not mentioned symptoms like feeling hot, tingling in the mouth or rash (itchy) other than the chest pain which could mean an asthma attack. If you have asthma, then getting to the root of the problem is more important. Skin prick testing or specific IgE blood tests can diagnose seafood allergy and blood testing is recommended as first line. If positive, you need an anaphylaxis management plan in place with antihistamines, steroids, adrenaline autoinjector etc. Thanks."},{"Patient":"hi iam thirty year old male and am suffring very badly since from last 3year s am having ecthing deases on my underpart and on stomok also i have done sevral test like-funguns and some other test but i dont no the exact medically name of that test and after that iused to take medicine s according to dr s precception ,ihad that cours for 3months!when ever i stoped taking medicine that deases arise again and again !amvery much tens what to do nowi can ttake itany more! plz help me outwith this plz some timei feel like tokillmy self plz dr its a humble request nothing is hapnig i had somuch medicine sbut all was helpless and west!i dont know what is this !is it because of smoking though am chain smoker!","Doctor":"this is due to areas where sweat collects keep areas dry no oils clean the sweat regularly take tab forcan 150 mgm once week apply candid ointment bd in affected parts keep airy loose undergarments do 3 monhs but yiou have to care for dryness and other precautions for long"},{"Patient":"I have just tried to send my query and not sure where it has gone so I am trying again.

Now after 2 months, it seems the coughing has worsened and earlier tonight while looking at her throat there are petichae on her hard/soft palate and deep red veins on her tonsils. Any idea what to to do next? Thanks","Doctor":"I guess the information regarding Petechiae and deep red veins on her tonsils has been conveyed to you by your doctor. These findings could be because of coughing itself. Chronic cough needs investigation i.e. blood tests and Chest x-ray. Based on the severity of symptoms, physical examination and these investigations, treatment can be initiated. There is incomplete information regarding what asthma treatment has been tried so far? If doctor believes she may have asthma, she may experience ups and downs with her symptoms before getting better control.

Montelukast is a good choice for the lung and for exercise induced asthma but allergy testing is required to ensure you are aware of exactly the allergens your kids are sensitized to, example house dust mite or animal dander or molds. Precaution works a long way in preveting exacerbating allergies and long acting non sedating antihistamines plus nasal corticosteroids prevent ongoing nasal inflammation and subsequent asthma.

You are suffering from sore throat and as a consequence there is cough which may have some allergic component also. In this regard i will advise you to take an antibiotic in the form of azithromycin 500 mg once daily for 6 days with vapour inhalation and gurgling with luke warm water. Give your voice rest for 2-3 days. Take a levocetrizine tablet 5 mg once daily at night for 7 days. Take plenty of water. Avoid cold. I think you will be quite ok in 4-5 days.

As it is a Sunday here ...should I start giving him the same puff... Please advise","Doctor":"Hi I do not understand the term resonating cough. Since you say he was diagnosed with asthma before, its likely that he has one such episode now. You have not mentioned any fever, which too favours asthma.

I am a 40 year old healthy male with no known diseases or allergies. I am currently visiting Langkawi for vacation and am suffering from allergic rhinitis since past couple of days. I have never encountered any allergies previously. The doctor has prescribed oral prednisolone 10 mg daily for 7 days. Its my second day of the dose and I am suffering from running nose , watery eyes and dry cough.

Just wanted to confirm if I can take oral prednisolone and rhinoclenil together and if that would help. Thanks. Also how long will these medicines take to cure this allergy .","Doctor":"Hello, Oral prednisolone is the LAST option for severe allergies, and reserved only when antihistamines and nasal sprays are not working. Steroids can give quick relief although it would take 1-2 days. But you must stop after 7 days; also 10mg dose is very low to have much effect, the usual dose for 3-4 days is 30-40mg depending on body weight. You must take nasal sprays and antihistamines along with the prednisolone as after stopping steroids you will get a rebound of symptoms if antihistamines are not in the background.

Your symptoms are nonspecific but suggestive of benign digestion disorder called IBS or irritable bowel syndrome. This is manifested with bloating or diarrheas with pain and abdominal discomfort. As remedies you should: Look at your diet. If it contains a large amount of carbohydrates that are difficult to digest, try to replace them. Carbohydrates that are easier to digest, such as potatoes, rice, and bananas, are good substitutes. Also try to eat around five to six small meals a day instead of three larger ones to help your digestive process. Chew properly to avoid doing anything that may increase the amount of air that you swallow. This includes making sure that you are chewing your food properly, and avoiding chewing gum or smoking. Also, drink some peppermint tea, chamomile tea and ginger. In severe cases colonoscopy should be done and some medications recommended. Hope I have answered your query.

This rash is raised barely when it shows up and looks like it is an indentation. Should I be concerned or is this my body possibly reacting to allergies and I need to take a claritin 10mg to manage the allergy?

He could have developed hyper reactive airways after inhaling the fumes or some of it may have gone down his airways. He may go in for chest CT to asses the damage to the lung parenchyma and a PFT. The risk is if he has any damage to lungs he may develop broncheactasis and  he may get repeated chest infections.He may develop hyper reactive airways and have  asthma may develop  ILD.

Please help as it is the biggest night mare of my life i cudnt sleep one day satisfied Because of this this has Become chronic and it doesnt decrease rather it goes on increasing...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for your query. First of all confirm the diagnosis with a Dermatologist. You have to take adequate and correct treatment. NMF lotion and Ultravex cream are not correct treatment. You have to take some systemic antifungal antibiotics like Flucanazole, Griseofulvin, Terbinafin, or Itracanzole in appropriate dose for adequate duration along with topical antibiotics like Clotrimazole, Ketocanozle, Terbinafin or Seratacanazole etc. You have to rule out any predisposing factors for Fungal infection like Diabetes Mallitus, Immuno-deficiency conditions, Prolonged steroids etc. All measures have to be undertaken by the guidance of a dermatologist. You need not get vexed. A complete cure is possible. Get well soon. Dr S.Murugan"},{"Patient":"I was cleaning a bathroom for over an hour (enclosed area and not very big maybe 10 x 10 ft) - spray the Lysol Disinfectant very heavily as the smell was atrocious. Obviously I was exposed to these fumes for an hour and ever since then I have just felt tired and no energy. Could this be from having inhaled these fumes. I never knew they could be harmful. And now I am worried if I had sustained permanent damage somewhere. This happened about 4 weeks ago. Thankyou for your response. Linda","Doctor":"Hello Linda, It is estimated that up to a third of patients with asthma can suffer from respiratory problems after being exposed to agents such as lysol (ehow.com data) but it can happen even with people who have bronchial hyperesponsiveness on exposure to chlorine fumes. Feeling drained of energy is not an obvious feature of asthma but if you are coughing and then feeling tired, it is recommended you visit a Chest Physician and get pulmonary function tests done to ensure your airways are normal. A trial of beta 2 agonists (short acting ones) may prove helpful. Discuss this with your doctor. If you have any other respiratory allergies, please mention this as well. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My son gets a severe rash around his waistband. My husband used to get the same thing, stopped wearing underwear and it went away. I assumed it was the same for my son. Maybe an allergy to the elastic. He tried the no underwear but it did not work. I bought him special boxers with that don t have elastic exposed but it hasn t helped. A few years ago, he scratched so badly, it turned into MRSA and he has horrible scars. He doesn t have open sores right now, but he says it itches constantly and looks very irritated. Cortisone cream helps but he knows he can t use that for very long. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello Sue, It is possible he is getting pressure-induced urticaria that is aggravated/triggered by the pressure of the elastic. As he tried the 'no underwear' without help, it is likely he is getting urticaria (hives and bumps, red and itchy) at other times or places and scratching aggravates the problem and has got secondary bacterial infection. Fusidic acid cream is treatment for the local skin infection but occasionally may require IV antibiotics if he is getting fever etc Long acting antihistamines with calamine lotion as local sooting effect is recommended for at least 6 weeks. CBC, LFT, ANA, TSH fT3 fT4 are tests that are usually done in urticaria to see if there can be identifiable causes.

After 15 days he gave me telecast-10 tablet and said to continue for 2 months after 30 days the breathing problem as not up to that extent but it has not gone fully some coughing is there.. so is it the Asthma …..","Doctor":"Yes your symptoms are suggestive of asthma which is a form of menifestation of allergy and in your case triggered by chest infection.

I have just finished amoxicillan having taken it for 7 days, three times a day, at 500 mg. I still continue to cough, but it is now more aggressive. My doctor says it is from a post nasal drip . He claims that my lungs are clear, although I have this constant tickle in my chest . I was frightened yesterday as I was eating because I suddenly could not breathe. Logically you would have thought I was choking but it seems as though my throat just clamped. Inhaling was a problem. It was quick and as I swallowed I could breathe again. I have also had a constant phlegm that wont move right around my vocal chords and I try hard to clear it. I have never experienced a cough for so long and I am worried. My doctor insists my lungs are clear after two visits. After choking I went to the hospital they kept me waiting for hours. I will revisit my doctor on Monday. I would appreciate any advice.

Exclude communicable respiratory diseases like TB, especially if you have been in contact with someone with infection (active) or a recent visit to a country with TB 3. Post nasal drip due to allergic or non-allergic rhinitis can cause the same constant cough that worsens at night when you have dust mite allergies If options 1 and 2 have been excluded, a visit to an Alergist for skin prick test or specific IgE blood test can help find what your allergies are.....antihistamines (long acting) and nasal corticosteroids for 6 weeks (minimum) is recommended.

Probably by all thses your son will get rid of this episode.

The cough sounds horrible and irradiating and does wake him especially while sleeping, but his overall well being is quite normal. In the first 2weeks I assumed it was either a chest infection, broncoltes or the flu . I then put him on a coarse of antibotics which he finished 100% but he still had the majority of symptoms. I then took him to a doctor who prescribed him a 3 day coarse of a steroid , which he also finished and still he remained to have all of his symptoms so we returned to see another doctor who said he s chest was clear and unfortunately it is going around and it could take up to 5 to 6 weeks to clear. In the end of the 4week I returned once again to another doctor, after a couple of temps and still with the same cough, she then dianogised my son with asthma and prescribed him with another steroid to give him for 3days and also ventolin liquid to be given 3 times daily, after the third day on both the steroid and ventolin no change and my son if anything seemed worse as he had two more temps along with the worst 2nights sleep while on the ventolin liquid ( both times on the 3day steroid, the dose was given in the morning as advised by both doctors and pharmacists) I decided to not give him anymore of the ventolin until I got another opion.In the mid of the 5week I then decided enough was enough and got him in to see his doctor that has seen him form birth. I was told then that the dianogise that the previous doctor had given him was incorrect as his chest was clear and although he has a higher chance of having asthma as both his father and I had asthma and broncol asthma as children, he is still too young to be sure 100% as he cant do any type of breathing test. He then said to give it a week or two and see how he goes without any medicine and if No improvement or I get concerned bring him back within a week. I then returned in a few days as still no improvement and the coughing was getting to the stage of him nearly vomiting, we were able to see his doctor and he prescribed a twice a day coarse of antibotics which he has all most completed.

I recently lost my sight for a few mins and since then it has not been the same. I am waiting for tests at the hospital, they have sent me to a stroke clinic. But now after doing my own research I am starting to wonder if I have an allergy to the titanium plates in my lower jaw.","Doctor":"Hello Holly, The symptoms are serious and you have rightly been sent to the stroke clinic for a CT/MRI to exclude a brain event. If you suffer from rhinosinusitis you must let your doctor know so that a sinus CT is done at the same time and obviously to see the position of the plates. If you are on steroids or any immunosuppressant drug, they should be reviewed urgently as the symptom can mean a temporary loss of blood supply to the brain that is often caused by medications. As i said 'temporary' the recovery is usually 100% but all tests must be done especially if you have risk factors of heart disease, diabetes. Allergy to metal plates is a hypothetical possibility, but never actually proven in real life in most patients who have 'allergic' reactions after metal prosthesis.

Could this be an allergic reaction from either injections? The tb test was red and indurated. The first tb test I ever had was negative (over 10yrs ago), the second was positive, the third was negative, and this recent one was positive. I have read that you can have an allergic reaction to certain manufacturers and is why it was positive the second time. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello, If the TB test you are referring to was the Mantoux test, then the positivity reflects either past immunization or exposure. There is usually no need to repeat this so many times as in you case. if the question is latent TB (i.e., the doctors think you may have TB, but not sure) then a new blood test is available called TB-Spot or QuantiFERON assay. The flu shot is probably the seasonal influenza jab you had and if the symptoms happened within a few hours, it is possible you have sensitivity to one of the excipients in the jab. The common thing in both will be antibiotics like neomycin, but you need to check this. People with severe egg allergy react to flu jabs, so please ensure if you have any symptoms of egg allergy you get this tested by a specific IgE blood test or skin test.

Delayed reaction to mouth washes at the dentist is more unlikely. A skin prick or specific IgE blood test would elucidate if you have any allergies particularly dust mite.

Urticaria is the diagnosis and underlying thyroid dysfunction plays a role in aggravating the urticaria, although the exact mechanism remains uncertain. Thyroid autoimmune disease may reflect that the urticaria you are having is autoimmune for which a long period of antihistamines (avoid sedative ones) are required to control the urticaria.

She also has night sweats . She had a CT scan done and all her sinuses are badly infected . She has been on steriods and antibiotics for them and has been seen by an ENT specialist who has blown out the easier to reach sinuses. She still has the headaches, she also gets red plaques on her skin for no reason and then they go away. The specialist seems to think she has allergies and will test her next week with a special allergy test that is subcutaneous instead of the pricks on the surface of the skin. She has had several stents put in her heart several years ago and her breathing is not as good as it could be be other than that she is good. I am not convinced that it is allergies. Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello, Headaches and night sweats can have several different causes and hope the CT scan of the paranasal sinuses also covered the head and excluded intracranial pathologies. Also thyroid function test would be an important test here. The red plaques are probably unrelated to the headaches and night sweats in time, and if they are itchy red lesions slightly raised and disappear without a trace it means urticarial eruptions. Here too thyroid autoimmunity plays a role and therefore best to exclude with TPO antibodies. I do not knwo what subcutaneous tests your doctor is going to offer but cannot be more sensitive than skin prick tests. Occasionally multople cardiac medications can cause the urticaria, so please check these out and discuss with your doctor. 80% of patients with urticaria do NOT have allergies. Long acting antihistamines non-sedative are usually fine but in the elderly needs some caution as it causes dryness of mucosae. Hope this helps.

He was prescribed Atarax drops and Fudic BNF cream. I ve 2 questions: 1. Fudic BNF although is temporarily drying up the boils ( constant scratching flares them up again) , the rash is not going. So should I continue with the day course, or get another suggestion. 2. Is there a way to make sure that he overcomes this allergy with some dietary supllements. Thanks, Annu","Doctor":"Hello Annu, Your son may have dry skin that could be eczema but the boils is secondary to infections with a common skin bug called staph aureus. If there are any boils actively bursting, a pus c/s or swab will identify the mechanism. Antibacterial creams such as Fucidin are helpful against such bacteria and Mupirocin cream 2% nasal oitment to eradicate carriage and chlorhexidine soap to wash the whole body is recommended.

First time!","Doctor":"Hello, It is likely that you are suffering from a generalised acute urticaria and angioedema episode. If there is no fever, abdominal pain or breathing trouble then the situation is not that serious, but apart from long acting antihistamines like allegra, you will need corticosteroids to overcome this acute episode. Please see your doctor regarding this prescription. There are certain drugs that can do these reactions like pain killers (NSAIDs) or aspirin or blood pressure pills, so ensure you let your doctor know if you have taken any of these prior to this event.

What do you think could be some possible diagnosis?","Doctor":"Hello, I am unable to understand if the nose bleeds and the sinus problems happen together or are unrelated to each other. If they happen together, then it may be due to rhinosinusitis that you develop once you get exposed to string chemicals. If you get any rashes on contact to chemicals, then a type IV hypersensitivity is likely that can be proven NOT on blood tests but patch tests. If you dont get rashes, then you have (possibly) a hyperresponsive airway that can be better understood using a pulmonary function test using methacholine challenge. This allows us to understand whether you have a degree of asthma. The sinuses need to be viewed using a CT scan to ensure there are no other problems.

However, this may seem but is usually not the case. What happens is that your allergies are getting worse, and once a day cetirizine is insufficient to make a difference to the symptos. Avil injection is a short-acting but rapidly acting antihistamine with sedative properties and will NOT recommend this for long term use. You must get a blood test or specific IgE OR a skin prick test to find out what your allergies are. If it is house dust mite, avoidance measures should be in place but optimising medical treatment with long acting antihistmines like allegra and nasal corticosteroid sprays are recommended. Immunotherapy (subcutaneous or sublingual) are reserved for patients who do not respond on medical treatment.

A delayed raction to the IDT means you are allergic and therefore this must be noted in the medical records. You can call him and let him know if you cannot visit your doctor. Long acting antihistamines such as allegra is recommended up to twice daily for 7 days. You obviously know of the severe symptoms to look out for (such as extensive reactions or breathing difficulty) in which case you must go to the nearest A&E or Emergency Dept and ensure that the doctor who did the test also gets informed.

Same period, I started experiencing the pain like burning sensation on my feet and having a feeling like crawling sensation on my body.

Nothing was seen..

Sometimes i feel crawling sensation on my face to my shoulder, Swollen Gland though already went down and i had sore throat like which was not painful whenever i swallow foods. I dont know know what is happening, I thought it could be HIV but the test says Negative.. James","Doctor":"Dear James, I am sure you are worried sick about this but hope you have visited an Infectious Disease or GUM specialist to get the whole range of STDs checked out. Of course, the HIV 1 and 2 ab test is the right test given the time frame (when antibodies to the virus would have formed IF you have the reaction, but clearly not so) but the most sensitive test remains HIV PCR or Viral load if you had more encounters since. The feeling that you describe can be scabies but would be evident on clinical examination, although a rash would mean this is urticaria. House dust mite and sea food allergy occasionally come up positive on blood tests, so if you really have reactions (allergic) when you have sea food the result is correct. You need a throat swab, HIV PCR/VL and get seen by a specialist to lower the apprehension and hope things turn out well. As per the urticaria, long acting non sedating antihistamines for 3 months is the treatment.

Food allergies include cayenne (muscle weakness), nectarines (anaphylaxis), black pepper (facial rash);oranges (itchy welts). Intolerances include milk, blueberries, cinnamon. Some foods cause itching with no rash (but require benadryl and last for about 8 hours--like tuna).

You may consult your allergist to take his opinion regarding your problem to undergo some skin testing or serum analysis to conclusively prove your sulphur allergy.

You may feel that you are suffering from the same infection but it may not be true. You should consult a local general physician so that you get physically examined. You need anti- allergic and anti biotics. If you have a prescription and you have been physically examined it will be better. You should not take any medication by yourself and should follow the doctor's prescription strictly. Do alert your treating doctor if you have history of any past illness or have allergy to some medicines or food. Hope you have the reports ( records ) of your previous investigations with you. It will be helpful for your treatment. You may need a few investigations to be done. You should have warm saline gargle three times a day. You can also use an antiseptic mouth wash for gargling.

Both patients stopped breathing for some time and rescue breaths were given. After about 6-10 rescue breaths, both patients began shallow breathing on their own. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hello, These are serious symptoms and you need to ensure that both of them do not suffer from allergies that may have triggered the symptoms. The attack that you describe is sort of something like airway obstruction with saliva as the 'foam' and ensure that they have an anaphylaxis management plan in place. If this was after a food they had ingested, a food allergy definitely needs excluding. Happy to elaborate if you have further issues.

There is no pain on the outside. i had taken an x-ray of KUB to see if stones were present but it showed up negative. I m a diabetic and am on metformin/gliclazide combo.There is pain if I take a deep breath too. Been taking amoxycillin/ potassium clavulanate for an ear problem which is clearing up and I was wondering that had my problem (side pain) been because of an infection it should be getting better (in my opinion) because of the antibiotics that I was already having but the pain is still there, so I m wondering. Slight temperature is present but I m wondering whether this is because of the flu that I might be having as i m sneezing quite a few times. Examination of the urine turned up negative. There was no presence of urea/ creatinine too. Plasma glucose (random) is 167 mg/dl Glycosylated hb is 6.8% Serum triglycerides is 210 mg/dl I m just presenting to you some figures that have turned up on my visit to the doctor for your reference. Your opinion will be very much appreciated. Thanks Regards, D.Neli","Doctor":"Dear D Neli, You are a diabetic and although your blod sugar is controlled, you remain at risk of infections. An ultrasound scan of the abdomen is a must at this stage and a serum amylase test. A normal amylase does not rule out pancreatitis but a raised level will certainly help the clinician. A renal tract infection is likely so the augmentin will help. If the fever continues, ensure you get a CBC, and if reqd. a blood culture / CXR done.

There is tube connecting the two - Eustachian tube - middle ear to oro-pharynx (throat).   The tonsil irritation could be from infection (virus, bacteria, some times a fungus) or allergy or even mechanical - from food and so on.  Post nasal drip could also cause. Tobacco in ANY FORM is bad.   Only the effects of additives like tar and so on are avoided by the  the so called smokeless tobacco.

In a report FDA mentioned about the possibility of neuropsychiatric side effects with leukotriene modulator drugs like Montelukast.

Your daughter aged 2.5 years age had breathing problem then she was given treatment with nebuliser, now when she got cold was given inhaler. Both are same by function depending on age the doctors prefer the type. Inhalers are of several types, broadly bronchodialator and steroid.   broncho dialators we should use to get relief, steroids are used only when the severity of the infection is more. Steroids are to be used rarely when ever there is necessory. breathing problem usually develops due to allergy, and if you could find the allergen you can greatly minimise the severity of the attack. allergens can be traced by making a list of the things used and foods on daily basis. Note when there is cold or cough. Try to find out the things used on the day of the attack of cold and avoid such things which are common. Besides i advise you some diet recommendations  as avoid taking brinjal, fish, other sea foods, ice water, ice cream, cool drinks, these are common allergens. Don't allow her to play with water.

Normal PFT doesnot mean that you dont have asthma The diagnosis of asthma is more of clinical than PFT finding As your doctor found spasm and your symptom has a seasonal variation brochial asthma is most likely On long term basis neither deriphyllin nor prednisolone is appropriate systemic steroid is hardly used in asthma unless there is exacerbation.

I am off the inhalers, and currently use astepro and nasonex for indoor allergies. My lungs still feel inflamed- family history of GERD but have no overt symptoms of acid reflux, no family history of anxiety. I was hoping to get some feedback thanks.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to the forum. It is nice to know that your investigations have a normal report. The symptoms of Asthma can be controlled and discomforts reduced but there is no clear cut cure of the ailment. It is important for you to take care of your lifestyle, quit any kind of addition as it may trigger your symptoms. Stay stress free and have a good sleep. It is caused by allergy of any kind, cold, pollens, food, etc. Some have a history of asthma as a family ailment. The people who are psychologically sensitive are affected by it. Asthma is a medical condition that results due to the inflammation, swelling or narrowing of the airways ( bronchioles ) in the lungs. It may cause over-production of mucus sometimes. Iit results in shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing. When the episodes of asthmatic attacks ( coughing, shortness of breath, wheeze ) get quite occasional, steroids, bronchodilators, anti-inflammatory medications and nasal sprays have to be taken ( after consultation with your treating doctor ). Asthma is not a disease. A normal, active life should be lead.

However I have also got a rash up both legs and pain in feet and ankles. No calf pain so no concerns of DVT just concerned about rash as thought initially it wa a sensitivity to Ciprofloxavin that I took for chest infection but since ceding the meds rash hasn t really improved. PMH- CA breast lymphoedema L arm and breast asthma and hypothyroidism","Doctor":"Hello, It is important that a DVT is excluded (at least by clinical examination, if not by doppler) as your past history puts you in a slightly disadvantageous position. However, if you are now not taking tamoxifen etc then the risk is low, but if the flight exceeded 6 hrs without much feet exercise, then it is better to exclude a DVT. It is unlikely a reaction to ciprofloxacin, unless you have a past history of quinolone allergy. The rash also means a DVT must be exlcluded. If the rash is itchy, then venous pooling with dryness of skin can cause a rash, when antihistamines will help. But I would still recommend getting this checked out.

Fever, joint pains, rash that does not disappears but looks like a bruise or leaves a scar needs further investigating to ensure that it is not a form of vasculitis (inflammation of blod vessels). However, just a fever is not suggestive of this condition, and a viral infection triggering the ithcy rash is usually the most likely explanation. If the fever continues, do ensure an infection screen is done and you are on the right antimicrobials but continue on the antihistamines until the rash is well gone for 2 weeks and then stop the antihistamine tablets.

This is called allergic rhinitis. Your headache is also due to inflammation in sinus due to rhinitis. Take some anti-allergic tablet. Put 2-3 drops of nasal decongestant drops (e.g. otrivin) in oth the nostrils followed by deep plain water steam, at least 2-3 times a day. This will relieve both nasal inflammation and headache.Your loss of appetite may be due to disturbance in metabolic activities due to change in place, food and water. Take very light food till you get normal appetite. It will gradually increase as your body get adjusted to the changing condition. Till that time if you want you can start some appetizer. For hair loss, please check the water supply. This is the most common cause when you change your place. Even your loss of appetite may also due to hardness in the water. If you are getting hard water (e.g. bore well water) it may cause the hair loss because of high content of heavy salts.

You are requested to kindly suggest. Regards AAAAA","Doctor":"Dear Mr/Mrs Pandey, It is difficult to diagnose asthma in little children as pulmonary function tests are difficult to perform by children and therefore the diagnosis is usually retrospective based on response to treatment. Chronic noctunal (night time) cough, audible wheeze after playing or exertion are symptoms suggestive of asthma and inhaled salbutamol can be tried to see the response. Occasionally asthma is triggered by viral infections, so a temporary use of inhaled bronchodilators is a good treatment. Children may develop asthma after repeated viral infections and more so if they have allergies, like food allergy or rhinitis for example. And also, children may not develop asthma but a temporary relief with inhalers will provide comfort to the child in lowering lung inflammation and constriction.

Some liver function derangement has been reported due to montelukast in the literature though no definite proof is not obtained till now. But as you are allergic on withdrawal of these drugs may cause relapse of your allergic symptoms. In fact allergy cannot be cured by these drugs. All they do is to reduce the symptoms on allergen exposure. For allergy cure specific immunotherapy may be of some help and for that you have to consult an allergist.

Please advice me.","Doctor":"Hello The combination of throat irritation, cough AND voice getting affected after food (as also early morning) raises the possibility of reflux - stomach contents back-flowing to food pipe and beyond... You have to see your physician for proper evaluation - if it is long (you didn't say how long!), you may need an X-ray, blood count and/or upper GI endoscopy (tube to see your food pipe and stomach) Good luck"},{"Patient":"i my daughter name is sana she often gets allergies . in the month of feb she got red spots on her back they told it is chickenpox but now again same spots are there , they are saying this is c.pox when she was young itself i vaccinated her. i don t know what to do please answer my question YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hi Lakshmi, Definitely it can not be chicken pox both times! One attack gives immunity to the baby. It may be insect bite or viral rash.

For the moment, you need a systemic corticosteroid like prednisolone 1-2mg/kg BW for 15-20 days to control this reaction and also need to continue the Allegra 120mg until all of this is resolved. As for the other 'skin allergy' I am not sure what it is, but a formal testing is recommended. Thanks."},{"Patient":"hello sir, i have an allergy to mosquitoes and if they bite me, i get a lot of itching, and later spots which wont heel for days also, after its gone it leaves a dark spot, one doctor i consulted before said its a rare dermatological condition which occurs on fairer skin people. i desperately need to know the cure, its only on my hands and legs, n i feel embarrassed to wear small sleeve dresses","Doctor":"Dear Shinie, This is a normal response to an insect bite, especially mosquitoes, that you get. The response to fiery red ants, wasps and bees may provoke an anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) response but not against mosquitoes. A mild potency setroid cream (betamethasone) and anti-histamines taken over 3-4 days usually suffices as treatment of skin reactions to mosquito bites in adults. However, if you are getting bruises or dark areas on severe scratching, you need to ensure that you do not have an abnormal platelet number (low) that leads to the bruising. A complete blood count test should tell you the platelet number. Thanks."},{"Patient":"hi docs, Heres a quick background for you. Im a 6 foot 2 inch white male, i use to work out pretty regularly. I work out about 2 times a week now, mostly lifting weights. Im 26 years old and weigh around 265lbs. My question is that when i drink i sometimes get these red blotchy looking spots mostly on my neck/ chest area and my head and it becomes a bit harder to breathe. I am wondering if this is an allergic reaction to alcohol?","Doctor":"Hello ewolms, Allergic reaction to alcohol is a hypothesis that has been going around for a long time, and there are two explanations for these kind of reactions 1. Alcohol dehydrogenase is an enzyme that breaks down alcohol (something that your body naturally produces for cellular function!) and the alcohol that you drink also needs to be converted by the same enzyme, and therefore deficiency will cause adverse effects in the form of allergic reactions. however, this has not been proven and this test (alc deh levels) is not available routinely. 2. The more likely explanation with your breathing difficulty especially is a form of sulphite intolerance, and therefore you need to see your Allergist to get a list of sulphite-free foods and avoid the foods 'very high' and 'high' in sulphites (this includes wine!). Only then this will be clear."},{"Patient":". have cramping, blotting, pain in upper abdomen and lower left. But when I eat it’s upper more intense. But consistent lower left pain.

Stay or go?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Certain degree of bloating  is normal but in case of excessive bloating it may be sign of food allergy, hiatal hernia ,IBS or inflammatory bowel diseases. So you should do gastroenterologic work up but first try to change your dietary habits, it means: eat smaller meals but more frequently, avoid fried and spicy food, take menta tea, avoid alcohol and coffee, eat probiotics and milk products, boiled food and vegetables. Also, there are medications such as Flobian, Magnesium oxide or certain Laxatives  which may relieve such symptoms of this continue. If there wont be improvement on these measures, you should consider doing diagnostic tests such as colonoscopy, anal sphincter manometry and food allergy testing. I hope I have answered you query.

Individual lesions do not last for more than 12 hours and new ones appear, and it seems they are always there. Allergic reaction is only plausible if this was after a new medication, food you have taken and happens within a few hours. Pain killers are notorious to cause these reactions, but if you have not taken before an outbreak it is unlikely to be an allergy. However, medications can have a secondary effect on skin so do get your mdications reviewed if you are on any. Urticaria is mostly non-alergic, although blood tests such as CBC, LFT, thyroid are necessary at some stage especially if lond-acting antihistamines over 3-4 weeks taken daily do not help.

You have to take seroflo regularly whether you are having symptoms or not. Also take a reliever puff like asthalin or duolin 3 to 4 times a day. If symptoms persist add a monteleukast and doxyphyllin to your regime and a short course of steroids for 5 to 7 days.

My lungs feel like they are on fire and the dry cough is terrible. Could i have developed asthma? Im 34 years old. Thanks","Doctor":"From your description it is apparent that you are atopy ie you are prone to develop allergy to various substances. First you shoud get a routine blood count and a x ray chest done to rule out any other lung pathology. Also get a PFT done to diagnose asthma. You should consult a pulmonologist as you may need anti inflammatory/allergy treatment in the form of inhalers or tablets."},{"Patient":"I currently have laryngitis and have had it since last Monday.

Recently at first allergic skin prick test is done to detect suspected allergen and subsequently it is confirmed by specific serum IgE assay. Though according to recent studies both these tests are equally effective. But there is no role of estimation of total serum IgE level. Your baby's symptoms are suggestive of allergy because itchy skin, dermatitis, eczema, headaches probably due to recurrent sinusitis are indicative of allergy. Therefore consult an allergist and take his opinion and go for those tests under his guidence. Thank you."},{"Patient":"My husband 47years old suffering from bronchial asthma since 1992.

Since viral illnesses are one of the most common causes of an acute asthmatic attack, you should consider increasing the amount of the preventer that you use and you may want to consider using your reliever in case the shortness of breath is an indication of an acute asthmatic event. In terms of the fever and chills , you can consider using paracetamol, use of tepid/ room temperature baths to cool your body, fan therapy.Resist the urge to bundle up, when persons get chills they tend to bundle up, this will only increase your temperture. In light of your history of asthma and the shortness of breath that you are currently experiencing , it would be best if you seek medical attention as soon as you can.

She told me I should be better in a couple of days if I get some rest and drink plenty of fluids. I ve been drinking plenty of fluids but having difficulty getting rest. I ve been taking codeine cough syrup (which I m almost out of) and a Proair inhaler every 4hrs for symptoms. They seemed to be helping only a little bit.

You should start your treatment with a formoterol-budesonide combination inhaler 200 at 2 puffs twice daily along with montelukast 10 mg daily at night. You should have to use them on regular basis.

Smoking has an association with asthma though not conclusively proved. But its exposure may lead to asthma exacerbation which happened to you.

But with that a inhaled corticosteroid-long-acting beta2 agonist combination should be started on like formeterol-budesonide combination for better control of your asthma symptoms.

What you describe is something like cholinergic urticaria, a form of urticaria (this is not allergy in >80% of cases) that is triggered by temperature changes and mast cell release of mediators like histamine. Scabies is also a possibility that is intensely itchy and needs to be excluded with a careful examination, skin scrapings or a course of treatment if there is high clinical suspicion. Atarax is a strong antihistamine (sedative, so take at night) and prednisolone must be stopped after 5 days giving atarax a chance to work. You can switch to non-sedative antihistamines like fexofenadine or cetirizine. There is no blood test for a definitive diagnosis but thyroid disease or diabetes need to be excluded along with a complete blood count to ensure there is no infectious trigger.

Thank you!"},{"Patient":"I am suffering from running nose, please suggest to stop this problem.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for your query. You have been suffering from allergic rhinitis. Principles that may improve your condition. 1.     First do a skin IgE allergen test to identify the allergy and try to avoid them by food, environment, touch etc. 2.     Controlling dust and dust mites. For example, dust regularly and wash bed linens in hot water. 3.     Controlling animal dander and other pet allergens. One way to do this is to restrict pets to certain areas of your home. 4.     Controlling indoor molds. Clean bathtubs and showers monthly. 5.     Avoiding outdoor pollens. This includes staying inside while pollen counts are high. If avoiding allergens doesn't help your symptoms or is not possible •     you may try taking over-the-counter allergy medicines to relieve symptoms. You can treat a stuffy nose by using decongestants or nasal steroid spray or cleaning your nasal passages with saline solution (salt water). Please consult with your physician for final opinion.

I have this issue with breathing . It seems like my chest rattles when I am laying down, only at night/early morning. If the weather is muggy I can also feel it. My doctor has given me an inhaler , but it only seems to make it harder for me to breathe. I am also noticing it to be more difficult to swallow . What is going on? I started with a variety of symptoms in November of 2011, about 2 months postpartum. My first episode was in the end of November. While with my two young children at Walmart I started to see very fuzzy, then felt very faint. I asked a passerby to take my baby and I sat on the ground. They helped me make my way to the front and I called my husband to come and get me. In looking back I hadn t really eaten or drank that well and given the fact that I was nursing I thought maybe I was hungry or dehydrated. About a week later, the same sort of scenario, it was early morning and I was in the kitchen and suddenly felt like I was going to pass out. My mother was here with me at the time and she got me some orang juice and I got something to eat as it was near breakfast time, my dad rushed over to my home and took my blood sugar( which was fine) I was very shakey. This time I went to the ER. Ultimately they ran labs and checked me over and everything seemed ok, they even did an xray of my heart to make sure it was not swollen from after the baby, that was fine. They went ahead and sent me home with a heart monitor, which came back borderline abnormal. You should also know that just after this my PCP put me on 50mg of Zoloft which caused incredible side effects,from shaking to hot flashes to severe panic. They decreased my dose, but the side effects were just too much to handle.I was then put on Paxil which seemed to aggrivate my SVT, though keep in mind at this time the PCP did not know I was struggling with SVT they called it anxiety .In February 2012 I was finally given a stress test which showed SVT, but that the structure of my heart seemed fine. In that same month of February I had noticed the breathing issue begin, it would seem that it would rattle when I would be laying down only, or upon waking. I went in my PCP and he did a chest xray which indicated the possible beginning of pneumonia, which he hesistated to treat stating that it may just be breast tissue . He treated it with Zpack anyway. Along the way I have also not felt right in my head, I feel sort of drunk and out of it, sort of like I m just floating through my day. On April 3rd 2012 I had the Catheter Ablation for my SVT which seems to be a success so far. During the ablation they actually found two SVT s which is rare I am told. One of the other symptoms I have is the feeling from the pit of my stomach, like nervousness but also a sensation where I feel as though I cannot get a full breath. Lying down only makes it worse. In May 2012 my PCP felt that they needed to treat my anxiety by treating me with more meds, so they put me on buspar. They also did a breathing test and ultimately sent me home with Advair, which didn t seem to help any. I also went to see an ENT who put a tube/camera down my throat to see if they could see any problems with myt throat. They showed a slight irritation and ordered an barium xray, which according to that xray I do not have acid reflux, so I stopped taking my acid reflux medication. I am still battling the breathing issue, I feel winded just going up the stairs. I started exercising again and can seem to run 3 miles without feeling awful. Most recently I feel very dizzy and off balance, I just don t feel myself these days. My PCP said it s my inner ear and doesn t seem to be anything more. I just feel drunk and short of breath and sleepy. My PCP chalks it all up to anxiety. I was recently in a store with my mother and got very dizzy, out of nowhere, I was feeling perfectly fine then it hit me I was just dizzy. I m overwhelmed, it seems since November my health has gone down hill and everyone seems to think nothing of it. What should I do? Is this all in my head? Am I crazy? Do I sound crazy? Are there questions I need to be asking my doctor that I just don t know of?","Doctor":"ei thing you mustttttttttttgo for xray pns waters view and other investiations hb,haemogram total ige level in blood total ttg levels of blood tatal eosinophil count' thee will be anwer sitting on these investigations post after this homework"},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor.

The mainstay of the treatment will be :No alcohol or such foods and beverages which increase your pain, This is what you have to find out. You have to take pancreatic supplements every time you take food, the requirement of the painkillers will reduce. All the painkillers you are using like Ibuprofen, aceclofenac, paracetamol and serratiopeptidase are of least value in a known patient of chronic pancreatitis and you need to have better ones like tramodol and so on. You can consult a Pain-clinic specialist who can help you by injecting the appropriate nerves.

For the past 10 days my chest has felt very tight and somewhat difficult to catch my breath. I thought it could be bronchitis, since I have chronic bronchitis and seasonal allergies which when acting up will manifest in my chest. I saw my physician who put me on an antibiotic . After 7 days I still had bad chest pains and no productive cough. I called him and he ordered a chest X-ray . The X-ray came back clear so he ruled out pneumonia . The chest pains worsened so much that it felt like an elephant was sitting on my chest and I became very hot and sweaty, difficult to breathe etc... I am a single mom so I was trying not to scare my 9 year old daughter. My brother and mother came over and while my mom watched my daughter my brother took me to the ER. My EKG came back abnormal, low frequency and early pulmonary disease. I was a smoker back in high school, college and my 20 s. They have recommended I see are cardiologist which I am on October 10th. However since my episode which was this past Wednesday pm, I am experiencing terrible pain in my pectorals, shoulders, neck and upper back area. The pain has not subsided and I can barely even change my clothes. To add to this, I am experiencing chest pains again today with severe tightening feeling like the elephant is back sitting on my chest. Im light headed, and having periods of feeling hot. Is this something I should go back to the ER for or am I just overreacting and should wait for my appointment with the cardiologist?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM. After going through your history ,I must say you have given clear picture of your problem. You are having Chronic bronchitis along with allergic sesonal acute exacerbation, but are you taking inhalers or medicines for breathng problems?. As chest pain was severe and EKG was done which may be low voltage and clockwise rotation,with right axis deviation, which may be Cor pulmonale that is effect of lung disease on heart. If pain is severe a repeat visit to ER with repeat EKG is warranted as  heart problem can not be ruled out, so kindly get a EKG,if nothing significant is found then you may be wise to take any safe analgesic. Then you can wait for cardiac evaluation. Feeling of hot flashes could be due to age ? perimenopausal hormone changes.

If it is the former (i.e., ear itchy only) then you may wish to consider if this is secondary to metal allergy like earrings or jewellery. Nickel allergy is quite common that is a hypersensitivity (delayed rather than immediate) and can last for quite long and flares up on little contact again. Patch test procedure can diagnose chemical (delayed) hypersensitivities. If you have all the symptoms, then dust mite or pollen allergy is more likely. Skin prick or specific IgE (blood test) can reveal all the allergies but needs to be discussed with a Specialist in Allergy. Combination of oral antihistamines and nasal sprays are required and occasionally leukotriene antagonists for a longer duration of benefit.

Recurrent sneezing attacks can also make one feel giddy. Disturbed sleep due to dust mite allergy can also lead to several non-specific symptoms. If the neurologist and chest physicians have not found anything alarming, I would suggest you get either blood tests (specific IgE) or skin test that would reveal your allergies and according start the treatment. Smoking can lead to restricted lung volumes with air trapping known as chronic obstructive airways disease for which several inhalers are available. For allergy treatment, combined use of oral antihisamines and nasal sprays will help overcome the symptoms but should be used continuously for at least 2 months or longer depending on the sensitization profile.

You are quite right in thinking of Allergy with what seems to be rhinitis and occasionally allergenic triggers may become a problem in patients with autoimmune disorders. It would be very helpful if you could remember at the time when the problems started 3 months, if there were any new medications introduced or changed to something else. However, if I considered drug allergy the top of the list will be hydromorphone that is an opioid analgesic and can cause direct mast cell histamine release WITHOUT any allergy - specific antibodies. There is now a blood test available for those who want to exclude morphine allergy, specific IgE against morphine. Pain killers can also cause direct mast cell degranulation and antihistamines are very helpful. Please see your doctor for an antihistamine prescription that needs to be used for 4-6 weeks after stopping the hydromorphone to see an effect.

She is not acting sick and i asked her if anything hurts or itches really bad and she just said her neck itches a little.She also has about 10-12 mosquito bites on her, so i have no idea what could have caused the rash....?","Doctor":"Hi Jessirae, Your daughter is suffering from allergy and also mosquito bites. Give her a warm bath and apply a medicated prickly heat powder. Do check her bedding and mattress for bugs. It seems your daughter has sensitive skin. It will be good for her to avoid sleeping with pet animals, they can cause other problems ( asthma) later in life. Do visit a skin specialist and get your daughter examined. Mosquito bites can cause problems like fever after 48-72 hours. She also needs an oral anti allergic medication. Clean your home and surroundings (garden etc) to stop mosquitoes from breeding. Mosquito bites should not be taken easy, they are source to really serious ailments ( malaria, cerebral malaria, dengue, etc ) many times. Enjoy good health."},{"Patient":"I had whooping cough in February, since recovering I thought the soreness in my chest would heal itself. However, when I cough now, my upper chest deep inside hurts.

The pain is often very bad and can make general daily activities very difficult.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query and an elucidate history..The history of so many varied symptoms some related and some non-related with normal ultrasonography and some blood investigations are suggestive of you need to have:A detailed clinical and Physical examination by a a MD Physician. This is very important as there can be some syndromes mimicking these. You say the following history:Abdominal and back-pain- are indicative of retroperitoneal structure involvement; 2 late periods can be general illhealth and may not be a major issue unless accompanied by heavy bleeding or so.Achy sides and bruised coccyx can be due to fibro-myalgia associated with infection, stress and anxiety of not getting well. Same goes for the abs and both sides of abdomen.Skin can be rough due to deficiency of vitamins. Since you have not noted any sym,ptoms related to the intestinal problems like bloating , loose motions or so , all these problems can be related to the kidney infection which is not diagnosed and treated well. I would hence advise you the following:First of all get the urine and blood culture and sensitivity done to get an idea about the infecting organisms. Routine tests of blood, urine and stool. Intravenous pyelography and CT scan of the abdomen. Cysto-urethroscopy and Urologist's opinion.Once a proper diagnosis is made the treatment can be planned perfectly to get the results. This will be in the form of a long-term antibiotic, multivitamins and so on.

I quit smoking around three months ago and seem to get more and more respiratory issues since quitting. What s going on right now is the most serious and scary feeling I have ever had. For the past four days+ I have had a severe cough that is not helped by any medications . Wheezing on expiration, crackles, and SOB accompany the cough. I also feel as though it is only my left lung , as I can actually feel crackling on the left side, and yet, it seems the only position I am able to experience any relief is by laying on my right side. I had a doc at an ER listen to my lungs(while I was working) and he said he was 99% sure I am experiencing cough inducing asthma . I have never had asthma and I have been to an allergy specialist in the past. I am worried it is more serious at this point(due to my delay in seeking MD consult). If you have any suggestions of a diagnosis and or things I can do to get temporary relief until I am able to get to a pulmonologist , it would be greatly appreciated.

So ,i request to sir kindly guide us for the treatment of the same.","Doctor":"Dear Mr Mehra, If your skin comes up in hives or circular red itchy lesions (with central clearing) that disappears on its own or after medications (usually antihistamines) in a few hours, you are most likely suffering from a condition called urticaria. This can also manifest with swelling under the skin or swelling on lips and tongue called angioedema. This is due to histamine release that may be spontaneous or a secondary trigger like scratching (physical), cold or heat (temperature change) or related to hormonal imbalance. Conditions such as diabetes, underactive thyroid, or other autoimmune diseases make it worse when they are uncontrolled and a proportion of patients with urticaria have 'autoimmune urticaria' while in others it may be idiopathic. High-dose long-acting antihistamines for 3 months (minimum duration) may provide extended relief when stopped but may need to be continued for longer. Fexofenadine 180mg and cetirizine 10mg twice daily is the usual choice. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi there. I have always had a very steady menstrual cycle. I am overweight but working on losing it.

Asthma is also a result of allergy. You must take your asthma medicines regularly which are normally a monteleukast, an antihistaminics and inhaled steroids. You should consult a pulmonologist who will regularize your treatment and once your allergy is controlled, your symptoms will subside. Fast beating of heart could be because of the disease or even because of medicines.

Flomist is a steroid but since it is a spray very little quantity actually enters the blood, hence side effects are minimal.

Your symptoms could be due to migraine, tension headache, blocked sinuses or even temporal arteritis. We would need a more complete history to find out whats going on. The itchy feeling is not related to this and could be something totally separate. What I would suggest is that you take steam inhalation and drink a lot of warm fluids.

High-dose non-sedating antihistamines are suggested such as Allegra 180mg once daily, cetirizine 10mg at lunch time and evening for a week then lower to one tablet daily for a month.

Many children are misdiagnosed as antibiotic allergy in such situations but it is important you keep this at the back of your mind should this occur in the future. Levocetirzine syrup and antibiotics should be continued and levocetirizine upto twice daily for at least one week.

However, I started getting a tighhtness and tingling all over my body with each cough. Finally after my coughing spell stopped I was fine. However now if I cough or sneeze I am getting the same feeling. Should I be concerned or is it just because the orginial episode was so intense?","Doctor":"Hello. When somethings goes the wrong way in the wind pipe, the cough is always very aggressive. It is the body's desperate attempt to remove the offending substance. It needs to be removed immediately, otherwise it may plug the bronchi and lead to lung collpase and post obstructive pneumonia. It is important for you to tell what were you eating. If it was a solid substance such as a peanut, get your X-ray done and consult a doctor immediately. If it was a liquid, most probably nothing would go wrong. However consult a doctor if the cough persists for more than 24 hours.

I usually take the tabulets Telecast L, Synasma, Topceff 200 which is prescribed by doctor for allergy","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for your query. I think you are suffering from allergic rhino-sinusitis. I think for sinusitis you are suffering from heavy head. Please go for a x-ray para-nasal sinuses to exclude chronic sinusitis and polypoid sinus diseases. If anyhting found on x-ray, a CT scan of para-nasal sinuses may be done to properly evaluate it. If any polypoidal changes occur in the sinuses then FESS ( functional endoscopic sinus surgery ) can be done to remove it permanently. Otherwise you should continue to take telecast L, Synasma but not Topceff 200 for prolonged period. In addition to that you may consult an allergist and may go for skin prick test and specific IgE tests to detect specific allergen and immunotherapy to that allergen so that you can be protected from that allergen. I also advise you to go for a spirometry with bronchodialator reversibility to confirm the diagnosis of asthma and management of it properly. I think all these will give you remission of these symptoms. You can try our premium services to get further answers on this issues if you have further queries.

Soy allergy is not very common and a soy-free diet is very difficult and almost impossible to continue for more than a few weeks. If you have a problem with drugs such as pain killers (NSAIDs) or aspirin, occasionally salicylates in tea can cause such problems as it gets concentrated. Hives on skin, vomiting after ingestion of foods (within 1 hr usually) is a sign of allergy and needs to be checked in detail.
