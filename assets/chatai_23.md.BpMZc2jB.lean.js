This problem may be caused by conditions like: anemia, fever, or even uncontrolled blood pressure. More severe conditions include, congenital heart problems (present since birth) or heart valve problems like stenosis (not enough blood flow through the valve or regurgitation: a valve that doesn’t close properly and leaks).Each of this condition causes a murmur. So, I would recommend her to do some lab test including a complete blood count, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a lipidogram. Also, it is necessary to consult a cardiologist and to do an electrocardiogram and echocardiography to check if there is any presence of congenital heart problem or an abnormal heart valve that cause this murmurs.

My heart is pounding often without reason.  I am very well otherwise.  I exercise often (no cardiovascular exercises) and I have a little bloodcholesterol which I control through diet.  I am 63 and a female.","Doctor":"Hello,Brief answer: No relation is between bounding heart and lipid-lowering drugs, complaint needs to be assessed.Explanation: My opinion is that in your condition, you are doing far well. Exercising regularly without any chest pain or fatigue or even dyspnea that means your cardiac condition is good. Taking antihyperlipidemic drugs is even better to lower the level of cholesterol and to improve morbidity in our patients. But there is no relation with your complaint. Bounding of the heart needs some clarification, if that means some palpitations that is an issue. I suggest my patients the following: •     General and local cardiac examination•     Electrocardiograph and echocardiogramThe information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about other medical conditions such as diabetes or hypertension also specific details about heart palpitations.Conclusion: I suggest you check with your general physician if any palpitations experienced.Hope I have answered your query.

With Gall bladder sludge and stones there are higher chances of infections in biliary tree leading cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis so it's better to remove gall bladder when it's functioning decreased. In our practice we use to access gall bladder status in follow up in such patients and whenever there are gall stones or sludge in ultrasound or patients have discomfort with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux(GERD) we convince the patient to go for cholecystectomy. In your case symptoms of GERD  are present so you can follow up your doctor with proton pump inhibitors for symptomatic relief with regular sonography for gall bladder sludge, if your symptoms improve with medication and with no evidence of gb sludge or stone you can do better with medication alone otherwise if symptoms not relieved with or without gall bladder sludge/stone you can move forward for cholecystectomy.

I am 5 1 135 lbs and eat very healthy. I exercise 2 times a week with cardio and weight lifting. I got my test results back to check liver enzymes and my ALT is high. The range should be 6-29 and mine is 35. I looked back on my previous tests when I was under another doctor s care BEFORE I was taking cholesterol medication and it was 28. The range they showed though was from 0-40 as acceptable, not 6-29. This most recent test was done because I was diagnosed with a benign hemangioma on my liver which was found incidentally looking for something else, a benign fatty mass on my kidney. I am also wondering if my high ALT is the reason my glucose is so high. It is 119. Before when I was tested under my other doctor when my ALT was low my glucose was low too. It was 92 so I feel there could be a connection between the 2 readings. So while my cholesterol is low, 174, due to the statins, my ALT and glucose are high as well. My current cholesterol reading after going through a life style change WITHOUT statins is 264. Do you think it s the statins that are causing my high ALT readings? Or is it the benign hemangioma on my liver? I am also concerned my medications are affecting my glucose negatively. I ate less healthy when my glucose was low. Now that I take care of myself, it s higher. The only difference I can see is statins.","Doctor":"Hi, dearI have gone through your question. I can understand your concern.Your ALT level is normal. No need to worry about your ALT level. There is minor lab to lab variation and instrument and kit wise variation in result. So no need to worry about ALT. Statin is not responsible for that. liver hemangioma is accidental finding and it is also not responsible. Statin does not increase the blood glucose level.

I am now 49.  I cannot remember what temperature is too cold or too hot outside for me to be outdoors.  Can you please answer this for me?  Thanks you!!!","Doctor":"Hello,Brief answer: As long as you take your blood thinners and your INR level is within normal range, nothing to be worried about.Explanation: My opinion is that after mechanical valve replacement the most important challenge is to keep your clotting profile within acceptable level, that means international normalized ratio or INR level between 2and 3 roughly, anticoagulants is a must and that is more important. Too cold atmosphere may predispose to slow blood flow and tendency to clot, but you need to take care of your medication.I suggest my patients the following: Follow up your clotting profile, avoid missing doses or adding drugs without physician supervision. The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about your last INR level and the medications you take.Conclusion: I suggest you check your INR.Hope I have answered your query.

Explanation: My opinion is that heart palpitations have many causes. Simple causes are more common such as anxiety, stress, excess coffee, and anemia. Other diseases as thyroid problems and hypertension are also causes. In your case, you have accompanying symptoms such as lightheadedness and dyspnea and that is a source of worry. I suggest my patients the following: general and local heart examination is a must , EKG and echocardiogram to see any structural or functional defects are present.The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion.

TWO DAY'S LATER MY HEART IS HURTING BAD. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF POSSIBLE THEY HIT THOSE STENS IN MY HEART ?","Doctor":"Hello,Brief answer: No chance that old stents in your heart be affected by simple diagnostic cardiac catheterization.Explanation: My opinion is that coronary artery stents are placed in coronary vessels to prevent vessel occlusion by a thrombus. With adherence to anti-ischemic medications and lifestyle modification the preventive rule is completed. Diagnostic coronary angiogram is even more simple procedure, just staining your coronary vessels with a nonionic dye to see if any obstruction or lesions are detected in the study, no wiring or invasive maneuvers done in diagnostic procedure. So hitting your stents is a far- fetched.The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about their coronary angiogram report and if any problems in their medications or recurrent typical chest pain is present.Conclusion: I suggest you stick to your medications, if any chest pain developed please revise your physician.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Mahmmad Gamal"},{"Patient":"Hey, I had my gallbladder removed 2 weeks ago and I started to have lower leg(in the right leg, left side of my calf) pain today.

Sometimes in prolonged bedridden patients they do develop deep vein thrombosis which causes pain and swelling in leg...but I don't find it in your history..

You seem to have jaundice which is the yellowish discoloration of skin. This will cause the yellow colour of the skin.To get to the cause you first need to understand which type of Jaundice you have. You need to see a Doctor and get a lab test which will distinguish conjugated bilirubin from unconjugated type. Based on this, you will be able to idenitfy the cause and then get the appropriate treatment. Blood disorders can take a longer time to treat than Hepatitis. Both will present with similar symptoms, however. Please follow up after you have the results.

Continue these 2 medications to avoid constipation. Restrict salt intake to 2-3 grams and restrict proteins intake ,i.e. avoid pulses, meat, milk & milk products. Because protein restriction is needed to avoid complications of cirrhosis. You can give him juices and vegetables soup.Well, liver transplant is another option but your husband may not be fit for surgery.

So, depending on blood pressure reading at or shortly after asthmatic attack is inefficient. Low blood pressure readings in your case, if away from asthmatic attacks and measured accurately that is an indication to lower your anti-hypertensives dosage or even stop it in some occasions to prevent low blood pressure complications.I suggest my patients the following: stop Amlodipine, monitor blood pressure readings, and follow-up.Conclusion: I suggest you measure blood pressure away from asthmatic attacks and revise your physician.Hope I have answered your query.

I have not had chest pains.","Doctor":"Hello,Brief answer: Troponin level may vary according to acute heart insult also from lab to lab. Sometimes false positive troponin present.Explanation: My opinion is that troponin level is used to diagnose acute coronary syndrome. Chest pain and dynamic or ischemic changes in EGC are an indication to measure troponin. So, it is not any time investigation such as CBC. Positive troponin points to myocardial injury, so anti-ischemic measurements should be initiated. Sometimes false positive troponin presents with renal failure for example. Also, variation in lab results may be an error in lab procedures. In your case, having no past history of chest pain makes diagnosis of ischemic heart is far-fetched. I suggest my patients the following if positive troponin. Do an EGC, echocardiogram and if those suggest myocardial ischemia, anti-ischemic measures are initiated on spot.The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about other risk factors to develop ischemic heart disease, smoking, obesity, family history, etc. Also ask about diabetes as in diabetics silent ischemia happens (that means without chest pain).Conclusion: I suggest you do your thallium study as soon as possible to see if any ischemia develops in your heart and so treat accordingly.Hope I have answered your query.

My friend has been struggling for a week or two now with her blood pressure not coming down - it goes higher with each visit to the doctor. The latest result was about 170/150 ! The doctor says he does not know what is wrong and she even went for a second opinion, with the same answer. Medication is not helping and blood sugar also elevated - 11. What could the cause be ?","Doctor":"Hello,Brief answer: Persistent high blood pressure needs control and follow-up, blood sugar alone cannot diagnose diabetes.Explanation: My opinion is that persistent high blood sugar on multiple occasions in and out of doctors office is a diagnosis of hypertension that needs to be controlled by lifestyle modification, exercise and if not, medication. Random blood sugar alone is not good enough to diagnose diabetes. Other tests like oral glucose tolerance test and hemoglobin A1C are essential to diagnose (one of them is good). Also, if diagnosed needs to be controlled first with lifestyle, some medications like Metformin or maybe more, and that according to type of diabetes, age, risk factors, etc.I suggest my people the following measure blood pressure at home with a good technique and that you can check on you tube videos. Do other tests like HBA1C, lipid profile, etc. The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion. If someone comes to me with this condition I would ask them about risk factors, smoking, and anxiety issues.Conclusion: I suggest you home blood pressure monitoring and recheck you medication with your doctor.

My current problem is with ammonia and the high levels in my blood that is being treated by injestion of 60 mg of laculose x4/day. Talk about no life outside a bathroom! What could be causing the elevated ammonia levels beside my liver?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to Health Care Magic. I read carefully your query and I understand your concern.You had  a transplant liver, ammonia is the  product of bacterial activity on protein in intestine and then it is absorbed  and transported to the liver and the liver degrades into end  products and waste products, having a liver disease cause the high level of ammonium in blood.The component of the production of ammonia are diet protein and bacterial flora of the intestine, so you should reduce the protein intake through your diet and specially you should avoid the intake of cheese, peanut butter ,onion, mayonnaise ,ketchup etc.The other component is the bacterial flora in intestine, for this you can take Lactulose that is a laxative that alters bacterial flora and makes fewer organisms available to produce ammonium, and you take it, you can use with or without the Lactulose antibiotics e.g. Neomicin take from oral rout induce the reduction of ammonia production by the intestinal bacterial flora.Except the diet and medication to keep reduced the ammonium blood level you should take a healthy diet and  have a healthy lifestyle to keep healthy the liver and this include a healthy weigh that avoid complications e.g. high blood pressure, so you should: eat five serving of fruits and vegetable every day; eat lean meat; eat whole grain breads; increase the fiber in your diet; drink low-fat dairy products; keep a low salt and low fat diet; avoid alcohol intake; staying hydrated and avoid grapefruit because of their effects on the immunosuppressant drugs that you take to maintain the transplant liver.

WHat do you think?","Doctor":"Dear Madam,Welcome to Health Care Magic. I read your query and I understand your concern.I think that there is not any problem with your liver enzymes if you drink only on special occasions. You do not mention what kind of alcoholic beverage did you take, since different beverages contain different percentage of alcohol. I ensure you that your liver enzymes are just slightly elevated or not elevated at all for the amount of alcohol you took just in one special occasion. Liver Enzymes are normally elevated in binge drinking or chronic drinkers. Alcohol, to be more specific ethanol - the active ingredient, damages liver cells and spills the liver enzymes in the blood flow when is consumed in large amounts and regularly. Alcohol doesn't have just negative effects on your health, on the contrary, taking in consideration your age, I would recommend you consume 1 oz of ethanol, or 1 glass of wine a week, in order to help maintenance of cholesterol balance in your blood.Hope I answered to your question.

Thank you Regards Luiza Russell","Doctor":"hi.what's the size of your liver lesion (hemangioma)? usually, when a liver lesion reaches more than or equal to 5cm, it produces symptoms such as abdominal pain.. this pain is usually dull, intermittent, epigastric to right upper quadrant of the abdomen in location, occasionally with radiation to the back, flanks and sometimes upper back area. it is best if you consult with a general surgeon or a gastroenterologist with regards to this problem. treatment (medical and/or surgical) will be directed accordingly.hope this helps.good day!!~dr.kaye"},{"Patient":"Hi, I had gastric bypass surgery on 2003, the last few months I have been having issues with digestion. I recently had an Upper GI/small bowel series and it was determined that the barium was passing through from the pouch to the portions of the excluded stomach. Also my bile ducts were minimally dilated. What does this mean I have a f/u with my surgeon who did the gastric bypass.Thanks for your help","Doctor":"hi.since you had previous abdominal surgery with proximity to the biliary tree, a minimal dilatation in your bile ducts is essentially normal, especially if your asymptomatic and clinically well. a follow-up check up would be best. but you need not worry about anything.hope this helps.good day!!~dr.kaye"},{"Patient":"Hi.

Should I be worried or is this normal?","Doctor":"hi.if you have a ruptured spleen, you wouldn't be able to have the time to spend here as its symptoms are usually acute in character. usually, a severe abdominal pain, flank discoloration, decreasing blood count and probably other constitutional symptoms like fever. what you're experiencing right now might be a muscle strain or positional. if it's persistent and progressive, a follow-up with your doctor would be best. abdominal CT-scan could easily rule-out if you have a ruptured spleen.hope this helps.good day!!~dr.kaye"},{"Patient":"I had my gall bladder removed on July 15th.

I have tried various shampoos, tee tree oil, rubbin ghis scalp with baby oil. Any remedies for this?","Doctor":"Hello,Brief answer: A spontaneous nosebleed is common, dry scalp is a bit of concern.Explanation: My opinion is that nosebleed in 90% of cases is of unknown cause and happen spontaneously. So nothing to worry about. If bleeding is severe or frequently happen from same side then you need to check with an ENT doctor. Manage nosebleed with head down and close both nostrils for about 10 minutes. About dry scalp, you have done a very good management so far but at that point it may be some sort of psoriasis.

I read your query and I understand your concerns.The description you are making, makes me suspect of jaundice, also referred to as icterus, which is the yellow staining of the skin and sclerae (the whites of the eyes) by abnormally high blood levels of the bile pigment, bilirubin. Except the yellowish color and weight loss, does your son have any signs or symptoms, in order to make me easier helping you? The lifestyle of your son makes me suspect of hepatitis, which could be type A due to the ingestion of infected food, hepatitis B or C if your son has had unprotected sex or injected drugs. With such a presentation on my clinic, I would perform at least liver function tests, complete blood count (CBC), electrolyte panel, lipase levels, and urinalysis. Blood testing for exposure to hepatitis may also be ordered. Additional blood testing may be ordered based on the initial results. Depending on the results of initial blood tests, further studies may be needed to help diagnose the underlying disease process.Hope I helped with my answer.

My Tramadol entake is about 12 pills a week.","Doctor":"Hello Madam,Thank you for your question and welcome to Health Care Magic. I read your query carefully and i understand your concerns.Gamma Glutamyltransferase or GGT is a liver enzyme that has traditionally been measured to detect liver health and function and alcohol consumption. The normal range for GGT in your blood is 0 to 51 international units/liter, so your test report is slightly elevated. The most common cause of increased GGT level is overuse of alcohol, as in your case 3 glasses of wine a day are considered high. GGT blood levels are usually high when the liver is damaged, and in order to prevent further damage, I would suggest you to cease alcohol, or at least decrease the amount of consumption.

Does this mean my lever is already affected? please answere thank you","Doctor":"Hello Madam,Thank you for your question and welcome to Health Care Magic. I read carefully your query and I understand your concerns. 1. Normal levels of Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT) may slightly vary depending on the individual laboratory's reference values. In the laboratory I work a value of 36.80 is considered normal, since the range which we consider normal  is from 5 to 40 units per liter of serum.2. Even though your liver transaminases (SGOP and SGPT)are normal in my opinion, I would recommend you a nutrient-rich, plant-based diet, foods rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, in addition to being low in fat. Green leafy vegetables, broccoli, carrots, squash and a variety of fresh fruits should be staples of your diet, along with nuts, whole grains, low-fat dairy products and lean meats.3. Fast Blood Sugar value is high. Normally, a value more than 7.0 mmol/l  or higher on two separate tests indicates that you have diabetes. I would recommend you seek a consult with your local endocrinologist. 4. As I understand, the thing you are most concerned of, is if your test results show that your liver is affected from cancer. My impression is that your laboratory results show nothing to worry, and I don't think that your liver is affected.Hope this answers your question.

I read carefully your query and I understand your concerns.Increment of liver enzymes is a known side effect of the usage of statins, which are medications used for lowering blood cholesterol. Two liver enzymes in particular (SGPT or ALT, and SGOT or AST) may be mildly elevated, but in my opinion it is safe to continue treatment unless they rise by three times the upper limit of normal and in that case the statin should be stopped. The damage is not permanent and when statins are stopped the liver tests return to normal. Normal values of SGPT are considered 5 -50 U/L and for SGOT- 7-40 U/L. Bilirubin level is also slightly high, but i wouldn't consider it problematic.  For the moment, your blood lipid fractions are in their normal range. Since your treating doctor has considered reasonable stoping your medication, I would suggest you to monitor your cholesterol level, and if it starts to increase despite your diet, I would recommend you to start rosuvastatin, which is considered the drug of choice for treating high blood cholesterol.In addition to low fat diet that you are following, I would also recommend to you physical exercise, like 30 minutes walking a day, avoiding meet, dairy, , deep fried foods, and egg yolks and try to eat green or dark green leafy vegetables and fruit, and try healthy alternatives of cooking, such as baking, broiling and roasting.Hope I helped with my answer.

I read carefully your query and I understand your concern.The nausea and vomiting are related with the gallbladder surgery, it maybe happens especially when your children eat fatty foods.Bile function is the digestion and absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins in the small intestine.Bile is produced by the liver and then delivered to the digestive tract, but a good quantity is also stored in the gallbladder for later use. One important function of the gallbladder is to regulate bile secretion (not only store it) so the small intestine has the proper amounts of bile when needed.If the gallbladder is removed the liver will be continuously transporting bile to the digestive tract, but in smaller quantities and is not uncommon  to experience the following  side effects after gallbladder removal: Indigestion, loss of appetite, chronic diarrhea, stomach and intestinal pain, nausea and vomiting after eatingThese occur because the body can no longer digest fats properly.For these reason I recommend you to made as routin a low-fat diet to your children and educate them to maintain these diet during their live to avoid the repeating nausea and vomiting sensation.Hope this answers your question.

It has no effect on bringing creatine (must be creatinine, which you are refering so) or liver enzymes back to normal.Increased creatinine level is an indication of kidney dysfunction.

At 27 weeks, I started experiencing pain under the right rib and in behind the right should blade after i eat a meal...esp worse later in the day. I was out of town at the time and all indications from what I read online pointed towards gallbladder pain. I eliminated all fats from my diet and followed a strict gallbladder diet. This seems to help minimize the pain. When i returned from vacation, I went for an ultrasound of the abdomen and was surprised to see there were no gallstones found. The ultrasound did show the gallbladder contains a 5mm polyp. The common bile duct is normal in calibre and no intrahepatic biliary dilation. Liver was normal in size...kidneys both normal...spleen unremarkable. Poor visualization of the pancreas due to obscuring bowel gas. The mid portion of the abdominal arota is obscured by bowl gas. i still have this pain if i stray from the strict gallbladder diet.

I want to calm you wishing a happy end to your pregnancy and a good baby, because the polip of gallbladder I think is totally innocent in this right hypocondrium pain of yours.

I went to see my general practitioner who requested another blood & urine test. Elevated liver enzymes count came back again. He referred me to a gastrointestinal and a kidney specialist. The gastroinstestinal specialist requested more blood tests, an ultra sound of the liver and intestinal organs, and I also had a liver biopsy. The ultra sound came back clear. I also had a colonscopy which came back clear. The liver biopsy showed sign of an infection but the pathologist was unsure what it could be. The gastrointestinal dr asked for another blood test and the markers for hepititis all came back negative except one - ana. The kidney specialist ruled out anything on his part because the lab erroroneously entered 100 to my age when determining the blood work results.

Should I be concerned or do I take some tylonal and rest. It feels like a ruptured cyst ( I have had those before)","Doctor":"Hi there,Thanks for posting in HCM.The two most common cause for pancreatitis are alcohol intake and gallstones.So if you have have the habit of drinking alcohol, you need to stop it. Get a abdominal scan done to look for gallstones and if present the gallbladder has to be removed.The sudden intense pain after lifting weight may be due cramps and not due to bursting of the fallopian tube.You can take bentyl for relief.Regards."},{"Patient":"yes, my daughter has been having problems and doctor said was not gall bladder, but they finally did a hida scan and it showed that her gall bladder was only working at 19%. he sent her to a surgeon and he said these scans were not 100% sure.

I am beginning to get some mild itching feelings, though I am trying not to itch it. Tonight the new PA told me to take another shower and apply Pemetherin for 8-10 hours. Twice yesterday and this morning I applied Triamcinolone Cream. I will apply that after I wash off the Pemetherin tomorrow morning for 2 weeks.

Coming towards the other symptoms like excessive thirst an drowsiness , research studies shows a  VERY STRONG ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HEPATITIS C AND DIABETES.. so check her random glucose levels plus HbA1c levels..to rule out DIABETES  Last but not the least is constipation and disorientation.....they  may signifies the HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY < one of complications of chronic liver disease > get her ultrasound done to look for LIVER TEXTURE , ASCITES , PORTAL VEIN DIAMETER AND SIZE OF SPLEEN....avoid constipation and use stool softeners and ISPAGHOL HUSK....

Have been advised by a Laproscopic Surgeon to undergo CT scan, for better investigation of both conditions (cysts and stones). Current period is extended, am already on the 10th day - it is not heavier than usual, but definitely lasted more than the usual 5days. I ve had no discomfort/ pain since the episode 3 months ago. My questions: 1) Does CT scan investigate both conditions better than an Ultrasound (which I ve already gotten done)? 2) What are the success rates and complications involved in surgery involving both organs (Gall Bladder and Ovaries), in my case? 3) Should I wait for my period to stop completely OR can I go ahead with the CT scan while period is still on?","Doctor":"Thanks for your consultation at HCM: Ovarian cyst and Gall bladder stones represents two different conditions with different etiologies and requires different management...I have gone through your case and my advise in response to your querries is as: 1: certainly CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS STUDY is far more superior than ULTRASOUND in order to investigate both of these conditions... 2: As far as sugery for GALL STONES is concerned it is highly successful but there are certain risks like general anesthesia and postoperative complications but as a whole the complications rate are less than .5%..so SURGERY for gallstones is the best option for you if u experience symptoms. your doctor will decide when u undergo elective surgery for gall stones.         ON the other hand , managemnt of ovarian cyst varies and it mostly depends upon the size of cyst which can easily measured with ultrasound....On serial ultrasounds if the size of cyst is increasing and it has got septation with solid components then it requires surgical intervention.. you better consult a gynaecolgist regarding this issue..... 3: lastly there is no contraindication of CT SCAN during periods you can do it.....

It could be related to anxiety or physical activity. Coming to this point, I would recommend you to closely monitor her blood pressure values, frequently during the day, in sitting position after 10 minutes of total relax and write those values down. If her blood pressure values are persistently high, I would recommend consulting with her doctor for a physical exam and some blood lab tests to investigate for secondary causes of high blood pressure. In such case antihypertensive therapy may be needed. You should know that uncontrolled long-term (chronic) hypertension is an independent cardiovascular risk factor, which means that it leads to an increased risk for stroke or heart attack.Hope I have answered your query.

I dont think I can stand this, I was fine before. I have nausea heartburn and constant pain. Any suggestions of anything else this could be?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Gall bladder surgery is not free form complications. Your doctor meant that the gall bladder contained a lot of concentrated bile which is called sludge and if allow to stay might form stones. That might have caused you the discomfort you were experiencing earlier.When gall bladder is removed then there is no place for the bile to collect and it is directly released in to the small intestine. This causes discomfort associated with eating and digestion in some people and improves with time. The nick in the bile duct is to be evaluated in detail for any stricture or leak. Probably another imaging procedure might be required to know if the bile is draining properly and whether any corrective measures are needed to reduce your nausea and pain abdomen.

This is an inflammation of gall bladder wall and appears with thickening on ultrasound scan.If there is no stones or sludge then it is acalculous cholecystitis and is a result of other medical or surgical illness.

It will help to know by how much your liver enzymes are raised and then treat any condition that is causing it.Since the doctor has told not to worry therefore I think the liver enzymes are not very high to cause a concern. However you might have vitamin D deficiency and this requires you to take supplement. The pap smear showing hyperplasia requires discussion with the pathologist.

We cannot  predict the method of death in any person having chronic condition like cirrhosis. If he is unconscious most of the time then it might suggest hepatic encephalopathy.This is a condition when the toxic metabolites are not getting cleared by liver and are accumulating in the brain.

It's true that raising of SGPT suggests liver cells damage, but I think you shouldn't be very worried to that. There are several viral conditions that affect children of this age that may raise SGPT. Hepatitis A, is one of the viral conditions that affects almost 98% of people and they don't even know about it, because its symptoms are just like a simple flu, or common cold, associated with diarrhea, vomits, fevers, weakness, lose motions etc.Anyway it is not a serious condition and it is not contagious.I would recommend you to repeat that analysis after a couple of days after your daughter is recovered from this viral condition to see if the level of SGPT is normalized. HbsAg, and anti HCV is another analysis to be done to rule out Hepatitis B and C.For now, just maintain a supportive care of your daughter at home. Give her liquids, vitamins and if she has fevers you may use Acetaminophen syrup to keep it under control.

As you are on Isoniazid for last 2.5 months and one of the severe side effects of this drug is hepatitis, but its very rare. Risk is increases as the age advances, so if you are more than 50 years of age, then chances of developing hepatitis is more as compared to younger ones.       Levels of ALT and AST are increased during 1st few months of starting treatment, but usually ALT levels return to normal after 3-4 months of treatment.        So in your case, as you have started isoniazid since 2.5 months and levels of ALT is not that much high, so at this point it doesn't seem to be an urgency and need any kind of evaluation, but i would recommend you to repeat the ALT and AST levels every monthly to rule out hepatitis. If the levels are consistently high after 4 months, then you need to consult a physician and need to be discussed about this.      Hope this answers your question and let me know if you have any further relevant queries, i will be happy to guide you further."},{"Patient":"I had lab work and discovered my alt liver enzyme was 179. After surgery I started taking percocet before surgery I took plain oxycodone. The percocet had elevated the alt to 87 a year before surgery so they put me on oxcodone I told the surgeons nurse this but she said my liver enzymes were fine to now take percoct. But now after a month and a half they have really gone up. So today they ordered plain oxycodone and did another Hep test but I haven t ever in my 51 years done anything to have hep and tested negative a year ago. My question is will my liver recover again? I am have a ultrasound on my abdomen next week. I thought maybe I could be sensitive to gluten.","Doctor":"Hi, your liver seems to be a bit sensitive to acetaminophene one of the two composers of percocet. I don't know if you are a drinker and if yes your liver recovery will start with stopping it (ALCOHOL) together with acetaminophen of course. There are many other painkillers in the pharmaceutical market more accepatables for liver. Meanwhile I'd suggest Legalon 140 mg three times a day and Vit E 100 mg three times a day, for a month, then test again your ALT liver enzyme."},{"Patient":"Hi I just got some blood tests back which were done as part my routene check up My SGPT is 160 and SGOT is 280al so my tryglycirides at 450. My cholestrol,sugar and blood pressure is normal. Can you tell me what should I do to get these numbers back in order ? Do I need urgent medical attention ? Is my liver damaged ?","Doctor":"Hello,      I had gone through your reports carefully and can understand your concern very well.      SGPT and SGOT are liver enzymes which levels are increased during any kind of liver injury like hepatitis, fatty liver, cirrhosis, carcinoma, etc.       I hope you have done your lipid profile with fasting blood, because if its random, then chances of triglycerides of getting high are more. So if not in fasting mode, then i would advise you to repeat the lipid profile after 12 hours of fasting. Also check your HDL and LDL cholesterol levels. Also want to know your age and weight, taking any medications for long term illenss, drinking alcohol or not. You can get back to me anytime after all these information.      Because your SGPT and SGOT are very high (normal is less than 45), some kind of liver involvement is already there for sure. So i would recommend you to go for ultrasound of abdomen to find out the liver injury.      Triglycerides are very very high and it definitely damage your liver in long run. As per my opinion, you might be having fatty liver due to high TGs. If i were your treating doctor, then i would recommend you few life style modifications like......1. Take high fiber diet like green leafy vegetables, fresh fruits, etc.2. Avoid oily and junk food.3. Do regular brisk walking for at least 40 minutes a day 4. Stay away from alcohol or smoking5. Do regular meditations to lessen your stress      Follow these for 3 months and repeat your liver and lipid profile. If triglycerides remains high, then you need to take statin group of drug. Because this is a prescription drug, you need to consult your local doctor and discuss about the diagnosis and further line of management.       Hope this answers your question and let me know directly if you have any further follow up queries."},{"Patient":"hello sir .. plz help me out .this is my father USG ABDOMEN report ...3 things mention in the report but i can t undertsnd ... 1-free fluid noted in adbomen .no pleural effusion noticed. 2-cirrhotic liver with ascitis. 3-left renal calculus . no significant calyectasis.....and one more thg he s diabetic .... doctor recommended these medicines liv52d/s tab lasilectone tab ursocol 150 USG ABDOMEN REPORT - Liver: is normal in size &shows coarse echopattern with irregular margains.no foca lesion is seen in the hepatic parenchyma .intrahepatic biliary channel are not dilated..

IMPRESSION:-*cirrhotic liver with ascitis.. left renal calculus.no significant calyectasis......... plz sir tellme is it any danger in report .and how his liver working properly ... and things","Doctor":"The major concern with this ultrasound is the cirrhotic liver with ascites. When the liver is badly damaged with scarring (cirrhosis), it doesn't work very well. Blood flowing through the scarred liver gets backed up and creates high pressure in the liver, which in turn results in fluid leaking in to the abdomen (ascites). Unfortunately, cirrhosis with ascites may be an indication that his liver is starting to fail. The kidney shows that a stone is present, but that does not seem to be causing any problems. No other findings are of significance. What needs to be done now is to take a sample of the ascites fluid and determine if it is truly related to the liver cirrhosis or something else. Liver disease is the most common cause of ascites, but other conditions may cause it as well, and treatment may differ. Further investigation of the liver status may also be needed, such as a biopsy. Usually the spleen is enlarged when ascites develops with a cirrhotic liver, and his spleen is normal, so perhaps another more treatable condition is present. Liver failure from cirrhosis is the worst case scenario. Further evaluation should help define his situation better. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello I am dentist, and I would like to inquire about the effect of lidocaine when a patient has liver disease. Lidocaine is metabolized by liver, and with liver dysfunction, half-life of Lidocaine will be prolonged. Will that lead to Lidocaine toxicity or other systemic condition? Dr. AJ","Doctor":"Dear Dr AJ  HiThanks for your queryI appreciate your concern for the safety of Lidocaine in a patient with liver disease.Lignocaine clearance is reduced in patients with liver disease and appears to be a sensitive index of liver dysfunction. The average elimination half-life of Lidocaine may be increased from 1.6 hours in normal patients  to more than 6 hours in patients with severe liver disease this will lead to the systemic toxicity which is more commonly seen following inadvertent intravascular injection or absorption of the local anesthetic from the site of administration.The systemic side effects that can occur due to toxic doses of Lidocaine include:Involvement of CNS: Light-headedness, visual and auditory disturbances, and circumoral and tongue numbness and a metallic taste. At higher concentrations, nystagmus and muscular twitching occur, followed by tonic-clonic convulsions.Involvement of CVS:Fall in BP and pulse rateIn patients with liver disease a dosage reduction to one-half the rates for normal would seem appropriate.Hope this answers your query.Rate this answer if you are convinced."},{"Patient":"I take a very low dose high blood pressure medicine.

I would like to tell you that because you had thyroidectomy years ago and now suffering from hypoparathyroidism, which is a common complication after thyroid removal, in my opinion these two (thyroid/parathyroid and elevated LFTs) are not related with each other.      You had elevated LFTs may be due to recent liver resection and so remaining liver tissue is responding to work efficiently and that can increase LFTs for initially few months. You can go for ultrasound of abdomen and discuss with your surgeon to rule out any complication of your liver surgery. If nothing is significant, then mostly your LFTs will be normal within a month or so.       Otherwise, connection between thyroid/parathyroid and 4 times higher LFTs are unlikely.

I would like to tell you that jaundice is very common in newborn after 2nd day of birth and its physiological and most of the times it will go away within 7 to 10 days without any treatment. Rarely bilirubin level goes beyond 18 or 20mg/dl.      If the bilirubin level goes beyond 18, then baby requires phototherapy which consists of UV rays which convert water insoluble bilirubin into soluble form, which can be easily excreted from her body.       Blanket is the other name of home phototherapy, works on same principle and its very common, so i would recommend your daughter to use it to ease the jaundice. It is also effective as long as the baby is healthy. But if the baby is not feeding well or has high grade fever or convulsion, then i would suggest you to admit in Neonatal ICU till the condition improves.       Otherwise no need to worry and use bili blanket to reduce the levels of bilirubin, which mostly become normal within 2 weeks or so.

I would like to tell you that your discomfort in right side of abdomen below ribs is mainly due to liver dysfunction. AS you had fatty liver and also your SGPT levels are high, so problem is in your liver only.       Your doctor rightly prescribed you pantoprazole and udiliv and you should continue these medications. I would also recommend you to do your lipid profile and blood sugar. Your weight is 75 and its very high as per your height, so i would suggest you to lose some weight by doing regular exercise in form of walking, take healthy diet, avoid oily junk food, do meditation, take help of a dietician to plan your diet. You should lose at least 15 kg of your weight.       Fatty liver will also regress once you start to lose weight and take healthy diet.

I would like to enlighten you that GGT levels are mostly raised in case of liver diseases and that too specially in chronic alcoholics. So if you are chronic alcoholic, then high GGT is a sign of liver injury due to alcohol.       Otherwise no other drugs which you have mentioned can increase the levels of GGT in blood. I would suggest you to go for ultrasound of your abdomen to rule out any kind of liver injury.      I would also advise you to stop drinking alcohol, if you are chronic alcoholic, otherwise it can lead to serious consequences.

Kind regards.","Doctor":"Hello,      I had gone through your question carefully and can understand your concern very well.      As you were being treated with macrolides like clindamycin for a week and macrolides most commonly acid stable erythromycin estolate leads to hepatitis like features and that can raise AST and ALT levels. Also incidence of hepatitis like features are high in pregnant women.       So in my opinion, because you were pregnant and treated with macrolides (clindamycin), AST and ALT levels can be high due to antibiotics. No need to worry about it, as it will normalize by itself after discontinuation of drug.       I would suggest you to repeat the AST and ALT levels after a week and it will be normal mostly. Don't get stressed and be relaxed. Also continue your breastfeeding, as it will not have any impact on your baby.

Mostly it may be due to viral hepatitis and requires only supportive treatment. So in your case, i guess it might be mild hepatitis and does not require any kind of medications. Have a proper diet containing high glucose, avoid oily foods, have a fresh fruit juices and take sufficient rest.      The best way to know the recovery of jaundice is to measure ALT levels, which will slowly lower down as the recovery is in progress. So i would suggest you to go for serum ALT levels and if its in normal range, then you have recovered fully.       So don't worry and take enough precautions, so relapse will not occur.

Repeat your SGPT levels and if its on the decreasing side, then you are recovering and wait for few more days.      In case you are diagnosed with chronic hepatitis, then you require few medications to avoid liver injury and transmission of infection to others. You require antiviral medicines like lamivudine.

Even cures in initial stages. But since its too late and also your age factor, you cannot expect miracles in Ayurveda or Allopathy.

The stone in the gallbladder doesn't allow the normal drainage of the bile so it turns in the opposite direction passing to the blood and giving the jaundice. Also from this blockage the liver cells are damaged too.Udiliv is a medication used to dissolve the cholesterol and prevent stone production. But in this case it is obvious that has not any spectacular result!Generally this situation is resolved surgically by removing the gallbladder stone. Unfortunately there is no medication which can dissolve the stone in this stade. Udiliv may be used after the surgical intervention up to one year after.

She has been checked by a heart doctor and a neurolgist. No problems seen.

I do not have my gall bladder. Why would my liver feel so bad. Its burning and just hurting. Feeling bad. no fever. get the sweats here and there. Worried, with no insurance for another month due to a job change.","Doctor":"Hello dear user!Welcome to HCM!If you have had CT scan with contrast it is expected to have yellow/orange stools. It happens because the chemicals that the contrast contains, change stool color. It will happen for a while of time until the contrast is out of the body.The pain and uncomfortable feeling you are experiencing may be due to a higher sensitivity you have against the contrast chemicals. Liver function may have been alternated a little bit, and gastrointenstinal symptoms has showed up. You may have complains related to the vomiting, diarrhea, dyspepsia, heavy feeling in the stomach or right upper part of abdomen.If you have removed the gallbladder these symptoms are likely to be present more often than generally, and you may have problems with the digestion. I recommend you to have light meals and foods for a while of time, till the symptoms get away. Take a lot of drinks. To ease and improve the digestion you may use lactic ferments and ORS since you have had vomits and diarrhea.If you have these concerns for a long time, and the situation doesn't get better please go to your Healthcare center.I hope you will be fine soon.Best regards!DR ERIOL"},{"Patient":"hI , I HAD MY GALL BLADDER REMOVER 4 YEARS AGO , THREE MONTHS AGO I STARTED HAVEING HEART BURN NO MATTER WHAT I ATE , IVE TAKEN NEXEUM AND IT HAS TAKEN CARE OF THE HEARTBURN BUT NOW (STARTED 2 WEEKS AGO I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A BASE BALL STUCK JUST BELOW MY RIB CAGE JUST TO THE RIGHT , ITS NOT PAINFULL JUST UNCOMFORETABE ALL THE TIME","Doctor":"Hello dear user!Welcome to HCM!I understand very well your concern.Since you have removed your gallbladder you will have gastric symptoms and dyspepsia because the biliar acids produced from the liver don't go to the bowel regularly and when you take foods.So you have to keep a balanced diet for a long time, avoid spicy foods, salty and fat foods in your diet.The heartburn can be treated with ranitidine or omeprazole like you have done until now.It seems like you have a gastric inflammation right now since you feel uncomfortable.I would recommend you to see your gastro-enterologist doctor and a gastro-scopy may be required to see your inner upper digestive tract.Take care and I hope you will be fine soon.Kind regards!DR ERIOL."},{"Patient":"Had a dr. appt. today to go over bloodwork...I have Hashimoto, was DX over 10 years, my levels have been changing for 18 months because my antibodies have been high...this last test, dr said my levels for that seem to level out, finally but now last two tests have given concern for liver function...he order more bloodwork but I was wondering if there may be a connection to Hashimoto...I don t drink and never had Hept A or B or C, thanks","Doctor":"Well is not a viral hepatitis doubted for first in the terrain of an autoimmune disease like Hashimoto, but an autoimmune hepatitis too.

If the operation was done more than 5 years ago and if it was done laparoscopic, there is a chance that a stone might form around the clip used for securing the cystic duct.The LFT will help narrow down the diagnosis too.

I suppose the gall bladder surgery was because of stones and that it was done laparoscopic. If so, the findings of the operation are very important. Many small stones could mean that some stones could escape to the common bile duct that could cause cholangitis. That could explain the fever, itchiness, and maybe the redness.

My weight is down with the help of garcinia cambogia(?), but both my amylase and lipase are elevated ( I frequently have elevated amylase, but not very often lipase).

Enzymes are proteins produced by the body to do a particular job. The pancreas produces amylase to break down carbohydrates in food into simple sugars. Lipase is produced by the pancreas to digest fats into fatty acids. Sugars and fatty acids can then be absorbed by the small intestine. Some amylase and lipase can also be found in saliva and in the stomach, but most is made in the pancreas and released into the small intestine.Amylase and lipase are enzymes produced by the pancreas that help to digest food. If the pancreas is damaged, high levels of these enzymes can be detected in the bloodstream.Do not worry about the low triglycerides.

Chronic hepatitis B is defined as HBs Ag positivity that persists for 6 months, as almost in 90% of cases Hbs Ag is cleared by body's own immunity within 6 months. It is also accompanied by Anti Hep B core antibody positivity of IgG type. It would be wise to recheck your Hbs Ag status after 6 months. If positive than other markers of diseases like quantitative PCR for Hep B DNA, Complete blood count, Ultrasound of liver and ALT should be done.Wishing all the best and spontaneous recovery,Dr. Nauman Wazir"},{"Patient":"helo, im idrees. i got my blood tests done and my ALT lvl came out at 92. i was reffered by a medical specialist to undergo an ultra sound of the abdomen and i was diagnosed with liver haemojima. my question is whether my raised ALT level is due to liver haemojima or otherwise. please advise measures to bring down ALT level as well.","Doctor":"HelloLiver hemangioma is a benign tumour of liver made up blood vessels.It is generally an incidental finding and usually doesn't require any treatment.This condition only need follow up.It may require treatment if it is causing symptoms.Most likely liver hemangioma is not relate to raised ALT.Increased ALT may indicate liver injury.It may be due to many reasons like hepatitis,alcohol intake,altered lipid profile,auto immune causes etc.You may need few more investigations like routine hemogram,random blood sugar,lipid profile,renal function test,complete liver function test,viral markers.I suggest tablet ursodeoxycholic acid 300 mg twice daily for three months to my patients.It helps in regeneration of liver cells.Get well soon.Take CareDr.Indu Bhushan"},{"Patient":"My liver levels were normal June 17.

She is asymptomatic. My question is why do they fluate and how long does it take for them to normalize. Another bit of information is she had completely normal labs in Feburary .","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns.Firstly, i must stress that one or a few of the liver function tests should not be interpreted in isolation.The entire hepatic function panel should be ideally be available along with the normal laboratory reference ranges for a meaningful interpretation. You have provided only the AST and ALT values.Therefore, i can only answer in general terms.Serum aminotransferases: are of two types.- alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and- aspartate aminotransferase (AST).Elevations of these are the two of the most useful indicators of liver cell injury. The AST is less liver specific than the ALT.Elevations of the AST level may also be seen in acute muscle injury, (cardiac or skeletal muscle). Mild degrees of ALT level elevation may occasionally be seen in skeletal muscle injury or even after vigorous physical exercise.Disproportionate elevations of the AST and ALT levels when compared with the alkaline phosphatase level arise in diseases that primarily affect hepatocytes (ex; viral hepatitis). The AST/ALT ratio is not very useful in determining the cause of liver injury, except in acute alcoholic hepatitis, wherein, the ratio is usually > 2 and the AST level is 400 IU/mL or lower.Common causes of mild increases in AST and ALT levels is fatty liver disease seen most often in the context of obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and alcohol abuse.The ratio of AST to ALT may give additional clues as to the cause:- In chronic liver disease with early cirrhosis ALT > AST,- In chronic liver disease with established cirrhosis AST > ALT.Extremes of the ratio of AST:ALT may also be sometimes useful:- ratio >2 suggests alcoholic hepatitis, and- Do not worry.It will take around 6 months for the enzymes to be normal again.Hope this answers your question.

Sotalol non-selectively binds to both β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors preventing activation of the receptors by their stimulatory ligand. Without the binding of this ligand to the receptor, the G-protein complex associated with the receptor cannot activate production of cyclic AMP, which is responsible for turning on calcium inflow channels. A decrease in activation of calcium channels will therefore result in a decrease in intracellular calcium. In cardiac cells, calcium is important in generating electrical signals for contraction, as well as generating force for contraction.It has no action in the biliary tree.Your doctor must have prescribed it due to some comorbidities like ischaemic heart disease or inflammatory pathology  of heart called cardiomyopathy.It is not used directly for the gall bladder disease but it must be used in the patient on the basis of the comorbidity , he/she must be having.Hope this answers your question.

( we know about diary products and bananas, but he ate spinach and endives today so is it bad?) and my third question, he’s having a strange ammount of blisters in different sizes in his face ( and that’s from about 4 years) is this a sign of HIV?? its increasing very quickly these days and spreading along his face please i need to have answers because we want to help him as much as we can and to take care of him... thank you in advance","Doctor":"Hello,If you are a friend or a cousin has heart problems, and has Hodgkin's disease usually they are not related, and I cannot tell you the treatment for heart troubles unless you tell me the exact diagnosis. Some inflammation in the heart can be cured by treating Hodgkin's disease which is curable by radiation therapy.High potassium is a temporary condition and should be treated when it is present, but if it is a constant problem, you should look into checking your kidney problems, and also if you want to have a low potassium diet it should be avoiding tomatoes, and oranges banana and even apples.Pimples may be related to HIV if you have the diagnosis first you have to have the diagnosis established by your physician if you do not have HIV, then it can be either skin infections. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Amrit Singh"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctors, I did my first test for HBsAg and core antibody six months ago and was positive. I then did HBV DNA and had 2318iu/ml two weeks ago. I have been on livolin forte since two weeks ago also. Can anyone advice me in the treatment method best suitable for my profile. I feel very okay, no symptoms whatsoever. Do I just monitor over time or seek medication. Best regards.","Doctor":"Hello, Hepatitis B is mostly a chronic illness, and having symptoms is not a very good marker of gauging the progress of the disease. In fact, symptoms may come only at a very advanced stage. Therefore it is necessary to monitor your infection and provide adequate treatment if required. In this regard, a test for HB-e-Antigen and Anti Hb-e-Antigen antibodies must be done. This will inform us whether the virus is actively replicating or not and whether your body has started an immune response against it. If you already have these tests done, please post their results. Physicians generally don't start anti-virals straight away in cases of Hepatitis B, Especially when Anti HB-e-antigen antibodies are positive, but wait for about 6 months and then repeat to check the viral load. If the virus has disappeared, no treatment is needed. If the virus persists in the blood (checked via HBV DNA), then anti-virals must be started.I hope I have made mself clear. Thank you and good luck.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I want to know that does inactive hepatitis create problem in life...

Good physical condition with no medical history. I took a pre-workout supplement containing caffeine and other natural stimulants 5 days ago. During my workout I got very ill and had to come home. I had a couple episodes of vomiting and muscle cramps that night. Thought I was just dehydrated. The next day I stayed home and rehydrated myself but still keep a hungover feeling. Felt decent the next day and wanted to go workout. Decided to try the supplement again but only a half dose. Went to my work which is a fire station and obtained a bp of 130/84 on a machine. After taking the supplement I felt ill and had a pressure in my head and the back of my neck. Had a medic listen to my bp which was 196/100. After going home to rest I returned to work and had them listen to another bp which was 210/114. The medic started an IV and gave me a bag of fluid. This decreased my pressure to 180/90. Went to the local ER and had a full cardiac work up done. EKG showed normal, labs were normal, and head ct showed nothing. BP on their machine showed 155/90 upon arrival and 125/75 upon discharge. That was 3 days ago and since then I have made an appointment with my primary doc. I have stopped all supplements and exercise. Check my BP several times a day and it is normal when taken on a machine but it shows still high when listened to by cuff and stethoscope. 120/80 on a machine is showing as 160/90 by auscultation. I am also having episodes where I get sick to my stomach, start shaking, and get pressure in my temples and eyes. I check my bp every time I feel this coming on and it is elevated on my machine. I am at a loss as why a caffeine product would be affecting me 5 days later or if it maybe uncovered or cause a new underlying condition. I have never had a problem with BP and/or any type of anxiety but it has also crossed my mind that the episodes of shaking and nausea could be a nervous response.

For the diagnosis, you need to do ECG at the time of palpitation & tachycardia.

Will this caused any damage to my liver? 48 yr. old male 6ft. 263 lbs.","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your concern on HCM!I appreciate your concern for the high BP and high Ferritin levels.Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ - 12.5 mg/day) is used to treat mild hypertension and it seems your BP is well controlled with this dose. HCTZ is unlikely to cause liver damage, however patients with severe liver disease or cirrhosis are very susceptible to thiazide-induced electrolyte disturbances ( hypokalemic hypochloremic alkalosis) which can cause hepatic coma.Hemochromatosis is a hereditary disorder in which excess of iron is stored in the tissues of major organs, especially  liver, pancreas, heart and testes.Serum ferritin measures the amount of iron stored in the body. For adults, the ideal range is 50-150 ng/ml.Over a period of years, the stored iron can severely damage many organs, leading to organ failure and chronic diseases such as cirrhosis, diabetes and heart failure.Regular removal of blood (phlebotomy)  can be done every 8 weeks. Serum ferritin drops about 30ng/mL with each full unit (500 cc) of blood removed.The goal is to bring blood ferritin levels to an ideal range of 50-150 ng/mL.

I was very skeptical with their medical result considering that my older had a history with them that she was diagnosed with Granuloma, but she has no history of TB, Bronchitis, asthma and most of all she doesn t smoke or had long exposures with secondary smoke. After a month with consulting with the Philippine Department of Health her Granuloma was diagnosed instead of an expanded artery in her lung thus she was clear for a fit to work clearance. On my case, when i consulted clinic s doctor, I asked him what could have caused my elevated ALP but instead he directed me to paying another set of tests. When i shared my knowledge on the normal levels of the ALP which i believe is 44-147 IU/L or 30-120 IU/L, the doctor again refused to acknowledge my question and instead directed again to paying another set of tests and he said that in their clinic, the normal level of ALP is 114.

Thank you"},{"Patient":"I am an 18 year old male with a history of OCD and non-allergic rhinitis in addition to the disorder I describe. In late January as part of an effort to find the cause of my implacable lethargy and nudged in this direction by recurrent episodes of greying out that were becoming more frequent, I underwent a tilt table test. The results were that my heart rate increased from ~ 80 bpm to 130 bpm upon being tilted (the increase began sharply as soon as I was tilted) and this heart rate gradually settled down to about 100 bpm after twenty minutes. I was given sublingual nitrate which caused my heart rate to increase again to ~ 130 bpm. The heart rate increase was accompanied by palpitations which lasted until the test was completed but on the day of the test doctors were unable to replicate my symptoms of presyncope. No syncope occurred during the test. For days after the test I was very significantly impaired. Other symptoms I experienced that appeared to be related to a common condition included: severe post-prandial fatigue (to the point it was difficult to organise my thoughts and even to talk for about 2-3 hours after eating a meal—a sandwich with wholemeal bread would be enough to trigger this), cognitive sluggishness (not too remote from the complex of symptoms an ADHD person would experience), post-exertional fatigue (I would not be able to function adequately after exercising and was effectively bed or chair-ridden until I had a very long episode of sleep—for obvious reasons I would never, ever exercise in the morning), fatigue in response to being in any sort of hot environment (especially hot showers), muscular discomfort (mostly after exercising, it was very similar to what one feels preliminary to stretching) that would be relieved temporarily by stretching and gave me urges to compress affected limbs (I would place one leg in tight spaces, for instance in between lounge cushions on which one generally sits and the backrest of a lounge), urges to lean on things while standing (such as bathroom mirros while brushing my teeth) and excessive thirst (a relative counted twenty-eight 600mL bottles of water on the floor near my bed once). It was inductively strong that the episodes of greying out and other symptoms, according to specialists I am in consultation with, were related to the observed phenomenon during the tilt test which confirmed a diagnosis of postural orthostatic tachycardia. I was given Inderal 40mg, half of which I was instructed to take twice daily, so 20mg in the morning upon waking up and 20mg at night. My response to the medication was uncanny in the positive stense. For several days, after years of this illness, I was asymptomatic. I was expecting to make a full recovery but my symptoms began returning after about a week. Some symptoms appeared to be remain controlled by the Inderal, including the post-prandial fatigue and accompanying drowsiness, but others, such as the muscular pain, the cognitive sluggishness, the greying out and the muscular pain, began returning. I expressed the failure of the medication to control my symptoms beyond a week to my doctor, and he wanted to increase my dosage as he apparently always intended because I am a big guy and a 20mg dose of Inderal twice a day (40mg/day) is what he would give a six year old (actually, I m not a big guy at all, I am 70kg and 6 0”). My dose was increased to a full tablet at night and half a tablet in the morning and then once again to one full tablet in the morning and one at night over the period of two weeks (it worked out to be more than that). All of the symptoms that were returning before the dose was increased the first time worsened, and suspicions that the Inderal was influencing my mood seem to be confirmed by my moodiness getting worse as well, so now I began experiencing a side effect. I quickly tapered my dose from 80mg/day to 60mg/day and then back to 40mg/day. In the last 24 hours I have taken 20mg two times, so it has been a very short time since the tapering of the medication finished. It is important to stress there has continues to be a full resolution of my post-prandial fatigue, which was the most distressing of my symptoms, but I am at a total loss for why my improvement for the first few days of taking the medication was so holistic and significant, whereas now I am once again impaired, even now when I m on a similar dose to that I first took. I have tried many medications in the past, including ones prescribed for depression because doctors suspected I was atypically depressed, and they have not yielded the same results as Inderal. There have been no significant changes in lifestyle or diet since starting the treatment, with one exception, so what may account for the initial efficacy of the medication versus its efficacy now? I do know that propranolol reduces the sodium present in urine and sodium affects blood pressure and blood volume, and the major change in my diet over a long period has been a decrease in the amount of salt I consume, which I imagine is still relatively high. However, over the last 24 hours I have been consuming more salt, a deviation from the trend, to no avail, at least yet. My blood pressure is not too low, not too high . I am looking for alternative explanations. Should I push for my doctor to prescribe a second line of treatment, in the form of a medication like midodrine or fludrocortisone? Would you personally approve of a second-line pharmacological intervention if I was one of your patients? Should I be concerned about interactions between my current medication, propranolol, and any of these two other medications that make one of them less effective or that imperil my health, save that fludrocortisone requires auxiliary potassium supplementation? To summarise my questions: What may account for the initial efficacy of the Inderal versus its efficacy now? Given the dose has remained the same? Should I broach with my doctor my thoughts about using more medications, to target the postural orthostatic tachycardia symptom complex in different ways? Do you personally think more intervention is warranted given that the medication I am taking now is not having the effect it did? Would Florinef or midodrine interact with propranolol in such a way that is dangerous or one of these medications is rendered less effective because of the other? (From my understanding, potassium depleting drugs are only dangerous with beta-blockers that prolong the QT interval of the heart, which I don t think propranolol does, but I don t want to show up to an appointment with my doctor appearing uninformed, so if I am wrong, I would like to know.) Thank you very much for taking the time to read this.","Doctor":"Hi, Yes, florinef and midodrine are not used with propranolol. There can be underlying causes such as elevated adrenal hormones which cannot be checked while on any of these drugs which cause that to occur anyway. BUT the tumor can be looked for. Otherwise this is classic for chronic fatigue with the orthostasis. There can also be chronic fatigue due to depression/psychological reasons but that doesn't have blood pressure effects and you'd need to get the BP under control before you could say there are independent psychological issues other than obvious OCD. Diabetes, both type I, II and insipitus can cause this but if you aren't up all night urinating, forget I mentioned it. Without an exam, I can only give general information, but, this is some about CFS. Once one can stand, exercise of every type basically fixes it. Muscle and endurance building and also getting used to the BP fixes it, but you have to be able to exercise. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Do you also have upper abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, burping, increase in pain on food, sour water feeling in throat or chest burning, if yes it further supports the diagnosis. You should avoid fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have some walk after having food instead of taking rest. Have multiple small meals instead of heavy meals. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any.  You can get prescribed tab Pan DSR 40 mg beforebreakfast once a day for 2 weeks.     Secondly does this pain increases on applying pressure over the area, if yes it could be costochondritis and it's a musculoskeletal type of pain and needs prolonged nsaid therapy.   Does this pain increases on deep breathing and coughing etc. if yes it a pain arising from lining of lungs and needs nsaids treatment and evaluation.

You might be having early cirrhosis.A fibroscan or a liver biopsy may be done to see whether you are having cirrhosis.Liver panel may be done which may show numbers indicating liver damage and chronic liver disease.Alcohol intake, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, Hepatitis B and C infection are some of the causes for chronic liver disease.You can consult a gastroenterologist for the above mentioned tests.Is this answer helpful?"},{"Patient":"I am an alcoholic and have been sober 6 years.

This obstruction could be either inside the liver substance or in the bile duct. In these cases the liver panel would be abnormal. There would be a raise in the bilirubin level especially the direct component. A ultrasound scan may show dilated bile ducts. If the obstruction is inside the liver substance the ultrasound scan may not show it and a liver biopsy may have to be done to confirm it. This obstruction could be harmless as in gallstones in the bile duct or may indicate serious conditions like malignancy, primary biliary cirrhosis etc.There are other causes of high alkaline phosphatase also. Bone disease can cause an increase in alkaline phosphatase level.Pregnancy can cause a raise in alkaline phosphatase.Is this answer helpful?"},{"Patient":"I am a 48 year old woman.
