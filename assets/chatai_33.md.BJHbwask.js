I have had a terrible dry cough and not brought up mucus. I was referref to the nurse at my doctors surgery on Friday who said my chest sounded clear and gave me antibiotics and a cough suppressant. I have ben up all night with crippling pains when I cough . The pain and really tender extended area seems to be to the high left of my abdomen just under my ribs. As I had a perforated duodenal ulcer a months ago I am worried that I have split something due to my violent coughing or could it be my chest or lungs. It is really tender all the time but unbearable when I cough. What shall I do, shall I go to Aand E in the morning?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. Yes, you should definitely consult doctor for your symptoms. You are having constant cough with right sided lower chest pain. This is seen in pneumonia and pleural effusion. So better to get done chest x ray first. Chest x ray is must to rule out these conditions. If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry much. You are mostly having musculoskeletal pain. But first rule out lung related causes. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

They told me I had Pneumonia and prescribe me Mylan-Levofloacin 500mg took 1 1/2 tablet once by mouth for 7 days and 200 DOS Ventolin HDA 100mcg 2 puffs every 4hrs. I did that and I still had pain so I went back and the dr said my pneumonia was gone but still had crackles in my lungs so he said I had pleurisy and prescribed me Naproxin 375mg 1 tablet by mouth 3 times a day I got them on march 18th. It s now march 23rd and I still have that sharp pain on my left side when I breath or cough and still have crackles. What do I do? And the other question is can all these antibiotics make my period late or skip it? Thanks!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Answer to your 1st question. In my opinion you should get done CT thorax to rule out bronchiectesis. It is type of healed lung tissue common after pneumonia treatment. In this part of lung tissue dilates and remain as it is. In the dilated part, secretions tend to accumulate and cause crackles and pain on coughing. So get done CT thorax to rule out bronchiectesis. Answer to your 2nd question. Delay in periods is seen in acute infection and antibiotic use both. But infection is the likely cause in your case. Infection anywhere in the body causes stress and hormonal imbalance. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"HI DR. Grief, my name is Roberta. At the end of February I had the flu. After the flu started to go away I developed a chronic cough accompanied with mucus. I went to my a physician\`s assistant who prescribed Benzonatate 200 MG take 1capsule by mouth every 8 hrs. as needed. I did this for a few weeks and this did not help. My cough was atill persist and accompanied with mucus. I coughed so hard and could not breath when trying to clear the mucus from my throat. I have gone back to my Dr.s office after a month and was seen by a nurse practitioner who prescribed Ventolin HFA 90 MCG inhaler, 2 puffs by mouth every 6 hrs as needed, and Montelukast SOD 10 MG, 1 tablet at bedtime. I was told that this won\`t take affect right away, that I have to take this over a period of time before it does! Does this sound right to you?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are not taking right treatment. By your history and description, possibility of post infectious bronchitis is more. This condition is common after common cold due to flu infection. And treatment of choice is inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Ventorlin is short acting beta 2 agonist (SABA). It's action lasts for 1-2 hours. So frequent dosing is required. Montelukast is anti allergic and it has no role in post infectious bronchitis. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. Better to stop montelukast and start ICS after discussing with pulmonologist.

Since you are massage therapist, muscular strain is common in you.But better to rule out internal lung causes for your chest pain. So get done chest x ray first. If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for lung disease. Your pain is mostly due to musculoskeletal pain. So avoid strenuous exercise and heavyweight lifting. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Apply warm water pad on affected site. Start painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs. Don't worry, you will be alright in 1-2 weeks. Hope I have solved your query.

Best way is to take your father to hospital because possibility of pneumonia is more in his case. Dementia causes aspiration of food content in the lung and this causes aspiration pneumonia. If you want to treat him at home than tracheostomy is an option. In this trachea is opened in front part of neck and tracheostomy tube is inserted in it. Through this tube sectioning should be done to remove secretions in the chest. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your father.

I can understand your concern. Possibility of gum infection is more in your case. Pneumonia causes cough, fever, expectoration and chest pain. You are not having any of the above mentioned symptoms. So possibility of pneumonia is unlikely in your case. Gum and tooth infection can cause similar symptoms. So better to consult dentist and get done clinical examination of your teeth and gums.

In my opinion, you should get done repeat chest x ray to see whether pneumonia is worsening or not. Pneumonia is lung infection. It is known to cause weakness, fever, sweating, bodyache etc. If your pneumonia is recovered than your symptoms must have gone and you should improve. But since you are having all these s, better to rule out worsening of pneumonia. So get done chest x ray.

It is often associated with pericarditis, which is an inflammation of the pericardium, a double-layered membrane sac that surrounds the heart and protects it.Breatlessness is because due to the fluid outside your heart is not filling properly causing regurgitation of blood back into the lung causing breathlessness.Most cases of pericarditis can be successfully treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs work by reducing the inflammation of the pericardium, and also relieve the chest pain. Ibuprofen is the preferred choice of NSAID., dont take too much water , try to rest  , change in diet will not helpadvice get a 2d echo done"},{"Patient":"I seem to get pneomonia alot right now is my 4th time.

Yes, you should definitely get done adult Pulmonary vaccination with pneumococcal and Influenza vaccines. Pneumococci are the most common bacterias causing pneumonia. Influenza is the most common virus  causing lung infection. So vaccination is definitely recommended in your case as you are having recurrent pneumonias. Recurrent blood clots is mostly due to hypercoagulable state. So you should consult hematologist and discuss about hypercoagulable states like protein C, protein S deficiency, homocysteinuria etc. So at present, you should definitely take vaccines to prevent recurrent respiratory tract infection.

I never stayed with them during their medication thats why i was shocked recently.. help me please thnx. Will this be transferred to the people i get along with everyday?Especially my partner?","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question. I understand your concern. TB transmits mainly by air-born droplets when an infected person coughs. When someone breathes in these droplets which contain TB bacteria, they get infected. Not everyone who inhales bacteria develop disease. Whether someone develops TB disease depends on that person's immunity. Regarding if you can transfer disease to your contacts, depends on presence of TB bacteria in your spit. This is checked by testing 3 samples of sputum on consecutive days, looking for TB bacteria (generally called Acid Fast Bacilli). If your chest X-ray shows cavities (empty spaces in lungs), chances for presence of bacteria is more.   Anyway, more important is for you to start Anti TB medications at the earliest. Usually this is a 6 months course. Once you start treatment, by 2 weeks most of the patients become non-infective. Hope I have answered your queries.

But I'm still coughing and short of breath at times? I'm confused as to where the coughing is from and wheezing in chest?","Doctor":"HI, I had gone through your questions, and understand your concerns. First of all fat pad seen in your X-ray or CT scan is not the cause for your coughing and breathlessness. This will not cause you any  complication or illness.From your history I understand that you get cough, mucus production, shortness of breath and wheezing since 6 weeks, and X-ray ruled out pneumonia. You haven't mentioned your age and whether you are/were a smoker. Also you had any previous history of similar symptoms. 2 probabilities are 1) allergic bronchitis or asthma, if you had similar symptoms in the past or other allergic symptoms. 2) chronic bronchitis or COPD if you are above 35 and a smoker. Depends on the condition you will need treatment with nebulizers, inhalers (broncho dilators and sometimes containing steroids) or a combination), antibiotics (if signs of infection like colored mucus, fever, raised WBC count etc.), and may be a short course of oral steroids. In both conditions there will be excess mucus production and narrowing of airways which cause wheezing. The treatment I mentioned will take care of both.

I can understand your concern. No warfarin can not cause thirsty feeling or weight gain.

Costochondritis is a relatively harmless musculoskeletal chest pain  but is very painful.It  is an inflammation of the junctions where the upper ribs join with the cartilage that holds them to the breastbone, or sternum. The condition causes localized chest pain that you can reproduce by pushing on the cartilage in the front of your ribcage.According to you ; you feel pain  around sternum so most likely your symptoms are because of costochondritisOne more diagnosis which comes to my mind is  it can be Tietze syndrome ;often confused with costocondritis and is missed by cardiologists , the main treatment of costo is anti-inflammatory medicine and  high dose steroids used for a short period of time, As you have written you can't take anti-inflammatory ;in that case  you can take high doses of methyl-prednisolone  for few days for relief .Antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, are often used to control chronic pain — especially if it's keeping you awake at night.gabapentin (Neurontin) also has proved successful in controlling advice 2D ECHO AND TMT FOR CARDIO CLEARANCE PHYSICAL THERAPY AND MEDS FOR COSTOCHONDRITIS"},{"Patient":"I got the flu around december 10th and then bronchitis but it is not getting  better.

Possibility of cardiac or Pulmonary disease is more in your case. So better to consult doctor and get done 1. Ecg and 2d echo to rule out cardiac diseases. 2. Chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out Pulmonary causes. Better to avoid further running. First diagnose yourself, start appropriate treatment and than you can continue your running and other exercise. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have a severe case of bronchitis (2nd time this year and had it last year), am allergic to penicillin, have been on Z-Pack and steroids. Was getting better, but now have finished both and it is coming back. Is there an effective penicillin antibiotic out there that can help?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Th most common cause for bronchitis is viral infection. And amongst viruses Influenza virus is the most common. You should avoid penicillin group of drugs because you are allergic to penicillin. For prevention of recurrent bronchitis, it is better to take adult Pulmonary vaccines like pneumococcal and Influenza vaccines. These will prevent infection and hence episodes of bronchitis. So need of recurrent antibiotics can also be avoided. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hello I m 28 I was at the beach bout 4 days ago and I got a little drunk. On the way to the car I fell off the side of the steps leading up and unto my back it was a pretty high fall. About this time yesterday the right side of my chest around the middle to just under my breast I ve been having pain if I move in a certain way breath to deeply cough sneeze. This morning my right shoulder also was feeling numb. even just standing/sitting doing nothing is hurting is it possible that falling on your back from a hight can injure your chest I m also having the urge to throw up cause of the pain.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion, you should definitely consult doctor and get done chest x ray to rule out post traumatic pleural effusion (hemothorax), pneumothorax and rib fracture. Impact of fall on back can cause injury in the front part of chest. This can cause lung damage due to trauma. And lung damage causes pleural effusion and pneumothorax. You are having gradually worsening symptoms. So better to rule out above mentioned complications first by chest x ray. If chest x ray is normal than no need to worry much. Painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs are helpful in your case. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Apply warm water pad on affected site. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My friend wants to work abroad but needs to be cleared on medical first. She has a previous lung infection. She had undergone treatment for 6 months and now she is fine. The result of her xray was stated like this: clear lungs, heart is not enlarged, pulmonary vascular markings are within normal limit, trachea is not narrowed, diaphragm and costophrenic sulci are intact, bony structures are unremarkable. My question is: Can she come in UAE and pass the medical? Since here in UAE it is very strict. Even though you are healed and physically fit to work but if they see a scar on the lungs automatically you will be deported. Can I have an answer? Thanks..","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, your friend can definitely apply for UAE work permit. Because her chest x ray is absolutely normal. She is not having any evidence of active infection or healed scar. And even if she is having old scar, she can still apply for work visa. We just need to prove this by CT thorax and bronchoscopy. CT thorax is more Informative than chest x ray. Bronchoscopic evaluation is also far superior to rule out infection. If both of these are normal or negative for active infection, she can argue with visa authority about not having active, infectious disease. Hope I have solved your query. Wishing good health to your friend. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I ve got sharp pains in my chest and arm and left breast area which comes and goes every now and again my blood pressure is normal but pulse rate is a bit high. When I take pain killers it relieves the symptoms. Sometimes my shoulder and back hurts what shall I do","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion, you should first get done ecg and 2d echo to rule out cardiac diseases. Left sided chest pain with rapid pulse rate is common in heart problems. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If both are normal then no need to worry for major cardiac diseases. Stress and anxiety can also cause rapid heart rate and chest pain. So avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm. You can take painkiller for symptomatic relief. But better to first rule out cardiac diseases. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hello.

Yes, you should definitely consult doctor and visit emergency room (ER). By your history and description, possibility of viral Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and post infectious bronchitis is more. Bronchitis is common after URTI. So better to get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) for the diagnosis of bronchitis. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Antihistamine drugs are also useful. Also get done ecg to rule out cardiac diseases as you are having racing heart beats. So consult doctor, first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

Yes, you should definitely consult doctor because hemoptysis (blood in sputum) is not a good sign. Hemoptysis in your case can be due to 1. Uncontrolled bronchitis 2. Pneumonia 3. Tuberculosis. So get done chest x ray to rule out pneumonia and tuberculosis. Get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to know the severity of bronchitis. You may require inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with antibiotics. So don't wait at home, consult doctor and find out cause for hemoptysis. Hope I have solved your query.

I am a young girl who is healthy and very active bu I have had this for three days now","Doctor":"Welcome to HCM. I read your question carefully and I understand your concern. I think that there is nothing wrong with you organically speaking. The way you describe your shortness of breath seems like you have an emotional stress (it's up to you to search in yourself about your emotional burdens). If there is something wrong with you, it would also appear during the night associated with other symptoms or signs. Your initial question was Causes of shortness of breath. There are many, which seems unlikely in your case. For example, people with cardiac diseases might have shortness of breath, but it occurs more often during the supine position or during physical effort and in general cannot be so active (you are a young girl, very active and symptoms alleviate during sleep). Another cause is asthma, which is unrelated to standing or lying position (actually people suffering from asthma attacks tend to sit in the edge of the bed hungry for air). Another cause might be respiratory tract infection, that is also unrelated to positions and you would have other symptoms and signs, like cough, temperature etc. I recommend to try some relaxing techniques like listening to your favorite music, talking to a best friend, eating a proper diet, laughing a lot, exercising every day, sleeping better, taking deep breaths. Avoid coffee and energy drink, drink more tea. I hope mu answer helped you. Feel free to write for additional questions. I'm at your disposal. Best regards"},{"Patient":"hi im having upper respiratory tract infection .... and now third week started felling better but when we do some work felling bit hard to breath ... so im using ventolin if it gets worse ... does it take time to recover? and I would like to workout and need to drink protein powder does it good or bad ? and I had antibiotics for frist week ... ..... please help me","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your situation and problem. By your history and description, possibility of post infectious bronchitis is more. This is common after viral upper respiratory tract infection. And your breathing difficulty is also due to bronchitis. So better to get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out bronchitis. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). You will mostly improve in 1-2 weeks. And yes, you should definitely do exercise and work outs as they are good in bronchitis. Protein supplements are good in bronchitis. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

I am not a smoker.","Doctor":"Tightness in the chest is mostly due to some infection. For treatment you can take some antibiotic preferably levoflox or cefadroxyl after an expert advice along with some decongestants like wikoryl or diominic-dca for tightness and flu like symptoms. You can take syrup grilinctus-bm or ambrodil-s for coughing and soothing effect. Do warm water gargles and take steam inhalation to reduce the tightness and congestion of your chest."},{"Patient":"Hi, my lower left rib feels like it is slightly protruding and is sore at the very tip closest to me center.

It feels bruised but it is not visibly purple nor it is protruding visibly, however I can feel it sticking out significantly more than my lower right rib.","Doctor":"HiThank you for asking HCM.I have gone through your query. Your problem can be most likely due to costochondritis. It is better to have a consultation with your doctor and have an x ray to rule out any deformity. Anti inflammatory gels like ketoprofen for local application will be helpful. If pain is more you can take oral ketoprofen also. If there is no improvement even after this then local injection of corticosteroids or anesthetics will be helpful.Hope this may help you.

My surgeon tapped into the chest at the office and removed 2 and half pounds of red fluid.  Can the fluid return?  How does one know?  Do I need a follow up on this?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes,  you should definitely do follow up for this problem. Because this fluid can reaccumulate in pleural cavity. So follow up with chest x ray and ultrasound examination of chest is needed. Collection fluid in pleural cavity after aortic surgery is mostly due to leak in the repair. So if leak is not repaired, possibility of recurrence is high. So better to consult your operating surgeon and discuss about possibility of surgical leak and get done investigations for the same. First treat leak if present. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

Continuous chest pain is commonly seen in cardiac diseases. So better to first rule out cardiac cause. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If both are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Possibility of acute gastritis and associated chest pain is more in your case. So avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Start proton pump inhibitors for gastritis pain. Don't worry, you will be alright with these lifestyle modifications.

I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion, you should get done chest x ray or CT thorax to detect tubercular infiltration. Your blood report like IgM for TB is positive but mantoux test is negative. Your sputum for AFB is also negative. So we can not say it is 100% tuberculosis. You might be having tuberculosis as you are having cough with hemoptysis. So further evaluation with chest x ray or CT thorax is needed. Because some radiological findings like upper lobe infiltration, cavitory lesion, tree in bud appearance etc are characteristic of tuberculosis. So if any of these is present than you may need anti tubercular drugs. Bronchoscopy with BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis is also more informative in diagnosis of tuberculosis. So better to get done these investigations first to rule out tuberculosis in your case. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health.

Pleurisy is inflammation of pleura. And it is seen commonly with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) - pneumonia. In your case possibility of pneumonia is high. Because you recently had cold and pneumonia is common after cold. You are also having a lot of chest congestion, so possibility of pneumonia is high in your case.

I can understand your concern. Bronchitis is not always due to infection. It can also cause by allergy, pollution, chemical exposure at work place, exposure of cigarette smoke due to passive smoking etc. So antibiotics are not always needed. In my opinion, you should first get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). This will tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Avoidance of pollution, chemical exposure at workplace etc are needed for proper control.

And treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. Inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) are the treatment of choice for bronchitis. So first diagnose yourself properly and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I am having pain in upper chest on inspiration A week ago I hit a vessel in my lower left leg and lost a lot of blood (saturated three wash cloths,puddles on floor,finally stopped by knotting a towel around leg). As this happened at hs I went to bed and all seemed okay since.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Since you are having recent history of large amount of blood loss, anemia can be the cause for your left sided chest pain. Anemia causes tachycardia (rapid heart rate). This is due to strain on heart due to loss of blood. So better to get done hemoglobin estimation and if this is low then you may need supplements in the form of either oral tablets or blood transfusion, depending on your deficiency. If hemoglobin estimation is normal than no need to worry much. Your pain is mostly due to musculoskeletal pain. So take painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs. Hope I have solved your query.

Enlarged liver in 3 year old child is mostly due to infection. Possibility of cancer is low but can be there. He is also having pneumonia. So infective etiology is more likely. To know the causative organism, get done blood culture, bronchoscopy and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis. If both of them are negative for infective etiology, liver biopsy is indicated to rule out malignancy. Bone marrow biopsy is also useful in such cases. So consult doctor and discuss all these.

He has developed a gel-like substance in his lungs & a procedure will be performed tomorrow to determine what it is.  He has some issues with his lungs earlier today & they were unable to insert a tube because of the substance.","Doctor":"Welcome to healthcare magic for your health concernsI am Dr Fahim and I will looking into your problem     I have gone through your question and understood your concerns. After rib and sternum fracture he would have developed hemothorax (collection of blood in the pleural space). It is usually managed with inserting tube in the pleural space called tube thoracostomy. Some blood remains un-drained and results in clot formation, called a retained clot; to which you are referring as a gel like substance in the lungs. It is then evacuated with VATS (Video Assisted Thoraco- Scopy), otherwise it will result in empyema ( pus formation ) and fibro-thorax. VATS is established and safe procedure, I think It will do the job for him, and he will better soon. I hope my answer will help you. Do rate it if you like it.Regards"},{"Patient":"i have been having tightness/pain in my chest, neck, shoulder and back off and on for about 6 months.  2 months ago this symptom was accompanied by what felt like my heart flipping over in my chest.

Later, my doctor advised me to start taking Romilast-L10, which I am now taking every night. I don't have any problems when I take it. However when I stop taking it, in addition to wheezing, I also get itching on my hand and legs. Please let me know if this is the side effect of Romilast L 10. And is there any other way to get rid of wheezing and medicines totally.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Romilast L is having montelukast and levocetrizine. Both are safe for long term use. Montelukast is anti allergic and levocetrizine is antihistamine. Both are used in breathlessness due to allergic cause like asthma or allergic bronchitis. In my opinion, you should start inhaler with long acting beta 2 agonist (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) instead of asthalin. Asthalin is short acting beta 2 agonist (SABA). It's action lasts for only 1-2 hours. While action of LABA and ICS last for 10-12 hours. So better symptomatic control can be achieved. ICS also helps in itching. So consult your doctor and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I just woke up with pain in my chest around my left breast.

I can understand your concern. Tuberculosis once heal produce either fibrosis or calcification. Both of these appear as scar tissue on chest x ray. For visa problem, I advice you to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. CT thorax 2. Bronchoscopy and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis. CT thorax is much more informative then chest x ray for lung scarring. Bronchoscopy and BAL analysis is more accurate in diagnosis of tuberculosis. If both these are negative for tuberculosis then you can argue with visa authority about not having active, infectious disease. And your x ray lesions are old, healed, inactive scar tissue only. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"HI! My sister n law is on life support. She has COPD and has in the past taken pills, some subscribed and others that people gave and sold her. She is not breathing on her own and is on life support.

COPD patient on life support with tracheostomy in situ is not a good sign as far as survival is concerned. COPD patients have dramatically reduced lung volumes.

Most common cause for bronchitis is viral infection. And it is contagious through droplet infection. It is highest contagious in first week of the illness.

I can understand your concern. Burning sensation in chest with burping is mostly due to GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause burning sensation in esophagus and burping. Along with drugs, you need to follow these lifestyle modifications for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food, avoid large meals and take frequent small meals. 3. Prokinetic drugs are useful in burping. So discuss about it with your doctor. 4. Go for walk after meals.

This can sometimes cause transudative pleural effusion (fluid surrounding lungs). But possibility of this is very less. You are also having enlarged heart on chest x ray. So possibility of cardiac disease is high in your case. And this can cause pleural effusion on right side. So in my opinion, you should get done 1. 2d echo to rule out cardiac diseases. 2.

Nodule on chest x ray is mostly an incidental finding. Usually it is benign cyst only. But we need to rule out early lung cancer first. So first get done CT thorax with Contrast. CT thorax will give you much more idea about nodule size, margins, content,  association with surrounding lung and mediastinal lymphnodes. On CT, if it is benign lesion then no need to worry much for this nodule. But if it is suspicious of malignancy then you need biopsy for confirmation. So at present, no need to worry.

Last night he said he felt a stab in his chest and today he tried running. He used to run five miles a day and now he never does. He ran this morning and stopped after maybe a minute. He couldn't get a breathe and he said he felt stabbing pains in his chest again. Both sides of his chest. What could it be?

I can understand your concern. In my opinion you are mostly having allergic bronchitis. The atmosphere in the room (dust, smell) must be allergic for you, so on exposure you are getting allergic reaction in the form of bronchitis.

I won t argue that fact, but I have been the same weight for at least six years and never had this problem.

I was wondering how long does bisoprolol stay in your system. about a year ago, my doctor took one blood pressure reading 140/90 and put me on bisoprolol HCTZ. Four days prior, my OB/GYN took my blood pressure 120/70. I told my primary care doctor, but he still put me on blood pressure meds despite the fact that I told him I was extremely stressed after losing my job. At any rate, I started weaning myself off the meds after taking it for 8 months July 2010-March 2011. When I exercise, I get very good readings 101/75, 99/68, 103/76 and sometimes a little higher 121/77. Prior to being placed on the meds, my blood pressure normal range was 116-120 over 70-78. Now that I ve stop the meds, if I miss a few days of not exercising my pressure is all over the place ie (151/97, 137/86, 122/83, 115/75, 140/90, etc).","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Lets first understand how blood pressure is maintained by our body, this will help you to understand your symptoms better.Our kidney on top of them have two small glands called ADRENAL, these glands are responsible for secretion of hormones named ALDOSTERONE, CORTISOL etc.Aldosterone along with Cortisol affects the body's ability to regulate blood pressure.It plays a pivotal role in maintaining blood pressure constant through out the day, It sends signal to organs, like the kidney and colon, that can increase the amount of sodium(sodium retains water and can increase blood pressure if there is a drop in blood pressure) the body sends into the bloodstream or the amount of potassium released in the urine.Aldosterone is closely linked to two other hormones: renin and angiotensin, which create the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This system is activated when the body experiences a decrease in blood flow to the kidneys, such as after a drop in blood pressure,and maintains the blood pressure to normal again.My suggestion to you is to get a through check up under a ENDOCRINOLOGIST.He would prescribe you:A) ACTH(hormone secreted by pituitary that stimulate adrenal gland to produce hormone) stimulation test- commonly used test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency.You would be given an intravenous injection of synthetic ACTH, and samples of blood, urine, or both are taken before and after the injection. The cortisol levels in the blood and urine samples are measured in a lab.B) CRH stimulation test-When the response to the ACTH test is abnormal, a CRH stimulation test can help determine the cause of adrenal insufficiency. In this you would be given an IV injection of synthetic CRH, and blood is taken before and 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after the injection. The cortisol levels in the blood samples are measured in a lab.C) serum renin and aldosterone levels will be doneD)MRI of abdomen can be done to rule out atrophy(injury) to adrenalsAll these tests should be done in consultaion with a endocrinologist.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Rini"},{"Patient":"I get severe muscle cramps in my rib cage. I can feel the muscle move and I can hardly stand it!!!!

I can understand your concern. Your doctor is right about fibrosis. In pleural effusion, after healing pleural surface becomes thickened and fibrosis. These surfaces lost its smooth texture and thus on friction can cause pain. So pain on effusion site is common after treatment  for pleural effusion. Pain is more common when pleural surfaces rub against each other like while coughing, sneezing, laughing, yawning etc. This is normal thing and you should not worry much for this.

Worsening of asthma 2. GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). So get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). If this is normal then no need to worry for worsening of asthma. Possibility of GERD is more in your case because you are having central chest discomfort. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of central chest pain. So avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid large meals. Start proton pump inhibitors. Go for walk after meals. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. Don't worry, you will be alright. Wish you good health.

Also hx of autoimmune hepatitis (2008-10) - total remission since then, hypothyroidism and misc autoimmune issues in the past. Should I be concerned that this is more than just pneumonia?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely get done detailed investigations for neck swelling as pneumonia does not cause neck swelling. You should get done 1. Repeat chest x ray to rule out tuberculosis. 2. Ultrasound examination of neck for swelling whether it is enlarged lymphnode or not. 3. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) for the diagnosis of swelling. Possibility of tuberculosis should be ruled out as it can cause lymphnode enlargement. So consult your doctor and discuss all these. Wish you good health.

I  am 21 years old and i am having pain at the left side below the chest. I consulted a doctor and he told me some test to be done. And in the reports everything is normal but ESR is 24mm but normal rate should be 0-5mm it seems. So, is there any problem in that ad why am i getting pain ?","Doctor":"Hello. The ESR is a test that detects inflammation in any part of the body. It is a non-specific test, not diagnostic for a disease, and more tests are usually done to ascertain the specific cause.I'm unaware of what other tests you have undergone, but if your doctor says everything is fine, a trial of anti-inflammatory medicines maybe all that is required.Kindly discuss with your doctor for the same if pain doesn't subside/ worsens, for further workup.Hope this helps. Take care."},{"Patient":"I have been having burning in my chest that occurs when I am walking quickly and feel a tightening and pulling in the back of my throat and in the lower sinus region. We thought it was possible esophageal reflux. I have been taking Nexium over-the-counter for the past 3 weeks and there seems to be little to no change. My doctor said my lungs seemed clear and my heart was okay. As soon as I stop walking fast, it calms down. I had been eating before bedtime and caught myself having acid reflux up into my throat which is why we thought it may have been related.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, in my opinion you are having GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). Along with drugs, you should follow these lifestyle modifications for better symptomatic relief in GERD. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Go for walk after meals. 5. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. 6. Avoid smoking and alcohol, if you are having these habits. 7. Loose weight if you are obese. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Wish you good health.

Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello, Regarding your concern, I would explain that the dizziness and lightheadedness are probably caused by low blood pressure values, which is related to the anti-hypertensive drugs that he is taking. For this reason, I would recommend reducing the doses or even stopping doxazosin and Norvasc, as long as his blood pressure values are low.

I just had a full cardio workup with stress test and heart is in great shape for a 39 year old male. I have been on Percocet for a while due to a torn labrum in my shoulder and then the doctor put me on Indocin because they thought I had a pinched nerve as well. I don t believe I had a pinched nerve and after 8 days of the Indocin I felt so bad from taking it that I got off of it. The ED sent me to a GI doctor who did an endoscopy and said I have esophagitis and gastritis. Gave me Nexium 40mg and said I would get better. I stopped all pain meds and ate only bland foods and got at little better over a week and went ahead and had my shoulder surgery. After surgery I started back taking Percocet for about 4 or 5days and then stopped. The severe chest pain has come back now and I cant get it to go away. I take Carafate pills 5 times a day and take the Nexium 40 mg first thing in the morning but its been 6 days now and still no relief.

Pneumonia is infective condition. And in acute infection, steroids are generally not given because steroids can worsen underlying infection as it causes immunosuppression. So ideally, prednisone should not be given in acute infection like pneumonia. Prednisone can cause skin rashes as a side effect. So possibility of prednisone induced skin rash is more in your case.

I can understand your concern. Any lung insult whether tuberculosis, pneumonia or Pulmonary contusions, heal by following mechanism. 1. Fibrosis 2. Calcification 3. Fibro calcification 4. Bronchiectesis 5. Rarely complete resolution. Fibrosis and calcification are seen more commonly. These are healed scar tissue. They will remain as it is through out the life. They are inactive and noninfectious, so no treatment is required. You need to prove this. And for this you need to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. CT thorax with Contrast 2.

Began abx  7 dys ago. how  long should i continue running a fever before  become concerned","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic.  I can understand your situation and problem. Continued fever in case of pneumonia suggests that the antibiotics are not working and infection is still there in the lungs. Pneumonia with atelectesis needs chest physiotherapy along with drugs for removal of secretions and reverting atelectesis. You should also get done sputum culture and sensitivity report. Sputum culture will isolate the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide you about effective antibiotic treatment. By this fasten recovery can be achieved. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done sputum culture and sensitivity to guide appropriate antibiotics, also start chest physiotherapy for reversal of atelectesis.

I can understand your concern. No, you should not take this drug. It is steroid and oral steroids are harmful in breathlessness. They are indicated only in certain circumstances. In my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Possibility of bronchitis is more in your case. Steroids are given in bronchitis but in inhaled form, not in oral form. So you should start inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid. Better to first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. 15 days rest, post pneumonia is enough and you can resume your work now. You already said that the cough is gone down, this suggests recovery. Also note following things which favour recovery. 1. Absence of fever 2. Improving appetite 3. Absence of cough with expectoration. 4. No chest pain.

I insisted GP for my chest Xray which he was not happy to send me to saying my chest sound clear. Anyway I insisted and he send me to for Xray. Today I receive result and my GP say it is all OK.However,  result state:There is  hyperinflation of both lungs with flattened diaphragm suggesting chronic obstructive airways disease. There are a few linear vertical densities in the right lung apex suggesting linear fibrotic change.There is no active lesion seen in either lung. No mass lesion or consolidation.Normal heart size with normal cardiomediastinal contour. The right and left pleural spaces are clear, there is no pheumothorax or pleural effusion.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. Your chest x ray is suggestive of hyperinflation changes. These are common finding in smokers. So if you are smoker then you should immediately quit smoking. And for conformation, you need to get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) for the confirmation of COPD (chronic obstructive Pulmonary disease). It will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment of COPD is based on severity only. Treatment of COPD is as follows. 1.  Quit smoking as soon as possible. This is the most important step in the treatment. 2. Inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid. 3. Chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercises to improve lung function. 4. Vaccinate yourself with adult respiratory vaccines like pneumococcal and Influenza vaccines to prevent recurrent lung infection. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. First get done PFT.

I just quit smoking a month ago when I had a chest X-ray done, and they found a 4mm lung nodule, I had a ct scan done right away, and they said the nodule in nonspecific and to follow up in 6-9 month. I haven't been coughing all this month, but I developed persistent back pain between my shoulder blades. I have a 10 month old baby, and I would attribute it to carrying him, if it wasn't for cough and the lung nodule. I had sinusitis recently, which never happened before, now my chest feels tight, and I get an urge to cough constantly, but I don't. What could it be, i am worried about cancer... Thank you for your help.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out bronchitis. Bronchitis is inflammation of bronchi and it is common in smokers. Cigarette smoke causes persistent irritation and inflammation of bronchi. These cause chest tightness, coughing etc. So better to get done PFT. It will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and antihistamine drugs. And for your lung nodule, you have to get done follow up CT scan after 6-9 months to see for nodule size. If size is static or decreasing then no need to worry but if size is increasing then you need biopsy to rule out cancer. Your back pain is mostly due to muscular strain because of lifting your baby. So get done PFT and start treatment accordingly for your chest tightness and coughing. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

You have started treatment since January, so you have taken drugs for enough time. And AKT 4 is standard anti tuberculosis treatment. So in my opinion, you should get done fresh chest x ray and sputum examination for TB. If both are negative then no need for further treatment. Following dietary advice should be followed in tb patient. 1. Start high protein diet. 2. Start multivitamin tablet containing folic acid, pyridoxine, vitamin b12, zinc. 3. Start antioxidants too. 4.

There was a time when it was beating at around 167bpm at rest. So the my primary doc gave me Metropolol Er Succ at 25 mg daily, and recommended me to a endocrinologist to treat my thyroid. I took a pill I believe it was called Tapazol (pardon me, I dont have the script on me at the moment) and eventually my thyroid levels went down to normal so he automatically told me to stop taking the beta blocker. I did but I still experience rapid beats periodically and slight chest pains sometimes, although not that often. And I also read that you should be weened off gently from beta blockers for health reasons depending on the specific situation, which I still consider mine to be unknown. So I took it upon myself to go back on the bblockers that I had left over because there is obviously another underlying issue. Don t get me wrong I totally respect your profession and am not trying to play doctor, but I felt they should have followed up with a cardiologist before making such a rash decision. Basically what my question is, is this gonna be detrimental to my heart, and if not how long will it take to take effect? Also, my current heart beat is about 120 bpm at rest going off me just holding my hand on my heart with a stopwatch, Is that normal? I know that alot of stuff but you can even answer one of my questions I would greatly appreciate it, Thank you so much","Doctor":"Is it still irregular.If pulse rate is 120 at rest then it's little higher and you can continue metoprolol, there is no harm and keep monitoring your pulse rate at rest of atleast 10 min. It should normalize after your thyroid is under control. Also test your hemoglobin I'd thyroid has normalizes. if heart rate is above 100 at rest you can continue with metoprolol and gradually taper to 12.5 mg and then stop. If you have further queries you can post. thanks"},{"Patient":"This morning my husband and i both woke up with a tight feeling in our lungs and unable to take deep breaths without coughing.

My right lung feels tight and I have trouble taking breaths when exercising and laying on my back","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you are mostly having bronchitis. Your symptoms like chest tightness, heaviness and breathing difficulty on exertion etc are suggestive of bronchitis more. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. So get done PFT. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and antihistamine drugs."},{"Patient":"Hi there, for the past couple weeks i ve been having some breathing difficulties. 1) its hard to breathe through my nose, feels like its blocked but theres mucus 2) lungs sometimes feel heavy or tight . I did have a cold about a month ago and cough up a bunch of phlegm. When i breathe i can feel a rumble in the middle of my chest, sometimes it goes away. I am a smoker and i also have anxiety disorder. Ive been to the ER 3 times last year because i felt like i couldnt breathe. They gave me an ekg and xray, said everything is fine. Saw my primary doctor in May and told her about the rumbling in my chest and heavy breathing, she said my lungs sounded fine... It feels like my breathing has been getting more difficult and just wanted to ask on her for advice before going back to see a doctor. My lungs dont hurt, its easier to breathe laying down. Could this just be my anxiety?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion, we should first rule out bronchitis in your case. Bronchitis is common after cold (viral infection) and show similar symptoms like breathing difficulty, wheezing etc. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system  2. PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). If PFT is normal then anxiety is the most probable cause for your symptoms. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counseling sessions, try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. Avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, you will be alright."},{"Patient":"Hi there,I have recently had bronchitis and have finished a coarse of antibiotics.I am still very wheezy and when I cough I can feel a rattling deep in my lungs.today I have started to feel quite a sharp stabbing pain in my left lung..could I have phenomena?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. In my opinion we should rule out lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI)  first. Bronchitis can cause LRTI (pneumonia) as a complication. Since you are not improving rather worsening with symptoms of cough, wheezing, chest pain etc, pneumonia must be rule out in your case. Pneumonia causes pleurisy (inflammation of pleura).  And this is the reason for sharp stabbing pain in pneumonia. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system. 2. Chest x ray. Chest x ray is needed to rule out pneumonia. If chest x ray is normal then worsening of bronchitis is the cause for your chest pain. So start inhaled bronchodilators and antihistamines drugs."},{"Patient":"Hello. I ve been having body aches, shortness of breath and coughing since Sunday. I have had walking pnumonia and bronchitis in the past couple of years. I m currently taking PVK 500 I got from a friend. I started the dosage last night and took another this morning and again after lunch. I don t feel any different. What should I do?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. The most common cause for bronchitis is viral infection. And viral infection is common cause for generalised weakness and fatigue. Viral infections are self limiting in nature. But bronchitis needs proper treatment.

Prior to this I would lose my voice very night and wake up congested in my head and chest.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. By your history and description, in my opinion you are mostly having upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). So start following steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid oily and spicy food. 2. Avoid hard to chew food. 3. Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. 4. Start antihistamines and anti inflammatory drugs. 5. Do warm water gargles 5-6 times a day.

Is there anything i can give him to offset this if he is having an allergic reaction to the zpak until i can call the dr back in the morning?? Thanks, dana","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion, your son is having allergic reaction due to either of the following. 1. Immediate allergic reaction to azithromycin (z pack). 2. Delayed time of allergic reaction to amoxicillin. He is having allergic reaction for sure. Allergic reactions are of two kinds. 1.  Immediate type of reaction occurs within minutes to hours. 2. Late (delayed) type of reaction occurs after 2-3 days. So better to consult dermatologist and start appropriate treatment. Treatment of allergic drug reaction is 1. Stop the suspected drug. 2. Start antihistamines and anti allergic drugs. 3. Apply steroid cream on affected areas. 4. Drink plenty of fluids orally. Since all these drugs are prescribed medicines, better to consult dermatologist and start treatment accordingly."},{"Patient":"Have a bad cough for 2 weeks now. Sometimes I cough up greenish flem.

I can understand your situation and problem. Your symptoms are mostly due to stress, anxiety induced GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. Smoking causes further damage to sphincter and aggravate reflux more. So along with drugs for reflux and anxiety, you need to follow these lifestyle modifications for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Go for walk after meals. 5. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. 6. Quit smoking as soon as possible. This is very bad habit. Do all these for 1 month and if you are still not improve then go for stress test."},{"Patient":"I meant to ask this in my previous question, but may as well create a new one. I've always been curious about the \\"coughing up blood\\" symptom of lung cancer. Is this a normal involuntary cough? i.e. having the URGE to cough as opposed to forcing yourself to cough. Thanks again","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Blood in sputum is known as hemoptysis. And it is seen in following conditions. 1.  Pneumonia 2. Tuberculosis 3. Lung cancer 4. Chronic bronchitis. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system. 2. Chest x ray 3. PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x ray is needed to rule out pneumonia, tuberculosis and lung cancer. PFT is needed to rule out bronchitis. If all are normal, then no need to worry for Pulmonary causes. Forceful (voluntary) coughing can also cause hemoptysis due to friction bleeding. So avoid this."},{"Patient":"I have been having pain off and on on my left side of chest.Feels like in bone area under breat.Should I be concerned.I have seen a cardiologist within last year who states that I am fine cardiac wise.sometimes the pain goes up into breat area as well","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Since your cardiac work up is normal, no need to worry for cardiac cause. In my opinion you should get done mammography to rule out breast related causes like infection, abscess etc. If this is also normal then you are mostly having muscular pain. So better to follow these steps for symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep and painful movements. 3. Start painkiller and muscle relaxant. 4. Apply warm water pad on affected site. Don't worry, you will be alright."},{"Patient":"I have had chest pain which was going with drinking water in 5 years but at the end of my pregnancy I started having problem with swallowing food my baby is 6 month old now and iam still suffering .

By your history and description in my opinion you are mostly having GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). Now you are also having difficulty in swallowing. So we need to rule out esophageal mass lesion. So consult gastroenterologist and get done upper GI scopy to rule out esophageal mass. This will also helpful in diagnosis of GERD.

Have had a lot of thick mucus drainage at back of throat, if I can cough it out, it is bloody and greenish looking. cskaercher","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should consult ENT doctor and get done nasal endoscopic examination to rule out chronic sinusitis. Because greenish, blood mixed mucus suggest possibility of 1. Fungal sinusitis 2. Nasal polyps 3. Early cancer 4. Chronic bacterial sinusitis. So nasal endoscopy is must for the diagnosis. You should also get done culture of nasal secretions for the diagnosis of causative organism. So consult ENT doctor and first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatmentDo steam inhalation 5-6 times a day."},{"Patient":"Tomorrow I will be visiting my cousin in the hospital who has been diagnosed and being treated with Cryptococcal Meningitis and pulmonary tuberculosis. I have a poor immune system myself and easily get sick. Will it be safe for me to visit? He is in the research institute together with other patients with the same illness.. Need your kind and honest advise - Thank you","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Pulmonary tuberculosis is infectious disease. It spread through droplets. TThese droplets are produced by patient during coughing, sneezing, laughing, talking, yawning etc. By these acts,  patient discharge droplets in the environment and through inhalation they will infect near by normal individuals. So chances of infection will be high in your case. Your immune system is also weak, so this will further increase the possibility of infection. My advice is to avoid hospital visit and still if you really want to go then wear protective mask before entering hospital premises. Use antiseptic solution after visiting hospital. Also insist patient to wear mask. These are the possible ways to decrease the infectivity."},{"Patient":"I know that I have a hernia near my incision site from previous abdominal surgery. It is a bubble. Today as I stood up if felt like it popped and now I have lots of pressure around the bubble and feel very bloated. The only way to describe the feeling is tightness in the area and some shortness of breath. What could be causing this?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. You are mostly having GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)  due to incisional hernia. This makes gastroesophageal sphincter lax. And because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause gaseous feeling, bloating, chest tightness, pressure etc. Gaseous distention of stomach can prevent lungs to expand fully. So patient feels breathing difficulty. Try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Start proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for walk after meals. 6. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux.

The cyst is located beneath the scars from those surgeries. What could it be and how should it be treated?","Doctor":"Usually treating a lump on the sternum by identifying and addressing what’s causing that lump in the first place. In some cases, lumps and bumps are considered normal. Based on your introduction it can be related to her surgical procedures on chest. Fuid-filled cyst may form because of chemical imbalances or hormonal shifts..An chest X-ray should be done to evaluate this lump and other possible changes in ribs and lungs.If the X-ray will find a fluid-filled cyst, simple draining procedures and pharmaceutical interventions might solve the problem, though in some cases surgery may also be necessary.After that also the fluid should be examined.Hope my answer will help you!"},{"Patient":"I woke up unable to swallow.

Post infectious bronchitis is very common. And you are having bronchitis due to pneumonia. In the initial stage of bronchitis, sputum production is more. So mucinex is useful. Mucinex carries N acetyl cysteine (NAC). It is expectorant, mucolytic and antioxidants. After resolution of bronchitis, mucinex causes dry cough due to its expectorant effect. So your dry coughing is mostly due to mucinex expectorant effect. So you can stop this drug if you are not having sputum. So discuss about stopping this drug, mucinex."},{"Patient":"Its been 6 days and I feel like I cant take a deep breath.  Im constantly trying to yawn to get air.

Any lung insult whether tuberculosis or pneumonia or Pulmonary contusions heal by following mechanism. 1. Fibrosis 2. Calcification 3. Both And any of the above will remain as it is through out the life. So possibility of fibrosis or calcification is more in your husband's case because he is asymptomatic at present.

They are inactive, hence no treatment is required. But they will remain as it is and appear on chest x ray through out the life. For your work permit, we need to prove that these lesions are inactive and you are not suffering from any infectious disease. For this you need to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. CT thorax 2. Bronchoscopic evaluation and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis. CT thorax is far superior then chest x ray in diagnosis of inactive scar. BAL is much better then sputum to rule out infections like tuberculosis. If both of these are negative then you can argue with visa authority about not having active, infectious disease.

Dr also stated lung capacity is at 70 percent. Can you give me some suggestions what may be causing this? Will have more tests next week...Steven","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Bronchitis cause fever, breathlessness on exertion and cough with expectoration. Pneumonia causes fever, cough with yellowish sputum, chest pain on coughing, weakness and low energy. Asthma causes allergic symptoms like sneezing, cough, wheezing, breathlessness more in night. Since your doctor has done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) and it is normal then no need to worry for asthma and bronchitis. Get done chest x ray to rule out pneumonia. Some cardiac conditions can also cause similar symptoms. So better to consult cardiologist and get done 1. Ecg 2. 2d echo 3. Stress test."},{"Patient":"5th incident this month. early morning hours, sharp heavy pressure chest pain when turning from left side of sleep unto my back. center of my chest,can hardly move,almost like a paralysis...but painful. I hold and push on my own chest to help relieve pressure,squeezing,pain.Thought it was a heart attack?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. We need to get done ecg and 2d echo first, to rule out cardiac cause. If both are normal then no need to worry for cardiac cause. GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) can also cause similar symptoms. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause severe central chest pain. Better to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Start proton pump inhibitors. 4. Go for walk after meals. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. 5. Avoid alcohol and smoking if you have these habits. Don't worry, you will be alright."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am being treated for a UTI with macrobid, which is working..symptoms gone. However, I also developed bronchitis and have a low grade fever. My cough is productive, as they say, but I didn t know whether I should see my internist for an antibiotic that could cure both.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Macrolide is group of antibiotic. It includes azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin. So it is not the cause for your bronchitis. Bronchitis is infection of airways. So possibility of same infection as a cause for bronchitis which is responsible for UTI (Urinary tract infection) is more. Better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x ray 3. PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is needed for the diagnosis of bronchitis.

What are they looking for? It worries me.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. COPD and emphysema are risk factors for pneumonia and lung cancer. Chest x ray is primary screening test to rule out both these conditions. Since your primary chest x ray was suggestive of pneumonia, it is always better to confirm this by doing follow up chest x ray in case of COPD. CT thorax is much more informative then chest x ray to rule out lung cancer and confirm pneumonia. So better to get done CT thorax on follow up to rule out lung cancer."},{"Patient":"My mother aged 70 is on medication for BP.

It often causes some constriction in the chest. But this upper chest discomfort is unusual. I ve no history of heart disease but I am 75, if that matters. Should I go to the emergency room, just to be sure?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. COPD (chronic obstructive Pulmonary disease) is chronic, progressive disease of lungs. We can not cure it but we can halt the progression and prevent exacerbation. Treatment of COPD consists of following four modalities. Simultaneous application of all four is must for better treatment outcome. 1. Smoking cessation. It is the most vital part. 2. Start inhaled bronchodilators, mucolytic and antioxidants. 3. Enroll yourself in Pulmonary Rehabilitation center where chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercises are done. These will improve your lung function. 4.

About an hour later that area started to hurt and looked swollen and slightly bruised. He had trouble breathing because of the pain. It has been 12 days since that happened, and it is somewhat improved, but not gone. He has a physically demanding job, which is probably not helping it heal. He would like to know if it is necessary to go to the doctor.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your husband's situation and problem. Your husband is having blunt chest trauma due to elbow hit. In my opinion he should get done chest x ray first to rule out rib fracture, pneumothorax and Pulmonary contusions. All these are complications of blunt chest trauma and cause chest pain with breathing difficulty. If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for these. He is mostly having musculoskeletal pain.

I can understand your daughter 's situation and problem. In my opinion, we should first rule out cardiac cause for her left sided chest pain. So get done ecg, if ecg is normal then no need to worry for cardiac cause. She might be having stress related gastritis which is worsened by soda. Sweating in Palm also suggest stress and anxiety. So ask her to avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. She may need anxiolytic drugs too. For gastritis, proton pump inhibitors are good drug.

Renna","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. None of the drug is causing coughing as a side effect. Your cough is due to bronchiectesis itself. Bronchiectesis is structural lung disease. In this bronchi are dilated and lost their normal structure and function. So in these dilated airways, mucus tend to accumulate. This causes inflammation and irritation. This inturn causes spasm and infection. So bronchiectesis needs expectoration and mucolytic drugs to avoid accumulation of mucus. So discuss all these with your doctor and start appropriate mucolytic drug."},{"Patient":"hx of muscular dystrophy 85 year old male diagnosed in 1952, hx of prostate cancer, high beam radiation sesium implants, colostomy and fistula between prostate and bladder, 22 French foley 30cc bulb placed monthly by urologist. increased shortness of breath, bilateral basilar opacities in all lung fields along with cardiomegaly. pacemaker and resp 24 to 30 o2 sats on 3lpm via nc 90 to 92% costovertbal angles not well visualized. pulse rate 110 to 120....... no hx of smoking or exposure to chemical etc. Could passed radiation therapy have caused scaring of lung fields","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.

He also has diabetes. The drs just did stress test for 2 days and told him his heart is to weak for bypass. What is the next steps and are there any other options?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. By your history and description, in my opinion your father is having congestive heart failure. In this condition heart fails to pump out fluids properly. So back pressure causes fluid accumulation in the dependent parts of body like legs, abdomen, lungs etc. So his breathlessness and fluid around lungs are suggestive of Pulmonary edema and heart failure. This is confirmed by stress test. So better to consult cardiologist and start diuretics and cardiac isotropic drugs. Diuretics will increase urine output and decrease fluid overload. Isotropic drugs will improve force of contraction and pumping of heart. Both these will be beneficial for him in symptomatic relief."},{"Patient":"I have had chest pain and brown mucus the last 5 years.

I can understand your situation and problem. It is due to clenbuterol only. Clenbuterol is strong beta 2 agonist. It is basically bronchodilator in nature. It is having side effect of fat burn and weight loss. It is strong sympathomimetic drug. And all your side effects like shaking, tremors, pain in forehead, eyes etc are due to sympathetic over activity caused by clenbuterol. So better to avoid clenbuterol for weight loss.

In 2012 he suffered a stroke from which he has now recovered. I have 3 questions. Are the new approved FDA medications Pirfenidone and Nintedanib an option for people at an advanced stage of fibroses? Also, I would like to now why a doctor would never suggest a lung transplant as an option for my dad. Finally, can I be a living donor of a part of my lung to my dad? I m a healthy, active non-smoking/non-drinking 33 year old. Thank you very much, Anjeza","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Honestly speaking IPF (idiopathic Pulmonary fibrosis) is end stage, progressive disease without any curative treatment available. When IPF is associated with emphysema, prognosis is even worse. Yes, you are right about newer drugs for IPF like perfinodone. It is anti fibrotic in nature. But effective only in early stages of IPF, not in the end stage where extensive fibrosis has been developed. Better to start long term oxygen therapy with home oxygen. And yes, lung transplant is an option. Buy due to donor shortage and poor outcome it is not advised in all cases. And you can not be lung donor."},{"Patient":"my husband has a hart problem and he was a soker before and he has copd from that but ina catscan they see a spot my question to you is whether he should go to rdiation ad battle the side effect becouse thay can not do a byopsy do the hy risdk he is so they think it may be cancer or an infection becouse it has grown to 10 mm. in 2 years he is going to be 84 acording to the pulmary DR. he can refuse but i am thinking that if the side effect is not so bad maybe this will shrink the infection","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your husband's situation and problem. One should not start radiotherapy only on the basis of CT scan report. You need to have diagnosis of malignancy before starting radiotherapy. Since he is smoker, possibility of malignancy is high for this nodule. But we need to have tissue diagnosis first. Biopsy is not the only tool to detect malignancy. Rather for detection of early malignant lung nodule, go for bronchoscopy and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis to detect malignant cells. You can go for PET scan also. So first diagnose malignancy and then start radiotherapy. Ask him to quit smoking as soon as possible."},{"Patient":"Dr, i am 38 year old male, for the last three months, i feel pain on centre of my chest. and some times i feel difficult to respirate also.latest ECG shows that there may be the possibility of LAE. Kindly suggest me to recover from this and what are the basic causes on the same ?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. LAE is left atrial enlargement. Left atrium receives blood from Pulmonary arteries. This is oxygenated blood. From left atrium, this oxygenated blood will go in left ventricle and from here it goes in aorta and different parts of body. So any obstruction in this flow of blood can cause left atrial enlargement. Following are the causes for this. 1. Mitral stenosis 2. Mitral valve incontinence or regurgitation. 3. Dilated cardiomyopathy. So get done 2d echo to rule out causes for LAE."},{"Patient":"I m 18 yrs old guy,my weight is 51 kg and height 5, 5 inch.I am not taking any medicine till now. i ve a problem related to heart that is happening to me from 3 months that my heartbeats are very loud but it is not painful that i can here bymyself from which i can t concentrate in my studies .I also go to the hospital and there they put on my left side a device which is caled a ecg ,which should be put for 24 hrs and report are also normal but still i feel same condition what should i do now?","Doctor":"hi, I think this is psychological problems.

This represents that there is an infective pathology for which you need suitable antibiotics. Also, you require broncholytic drugs which make the sputum thin and watery so that it may come out easily. Promethazine is helpful in dry non productive cough and it is used to suppress the cough. It can be harmful in productive cough with sputum because the infective sputum will not come out on its own once the cough is suppressed."},{"Patient":"I have a small hiatus hernia and abnormal esophagus which was diagnosed with a endoscopic exam 4yrs ago. I am on 40mg of omeprazole a day. I have noticed for the past 2 weeks everytime i eat it feels like its gone down the wrong hole so to speak and i end up coughing. I have also notice first thing in the morning im coughing alot with thick phlegm which when cleared coughing stops. I don't smoke","Doctor":"Hi a hiatus hernia prones a person to get reflux of the food back and which leads to aspiration of the gastric content into airway leading to choking and coughing. Only omeprazole will not help you in this situation. You will need a surgery for hiatal hernia repair. Till the time you prepare yourself for the surgery please follow the following instructions:1. Small and frequent meals. No heavy meals.2. Water half an hour before food. No water with the food.3. Keep yourself in either sitting or standing position after meals for atleast half an hour.4. Avoid any product which causes constipation.5. No tea, coffee and chocolates.If, you follow these, the chances of aspiration will become less."},{"Patient":"I had been having a very high body temperature, felt exhausted, felt pain in my chest and been tired for a four to five days. Now my temperature is almost normal, I feel no pain, but I've lost my voice (I can only whisper and hardly speak) and my bronchi are making some weird sounds. I have started to cough a lot (still nothing hurts) and when I cough, three times I cought out some white milky body tissue. Can those be parts of my vocal chords? And is this influenza that turned into bronchitis? Please answer, I'm so afraid that I won't be able to speak normally anymore.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. No, whitish thing is not your vocal cord. So no need to worry about it. This thing is sputum (expectoration). And your history and description suggest possibility of post viral bronchitis. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system. 2. PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT is needed to rule out bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. So get done PFT. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and antihistamines drugs. Don't worry, you will be alright."},{"Patient":"Just took online quiz...I am lightheaded...Have slight discomfort in upper body...Feel pounding in chest...Breathing is a bit heavier than normal..(I have apnea and use a machine to sleep)...Little to no appetite...Woke up this way and am feeling better...but not great....Heart?...Just a not so good day?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.

I can understand your situation and problem. You are having blunt chest trauma. And your symptoms are due to this only. Following are the possible complications of blunt chest trauma that can lead to chest pain, palpitations and breathing difficulty. 1.  Rib fracture 2.  Pneumothorax 3. Pulmonary contusions. 4. Cardiac damage 5. Musculoskeletal injury. So get done ecg and 2d echo to rule out these complications. If both are normal then you are mostly having musculoskeletal pain. So avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid bad postures in sleep and painful movements. Start painkiller and muscle relaxant. Apply warm water pad on affected site.

I can understand your situation and problem. Rib fracture causes paradoxical respiration in that particular segment. So that part of the lung becomes poorly ventilated and thus atelectesis occur. In atectesis chances of infection are high, so better not to take steroid. Instead of steroid, you should take anti inflammatory, mucosa tickets drugs. And wear rib belt to avoid mobilisation of fractured segments. This will fasten the recovery and healing. Also apply warm water pad on affected site for pain relief. It will take at least 3-4 weeks for healing of fracture rib."},{"Patient":"I have ata tight chest but no phlegm. I feel acky and my throat is irritated but not sore.

Control of pneumonia is must for control of COAD."},{"Patient":"I am 49 year old female,4 ft 7 98 lbs.For the past week or 2,, I have had a dry cough no fever,no sore throat and sometimes my chest feels heavy. Sometimes I am able to cough up phlegm but not often.I also have been getting headaches when I cough and I have been sleeping more than usual .I have borderline diabetes and suffer with some mental health issues and epilepsy, so I am hesitant on taking anything over the counter as it might affect my sugar levels or will not react well with the prescriptions I am on now.Any suggestions would be most appreciated..","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion we need to rule out lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI - pneumonia) in your case. Because your symptoms like constant cough, chest heaviness and phlegm etc are seen in pneumonia. Epilepsy and diabetes are risk factor for lung infection. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x ray. Chest x ray is must to rule out lung infection. You may need antibiotics and antihistamines drugs."},{"Patient":"Okay. So I smoked crystal meth for the first time Friday and after smoking it I had problems like not being able to catch my breath and get a full breath of oxygen in my lungs and I was wondering how long is it going to take to go away or if it will be like this permanently. Thanks.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you are having inhalation smoke induced bronchitis. Any form of smoke when inhaled can cause irritation, inflammation and this can cause bronchitis and breathing difficulty. So I advice you to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system. 2. PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT is needed to rule out bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and antihistamines drugs. You will mostly improved in 7 - 8 days."},{"Patient":"I am a sixty eight year old male who has been in reasonably good health all my life and I am extremely active. I am not overweight and do not smoke. I had a prostetectamy due to prostate cancer in 2005. I have had cold symptoms for several weeks and I can t seem to shake them. I am also unusually tired all day. I saw my doctor last week and he prescribed an antibiotic for me, but it didn t seem to make any difference. I had mononucleosis when I was young. Could I have it again? Or, could it be something else. I can t get in to see my doctor until 7/29/2014. Should I try to see someone in urgent care?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Since you had prostate cancer and mononucleosis in the past, your present symptoms of cold and tiredness can be due to following conditions. 1. Recurrence of infectious mononucleosis. 2. Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). 3. Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI - pneumonia). 4. Lung metastasis. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system. 2. Chest x ray. If x ray is normal then possibility of URTI is more. So better to start antihistamines and anti inflammatory drugs. Avoid oily and spicy food. Drink plenty of fluids orally. Do warm water gargles 5-6 times a day. Don't worry, you will be alright."},{"Patient":"hello doctor..i am having old  scar in my right lung ..as of now i want to work abroad .so is there any way to hide these scars before i go for a x-ray? pls suggest me if is there any way to hide these scar?because i m not suffering from TB and i have never been suffered from TB as well. pls...","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Any lung insult whether tuberculosis or pneumonia or Pulmonary contusions heal by following mechanism. 1. Fibrosis 2. Calcification 3. Rarely complete resolution. Fibrosis or calcification are more common. This is scar tissue and it is permanent. Since it is inactive tissue, no treatment is required. You need to prove that this is inactive scar and not active lesion. For this you need to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. CT thorax with Contrast 2. Bronchoscopic evaluation. If both these are negative for active disease, then you can argue with visa authority about not having active disease. And the scar present on x ray is inactive, healed, noninfective lesion."},{"Patient":"hi, the radiologist findings for my chest xray was with hazy densities seen in the right upper lungfield. so the impression is PTB, right upper lungfield plueral thickening and /or pleural effusion.what does this mean? thanks a lot for your answer.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Your x ray report is suggestive of tuberculosis more. Tuberculosis is chronic lung infection with predilection towards upper lobes. TB bacilli actually grow faster in high oxygen environment. And upper lobes of lung have highest oxygen concentration. So TB infection is common in upper lobe. So any lesion in the upper lobe should be first evaluated for tuberculosis. For this you need to get done sputum examination for AFB (acid fast bacilli). Pleural effusion is common with tuberculosis. So better to consult pulmonologist and first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Don't worry you will be alright.

I rested, then worked some more, then rested, etc until the shortness of breath subsided (15 minutes?). The one in the fall was a month or so later and was not as strong so I just kept working through it by slowing down the pace of my work.A month ago, after a stress test, the cardiologist did a cath and put two stents in one of my heart arteries( I had one put in ten years ago and apparently it was getting clogged). He said I did not have a heart attack but explain the pulsations at the base of my neck accompanied by shortness of breath.  I hope someone can explain this to me. Maybe I should see a neurologist? I'm one who believes in checking things out so problems can be caught and treated early. Looking forward to your answer.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. By your history and description, in my opinion you are having acute left ventricular failure. It is common in cardiac patients. It is due to poor ejection fraction (EF).  Because of this pimping function of heart is reduced. So in rest body is comfortable, so cardiac demand is less. But when body is under physical stress, cardiac demand increases, and this can not be meet by failing left ventricle. So heart rate is increased. Your neck pulsations are mostly due to this. Failing heart causes fluid retention. And fluid accumulate in lungs and can cause Pulmonary edema. This gives breathlessness on exertion. So this is not heart attack, this is acute left ventricular failure which is causing you neck palpitations and breathlessness."},{"Patient":"My son of 43yrs old home on leave has been described with a chest infection and prescribed with penicillon and an inhaler with ventolin is not improving after 4 days prescribed by nurse at walk in centre in Blackpool has not been out of house and his cough is horrendous says it's worse.

Clinical examination of respiratory system. 2. Chest x ray 3.  Sputum culture and sensitivity. Chest x ray needed for the diagnosis of lung Infection. Since he is not improving with penicillin, better to start antibiotic according to culture and sensitivity report. Sputum culture will isolate the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about the effective antibiotic therapy. So by this, we can avoid haphazard use of antibiotics. As haphazard use of antibiotics can cause delayed recovery and increase chances of drug resistance. So better to consult pulmonologist and start appropriate antibiotic treatment."},{"Patient":"Sir, I am facing chest pain problem since last 3 month my hemoglobin level is low 9.80gm . we are taking advice of Cardiologist he has prescribe the Iron Tab and Multivitamin syrup for continue 3 months. He has advice to me we will do the ECG after 10 days but ECG showing the paches . Pls suggest me","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Yes, ECG is needed  in chest pain with anemia. Hemoglobin is very important for body. It is the only substance which carries oxygen to all organs of the body. So when hemoglobin is low, all body organs are getting less oxygen and so heart needs to pump more rapidly to fulfill the body 's demand of oxygen. So anemia increase cardiac work load and thus can damage  heart. So chest pain in anemia patients should be evaluated for cardiac damage. So ecg is must in your case. And correction of anemia is must for you. So start your iron and multivitamin tablets."},{"Patient":"I have had pneumonia and I am 60 years old. Started 24th Nov.

I can understand your situation and problem. By your history and description, in my opinion you are having post infectious bronchitis. Lung infection causes inflammation and some morphological changes in lungs. Due to these, some patients develop bronchitis. Your symptoms like breathlessness, wheezing and phlegm are suggestive of bronchitis. So consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT is needed for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and antihistamines.

I also have hypothyroidism, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetic. I experience chest pains and shortness of breathe,. Had an EKG and Chest xray showing its normal. Pulse rate for some time has been very high . Can go up to 158. What could be the problem?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should consult cardiologist and get done 1. Stress test 2. 2d echo 3. Coronary Angiography if required. You are having many risk factor for cardiac disease like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes etc. So possibility of either cardiac failure or coronary artery disease (CAD) is high. Above mentioned tests are useful in ruling out these two possibilities. If all are normal then no need to worry for cardiac disease. Get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to rule out bronchitis as a cause."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr. Ram Choudhary.I have an upper respiratory infection-no antibiotic yet but my allergist gave me a prescription if it goes more into 6 days. It has been more than 6 days.

I can understand your situation and problem. If you are not improving with drugs since 6days then better to start antibiotic. Prolong URTI (upper respiratory tract infection) can lead to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI - pneumonia), if not treated properly.

I can understand your situation and problem. Since your extensive cardiac work up is normal, no need to worry for cardiac cause. Substernal chest soreness is mostly due to GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this, the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of burning pain or soreness in central chest. So try to follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1.  Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Start proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for walk after meals. 6. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bed to prevent reflux. Don't worry, you will be alright."},{"Patient":"I have copd.

COPD (chronic obstructive Pulmonary disease)  is chronic, progressive obstructive disease of the airway. It is incurable. Inhaled treatment is the first line therapy for COPD. And if patient is not improving or controlled with Inhaled treatment then we can add oral bronchodilators too. Oral bronchodilators are theophylline group. Acebrophyllin and doxophyllin are commercially available. Since both are prescribed drugs, you need doctor's prescription for them. You should also enroll yourself in pulmonary rehabilitation center where chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercises are done. These will  improve your lung function and decrease the symptoms.

His right chest tube is draining a yellow, puss looking fluid. Could his tissue on his lungs be coming off and coming down the tube. If it is I was told in a few days his skin would start doing the same thing.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. No the thing you are saying is not lung tissue. It is pus in the pleural cavity which is coming out in the chest tube. By your history and description, your brother might be having severe bilateral lung infection (severe pneumonia) . And in severe pneumonia, if not improving and worsening further then pus is accumulating in the surrounded pleural cavity. And for removal of this pus, chest tube are placed. Pus is thick, yellow, infectious fluid. So, the thing you are talking about is pus from the pleural cavity and not the lung tissue."},{"Patient":"I have a lot of mucus in my throat..sticky and hard to breathe sometimes in the night..doc say my lungs are clear.. I heard wizzling sound when sleep, doc says its sinus problem.. I also went for xray..I have swollen glands. does this affect? Tks Catherine","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Yes, swollen glands can cause breathing difficulty especially in night. In night, due to supine position, glands will narrow the upper airways and thus you can have  breathing problem and thick mucus. But in your case, we should rule out bronchitis also. Because bronchitis can cause wheezing, breathing difficulty and thick mucus production. So get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test)  to rule out bronchitis. If PFT is normal then no need to worry. Your symptoms are due to swollen glands only. You may need antibiotics, anti histamine and anti inflammatory drugs."},{"Patient":"i was opening a pack of lance crackers with my teeth and a piece of plastic came off and I think I inhaled it, it felt stuck in between my throat and airpassage i tried to cough it up would not now i feel so tired and can hardly breathe.

Since neck is the common  site for enlarged  glands and swelling, FNAC is procedure of choice for diagnosis. And lung mass, if superficial  and easily  accessible  then FNAC  is also indicated and can be diagnostic. So no need to worry, get done  FNAC from lung mass.  It is very safe procedure."},{"Patient":"hi i got my chest xray yesterday and the conclusion said i had suspicious infiltrate right upper lobe.lordotic view suggested..but my other result said that the heart is not enlarged,the diaphragm is sharp and distinct the pulmonary vessels are within normal limits,the superior mediastinum is not remarkable the trachea is in the midline the osseous thoragic cage reveals no significant bony abnormality,there is suspicious infiltrate at the right upper lobe","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Normal chest  x ray is taken in PA (posteroanterior)  view. In this view, upper part of lungs (apex)  are overlapped by bony structures  like first 2 ribs  and clavicle. So any pathology  in this part can not be reported correctly. So for better visualization  of upper lobes, Lordotic view is needed. In this,  chest x ray is taken  in  such a way that bony structures  can not overlap upper lobes  and hence upper lobes are clearly  visible so lesions can properly  reported. So get done Lordotic view for proper reporting and diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor,Ambrodil-s is used for what purpose?  Will it reduces cold or cough or chest congestion? Can we give Ascoril-LS Expectorant along  with this?My kid is 5.10yrs old  having cold stuffy nose thick phlegm running through the nose. Can I give the above syrups. I gave him Ascoril-LS  and Mextra for 3 days.","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Since you are saying that your kid is having chest congestion, it is better to give Astoria LS expectorant instead of ascorbic s.Expectorant have much lyric action and thus it relieves chest  congestion. So in productive  cough (congestion)  it is better to give expectorant  syrup. Astoria s  being cough suppressant, will reduce the coughing and seceretion  will not come out and can cause further  infection. So better to give only ascorbic LS  and don't  give ascorbic s."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 23 years old male, i am suffering from burning sensation just below my chest. the end of my ffod pipe is burning and even when i drink water i can feel the pain there and feel it passing through the end of my food pipe with a lot of pain. Please help this problem is there with me for a year but since a week it is giving me a lot of problem","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. You are mostly having GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease).  It is due  to  laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this, the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms  of burning  chest pain. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1.  Avoid  stress and tension. 2. Avoid  large  meals, Instead take frequent  small meals. 3. Avoid hot and spicy food. 4. Start proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for walk after  meals. 6. Keep 2-3 pillows under  head in bed to prevent acid reflux. Don't worry, you will be alright."},{"Patient":"I went get a chest x Ray. All I have is hyper aerated lungs.

The few months before I have had chest pains that come ang go like a heart attack, I think it may be pleresy but would of a chest x ray found it ?","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Hyperaereted  lungs can be seen in following  conditions. 1. Normal individuals. 2. If chest x ray is taken in full end inspiratory phase. 3. In smokers4. In emphysema. So if you are smoker or having emphysema  then you need to get done PFT (Pulmonary  Function Test)  to diagnose the obstructive  airway pathology  as a cause for your Hyperaereted  lungs. Smoking  cessation  and inhaled  bronchodilators are the treatment  for this."},{"Patient":"I have pain in chest that radiates to my breasts and nipples. I have narrow arteries to the heart st doctor has me on Ranexa which does help my breathing . My nipples have been leaking if insqueze them, a white substance. They also are inverted sometimes. Doctors seem not to worry. Have had uterine cancer, stage 1. Also .3 benign cysts removed over the years on the right breast. Pain in chest could be an angina.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. In  my opinion, we should first rule out  cardiac  cause for your  chest pain because  you are having  small arteries. So better to get done 1. Ecg2. 2d  echo. If both are normal then no need to worry for angina or other cardiac  diseases. You are also having  nipple  discharge.  So get done mammography  to rule out  breastfeeding cyst or abscess  as both can cause chest pain. So consult  your doctor and discuss  all these."},{"Patient":"I had shooting pains in my right lung on Saturday that eventually went away. On Monday I started coughing up brown burnt tasting stuff and still am today. Also my ear on the right side now seems to be filling and poping when I blow my nose or yawn. I am a smoker for 20 years but never had anything like this.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. Since you are smoker, possibility of  lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI, pneumonia)  is high. Your symptoms  like chest pain and brown sputum is also favouring  pneumonia. In pneumonia, pleurisy (inflammation of pleura)  is the cause for chest pain. So you need to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x ray. Chest x ray is needed to rule out pneumonia. You may need  antibiotics and antihistamines. But first thing should be smoking  cessation as soon as possible."},{"Patient":"Good Day. I got my chest x-ray and diagnose that i have a pneumonia, right lower lung. They seen on my chest xray that there is haziness in my right lower lung. Doc, what does it mean? Is there a possibility that the impression is correct or is pneumonia can lead to tuberculosis? Please help, am paranoid of this pulmonary tuberculosis. Thanks, Lilou","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM. Tuberculosis  is more common  in upper lobes and less common  in lower  lobes. TB bacilli  grow more faster and have higher affinity  for oxygen. And in lungs, upper lobes have highest oxygen concentration. So Tuberculosis  affects upper lobes more. It can affect lower lobes in diabetes  and His infection. So in my opinion get done screening  for diabetes  and His.  If both are negative  then Tuberculosis  is less likely  in your case. Also get done sputum examination  for Aug (acid  fast bacilli-TB bacilli). If this is normal  then no need to worry for Tuberculosis. You are having  mostly  bacterial pneumonia. So start treatment accordingly."},{"Patient":"iam aged 63.i underwent angioplasty afre a mild attack in 2006,at present my chlorestrol level,blood urea and creatine normal,iam a non diabitic,recently two days back i went for sugar test just formallt,my fbs was 95 and ppbs was 200,i fook full meal with ripe mango ffruit before the test,how is that fbs is normal and ppbs is high,do i have to under go the test again","Doctor":"Hiyes you should undergo the test again ideally pp should be done after a normal lunch.mango is  a very high glycemic index fruit , hence its advisable to repeat the test  after 12 hours over night fasting and pp after  taking a regular breakfastfollow up with reports very high glycemic index  products converts into glucose as soon as they are taken ,hence it may be possible tht insulin secretion can not cope up with demand .thanks"},{"Patient":"Yes, I have all the was describe, in the 10, i have has breast cancer in 03, redo striking on 05, in 08, ling cancer, which part of my right lung was cut off due to cancer & chemo again, I have these system of bronchitis since, late jan, All of the Feb, I got sick again in March Went to ER, they did X-rays, blood work, car scan, they said it was positive for bronchitis! Same symptoms, etc; last time in 08, they found lung cancer, the ER doc didn t show me the X-ray etc; he said I needed to get with my primary doc & referred me to a pulmonary doc.... That s the same thing that was done when I had lung cancer.... I m out of breath, tired, coughing, & mad because I didn t see the X-ray or scan... What the heck is wrong with me?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. You had primary breast cancer and mostly secondary spread in lungs. Lung metastasis  in breast cancer carries poor prognosis. The only option left is chemotherapy. And the relapse rate is very high. Bronchitis  is also seen together with lung cancer.  It is due to continuous inflammation  in the lung. The best option  for you, at this stage is to consult oncologist and get done1.  CT thorax 2. Pet scan. These will give you exact idea about lung cancer."},{"Patient":"my mom has stage 4 lung cancer and she was in the hospital over the weekend and they did a ct scan that said the tumor on the left side is growing and so is a bilobed nodule in the lower right lung. now my question is what is a bilobed nodule? she has a tumor in the upper right and lower right lobes.also it said something about an enlarging low-attenuation focus in the spleen and a new extrahepatic enlarged lymph node. what does all that mean?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Your mother is having stage 4 lung cancer. Beloved nodule means presence  of metastatic  nodule in two lobes of lung.  So she is having malignant nodules in both right  upper lobe as well as right lower lobe. Spleen is common site for hematogenous  spread in lung cancer. So low attenuation lesion in spleen is mostly metastatic  lesion. Lung cancer also involve lymphatic system in abdomen. So enlarged extra hepatic node is mostly  due to malignant  involvement. All these make your mother stage 4 lung cancer patient  and treatment  for this is chemotherapy  and palliative  care in the former of pain management  and nutrition. Life expectancy  in such case is less than 18 months. So consult  oncologist  and start appropriate treatment."},{"Patient":"My daughter, age 7, has had a fever over 101 since Sunday 2/22.

I would think 7 days into the RX she would be back to OK...Thoughts on what we should do?","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Treatment of pneumonia should be guided according to the causative organism. Since she is still having  cough and fever even after 2 days of antibiotics, better to get done sputum culture and sensitivity. Sputum culture  will find the causative organism and sensitivity  will guide you for antibiotics. So by this we can prevent  haphazard  use of antibiotics. Because  haphazard use can delay the recovery and increase  chances of drug  resistance. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done sputum culture and sensitivity to start appropriate antibiotics."},{"Patient":"I m a 21 yr old young woman and I have bronchitis, my doctor said. Each time I get cold or fever, I have symptoms like temperature rise, running nose, throat pain etc. These symptoms reduce and are eventually cured. But when cough starts, it doesn t reduce as fast as the other symptoms. If antibiotics are not used, then the cough can last upto a month or so before its completely gone. Doctor says I have bronchitis which is causing this. When I told him about my problem, he prescribed glemont F for three weeks. Is that the solution for my problem? What can I do to prevent this kind of long lasting cough again?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist and get done 1.  Clinical examination of respiratory system. 2. PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment of bronchitis is based on severity  only. So get done PFT. You may need inhaled bronchodilators  and antihistamines. GlemontF  is oral bronchodilators and having side effects so better to start inhaled  bronchodilators. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these and start appropriate treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi ,today is my husband 58th birthday,we went to lunch & came home took a nap & @ 4:30pm awoke with severe pain in his chest around the breast bone,then started belching then vomiting ,sweating,ect.

He s better now I read to drink apple juices/ apple cider in it so he did & took a pain reliever. My question is will this be more likely now after having this first one to be something that is gonna reoccur ?? Thank you","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your husband's situation  and problem. In my opinion your husband had acute gastritis. He started symptoms  after outside food. So possibility  of acute gastritis  due to outside food  is more. And his symptoms  of severe chest pain and vomiting  also favour acute gastritis. So ask him to follow  these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid stress and tension. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. 3. Avoid  large meals, instead take frequent  small meals. 4. Start proton pump inhibitors. 5. Go for walk after meals. Don't  worry, he will be alright after these lifestyle modifications.

He was given radiation to his chest in January and another pet scan was done last week cause he was complaining of pain in his right cheek. The results of the petscan were not good. While he was getting radiation to his chest his liver was having a party and the cancer was spreading. He has been given a 20% chance of survival. Chemo now is an option. I am concerned that if he does go for a stronger chemo what quality of life is he going to have, or should we just opt to stop the chemo and live out whatever time he has left.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should go for another cycle of chemotherapy. Your husband is having stage 4  lung cancer with liver metastasis. This makes prognosis  poorer and life expectancy  is less than 16-18 months. But as you said that his lung tumour was shrunken  after chemotherapy, I suggest another chemotherapy  cycle. His lung cancer is highly  chemo sensitive. So benefit from another chemotherapy  will be more.  And this may improve life expectancy. Above all,  it will definitely  reduce the sufferings (pain) and improve  quality of life. So better to give him chemotherapy, rather than not doing  anything."},{"Patient":"I am a 37 year old female. This morning I started with a chest pain on the upper left side.

I can understand your situation and problem. Obstructive airway disease  is mostly chronic and progressive  in nature. Patient  needs life long therapy. Your inhaler and oral drugs are good and according to the guidelines but along with drugs she needs to follow these things for better symptomatic relief. 1. Enroll herself in pulmonary rehabilitation center where chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercises  are done. These will improve  her lung functions and reduce  symptoms. 2.

So fibrolinear densities in his recent chest x ray are mostly due to healing of old tb lesions.But better to get done sputum examination for AFB and bronchoscopy to rule out active tuberculosis.  If both are negative for tuberculosis then no need to worry for worsening of tuberculosis. Opacities are due to healed tb lesion."},{"Patient":"For the past few weeks in the morning when I wake up, my spit will have small very light traces of blood in it.

I am not aware of asbestos exposure, however, memory not so good.","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Yes, asbestos exposure can cause lung disease.This is known as asbestosis. It affects lower lobes more than upper lobes. It also deposit in pleura and cause pleural calcification and fibrosis. So your lung findings are typical of asbestosis.It is due to prolonged exposure to asbestos dust.It is mostly workplace related exposure.  These changes are irreversible. We can only halt the progression. So first step is to change the work place.Get done PFT ( pulmonary function test ) to know the severity of functional damage of lungs.  And according to PFT report, you may need inhaled bronchodilators.

Thanks~","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Yes, paint fumes are the most likely cause in your case.Vomiting and dizziness are due to typical pungent smell of paint.This smell actually irritates nose and throat and cause vomiting.

Unmanaged hypertension commonly triggers CAD & Stroke. Quit smoking, alcohol, fatty food, cut on salt intake, cut on high protein diet & red meat. Do regular exercises, maintain a low BMI, avoid sedentary lifestyle. Stay well hydrated. You are suggested to see a GP & get physically examined. Get blood (CBC, Lipid profile, stress test, T3, T4 TSH, Urinalysis, etc) & Imaging tests done to detect thyroid, kidney or any developing CAD. Your treatment will depend upon the pathology detected. You may need diuretics. Hope I have answered your query, take care. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Earlier i thought it could be some cardio so I did ECG done which went fine, after which I thought it could be acidic problem and for last 15 days I ve been taking acidic medince but this is not helping much. I am still feeling discomfort while eating, while sitting idle, while travelling. Could you please help?","Doctor":"Hello, Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms could be related to anxiety. Nevertheless, a simple ECG does not exclude a heart disorder. For this reason, I would recommend performing an exercise cardiac stress test in order to exclude coronary artery disease. Is the pain triggered by deep breathing or pressure on the chest? This could indicate a musculoskeletal pain, including costochondritis. In such a case, ibuprofen and local hot packs would help. If the cardiac tests result normal and your pain is not modulated by ibuprofen, I would recommend considering anxiety as the main cause underlying your complaints. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Ilir Sharka, Cardiologist"},{"Patient":"My grandfather has been smoking for a lot of years, probably around 40? He needs open heart surgery.

This continued for the next 4 days.  Good in the morning and as soon as I started walking it became unbearable.  Bengay seem to help.  Lots of belching going on as well.  Got to our destination and went for a massage.  There were definitely some knots that needing working on.  I was still sore walking so taking it easy.

I went to specialists in June and had tests (mri's, a ct scan, and an ultrasound).  One thoracic doctor wanted to remove part of my bone and replace it with a metal piece.  (He  did not have the ultrasound results which showed no place to biopsy on my breast and was not sure  I didn't have breast cancer.)    He gave me a recomended specialist when I asked for a second opinion;  I haven't gone to him yet.  I  called back the breast surgeon.  More tests pursued in September (mri's and a needle-guided biopsy).    Mayo Clinic was even involved.  No cancer was detected.  The bump had seemed to be getting smaller at the time of the tests and was not even bothering me in part of  October 2013.  In October I helped to paint a fence and was close to/or on the ground where the ground was muddy with water on top.  I had noticed just before that time that overdoing and stress seemed to bother me there.  I wondered if moist soil in Texas had anything to do with my problem as in May/June I had a respiratory illness before I went out and painted a fence and worked a little bit around turkey mulch.  Christmas Day I came home with a cold.  My clavicle bothers me now---more at night and if I have overdone.  I went to th primary care physician onTuesday and I had almost a 102 degree temperature.  My temperature was lower when I took it at home with a mercury thermometer.  I am now takinf cephalexin(500mg.) 4 times a day for 10 days.  If that doesn't do it, I will be going to the thoracic specialist I didn't go to earlier for a second opinion.  Wht do you think I should do?  Could I have a bone infection?

Recently my chest feels tight and I can't take a good deep breath without pain. I've cut down because I'm trying to quit. Is this normal? Will my breathing return to normal or is that the new normal?","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Yes, cigarette smoking is the cause for your symptoms. Cigarette smoke actually causes irritation,  inflammation in the airways. These cause edema and mucus production.  So congestion is due to edema.It also causes bronchospasm,  so breathing difficulty is felt.It also damage respiratory epithelium and make it prone for infection. So chances of lung infection are high in smokers.Since you have started smoking only before 1 month, no need to worry for permanent lung damage.And yes, this can be cured with bronchodilators and antihistamine drug. But you need to quit smoking as soon as possible."},{"Patient":"We were just advised my dad has 80% blockage in Mid LAD. A stint will be placed early next week.

In my opinion,  he is candidate for stenting and not fof bypass.Bypass is indicated only in triple vessel disease (all three major coronaries are blocked).So no scope of bypass surgery in his case.In single vessel disease (LAD) , stenting gives excellent results. You should definitely ask for drug eluting stent (DES). It is newer advance in stents.

The cough finally stopped last week but I have a really bad pain in the top on my ribs on the left side and I got a cramp in my right ribs last night ... is this normal after all the coughing or should I be worried? Thank you","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. There are two possibilities in your case. 1. Pain can be due to spread of pneumonia in left side.2. Coughing can itself cause musculoskeletal pain.So better to get done repeat chest x ray.If chest x ray is normal or resolving for bronchopneumonia then you are mostly having musculoskeletal pain due to coughing.

The funny thing is my co-worker has the same symptoms and I was wondering if it might be a virus?","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Your chest symptoms can be due to viral infection. Upper respiratory tract infection ( URTI ) is common after viral infection. So your chest congestion and heaviness can be due to viral URTI. But your gas, constipation and poor appetite can be due to GERD ( gastroesophageal reflux disease ).  Along with antacids,  you need to follow these lifestyle modifications for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid stress and tension. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Go for walk after meals. 5. Keep 2 - 3 pillows under head in bed to prevent reflux. 6. Loose weight if you are obese. 7.

As you have burning chest pains, salivation, nausea and stomach pains, I would think of causes like gastroesophageal reflux syndrome (GERD), gastritis, esophagitis, etc, which are related to esophagus and stomach.2.

If this does not help you, I would suggest you to consult a gastroenterologist who will examine you and may suggest yoy some investigations.5.

Honestly speaking pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension are not good diseases to have. There is no cure because 100% effective drugs are not invented yet.Both if these cause extreme limitations of physical activity and shortness of breath on minimal exertion. Sex need a lot of exertion. So this will definitely creat problem. For your erectile problem,  I advice you to replace tadalafil by sildenafil . Sildenafil is drug of choice for erectile dysfunction and also useful for pulmonary hypertension. So ask your pulmonologist to start sildenafil.

However, I have tried two different medications that have not helped. I have also seen a cardiologist who did a pulmonary function test, treadmill and tilt table test. All tests were negative. Do you have any other suggestions of what might be going on with me? My performance as a runner has declined substantially in the past few months. My times are getting slower instead of faster even though I continue to train as hard as I ever have.","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem. Since your extensive pulmonary and cardiac work up is normal, no need to worry much for cardiac and pulmonary causes. Rare cause in your case is pulmonary embolism. Since all routine causes have been ruled out,  get done CT pulmonary angiography to rule out Pulmonary embolism. If this is also normal, then no need to worry much. You are having mostly anxiety related symptoms. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need newer anxiolytic drugs too. Avoid stress and tension. Be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright."},{"Patient":"my mom is in her 70s shes already on breathing treatments, when I came home from work today she told me shes going to the Dr tomorrow for a reg appt.

I can understand your situation and problem. Your mother is having very severe degree of shortness of breath.

In my opinion she is having CO2 narcosis (excess carbon dioxide in the body).It is common in smoker. Due to severe damage in lungs (because of smoking), carbon dioxide can not be completely expored from the body.So this will slowly rise in the body. Excess of CO2 supress the Central nervous system (CNS) and makes person unconscious. So she might be collapsed mostly due to CO2 narcosis. The treatment of this is hyperventilation. So patient is put on mechanical ventilator and hyperventilated to remove excess CO2. Viral infection is associated can even worse the condition. So she is also undersedation to achieve good ventilation. Ask her to quit smoking as soon as possible once she is stable."},{"Patient":"Hello.

Tonight for instance I had such an episode that lasted almost 2 hours. I was just lying in bed when I began to feel weird. I had a rapid heartbeat, my chest felt heavy, I felt woozy & was really shaking. I almost called 911 but a friend I called assured me it was probably just a panic attack. I am afterall a somewhat healthy 26 yr old male. I exercise regularly, eat somewhat healthy & quit smoking just over a year ago. However, while looking into causes for chest pains on WebMD I read up on Myocarditis which sounds very similar to my current symptoms. Last November after having unprotected sex I showed symptoms of chlamydia such as pain while urinating & a milky discharge. I was given medication through Planned Parenthood. Symptoms appeared to stop for several weeks & then returned very mild, to the point where it took months to notice. This concerns me very much because Myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle can occur when a viral infection such as chlamydia is left untreated. It reads to seek medical attention immediately. However as a server with no insurance I am reluctant to see a heart doctor immediately so I have requested an appointment with planned parenthood to have a blood test asap & then go from there. Any addition advice would be tremendous. I am somewhat concerned.","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM. I can understand your situation and problem.

I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you should get done repeat chest x ray and PFT ( pulmonary function test ). There are two possibilities in your case. 1. Worsening of underlying pneumonia. 2. Post infectious bronchitis. So repeat chest x ray is needed to rule out worsening of pneumonia. And post pneumonia,  bronchitis is common due to inflammation.  So PFT is needed to rule out this.Wheezing is the classic feature of bronchitis. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these."},{"Patient":"hi there, this s aparajitha. i have been suffering from cough since 15days. consulted doctor inetially they prescribed antibiotic amoxicyllin, they were severe side effects, so i stopped using it. continued with some home remedies. but it is not cured. i have seen few drops of blood in my sputum. i found it 2 to 3 times. could you suggest me any medicine.thanking youwith regardsAparajitha","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM.

I can understand your situation and problem. In my opinion you are having GERD ( gastroesophageal reflux disease ) mostly. Since your CT thorax is normal,  no need to worry much for pulmonary causes. You are having mostly GERD. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause burning chest pain in center of back.You need to follow these lifestyle modifications along with drugs for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. 2. Avoid stress and tension. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Go for walk after meals. 5.

Last Sunday, she was placed on a ventilator and removed from the vent a couple of days later. Currently, she has been decreased from 60L of high flow oxygen to 40L (they are trying to wean her from the high flow oxygen). While resting, she is tolerating the weaning process well. Her O2 saturation remains in the high 90s to 100 and her blood gases are improving and from my understanding, acceptable. However, if she is turned or physically moved up in the bed, etc., her numbers (mainly her O2 saturation) bottoms out and it takes her anywhere from 30 minutes to as long as an hour to recover and get her numbers back up. The doctors and nurses are telling us that they do not know why this is happening. To me, that is very concerning. Could you offer any insight as to why this is happening? She has been diagnosed with COPD (related to smoking) and was not on any oxygen therapy prior to being admitted into the hospital. They did state that her lungs have suffered extensive damage and when I asked how extensive, they could not tell me because she was unable to perform a PF test. She had an upper respiratory infection, which led to her going to the ER initially.","Doctor":"1St of all you are having a good medical knowlege,just for your appreciation. & if, she is having COPD ,then probably her baseline o2 saturation would be low only, if you have previous documented data, or if u know about it, then it would be possible reason for this. Or she might be in right heart failure due to pulmonary hypertension, which would lead to decrease o2 saturation on lying down position from sitting, if so, diuretics will work..According to me ,if she has improved from ventilator with satisfactory ABG, she may do well with sufficient bronchodilators, & if spo2 at room air is less than 88, then with home o2 or sos home bipap.."},{"Patient":"My partner has major heart palpitations dizziness blurred vision chest pain.had chest xray and blood test other day and came back clear.but now has beta blockers and today suffered palpitations chest pain dizziness and pain in left arm what does this mean","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM.

And recurrent pneumothorax is common presenting feature in these patients. And chances of future pneumothorax are high in such patients. So it is always advised to get done VATS (Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery). In this technique blebs and bullae are ligated and pleurodesis (adhesion of pleura) is done. So that potential space for pneumothorax can be obliterated thus future risk of pneumothorax can be avoided. So consult pulmonologist and discuss about these therapeutic options."},{"Patient":"hi.the result of my chest xray says: SUSPICIOUS HAZINESS IS NOTED IN THE LEFT APEX. THE HEART IS NOT ENLARGED.

Around 1.5 liter of water was removed and it was analyzed with rest of the fluid leaving inside the lungs only.

I can understand your concern.In any case of acute chest the worst possibility is acute myocardial infarction or A.M.I (heart attack) which in your case has been hopefully ruled out by the EKGs and Lab tests.Now, 42% of the chest pains without Myocardial infarction occurs due to gastro-oesophageal causes like gastritis , gallstone. Other causes like inflammation of the covering of heart 9pericarditis) , pneumonia (infection of lung) , a bulging of the wall of a great vessel called aorta (aortic aneurysm) can also cause chest discomfort.Look for alarming symptoms like chest pain radiating to the left arm, sweating ; in that case immediately take him to the E.R.I would suggest you to give him a combination of Pantoprazole 40 mg and Domperidone 30 mg every morning in an empty stomach for 10 days.I would also suggest you to take him to a cardiologist , who can correlate the labs and EKG clinically.Hope this helps.Post any other question.

You are mostly having GERD due to drugs and poor dietery habits.It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter.Because of this the acid of the stomach, tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of chest pain.So avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Avoid stress and tension. Start proton pump inhibitor. Go for walk after meals.

She has aspiration pneumonia and as a result of this, a feeding tube was placed up her nose and down her throat. The food would get but so far and there seems to be an obstruction but after being at the hospital since Labor Day, doctors do not know hat has caused any of this. She had a couple of scans of the head, throat and stomach, swallow study and a special blood test to see if it is nerve related. She was diagnosed with endometrial cancer in April which spread to the bone of the brain. Her speech was also slurred but they can t really tell if she has had a stroke or not from the scans. She can t have an MRI because she has a defibrillator which we don t know if it can be turned o or off. A pet scan a couple of months ago had shown significant shrinkage of the cancer and it showed up cold or dead in the areas of the brain bone. She had three doses of chemo- the last was June 27th. Her oncologist does not want to further treat the cancer with chemo because of the damage that it did (although she recovered nicely from high liver enzymes) Now doctors want to discharge her and put a feeding tube in her stomach without testing to see if she can swallow without aspirating. I think that with therapy my mother can regain her swallowing ability without having to put a feeding tube surgically in her stomach, but the doctors don t even want to re-evaluate her.","Doctor":"It would be better to go ahead with the peg tube ( feeding tube in stomach) looking at overall clinical picture because the diet is the most important aspect and it should not be hampered at present..

I have an irregular heart beat which is being treated by my doctor over many years.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.Your chest pain is mostly due to hiatus hernia, but we need to rule out cardiac cause first as you are having irregular heart beats.So consult cardiologist and get done1. ECG2. 2d echo3. Stress test to rule out cardiac causes.If all of the above are normal then mostly you are having pain due to hiatus hernia.Hiatus hernia is known risk factor for GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). And because of this the acid is going up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of chest pain.So avoid hot and spicy food, avoid stress and tension. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Start proton pump inhibitor.If not improving with above lifestyle modifications then you may need surgical correction of hiatus hernia."},{"Patient":"I have been having mild chest pain for the last few days.

The consequences of alcohol and the fluid/volume imbalances causes, along with the disruption of normal gut mobility and chemistry often; symptoms of bloating, gas, increased urination, dehydration; and other issues, all of which can directly or indirectly lead to the discomfort you describe. My suggestion is to ensure your chemistry and physicality returns to a normal state after experiencing encounters with toxins. These include multivitamins, a diet with nutrients, electrolytes and hydration, along with Folate and B-12 depending on the length and or recurrence of these episodes. If symptoms continue I highly suggest a visit with your primary care and or emergency physician. I wish you the best."},{"Patient":"my son (21 yr old) was diagnosed with pleurisy a year and a half ago. He was and is very active.

In addition to the chest pains I have been burping a lot weird because I usually don t burp at all, and my left arm down to my middle finger has pains sometimes. I m not sure if that is related because I do hair a lot so for years sometimes my hands cramp up. Also, some background, I have asthma and 2 weeks before this started my asthma had gotten so bad that I had developed bronchitis. The coughing had put a lot of stress on my chest as well but the pain had went away after I took some medication. Some more background is that I had gained around 40 pounds in the last 10 months from inactivity (I used to do sports for 6 years & then stopped). Lastly, I thought the chest pain was from me crying a lot because I had a traumatic event recently and the pain came right after and got worse everyday that I was crying really hard. Sorry it s such a long message but as you can see, I have a lot of factors playing right now so I m really all over the place in terms of finding out what is wrong with me. Thank you in advance!","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.In my opinion we should first rule out cardiac cause for your chest pain. So get done ECG. If this is normal then no need to worry for cardiac cause.Uncontrolled asthma is the cause for your chest pain. And your burping can be due to GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). GERD can cause poor control of asthma. So In your case control of GERD and asthma is needed.So consult pulmonologist and start inhaled treatment for asthma and proton pump inhibitor for GERD.Once your asthma and GERD is control , your chest pain will also be subside.Don't worry, you will be alright."},{"Patient":"I am 37 years old I am having cheast pain when I walk for even 50 mtr distance or climb starecase .my docter has suggested me pills of heart but inspite of taking it regularly I have still same prroblem after 20 days pls suggest me what to do .my doctor tolled me to come after a month for chackup should I wait for month or go to another dr for chqup .

He feels as though he cannot breath when laying down and sleeps sitting upright. He loses his breath easily and cannot do simple tasks such as climb the stairs without taking a break most days. We have gone to his doctor three times to express our concerns, however the only thing he has done is a chest xray. The doc told me it was normal, but upon reviewing is medical records, it actually showed Mild perihilar/bibasilar subsegmental atelectasis and parenchymal scarring change with associated volume loss.

However, when I fly longer than 3 hours I find it very difficult to get enough oxygen, I cannot sleep on long flights and my heart races on planes as well as when I am at higher altitudes (such as skiing in Colorado) Or hiking in the Adirondacks. My family thinks I make up my discomfort. Is there a scientific connection? If so what can I do to prepare better? We traveled to Italy last summer and after 10 hours of flying I felt awful. Partially lack of sleep, but I just felt gray. I am concerned about a flight to Vietnam in Dec.","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.Your problem is genuine. And it is mostly because of the anaemia. In anaemia, hemoglobin (Hb) is low. Hb is the only source for oxygen to the tissues. In normal air oxygen concentration is sufficient to meet the demand of body tissue.But in long flight or at high altitude the oxygen concentration in air is low. This low concentration will not affect normal, healthy individuals because their Hb is normal and they are not having asthma. Since your Hb is low, oxygen supply to the tissues is also low and body  starts hyperventilating to meet the oxygen need.So you feel breathlessness, and this made more worse by your mild asthma.This is the scientific reason for your breathlessness on long flights and at high altitude.Correction of anaemia and control of asthma are needed for you to avoid such breathlessness."},{"Patient":"Hi.

The doctor is still doing tests because I don't have the profile at all. 105 pounds, 5'2', non smoker, doing sports, etc.  My cholesterol is on the high side, but the triglycerids are quite low.  The doctor prescribed 325mg aspirin, but since I reaaly don't fit the profile, there is scepticism.  But I am very worried.","Doctor":"Since you already had a Tia, you needs to be on med. I gues ct or MRI brain , echocardiography, ecg, carotid artery Doppler, blood sugar must have been done.You need to apirin, lower dose than 325, atorvastatin as well for cholesterol and stroke prevention. Blood pressure should be frequently checked.Tia is frequently associated with heart problems also so should be vigilant about chest pain and should be evaluated if having.So any of the above test are not done then get it done.Also healthy lifestyle and regular exercises, low fat, oily diet will help."},{"Patient":"Hi I have now experienced a dull pain on my left side of my chest 3 times and each time it lasts for at least 7-12 min. The first time I had this pain I went and got an EKG and nothing was wrong. I got another chest pain in Oct 2013 and another one in Dec 2013. I went and got checked out again and this time the results were a pinch off. The doctor said something about tests being inferior. I don't know what he meant or what this all could mean.Thanks for your help.","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM.In my opinion your doctor might be telling about inferior leads changes in ECG.In ECG, there are many leads and waves. But lead II, III and avF are representative of inferior wall of heart.So if you have ischemia of inferior wall, ECG changes will reflect in leads II, III and avF.So your doctor might be used word 'inferior' in regards with inferior lead abnormalities on ECG.So better to reconfirm this by repeat ECG and 2d echo through cardiologist.Also show him your previous ECG s for comperision."},{"Patient":"I have had a bad cough for about 5 months. I have also chronic migraines, I have sleep apnea and I also have hypothyroidism . Lately every time I cough I pee heavenly in my pants :( I have night sweats and also my hands and feet have been sweating a lot. What do I do?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.You are having too many health issues simultaneously.In my opinion you should consult pulmonologist and get done1. Chest x ray2. PFT (pulmonary function test).You are having chronic cough since 5 months. So we need to rule out lung infection and bronchitis first.So chest x ray is needed to rule out lung infection.PFT is needed to rule out bronchitis.Uncontrolled sleep apnea can also cause chronic cough.So better to consult pulmonologist and first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. You are having stress incontinence (urine problem). So control of cough is needed to treat urine problem."},{"Patient":"my daughter, Caucasian, age 45, married, vegetarian, relatively good health (neither smokes, drinks alcohol or abuses drugs).She has been losing weight in last few months (about 125 now from 140+, probably has undiagnosed GERD, but Hx of ulcer). Because of GI problems, she was on a more liquid diet in past two months as solid food would cause her to vomit.About 10 - 12 days ago a sharp pain in the lower right chest developed. She noticed her ribs showing and a slight depression beneath her right breast. Other members of family have had flu-like illnesses in past two weeks. She had 102F temp and was similarly ill but never had the same respiratory symptoms that the others had... no cough. Last week she finally was seen by a physician, had x-rays, blood drawn have no results), was Dx with atelectasis R lower lobe and Rx Zithromax prophylaxis for possible pneumonia.Is there a possibility that the former may be an underlying cause of the latter?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.Atelectesis is partial collapse of part of lung.It is mainly due to retained secretions in the bronchus.And I section is the most common cause for secretions.So , her current condition can be due to spread of infection from the family members.Treatment of atelectesis is 1. Vigorous chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercise for removal of secretions.2. Mucolytic and expectorant drugs to clear secretions.3. Antibiotics to treat infection.Get done repeat chest x ray after 7-10 days and if atelectesis is still there then get done bronchoscopic treatment for atelectesis.Don't worry, she will be alright."},{"Patient":"My friend has been placed in a medically induced coma, as he has a bad chest infection that has spread to his lungs, he has also been self harming and has very bad wounds that require plastic surgery which are also infected, the toxicology test has also came back with traces of steroids, they are now saying his muscles are breaking up and producing toxins that are causing his kidneys to start failing, what are his chances of survival and how long can they keep him in this coma for before it would start causing irreversible damage, his own oxygen levels in Friday when admitted to hospital were only 3.5%, any information would be gratefully appreciated,kind regards Claire.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.Sorry to say but your friend's situation is very very critical.He is having very very less chances of survival.Practically speaking he is having less than 5% chances of survival.He is having septicemia and related complications like hypoxemia, skin and muscle necrosis, brain damage and renal damage by rhabdomyoglobins (secreted from damaged muscles). All these changes are irreversible and lead to MODS (multi organ dysfunction syndrome) and finally to death.So your friend is having very very less chances of survival."},{"Patient":"I was told that I have a 14 the rib which is basically a birth defect I am 64 and have had back problems most of my life. I now have spinal stenosis, 2 bulging discs and reg. arthritis all in the lumbar area. I have just started therapy and injection for the stenosis but it was tol to me that removal of the 14th rib, other issues I have  could be reduced and the quality of life could be improved. Exactly where is this rib located? How invasive is the procedure to remove it?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.You are having accessory rib.Ribs are originated from spine (from back) and inserted on sternum (in front of chest) through cartilage.Rarely extra rib/ribs are originated from spine but did not rich to the sternum and hence they are known as floating ribs or accessory ribs.Usually they are asymptomatic but whenever symptomatic (like back pain in your case), surgery is needed to remove accessory rib.It is major operation and done under general anaesthesia. The approach is from the back."},{"Patient":"HI I have a small, hard lump slightly of centre at the end of my sterum, If i look down while breathing out and pulling my tummy in its quite obvious, its noticeable.  Its not attached to skin by seems to be on the process thing where last ribs meet.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.By your description and history, I think you are talking about xiphoid process.It is terminal part of sternum and in some individual, it is separate bone and can gives feeling of hard lump on touch.So mostly it is xiphoid process of sternum.So no need to worry much for this as it is normal thing.But better to rule out other things by ultrasound examination of local part.If ultrasound is normal then no need to worry for this thing.It is normal xiphoid process."},{"Patient":"I've never been able to drink soda's very fast becaue i get a tight feeling in my chest near my throat, it happens a lot more often when i drink alchoholic drinks.  I have a feeling it's trapped air of sorts because i hiccup a lot and feel like a good burp would make me feel better (which i've never been able to do on command)","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.In my opinion you are having GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter.Because of this, the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the burping sensation in the esophagus (throat).And alcohol actually deteriorate GERD.So better to avoid alcohol and start proton pump inhibitor.Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals.Avoid stress and anxiety.Don't worry, you will be alright."},{"Patient":"hi is it normal or fit to work coz i did my chest xray this is the chest pa .the lung are hyperaerated but no active parenchymal infiltrates .heart is not enlarged.the diaphragm ,costophrenic sulci and osseous structures are unremarkable impressions pulmonary hyperaeration..do i need to take xray for second opinion or not?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.No need to worry much for hyperinflation on chest x ray if you are not having any symptoms like cough or dyspnea and you are not smoker.But is you are smoker or having above mentioned symptoms, then better to get done PFT (pulmonary function test) to rule out bronchitis. No need for second opinion as repeat x ray will not tell you anything.But PFT will help you in diagnosing bronchitis.If PFT is also normal then no need to worry much for bronchitis or hyperinflation on x ray.So my advice is to go for PFT rather then repeat chest x ray. PFT will give you more information."},{"Patient":"Hi, i just got my mother's chest x-ray and the findings are:  Suspicious densities are noted in both upper lobes superimposed on the bony structures.

Tracheal is midline,  Both hemidiaphragms and costophrenic sulci are intact.  The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable. Anyone who can explain what is this mean?","Doctor":"HelloX ray findings suggests suspicious lesions in upper lobes of lung,so your mother may need apico-lordotic view.This view is needed because upper lobe of lungs are covered by many bony structures like clavicle,ribs etc.There are chances of missing of findings in normal chest X-ray if there are lesions in upper lobes.Rest of the lung field are normal.Sclerotic aorta is due to aging.Heart size is also normal.Pulmonary blood vessels are normal.Both CP angles and both domes of diaphragm are also normal.Get well soon.Take CareDr.Indu Bhushan"},{"Patient":"For about four days I have had a burning type feeling that seems to move all around, but mostly in my arms, back, and neck.

The androgel seems like it is working with my energry levels. but I cann't get a erection without taking cailis.

Chest x ray2. PFT (pulmonary function test).Many times clinical examination of respiratory system is normal but chest x ray and PFT are abnormal and indicative of disease.Chest infection can cause breathing problem. So chest x ray is needed.Bronchitis can cause breathing problem, so PFT is needed to rule out it.If both are normal then you may have anxiety and related symptoms.

How to use FORECOX tablets..doctor said one in the morning and one in the evening. Please kindly answer my questions.Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.Quentiferon TB gold test measures IgG antibodies against mycobacteria tuberculosis (MTB). So positive test does not always means you are suffering from active TB disease.It is positive in patients who are living in TB endemic areas,had past TB infection etc.So just on the basis of positive quentiferone TB gold test, one can not diagnosed as having tuberculosis and should not be started treatment.Your chest x ray is also normal and you are not having coughing,so no role of positive quentiferone TB gold test in you. And thus you should not take anti TB drugs.So, I advice you to consult pulmonologist and discuss all these before starting anti TB drugs.And forecox is anti TB drug. It should be taken simultaneously. So don't take in morning and evening. Take both tablet in the morning.But first consult pulmonologist before starting forecox."},{"Patient":"when I cough it sometimes feels like something is coming up from under my left rib and getting pinched between it and the fleshy part under the skin.

About 4-5 yrs back after having lunch my father had coughed out blood number of times partly old and partly fresh blood.He has ecosprin.After a few tests nothing was found. @ yrs back he had angioplasty because of blockage in two of his arteries.One with 80% and the other with 90%.After that he was ok .Since few months the doc.prescribed him with ecosprin gold. Now,2days back he coughed out blood old and fresh after having lunch.He was admitted to a hospital where the doctor stopped the ecosprin gold...he was given saline with few injections.The bleeding stopped that very day...only spots of old blood is seen with his sputum which is more or less negligible...sputum test ,ecg and other tests result was all good...Pls advise why is this happening..(.worried daughter).","Doctor":"Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM.I can understand your situation and problem.Ecosprin gold is having aspirin, clopidogrel and atorvastatin.Aspirin is having anticoagulant property.So it prevent blood coagulation.And blood coagulation is must to stop bleeding.So it is common to see bleeding in patients taking aspirin. It is due to prevention of blood clotting. So blood will not stop. And as and when you stop aspirin, blood will start clotting and bleeding will stop.Same is happening in your father's case. Since his other reports are normal, no need to worry much for major diseases.Blood in sputum is due to aspirin only."},{"Patient":"Does meth really crystalize in your lungs??
