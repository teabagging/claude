I read very carefully your description. Something you have not mentioned above, but may be a common cause of frequent chronic sore throat together with cough, is gastroesofageal reflux, which because of the reflux of acid in the throat may cause this sore throat. Acid gets in the lungs so cough appears as symptom. It has a nonspecific appearance on throat examination, so people may do all sorts of labs and treat throat infection, but at the end it does not get better.I would recommend that you take omeprazole 20 mg once day for 2 weeks, try to not have dinner late, keep your head of bed slightly high when sleeping.

Viral infections are self limiting and should reduce without any therapy within 15 days. But in viral infections you are prone for superadded viral and bacterial infections due to the fall in immunity. I am suspecting the same in your case. I suggest you take bed rest. Take a healthy diet to replenish your immune system. You can take multivitamin supplements to boost your immunity. I assure you you will feel better within 10 days. thanks."},{"Patient":"I have a friend recovering from Clostridium difficult, but he still drinks alcohol on a regular basis.

An abscess would also contain blood mixed with the discharge.If you have sitz baths this would help to clean it and with the healing process. This involves sitting in warm (not hot water ) for 10 to 15 minutes, 2 to 3 times a day (or going to the sea if this is an option).If it has be done at home (no sea water)then you can add salt to the water.Continue the antibiotics.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hello, I m 69 years old 5-11 215 lb I can walk 2.4 miles in 45 min , non smoker for last 15 years I am on BP Med and it is controlled 130 over 78.but i am by no means Chiseled Recently when I stand and walk after setting I get a tingle in back of my legs Mostly in my left one and my feet, Walking for a couple of minutes and it goes away never had this before","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.

She stayed in this time almost a week, was released, went home and passed away in her sleep within 4-5 days after coming home.

This is not common. You were unlucky enough to suffer from a serious complication of surgery. The skin protects the interior of our body from bacteria and other pathogens. Skin cuts may invite pathogens inside the body. That's why surgeons should be very careful and meticulous when preparing the patient's skin for incisions.Hollow organs like the intestine also harbor potential pathogens. Injury of the intestine may release those pathogens to the peritoneal cavity and cause infections. I don't know what happened in your case but peritoneal infections can be hard to eradicate.

After the second (abdominal abscess) relapse the picc line was reinserted for approximately 3 weeks in late May. I now have an extreme sensitivity to heat and cold in the vein that runs up the inside my left arm (site of the picc line) and around my armpit. It also is irritated if I lift something heavy. Even on a good day, when it doesn’t hurt, I can feel it, and would describe it as irritating on a bad day the pain ranges to about 7 or 8 on the pain scale. Please don’t tell me to use a heating pad or cold compress, this does not work and only makes the matters worse. What could be causing this? What can I do to alleviate the pain?","Doctor":"Hi and thank you so much for this query.I a so sorry to hear about these symptoms that you have reported. I am of the thinking that a nerve ending was probably injured during this procedure and is responsible for the constant pain. If local measures like heat and cold packs no longer help, then trying pain medications would help.  I will suggest you start with topical agent like capsaicin/local creams and see if there is an improvement.  I believe you would be able to identify a product that works well for you and this would be used thereon to control your symptoms.I hope this helps. I wish you well.

My blood pressure is now normal, and my blood sugar level averages 125. A few days ago I suddenly developed a sharp, rhythmic, stabbing pain in my right chest, just under my right breast. I also feel a bit ill all over during the episodes. The episodes occur all day long, and last from a few minutes to a few hours, and do not respond to over the counter pain medicines. Should I worry? Go to my doctor this week? Go to the hospital if the condition get worse? Thank you Glen R Davis","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I need to know more about the symptoms, like precipitating factors, factors that increases pain etc. Sharp rhythmic stabbing pain is unlikely to be cardiac. However, its better to get yourself examined by local doctor. Mostly it's a gastritis and reflux disease. Do you upper abdominal pain, nausea, bloating, burping, increase in pain on food, sour water feeling in throat or chest burning, if yes it further supports the diagnosis. You should avoid fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have some walk after having food instead of taking rest. Have multiple small meals instead of heavy meals. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. You can get prescribed tab Pan DSR 40 mg beforebreakfast once a day for 2 weeks. Secondly does this pain increases on applying pressure over the area, if yes it could be costochondritis and it's a musculoskeletal type of pain and needs prolonged nsaid therapy. Does this pain increases on deep breathing and coughing etc. if yes it a pain arising from lining of lungs and needs nsaids treatment and evaluation. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"I m in hospital with my husband. He had biopsy because his PSA was 4.75. After Biopsy he had chills and now he is with ESBL infection , gram negative resistant to anitbiotics. His cancer is benign not even stage 1. Because of this infection he s hesitant to go for any other procedure related to prostate. Pls advise can we wait and watch the growth of cancer?","Doctor":"Hello,prostate biopsy is essential for cancer diagnosis and estimation of prognosis. Unfortunately in some cases (not very often) complications happen. You ran into one of them. He's probably got infected with a hospital bacterium (ESBL bacteria reside in hospitals) that needs special treatment. There are scoring systems (Gleason grading system) for prostate cancer prognosis. Prostate cancer can be aggressive - which can prove difficult to treat - or not. If it is aggressive then you can't just watch and wait. He needs treatment. If not, then it's very possible that the cancer will be growing so slowly that he'll never have a problem with it.I hope I've addressed your concerns!If you need further assistance, please ask me again!Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"Hello.

Since Hashis is autoimmune disease, and immune system has to clear the ink when it s broken up by the removal laser, is it safe to move forward with removal or should I just leave the tattoo alone?","Doctor":"Greetings. Well that is an interesting question and i am glad that i may be able to help you in clearing your doubt.Do you know that, Many AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES, Cancer,  are now linked to toxins in Tattoo ink. -- What does Laser Tattoo Removal do? The laser works by targeting the unwanted tattoo and exposing it to a beam of intense laser light, delivered in pulses. Each pulse of light disintegrates the dye, breaking it up into manageable particles that can be eliminated naturally by the body’s filtration system. The tattoo will not disappear. Rather, it typically fades over a period of time following each session.Tattoos generally require 8-10 treatments performed at regular intervals. To ensure optimum success, an interval of 4-6 weeks is normal between treatment sessions. Although the exact number of sessions required depends on a number of factors, including the size, color, depth of ink and type of tattoo.A very chronic tattoo skin cell reaction induced to an old cosmetic tattoos after an intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment for facial skin rejuvenation is reported. On the whole  i suggest that IPL treatment should be used cautiously in patients with tattoos, especially when a history of AUTO IMMUNE DISEASE (viz.,HASHIMOTO) is present.Discuss with your doctor the reasons why you want your tattoo removed & don't forget to ask your physician about the risks associated with the procedure.This is just a guidance and not a definitive treatment. Hope i guided you rightly & helped you to make decision."},{"Patient":"hi i have a question so i just got a yeasst infection my nipples r really sore and have white dots on them and are always hard usually and have had really bad headaches, lower back and abdomen pain and feel sick and a few times i feel dizzy and im always tired what could be wrong","Doctor":"Hi, From what you are describing, having sore nipples with white dots is indicative for skin infection. I need to have a photo of the white dots and nipples to determine whether it is a yeast infection or bacterial.There are many causes to headaches:- anemia- feeling tired- tension headache - oscillations in blood pressure or/and blood sugar levelsFurther investigations are needed to determine the right cause. Having lower back ache and abdominal pain might be related to possible uro-genital infection. Urine analysis is advised to rule it out. Once the right cause will be found and correctly treated, you won't have such symptoms anymore. Take good hygiene of your nipples:- have frequent bathes- apply betaine locallyWish fast recovery!Dr.Albana"},{"Patient":"Hi I am using SEBOWASH and 8x shampoos as I am facing fungal infection on my scalp. it is temporarily solving the problem but not permanant.

For the past 8 days, I have been experiencing fever that would start around the afternoon period and disappear in the morning, slight headache and chest pain. Some days before this I had rashes around my anus. I went for a test 5 days ago and below is the result; S.typhi(O 1:320, H 1:160). My doctor recommended Ciproflaxin and I have completed the dosage without any improvement in my health. I decided to visit another doctor. He carried out a blood test and claimed I do not have any trace of S.typhi. I don t know what is wrong with me. Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hi, Temitayo Steven, did the doctors check anything besides for S. typhi? Your symptoms are nonspecific and could be almost any kind of infection. A lot more tests might be needed. The first test you did for S. typhi only indicates you have been infected at some time; it may not be an acute infection. Some things I would consider are strep, pneumonia, malaria, other parasitic infections, HIV, herpes, certain other STDs, tuberculosis, atypical mycobacterial infections, other bacterial infections. Many bacterial infections require a different antibiotic than Ciprofloxin. You need to have a good examination, to describe the rash, and get more testing done to see what this could be.

He said some famous Heart Dr. in the 70 s in California said anyone whose heart missed a beat had a MVP. I m tired a lot of the time and I m sure it s cuz of the Metropolol. I m also 68 years old and in pretty good health. Take 5 mg of Xanax to sleep and 10 mg of Paxil since going thru menopause. This past summer my hair started falling out in globs so my Dr. told me to change to CARDIZEM LA 120MG TAB. My question to you is how does 25 mg of Metropolol compare to 120 mg. of Cardizem?

If you are having skipped beats as well, which are ectopics, these may not be adequately controlled by cardizem. However, fast heart rate due to atrial fibrillation or atrial ectopics will be controlled by it. So let me know, whats your entire diagnosis. If you are advised by doctor to change to cardizem, then you should have it. You may have Tab Cardizem LA once a day. Hope I have answered your query.

My gynecologist performed a cone biopsy and until recently my pap tests have all turned out negative.I was told I will always have the virus in my body and have to always use condom so as not to pass the HPV to my current boyfriend. I want to know if my body really will not get cured from this and should I always keep using condoms? Thanks for your reply","Doctor":"At this time, unfortunately, there is no cure available for HPV and it does remain in your body. Hopefully someday a cure will be found, but for now you should always use a condom so the infection is not transmitted. The other thing is that you have had the HPV for awhile so it's possible your boyfriend has already picked up the infection. Men typically get little bumps or growths on their genital area. It's not easy to check for this infection in men until the lesions become obvious. In any case, you should still use condoms because he may not have gotten the disease yet and you could prevent that from happening.

I once had a patient who had seizures from aspartame, also hadn't heard about that. Her symptoms cleared up when she stopped the aspartame. The only way to know if the sucralose is causing the yeast infections is to stop taking it and see if it stops happening. The time course is very suggestive of sucralose being the cause. So I would stop taking it. Also check food labels to be sure you are not eating foods that might contain it (especially diet drinks).

It seems that you seem to have no problem and it's normal physiological phenomenon happening in all individuals provided they are at the limit of what you have mentioned here. If it's beyond what you've expressed here and is interfering with your routine activity/ getting worse it's best advise you consult a general Physician at the earliest to avoid any further complication.The feel like \\"very light headed when standing but it only happens from minute to minutes and I feel like I m going to faint I m very cold but than I get hot really fast I feel like throwing up and really heavy\\" - all are due to blood flow/ pressure changes happening inside you on changing to different posture viz., a condition explained as \\"POSTURAL CHANGE OF BLOOD PRESSURE\\".As i had mentioned earlier, best advise is to visit a General Physician & confirm yourself whether you are normal  & avoid complication .

I had been using bactitracin on it but am not wondering if I need to stop using it as it has been 2 weeks today since this occurred. I also have tried aloe vera from a home plant. Any other suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello,This is Dr. Klarida Papaqako answering your question.From what you have described, looks like you are doing the right things to your burning wound. The area that is not healed yet must have been a deeper burning, or it is on the plantar/soft skin area of the foot.If I was your caring doctor, I would recommend to continue the antibiotic if there is still skin damage, but if its already healed then continue using only aloe vera, or any other cream with no smell and color.. Most important thing of healing fast though, is keeping always the skin clean and well moisturized.Massaging your scars with lotion will keep them moist, make them less sensitive and make your stretching easier. It may also prevent skin breakdown. Taking some pain killers as Ibuprofen 400 mg as needed, will help with the pain also.Hope this information is helpful.Take care."},{"Patient":"I got bit by something on my way back from my mail box like 3 days ag.

The one on my shin is bigger (I think because this one itches A LOT, and kept unknowingly scratching at it ) It s not bumpy, just flat(aside from the tiny bit in the middle) and bright red with a blotchy/jagged type edge.

However, see your GP as soon as possible if your symptoms are severe. If not severe Minor bites and stings can be treated by: * Placing a cold compress (a flannel or cloth cooled with cold water) over the affected area to reduce swelling * Do not scratch the area as it can become infected. If the bite or sting is painful or swollen, you can also: * Take painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen after your doctor consultation. * Wrap an ice pack, such as a bag of frozen peas, in a towel and place it on the swelling * Your doctor may prescribe a spray or cream that contains local anaesthetic , antihistamine or mild steroid on the affected area to prevent itching and swelling and also take an oral course of antihistamine.

By the next morning the redness had started to go down my leg and it has been itchy and warm with some swelling where it is red . It also feels like i have a thick hard vein? Or something like that going down from top of thigh to where the redness stops . It was still a little red this morning and i thought it was going but by late afternoon it s started to get itchy again . It is warn to the touch . I got bitten by something on Tue afternoon on my calf and by wed morning and my calf was very swollen but that seems to be less hard and swollen today . Wondered if it was to do with the bite . Thanks Angela","Doctor":"Hi, Angela. Certainly this could possibly be related to the bite, but there are 2 other possibilities that require prompt evaluation. One of these is a blood clot in the deep veins of your leg. This can create swelling, redness, heat, and pain. An infection in the skin can create similar symptoms and eventually spread into your blood. If you are still having any of these symptoms or the thick hard vein, get checked at an urgent care center or emergency right away. An untreated blood clot or infection like this could progress into a life-threatening situation. Hope this answers your query. If you have further questions, I would be happy to answer them."},{"Patient":"I m scared I think I have a yeast infection if have been on the internet and it said that they can kill you If untreated and this is my first time I really need you to answer this pleaseeee I am 12 and I m to recoups to tell my mum and I am almost certain that I have got it","Doctor":"What are your symptoms?

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. So heart evaluation, what was the cause found for arrhythmia. I guess those are ventricular ectopics. As aggravated by coffee, try to keep its consumption under control.  Also, you should get your drug modified, and request to include beta blockers in the current medicines instead of other medicines. This will prevent ectopics from occurring. They are usually safe and should try if ectopics are there. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"I had the flu recently which lasted longer than normal for me (3 weeks) but 2 weeks ago I noticed my lower ribs hurting. I assumed I strained them coughing but we are now 2 weeks later and the pain is getting worse. Is there anything I can do or do I need to see my gp?","Doctor":"Hello,More information is needed for a complete answer. I'll try to guess what's missing and give you the best answer that I can.You mentioned having flu but you did not say anything about laboratory investigation. Was there a positive flu test? Did you have an X-ray?Is the pain one-sided? Is it worse when coughing or taking deep breaths?Do you have shortness of breath? What about fever?I would be more worried if you had ongoing fever (even low-grade), one-sided pain, getting worse when breathing particularly if you also felt you can't get enough oxygen. Sometimes inflammation may spread to the outer layer of the lung and cause pleuritis. The same can happen to the heart's lining layer (pericarditis). Besides the above, other serious complications may cause worsening rib pain. You definitely need a gp visit. If the aforementioned symptoms describe your case then you should see your gp right away. I hope you get well!Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"Hi there I ve been stung/bitten on my arm It was either last night or early this morning.

I keep it covered to reduce the risk of infection but it s oozing some kind of liquid and still kind of bleeding when I put the cover over it. It s still an open wound after 3 days and is not starting to heal, what should I do?","Doctor":"Greetings. Please don't worry, we are there to guide you. As for as oozing is concerned, it denotes a vein injury and not an artery. If the area begins to swell, apply pressure till the bleeding stops. Note:  --> If the cut is a centimeter or longer and you can see tissue below the skin, it may need stitches -If not bleeding and cut is small , Just follow simple steps :1. Thoroughly clean the wound under running water to free out any debris and dirt.2. Dry the wound.3. Add some antibiotic ointment if you have it.4. Cover the wound with clean cloth like gauze or simply wrap a BAND-AID5. Avoid water contact with wound.Visit a doctor and get a TT injection shot if not vaccinated earlier .Hope it helped."},{"Patient":"I have a wound that is not healing.

Is the yellowing from the Neosporin or pus. It wipes off and leaves the red appearance again.","Doctor":"HelloWelcome to Health care magic.I reviewed your history.These symptoms indicate infection of the wound.

Clotrimazole can be safely used in all the vulvar area and in the clitoris also.It needs to be used twice a day.And yes, it will take away the itching. With the pill you are taking by mouth, it should be completely healed in max 5 days.

Azithromycin is a very good medicine, and it works for lots of bacterial problems, but people may also be resistant to it, or there are also problems who may not be covered by it.The fact the its not working after the third dose, means that one of the above options is possible, and you need to consult your doctor again, so he runs another check up, does other labs, and gives the proper antibiotic that your son is sensitive to.Hope this helps,Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi,I am JayaNaresh.My grand fa having nearly 70 yrs.He is suffering from fileria since 25 yrs.Frequently he is getting fever because of fileria.This problem is very civier since 5 yrs.Its releasing serum(like water and getting bad smell) from the effected area and its also swelling.The effected area is right leg below the knee.Please let me know the solution for this problem.","Doctor":"Hello Jaya Naresh,I understand your grandfather's problem. He has swelling of the legs from the blockage of his lymph vessels and this can lead to oozing of lymph if there is any scratch or abrasion. This problem is produced by the dead worms in his lymphatic system especially in the lymph nodes. His fever can be due to two reasons. If he has an infection of his leg or if he has microfilaria in the blood. A night blood sample examined for micrfilaria may show it if it is present and then it should be treated with the medicine Diethylcarbamazine ( Hetrazan). If there is infection of the leg abrasion or ulceration he would require local and systemic antibiotics. The important way to avoid infection is to keep the legs clean and take care that he walks around only with protective footwear and to wash the legs everyday with water and mild disinfectant.Also please check whether he suffers from diabetes which will increase his chance of infection.If he is in good health surgical removal of the swelling can also be considered, for which you can consult a surgeon.If you have further queries, I am ready to answer them.Best wishes,Dr. Noble Zachariah"},{"Patient":"Yes, my 15 year old daughter is complaining that her heart is hurting.

In summary i sutured a wound 10 cm length with a well washed but not sterilized suturing set. My question is that beside the probability of later wound infection is there a risk for HIV, HBsAg, HCV contamination of that person? ( the wound was perfectly cleansed and washed perfectly by betadine before suturing)","Doctor":"Hello, Thnx to contact us. If I am your treating doctor I would like to advice you that before how much time you have sutured previous patient.

Clostridium tetani is convert into highly resistant spore form and not get washed with the water. If you have anything else to ask please contact me. Thanx.

After removing large branch, took off my gloves to remove the broken box wood branches and reach into the bush and received a sharp hot sting on end of my little finger. Could not see or find the insect, there was no marks or stinger in the skin. Treated with ice and desoximetasone .05%, which reduced the stinging. Went back to work.

Yes, its safe to use the cream in the vagina as well, because creams are made to be used in the skin and in mucous also. Make sure to keep the skin as dry as possible. Very rarely the antifungal medicines can give redness and irritation sensation as a side effect. If that happens, I would recommend to go and meet your doctor again, so he prescribes one that your sensitive area tolerates better.

Though infection is the most common cause of fevers, they can also be caused by rheumatologic conditions (joints, etc.), cancers, blood clots, medications, and autoimmune conditions. Though there is no way to know for sure without doing test. I recommend you see a physician about your fevers. Cyclical fevers (those that go away and come back) can be seen in malaria, babesiosis (a tick born infection similar to malaria), as well as many rheumatologic conditions, including one known as cyclical fever syndrome. Any case, it needs Treatment.So, I will suggest to contact your doctor for detailed help.Thanks & Regards,Dr. Gaurav Prajapati"},{"Patient":"I have thyroid cancer and I have liposacoma cancer.

After about 10 days the area around d piercing got red and a small tissue of skin (like a boil/pimple) grew. I've applied coconut oil, neosporin but to no avail. I am afraid the small mole like tissue around the piercing might become permanent. Pls help.","Doctor":"Hello!This is Dr. Klarida Paqaqako answering your question.There are 2 possibilities that the tissue growth in the piercing area can be:1)  If it hurts, seeps, have pus and/or bleeds it's probably either an infection or a sebaceous cyst (which can become infected). In this case If I was your caring doctor, would recommend to cleanse 2-3 times a day with an antimicrobial soap, or apply a local tripple antibiotic (check if you are allergic to its components) if just soap doesn't help.2) It can be a Keloid, which are formations of scar tissue that grow because the body over-defends itself as a result of trauma or surgical incisions. If you are prone to keloiding, piercings are strongly urged against. There's no real limit as to where keloids can form, as they can also grow on the tongue and other mucus membranes. The only way to truly prevent keloiding is to not get the tattoo or piercing. They need to be removed with the help of surgical removal if they happen. Looks like the second option is most probably to be in your case. Hope this helps,Regards."},{"Patient":"My son 19, visited a friend and has been bitten by fleas.

Should he work while this is so intense?  Thank you?","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for writing to HCM about your query,Flea bites will go away on their own. However, in order to stop the flea bites, you have to stop the fleas. Your pet and your home will need to be treated with pesticides to kill the fleas. Professional pest control experts should administer these treatments. In most cases, you will need to leave your home for several hours after the treatment is applied. Do-it-yourself home treatments are available for fleas, but if they do not work, you may need to seek professional help.Relieve the symptoms of flea bites with over-the-counter anti-itch creams and antihistamine medications. Avoid scratching the area. If you notice signs of an infection at the bite site, such as a white pocket or rash, make an appointment to see your doctor.Hope You will find it out helpful.Thanks And Regards,Dr. Gaurav Prajapati"},{"Patient":"So, recently my head has been hurting, mostly when I lean over or sneeze, cough, etc..

I am currently stuck in a \\"spell\\" since late October and am getting really tired of this. Dr. says my ears are clear and normal, and gave me 3 days anti-biotics to clear up the sinus drainage. Didn't help me much so after waiting 2 months to see ENT, I am now on 21 days of anti-biotics with a ct scheduled after it finishes. The pressure isn't in the front of my face as usual, it feels like it is behind, or in back of my sinuses. I can't hardly get drainage through my nose, even with the sinus rinse. I can breathe through my nose, but there seems to be some blockage/ swelling in the back that is not letting everything drain properly. I have constant post-nasal drip that ranges from clear to yellow to brown to dried blood. The most irritating symptom is a pressure build-up in my ears. every jaw movement, swallow, yawn, brings on crackling and mini-pops. It feels like I need to pop my ears to relieve the pressure, but they won't pop properly. This is leading to compulsive jaw movements in an attempt to relieve the pressure/pain that I can't stop. I do not have TMJ and have had my jaw checked out and cleared as a cause. I get dizzy often, feel like I have poor equilibrium, and any time my heartrate goes up even a little, the pressure gets worse in my ears. If I try to workout it feels like I am breathing, but that I am not getting enough oxygen from it, and my ears get very full and painful. Drs say I am clear to workout, and won't give me any answers that help.

Remember, don't clip you nail in rounded form. Clip you nail in a straight line and don't clip the the sides which may grow inside the skin. Diabetes is a risk factor, but it is a common problem seen in non-diabetic and young patients in the department of surgery. The first line of treatment is topical and oral antibiotics. More commonly augmentin (amoxicillin clavulanate) is used as a first line agent.

You have to go to the doctor for this, as it needs sterile (very clean)conditions.2) If its bleeding because its deep, but not longer then 1cm, then you can find steri-strips in the pharmacy, and they will stabilize the would so it wont be flappy anymore, so the bleeding will stop.Some other things that you should do, is to use a non-adherent gauze to dress the wound, and should soak it in warm clean water before changing the gauze, so it will be easier to change the gauze without causing the finger to bleed.Hope this helps,Take care.Dr. Klarida"},{"Patient":"Hi I have been taking doxylin 100 once a day at night along with metrogyl 400 2 times perday, since sunday for a dog bite on my finger the dog is a healthy pet and was a accidentall nip, I am sufferimg realy bad thrush digestive upsets nausea and generally feel poisoned, firstly should I be taking these two antibiotic together and I realy dont feel I can tollerate them anymore, what can I do my finger is not infected and feels like it is healing well","Doctor":"Hello,This is Dr. Klarida Papaqako answering your question. Thank you for posting your concern on HCM.The evidence tell that the necessity of treating early, uninfected wounds is controversial. Treatment with antibiotics before the wounds get infected is recommended for moderate-to-severe wounds, puncture wounds, wounds on hands, wounds near bone or joint, regardless of appearance or injurywounds with associated swelling, crush injuries, imunocompromised people.From what I am understanding your would is on the hand finger, that is a place where bone is near, and so the decision to start an antibiotic is good. Both medicines are the right ones to be used in this case, so, no they are not contraindicated. And the dose you are taking is not a big does.

Colonization is an important prelude to infection.Individuals who have previously received antibiotic treatment, have comorbid disease, and are being treated in ICUs are at greatest risk for infection.Since you are otherwise healthy,you are unlikely to get any infection,even if this organism has grown on your toothbrush Regards Dr. T.K.

In a period of 1 week after treatment was completed I noticed the rash on my hands and the symptoms have steadily worsened. It's across the tops of both hands and severe flareups between ring and middle fingers on both hands.  Recently my lips have started to dry and chafe up, but my doctor seems to think it's unrelated.  My question is, would he oral anti-fungal be the best option if it has spread this far?","Doctor":"Hello XXXX,I have read carefully your question. From what and how you have explained above, I agree with your doctor, that the dry lips are unrelated to a fungal infection, since in general the fungal infection spreads on the mouth mucous with creamy white, slightly raised lesions - usually on your tongue or inner cheeks but also sometimes on the roof of your mouth, gums, tonsils, or back of your throat.You might know that humidity is the main factor who helps an fungal infection to develop, and the lips are not a common place where it spreads.If I was your doctor, I would have checked you after 2 weeks time, while you use the local treatment in hands and feet as recommended, and reevaluate if you need to start using oral medicines if worse or not better.I would not have started oral medicines at this level, since the risks and side effects of using those, are higher then the benefit.If any more questions, feel free to ask again.Regards,Dr.Klarida"},{"Patient":"my toe beside my big toe has been sore for a few weeks now , and was a little swollen , but i woke up today too find the swelling worse and there is two little red bumps on the side of my toe aswell any ideas to what is wrong , i havent banged it or hurt it in any other way has just appeared","Doctor":"Thank you for writing us,Brief answer - A person can experience swelling in one toe or several toes at the same time. Several injuries or medical conditions can cause toes to swell. Common reasons to experience swelling in the toes include an injury to the toe.Explained Answer - 1. Apply ice compresses to swelling caused by an injury to the toe.2. Elevate your foot above the level of your heart to help reduce swelling. When lying down, prop your foot on a couple of pillows. Resting your feet is important when your toes swell.3. Tape a broken toe to the toe next to it. This method, referred to as buddy taping, will help stabilize and support the healing toe. Place gauze between the toes before taping them to prevent friction and irritation on the skin.4. Wear shoes that fit properly. Wearing tight shoes may cause swelling in the toes. Ill-fitting shoes can also cause neuromas — benign growths of nerves located between two toes — to occur because of tissue rubbing together.5. Massage your toes to help increase blood supply to the feet and toes, which may help reduce the swelling."},{"Patient":"Hi, ive had two ring worms on my arm since may 2011. Both of my arms had one but they went away. A few months back i started getting it on my neck, and then on my right arm it came back. Then i started getting it on my face. The docters gave me ketoconazole 2% cream. It did not work so i went back for a refill. It still didnt work so they gave me pills. The pills did not work either. About a month ago my aunt brought me the same cream but from the Dominican Republic. It was working really well, untill i  came back to my school on campus and took a shower it started getting red. My friend told me about useing clorox bleach. Ive been useing it for a week now and its just very red on my neck and arm. What should i doooooo!","Doctor":"Thank you for writing us,Hope you'll get satisfied answer here.Brief Answer - Ringworm, also called tinea, is a skin infection caused by fungi, microscopic organisms that are similar to yeast and molds. It does not have any relation to worms, but is called \\"ringworm\\" because the infection can produce ring-shaped patches on the skin that have red, wormlike edgesDetailed Answer - If you have jock itch, athlete's foot or ringworm of the body, you usually can be treated with a nonprescription antifungal cream, lotion or powder. Your doctor can recommend the appropriate treatment for your condition. Some of the nonprescription medications available include terbinafine (Lamisil), tolnaftate (Tinactin), miconazole (Micatin and other brand names), clotrimazole (Lotrimin, Mycelex) and undecylenic acid (Desenex and other brand names). Be sure to follow the directions carefully when you apply the medication. If your symptoms do not improve significantly after you have used a nonprescription medicine for about two weeks, call your doctor. Your doctor may suggest a prescription antifungal medication that will cure the problem. For extremely stubborn infections, the antifungal medication may be taken by mouth rather than being applied to the skin.If you have a fungal infection of the scalp, beard, fingernails, or toenails, your doctor may treat you with an oral antifungal medication, such as oral terbinafine (Lamisil), itraconazole (Sporanox) or griseofulvin (Grisactin and other brand names). You also will have to apply antifungal creams or shampoos to your hair and scalp. Complete treatment can take two or three months.When To Call A Professional"},{"Patient":"I have been taking faropenem tablets for the last 5 days and recently took a urine test -- report attached.

I just want to find him help","Doctor":"exfoliative erythroderma is an immune reaction in which the skin gets red and falls off. The skin falling off acts as a severe burn and is a serious condition and a reason to immunosuppress. Etiologies are often unknown, but fall into two groups: one is purely an immune reaction and can be to a known thing someone is allergic to (drug reaction. skin exposure). In these cases, with removal of the allergen, the condition gets better. Mostly the allergen isn't so clear or its autoimmune (psoriasis). The other group are cancers (generally blood cell cancers) that invade the skin and cause inflammation. Skin biopsy would be the first stage. Then removal of allergen, or treating the cancer; mostly, giving immunosuppressants is all that can be done."},{"Patient":"My daughter ran fever Tuesday night, wednesday night, and now tonight.

She needs to have her own blood tests to see what is happening with her disease. There are treatments for hepatitis B now, so I suggest she get followed up in any case.

If I am your treating doctor I would like to advice you that receiving shot just 5 hours before the bite will not immunize the dog. There is a little chance of you get rabies, because puppy is unvaccinated before five day. To develop immune effect vaccine shot approximately requires 15 days. Proper wound care immediately after bite is necessary to reduce the chance of getting rabies, if you have taken proper wound care than need to take vaccine is reduced.

It is more common in children and in the elderly.Fever causes fluid loss via the skin, if you are also not using enough fluids because of decreased appetite then dehydration can occur.Diarrhea and vomiting are also not symptoms that are associated with pneumonia but with gastroenteritis or stomach flu as your doctor mentioned.Both of these would also contribute to your fluid loss.If you have a history of asthma, it would be important to make sure that the coughing is not due to an acute asthmatic attack.

It is less likely that this is related to the medications and I would not ignore his symptoms.  With his history of high blood sugars and hypertension, it sounds like he also has diabetes which is why he is on amaryl.  Your dad is going to need a few tests including labs to check his kidney function and an ultrasound of the kidney area and an urine culture to rule out an infection.  I think the best way to do this would be to go the primary doctor again and tell him or her the new symptoms.

Has anyone ever spoken to you about trying to \\"decolonize\\" yourself from MRSA?  While we don't do it with every patient who has an MRSA infection, there is a possibility that trying one of the following two options can actually get the MRSA out of your system: chlorhexidine gluconate daily washes or mupirocin ointment.  I think it would be worthwhile to approach your primary doctor or an infectious disease specialist about trying MRSA decolonization to reduce your chances of future infections.

He also suffers low white cells of 3.01 being his recent reading. He works in a pig factory and is in contact with pigs blood on a daily basis, is it possible that he got this from the pigs?","Doctor":"Hello,It is unlikely that the haemophilus parainfluenza infection your husband has is directly related to his job at the pig factory.  This bacteria often lives in our bodies without causing infection, but can cause pneumonia, upper respiratory infections and even heart infections.  You mentioned that your husband's white blood cell count is low, this bacteria is thought to be especially active when the general immune system is compromised so it could be something else led him to get sick with this.  There is also a chance that the haemophilus parainfluenzae was reported on a sample but is not causing his underlying symptoms, since as I mentioned it is a normal component of some parts of our bodies.  I hope I answered your query, please let me know if I can be of further assistance,Dr. Patel"},{"Patient":"Hi My daughter (age 20)  was hospitalised 6 weeks ago with an acute kidney infection. She was given an IV with antiobiotics and fluids for three days. Her right kidney was swollen as well as her right ureter. She was sent home with trimethroprim which she finished but developed rashes etc. Within a few days she started getting pains again even though her tests came back negative. She was put on Alprim for two weeks, followed by cilex. She is feeling better now at week 6, but is still having twinges when she moves about more, or lies the wrong way. Her last ultrasound a week ago showed there was still some swelling in the right ureter.  I feel she is doing better, she is taking D Mannose, garlic and colloidal silver, but the twinges still worry me. She can't get in to see a urologist for another two weeks. What I want to know is it normal to still have twinges. Other than that, no burning etc. Thanking in advance","Doctor":"Hi there, It sounds like your daughter had a moderate case of pyelonephritis, or kidney infection.  These infections often take a while to clear and even after some of the swelling can still cause pain and perhaps the 'twinges' that she is still having.  I would say as long as she is not having any blood in the urine, pain with urination, any fevers above 100.3 F or vomiting or back pain at rest this could all be part of the healing process.

One was a GP and the other a GYN.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM.Painful boils are most commonly caused by pyogenic bacteria like Staphylococci and Streptococci and unfortunately these bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics very easily. I would suggest you get in touch with an infectious disease specialist and a dermatologist who can help you deal with this.Recurrent boils are more commonly seen in armpits and groin due to inflammation of the apocrine sweat glands in these areas.This condition is called hidradenitis suppurativa and is due to blockage of the hair follicles on the skin, or the sweat gland openings.Hidradenitis suppurativa is more common in obese people and in cigarette smokers. I would suggest you quit smoking and lose weight if you are obese.I hope I have helped you with this answer.Thanks"},{"Patient":"In march I got sick which looked like herpes got igm test postive and igg negative. went beck seven months later and igm postive igg negative I have been fine since March. strep b came back postive in March as well.

The IgM antibodies are formed first then disappear and then the IgG antibodies are formed later.When checking whether a person had a particular infection in the past or has it at the moment or recently, the IgG and IgM can help.IgM means it is a recent infection, IgG means the infection was in the past.You had positive IgM antibodies, this means that you were positive for a present/recent infection of herpes.The negative IgG antibodies means that it wasn't a past infection, this infection recently happened.It is herpes according to these results.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"My big toe was getting very red, pus like forming under nail and hurting....even during the night sometimes.

You can pay a visit to your gynaecologist for period related issues.It could be due to profuse sweating. Sweating creates a humid environment, which suits for fungi to grow.Keep the areas described by you dry as far as possible.

CFS has been associated with acute events or illnesses, ie you get sick with something and shortly afterward develop CFS. It's not uncommon to get TB tests annually, so I doubt that is a direct cause. You did have an evaluation (eg, chest x-ray) for the positive one, I hope.

These are also called acid fast bacilli (AFB). Routine cultures don't detect TB and these others. Special cultures have to be done that can take up to 6 weeks to show anything. The slide looking for AFB that you initially had is often negative even if the infection is present. That's why a biopsy and culture are necessary. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I have a pins & needles feeling deep into my left armpit that radiates down the inside of my arm to my elbow, several times during the day. Occasionally while this is happening, i will also have burning pain in the same shoulder - rotator cuff area radiating down the outside of the arm to the elbow. When this happens suddenly and is intense it scares me into thinking I may be having a heart attack, but I don't have any other symptoms, no shortness of breath, no heavyness, no sweats, otherwise I am a healthy 51 year old female. I thought it could be a pinched nerve, but would it come on so suddenly, last for about 15 mins, then subside. This first happened 6 months ago and then again 2 weeks ago. I don't have any neck pain when this happens. Can you have a pinched nerve w/o neck pain?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. In your case I will suggest MRI shoulder joint and MRI cervical spine. Maintain proper posture of neck while reading and sitting etc. It is not heart related, as per symptoms and history given. Yes, there can be a pinched nerve without associated neck pain. For being on safer side, I will also recommend blood pressure checking and ECG. Hope I have answered your query.

If the antibiotics aren't working, then surgery has to be done to remove the infection. Otherwise the infection can cause severe damage to his knee and could get into his blood. I believe they might be able to do this with an arthroscope, which is a relatively small procedure. Ask his doctor if this is an option.

After this I advise my patient to take Rifampicin 450 mg + isoniazide 300 mg in the morning .  Levofloxacin 750 with pantaloc-D in the  night after dinner . till another 3 months . After this rifampicin 450 + isoniazide 300 mg for another 6 month .

Regular x  RAY after every 3 months with sputum for A F B if present .Blood after every 3 months for c b c & e s r .

His seizures continue and so has his draining, ringing and poping in his right year for the last 13 years.  The ear doctor finally did a biopsy on the drainage that is behind his ear drum.

It's unlikely to cause the seizures, unless he's developed an infection or abscess in the brain. However, he would be having other serious problems in that case, so I don't think that's likely. If he is continuing to have seizures, he could have epilepsy. Has he had a workup for a seizure disorder? Other problems in the brain, such as scarring or damage from a blood clot, could result in seizures. The best specialist to see for the seizures is a neurologist. They can evaluate for possible underlying causes and initiate appropriate treatment for a seizure disorder. Hope this answers your query.

Urinary tract infections are commonly diagnosed by symptoms (high grade fever, increased frequency of urination, burning during urination, pain in the loin or lower abdomen etc.). Urine for routine examination can be used for diagnosis, which reveals increased pus cells or sometimes red blood cells. However, urine culture may not be positive always. This occurs when the individual has already been exposed to an antibiotic before the culture sample was collected. Responding to antibiotics may not always be a criteria for this and resistant strains are very common.Blood investigations have probably been advised to check the infection parameters or maybe for blood culture.In the meantime I would advise her to drink plenty of fluids and maintain personal hygiene. Urinary alkaliniser may help. Acetaminophen may be taken for fever (but not >3gm per day). Since she has anemia (deficiency of blood) she can take oral iron and folic acid supplementation. Please do consult your physician for further advise.Hope this helps you out."},{"Patient":"Hi. I was replacing the used needle of the gluco meter which is being used by my father in law who had a urine infection 3 weeks back. He has been treated for that though is still on some antibiotics. Do I need to do something? I have been by this needle very mildly.","Doctor":"Thank you for the query.Handling of used needle should be done with utmost care (it is considered under Universal precautions). Used needles should never be recapped (which causes the maximum number of pricks). Ideally used needles should be disposed by needle cutters,  but these are not always available at home.I would also like to know how deep your prick was (i.e. did you bleed yourself?). Immediately after the prick, you should wash your hands properly with a soap. (do not put the punctured finger in your mouth). If your father in law is suffering from any disease which can be transmitted by blood and blood products (haematological transmission), like Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV, then the need for concern arises. In that case I would advise you to consult your physician. I don't think it will be a need for concern if he is suffering from Urinary tract infection. However, in future, please use a proper handcare to handle these sharp objects.Hope that helps you."},{"Patient":"8 months ago a dermatologist injected both elbows for psoriasis.

All drugs may cause side effects, some of which could be severe, so I would not recommend taking all the drugs you suggest without knowing for sure infection is present. It is not a good idea to discontinue a medicine that has worked for him without discussing it with his doctor. When a doctor prescribes a medicine, he or she weighs the advantages of the drug against the possible risks (such as cancer) before recommending it. His doctor is certainly aware of the cancer risk but feels the 6mp is more helpful for the Crohn's (which can also be dangerous) than the risk of developing cancer.

Even if your skin was compromised, the volume of infected fluid and duration also matters in determining the risk. As the volume of blood was very small and you washed it right away, your risk is lowered to a minimum.Please do not get stressed about this episode but I would like to suggest you use universal precautions whenever dealing with patients.Thanks."},{"Patient":"Im on holiday in san antonio Texas and I thought Id been bitten by mosquito on palm of my hand-this 'bite' has turned into pin prick blisters over my hands , my arms , behind my ear, neck, belly, chest, eye brow, bottom and private parts - it itches like hell and is hot- taking benadryl which seems to control itch but it still spreading.

Wear comfortable clothes and you will feel better in a day or two.Thanks."},{"Patient":"I was just diagnosed with shingles and have a rash on my torso.  Just started antivirus medicine this afternoon.I was planning to visit my elderly mother (86) next Saturday but very concerned she may catch this. She thinks she had chickenpox but unsure.

The total duration of disease is generally between 7  and 10 days ; however it may take as long as 2 to 4 weeks for the skin to return to normal.When any patient who had chicken pox may get this disease from infected person ( as you may spread this to your mother ).Varicella-Zoster virus infections have tow types .1 VARICELLA ( CHICKENPOX IN CHILDREN ).2 Herpes Zoster ( shingles in adults ).So chickenpox infected person may get infection very rapidly . In my opinion at least you should remain away from your mother for 4 weeks .Good luck."},{"Patient":"my daughter is detected with thphoid it stared from 12th of sept she is not been hospitalised but under doctors care but fever isnot coming down .she had 104 fever.now with other medicines and 4 crocins a day fever is come down to 102 .how many days does the fever last and do i have to hospitalise her?our family doctor who is mbbs only says that there is no equirement of her hospitalisation.i am worried........my daughter is 27 years old.if i shieft her to hospital now they will start all the medicine once again.........what should i do ? should i keep keep faith on my mbbs family doctor or take her to some  big hospital?","Doctor":"Hello,If your treating doctor says that your daughter doesn't need admission,then it must be a correct observation.In general patients with typhoid fever are treated as OPD patients and admission is done only in few cases where there are complications present.After a proper antibiotic therapy typhoid fever may take 4-6 days to normalise,however you should make sure that a complete antibiotic course for 2 weeks must be completed,lest relapse occurs.Thanks"},{"Patient":"My son was bitten by a monkey 2 years ago he was 4 years old then.

I believe it came off as he was pulling out but not to certain if it came off due to the friction i felt while having intercourse. About 5 days later, i woke up with severe diarrhea that I've never experienced in my life that had went away the next day and i also had a loss of appetite and the food i did attempt to eat that next day, had a strange metalic taste along with spotting....I've taken several pregnancy tests and after taking them, i had all negatives. The spotting had continued along with thrush and I've never experienced that along with the metalic taste which can also be caused from the dehydration however, the diarrhea is what scared me. When I went to the er, The Dr. did a pelvic exam and drew blood and I was told i had bacterial vaginosis and prescribed flagyl. Two weeks prior to that, i had started a new diet consisting of fish and high in vegetables however i had very little bowel movements...I'm unsure as to whether that could be typical ARS symtpoms, from the diet, or food poisioning? Since that incident four months ago, I've experienced muscle twitching in my lower back that has happened within the past two months, sensitivity to the light, pelvic pain. Does this sound like typical ARS symptoms?

I've also been experiencing severe fatigue, muscle aches, difficulty sleeping at night, some instances where im hot which has been ongoing for two months now and more painful periods.

Does this sound like typical ARS symptoms?? Please help as im worried and worrying has taken over my life","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM.I understand your concern.The only way to confirm your HIV status is to test your blood sample for antibodies against HIV 1 and 2 by ELISA. This test will relieve your anxiety and stress. The symptoms you have mentioned in your query are not of ARS.Bacterial vaginosis is caused by anaeorobic bacteria which are usually commensals of the genital tract and you have been correctly treated by flagyl.I suggest you undergo the HIV test and confirm your status instead of imagining the worst and worrying unnecessarily.Thanks."},{"Patient":"I am losing nerve support in my left hand.Doctor says my MRI s for brain, cervical spine and spine are all normal.

Swelling in the face has many causes to let it happens, it may indicate allergy factor or salt and water retention. Kidney problems may make the face to swell, also some immunological disorders. In your question, sodium is a nutrient required by the body that, when consumed in excessive amounts, can cause swelling. This swelling can occur in the face, making that region of the body look and feel fat. Another thing to be considered is that is the swelling in one side of your face or bilateral? Sodium and water retention make it bilateral. Psychotic conditions have some elements but not severe swelling like the previous causes. What to do? 1- I suggest good diet, low salt and high water intake 2- Check for kidney function, if the condition still exists on controlling your diet 3- You may need to visit your doctor and make some labs to detect whether there is some immunological disorder or allergen that swell your face or not.

In this ( asthma ) there is airways hyperresponsiveness that is secondary to inflammatory airways disease that results in recurrent or chronic  episodes of wheeze ,shortness of breath, chest tightness & /or cough particularly at the nigh or in the early morning.Perhaps you understand that why are you having cough in the night due to cold winds.When such patient visit my clinic I prescribe monteleukast + bambuterole tablet once or twice in day depending upon the condition of patient and severity of disease (. symptoms )Since this is a prescription medicine so consult your treating doctor .Hot coffee and steam inhalation also provide relief.Hope this will help you."},{"Patient":"Hi, I haven't been able to lie down for 4 days now with a cough that becomes terribly hacking when I lie down (only 12 hours sleep in the last 4 days). Even stretching my neck or yawning can bring on an attack. I also have a green/black tongue, all over the tongue that lightens when I brush the tongue but doesn't go away. The cough seems to be caused by a circular process of nasal drip down onto inflamed , sore and sensitive lower throat tubes (the bronchial tubes?), which causes a cough, which makes the throat more sore and sensitive for the drip to trigger again. If I do manage to sleep and am woken with a cough I bring up hard to shift green phlemghI also have a blocked nose that doesn't produce anything when I blow my nose.","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicThe fact that the cough worsens on lying down may imply that there is pooling of secretions.You may need to consider a decongestant, antihistamine and mucolytic.The decongestant would help relieve your nasal symptoms and by reducing the dripping of mucus, help reduce the coughing.Mucolytic would help to break up any mucus so that it can be easily expelled and the anti histamine would also help with the mucus and congestion.These should be available over the counter and may be combination.Examples of oral decongestants are pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine.Examples of mucolytics are guifenesin, bisolvan, mucomystI hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I found an open, bleeding sore, the size of a pea under my right breast after showering the other day.

Cymbalta may produce high blood pressure in some patients as a side effect. So, you may need to visit your doctor for some studies.

There are different strains of strep, one type of which causes strep throat. You could have that strain or a different strain. Skin and wound infections with strep may cause redness, swelling, pus, pain and heat in the area. There could be a lot of drainage of pus. Antibiotics are used to treat strep. When a culture is done, they usually test how sensitive the strep is to different antibiotics. They can then identify the correct antibiotic to use and switch you to it. I am not sure about the dates you give. If the surgery indeed was back in 2011, it is indeed way too long. (It is awfully long if it was just 2013.)

My father is in a aged care facility and on a recent stay in hospital was found to have golden staph.  The doctor said that everyone can carry golden staph from time to time.   I went  to visit him a few time since on the last visit we were given now contact precautions by the staff.  I cleaned my hands when arriving but cannot remember doing so on leaving. I have read since how serious this can be and I am worried that I may have become colonized by the bacteria even though I have no evidence to suggest it.  i have read where it can live in the nose and now I am afraid to rub and touch my nose as I am afraid that I will spread the bacteria to someone vunerable.  Would that be possible or would you have to insert your fingers into the nostril where the bacteria is located?  Does every one have it in their nose or only those colonized in that area?  or is to do with the bacterial count in a particular area?  I see lots of people rubbing and touching as well as picking their noses with no intentions of washing their hands,  if it was such a risk why wouldn't there be health alerts. Other members of my family do not seem to be too concerned and said you shouldn't worry unless there is evidence that I may be colonized, but they haven't read what I have read and what the consequences could be if you were carrying it and infected someone unknowingly. I have always been concerned with hygiene, but now I know this is lurking everywhere I find I am constantly aware and becoming obsessive about it as we are told to constantly wash our hands to avoid it.  I am worried I will be somewhere without the facility to wash after I have touched something that could be contaiminated I know you can us e antibacterial wipes or gel but you would also contaminate your purse delving for them.  Should I take my families advice and just use normal hygiene procedures as before until proven that I am indeed colonized or should I be over cautious and assume that I may be colonized.  Is the rationale behind hand washing to do with reducing overload of bacterial counts?  Is infection dependant on bacterial count as well?","Doctor":"K so let me tell you about what have mentioned as golden staph/MRSA (Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus). Staphylococcus aureus is a bacteria and is capable of causing mild to severe life threatening infections. Initially it was susceptible to penicillin that is it could be killed by it but over a period of time it has acquired the property of not getting killed by penicillin that is it has become resistant. This property of acquiring resistance by organisms to various antibiotics is a cause of concern worldwide as infection caused by such organisms is difficult to treat. Hence measures to control the spread of such organisms is followed worldwide. MRSA is one such bacteria which is resistant to many antibiotics including Methicillin and cloxacillin restricting treatment options. MRSA carriage is seen in anterior nares commonly. So if you want screen yourself for MRSA carriage, do a culture sensitivity for MRSA screen from anterior nares.If it's positive you have to use mupirocin ointment in your nostrils thrice a day for 5 days. Following this do a MRSA Screen again to make sure that it's gone.

Please type your query here...My blood pressure is 87 over 63 and my pUlse is 85. I feel weak and achy. What should I eat or drink to remedy the situation?  Do I need rest. What is a healthy blood pressure for a 33 year old woman?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. The normal and expectable blood pressure range is from 90 to 120 systolic, if there is no other health issues. However, day-to-day variability is common. This value is not a very hard and fast one, especially if readings taken once or twice. Your BP of 87, can well be a normal as well. I would advise you check your blood pressure for a few days on different times of the day and if the average is still low, then you should see your doctor. Blood pressure get low with some medicine, with loss of fluid from body, like loose motions or excessive sweating, but this won't be permanent. I would advise you should take more fluids with less salt intake and keep checking your BP readings. If still low, then you should talk to your doctor to know the cause of low BP. Most of the times low BP is not very serious (if otherwise ok, like if no syncope, etc.) and may be normal in young females. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"question. Is rabies contagious during the incubation period.  Our family cat has had her shots - 1 year and then her 3 year shot.

Tachycardia or Tachyarrhythmia has a wide variety of reasons. Supraventriculartachycardia (SVT) is a common condition and may happen to young people.

It is funny to say this but sometimes when we exclude the dangerous causes of a certain condition and nothing we (doctors) can find so we say it is due to psychological condition. Your sister should be examined by echo cardiogram and Holter monitoring to check for the heart rate for a continuous 24 hours. If there is no definite cause for this so don't worry, many cases stop this later on on twenties. Also check for hemoglobin level as an anemic heart doesn't beat well.

I sent a pic to my doctor while I wait a couple weeks for my appointment, but he does not know what they are.","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to HCM,The history and symptoms suggest me that it may be a fungal infection but it should be confirmed by physical examination.The genital and perineal area is known for fungal infection, as you are regularly going for the gym you may sweat a lot it may provoke the growth of fungus and produce these symptoms.I would suggest you to follow1.Keep the area clean and dry by applying Neosporin powder.2.Apply Anti fungal cream on the affected area.3.Oral Antihistamines to reduce the itching and swelling.4.Single dose of Diflucan, 150 mg orally.The aforementioned modalities will help to reduce the symptoms and improve the condition.Thank you."},{"Patient":"My mother has a chest infection and has grown klebsiella. It is sensitive to cephalosporins, quinolones, and amino glycosides. She is on cefpodoxime plus clavulanic acid. Herbsputum has changed from green tomyellow iver the past four days while on antibiotics.Is this cephalosporin appropriate to treat klebsiella? Would doxycycline be more appropriate give the fact that klebsiella devolpes resistance to cephalosporin relatively quickly. How quickly I am not sure. She has not measured her temperature, but says she feels clammy.Thank you","Doctor":"Dear Friend.Welcome to HCM. I am Dr Anshul Varshney. I understand your concern.See, the sensitivity depends on the culture.If the klebsiella is sensitive to cephalosporins then Cefpodoxime would help good.There is no need of adding doxycycline to her.In fact, if her fever responds well to this antibiotic, let her complete course for at least 7 days.Some doctors also prefer to give treatment for 14 days.If her fever doesn't responds then adding a quinolone like Levofloxacin would be an appropriate decision.This is my personal opinion for you based on available details. If you have any further query please ask me.Stay HealthyDr Anshul Varshney, MD"},{"Patient":"Over a month ago I had nuts on ice cream.  I stored them in original container in pantry. Yesterday I went to use them and there was alot of white worms with brownish heads in container. It made me sick to see them.

Chice of the medication is also important as anti fungal such as griseofulvin wont work. So If you are reciving proper anti fungal then it is important to stick to treatment without fail along with local application. Regarding your breast discrimination problem you should have a physician & gynecologic opinion as the exact comment about the same can be given only after the visual impression of the condition. So it would be wise to consult physican earliest. Mean while you can examine your enlarged breast by yourself for any kind of lump or swelling within. If found so rush to surgeon earliest."},{"Patient":"Sir, my father had dengue fever,  his platelet count was dropping 82, then 70 and then 80, After that we have not measured, So my question to you is that in the dengue fever , is there any possibility of dropping down platelet, after increasing. As platelet increased from 70 to 80, so is there any chance of dropping down again .Age:70 yrs, Wt: 77kgs","Doctor":"Dengue fever is well known for dropping down of platlets. BUt usual course of the disease is such that platlets begin to drop and reach to the maximum dip point after which the again start to rise in count. Considering the barural course of the disease chances of dropping down of platlets once they are started to rise are very less. But still exact comment about it can not be given as in few cases thye again may drop because of the dengue itself or alterbnatively by the infection by some anoter virus. So it is better to keep a close watch on patients condition & any kind of bleeding any where from the body should be reported to the treating physician. For this reasons repeated counts of platlets are done. So considering the same there are very few chances of droping down of platlets again, but you have to be cautious."},{"Patient":"My doctor diagnosed me with severe ringworm on Tuesday (I am covered from head to toe, and it happened within 2 days-I noticed a few spots on Sunday and thought it was mosquito bites, then woke up monday with triple the amount, and the spots kept showing up during the day). Anyway, she prescribed me a cream that I used on Tuesday, two times- however it caused swelling and pain in my hands so I discontinued use. The doctor prescribed me something called grisofulvin? but I can't pick it up until today at 3 because the pharmacy didn't have it. When I woke up this morning I noticed that most of the ring worm was gone, but I have a LOT of bruises. Is bruising associated with ringworm? ( I did itch the bumps a lot, but only itched over my clothes). I used cortisone cream, but that's it.","Doctor":"I am not sure that whether your doctors has diagnosed the lesion properly as ringworm does not have such acute course it takes few days to week to appear the lesions of the ring worm. They itch so badly that you have to take anihisaminic to be relived off itching. even if you apply the local cream it will take few days to weeks to clear the lesions of the same. and most importantly they never bruise & go away wihout leaving any stress. So my frank opinion is that get it diagnose correctly befor having any medications as well as applying steroids ( cortison which may change the morphology of lesion & make it difficult to diagnose ). From the symptoms narreted by you lesions most likly point towards patechial haemorrages but as I can not make visual impression exact diagnosis regarding the same can not be given. So my advice is that you must consult a well experienced dermatologist for the problem."},{"Patient":"I have had itching and inflammation in the groin region since July.

It is now going away. But the groin infection recurrs. What do i do?Needadvice","Doctor":"The groin infection you are having is also a fungal infection probably, occurrence of groin infection with periods is due to rubbing of groin area with napkins and the groin area doesn't stay dry during periods. Try to use good quality sanitary napkin with soft pad and change your napkins frequently, improve personal hygiene. If you are in a humid climate, avoid travelling for long hours during periods.

The bumpy rash you can see on your child's skin is an allergic reaction to the eggs of the mites.Permethrin cream is the most common cream that is used in treatment of scabies. You need to spread over every inch of your child's body, from his neck down. Even parts of his body that don't seem to be infected must be treated, so don't skip them.Don't forget to put the cream between your child's toes and fingers, under his arms, in his navel, and on his genitals. Leave the cream on his skin for 12 hours and then wash it off.

Diagnosed with shingles. No rash for 3 days, still pain. Do you thing diagnosis is correct? Taking Famciclovir, nothing for pain. Should I take Acetiminphen or Ibuprofen for the pain and discomfort? Which would help better","Doctor":"Hello,shingles can be very irritating to the patient. Having only pain and sensitivity to the skin are the usual first symptoms. The rash may appear even after more than 3 days. So the answer is that your symptoms can be shingles but nobody could tell any diagnosis for sure without even examining a patient. You have to know that shingles require prior exposure to varicella zoster virus. This condition may recur from time to time. I suggest acetaminophen to my patients as a first measure against pain because it's easier to use and has less side effects (if not abused) than ibuprofen or similar drugs. Ibuprofen will prove to be a much more effective analgesic particularly if you take it along with acetaminophen. If your pain is severe enough then stronger analgesics should be used (opioids).I hope that's not your case! Good luck!"},{"Patient":"Good day! I have a problem that is almost destroying me.

Do not take it only when you have the fever but on a regular basis (every 4-6 hours) for as long as you feel sick. You haven't given enough data to suggest a possible diagnosis. Most low grade fever cases (like yours) are attributed to viral infections.

Infections can be transmitted to other individuals. Fever, body pains and headache is experienced by patients in many infectious diseases. One possible clue for a diagnosis is if you had close contact with sick individuals (at work, at home etc). If the answer is yes then it's very likely that you've got the same disease. You haven't given enough details for a more specific approach to your condition. For example did you have high fever (>39 Celsius) ?

I also received one dose of IV Levaquin. My concern is getting some type of blood infection as a result of medication being given thru an IV port not cleaned. Do you have any thoughts on this area?","Doctor":"Its a good practice to give the iv medication only after cleaning the port of iv set with alcohol & it is always advisable. But if at all the medication was given through the port withot cleaning, nothing to woerry about it. It is not at all going to cause any infection in blood as the chances of such infection are very very low & if at all by chance the infection is introduced in our body, it will be cleared by our immunity. So do not think much abou it it wont cause any problem. Further more for your satisfaction you can keep a watch wheather you catch the fever, chills etc which are suggestive of the infections.

Once the wart is cleared by topical application of cream you will become free from infection.It is transmitted to your partner, if you indulge in unprotected sexual activity during the presence of lesion. Once the wart is cleared by the topical medicines you can have normal sexual activity and you will be non infectious.5% Imiquade cream should be applied over the wart on alternate days for 4 months. Before application of this cream you need to apply Vaseline over the wart and then you have to apply the imiquade cream.Mean while you have to boost up your immunity which helps to clear your wart.

It was confirmed through a blood test. I have been feeling symptoms on and off for about four years. The symptoms are fatigue, body aches and joint pain, back pain, headaches, indigestion, gas, and excessive burping. Over the course of four years I bounced from doctor to doctor and had a battery of tests to find out what was wrong. My question is could H Pylori be the reason why I have been having these symptoms for four years? My PCP wants to put me on antibiotics, but I will be seeing a GI doctor first. Do you recommend having an endoscopy done to look for ulcers or other problems? I am 40 years old.Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM!H. Pylori is a bacteria which resides in the stomach and causes excess secretion of acid in the stomach and may result in Ulcers being formed in the stomach or duodenum.The common symptoms of gastric Ulcers are extreme pain in the abdomen, soon after eating food. The food irritates the ulcer and causes pain.  It may be accompanied by vomiting and hematemesis. Their is weight loss .If you have been experiencing only indigestion and burping, then it is unlikely that an ulcer has developed. There's a standard Antibiotic course for treating H. pylori. Take the course and make sure you complete it. Your treating doctor will give you medicines to relive of adicity. They will help in decreasing the symptoms.As such there is no need of endoscopy presently. Also, it is a painful procedure. Take your medications. IF the problem persists even then, then you might consider visiting a Gastroentologist and getting an endoscopy done.Hope this information helps.

Soyabean is also a rich source of proteins.You might want to get investigated to find out the cause of this immune deficiency.Another common cause of recurrent infections is Diabetes.

The scan report did not indicate any health problem. So the doctor suggested another scan after the second year. The second year was over in May.

In fact, most people infected with the bacteria never have symptoms or problems such as ulcers. Only a small number of people with the infection develop stomach cancer.If you have any symptoms from this then only you need to take medications like antibiotics to kill the bacteria.The most approved is triple therapies for 10-14 days.

What can I do myself to try and take care of it?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM!Well, if they were minor cuts and are now turning into non-healing major wounds, there can be two causes resulting in this - 1. You didn't take proper care of the cuts and they have now become infected. You should have had proper cleaning and dressings and antibiotics to prevent infection earlier.2. Second possibility is that you might be diabetic as non healing wounds are common in diabetics.Now, I'd suggest you to visit a surgeon and get your wounds properly cleaned and dressed. Also, take an antibiotic course.Secondly, get your blood sugar tested to see if you are diabetic.Hope this information helps. Feel free to ask if you have any doubts.With regards,Dr. Sridhar Reddy"},{"Patient":"Hello Dr. Grief, I've recently tested positive for h. pylori, I was wondering if you could please describe some of the symptoms that may occur because of this diagnosis.  I have been symptomatic for quite some time now, and would like to see if this is the answer. Thank you for your assistance.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM!H. pylori is a bacteria (Full name: Helicobacter pylori).It basically causes increased secretion of gastric acid in your stomach. This leads to symptoms like Acidity, burning pain in stomach, chest burning pain, vomiting etc. In severe cases, it also leads to Gastric ulcers i.e ulcers in stomach.  H. pylori is often found in several patients who are totally asymptomatic.There is a treatment regimen available for H. pylori infection and I strongly recommend you to take it.

A count of 510 means it is still above the normal range. Looking at your complaints, you seem to be getting better when you take the medicine prescribed. Try to find out the triggers, ( dust/ pollen/ perfume/ air pollutants)for the allergies by inhalation and avoid it as much as possible.  Your respiratory system responds to the irritants by producing more eosinophils in order to put the trigger out of the body. So, by avoiding the allergens and taking medicines which trigger excessive activation of eosinophils, you could probably keep  check on the counts.Regards"},{"Patient":"hi doctor i am taking tablets for hig blodd pressure form last 10 years and now my urine and blood test shows their is slight damgae in the kidney doctor says to reduce the pressure to 130/90 then only we can reduce the dose, now i am thinking to take sarpagandha insted of english medicine , is it requried to take english medicne also along with this , i stopped consuming the liquuor so i thnk blood pressure will reduce currently my presuure is 145/98 some time it goes to 139/90 also advice","Doctor":"Hello, Regarding your concern, I would explain that some natural ways to reduce high blood pressure without medicine are: - perform regular physical activity, aerobics, etc. - eat more garlic, lemon juice, etc.. - reduce maximally salt and caffeine intake.

A few pointers: - I m currently halfway through a 4 month trip around SE Asia, which has involved Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and now Vietnam. I m finishing the trip with Hong Kong and Japan where I believe both are rabies free. - I ve had the Verorab pre vaccinations just before we left- 3 doses by a UK clinic on day 0,7 and 21. - I ve had no known exposure to any animals and I ve actively stayed away due to my fear of this disease. However I am terrified of non apparent exposure or an exposure I may have disregarded or forgotten about. - At this point I m sure it will make sense that I do have OCD which I m hoping is the cause of my concerns. My questions: - I went diving and the fins caused broken skin on my toes. I ve since been terrified some saliva may have come into contact with me without me knowing (OCD remember) - my memory fails me. - I m also scared I ve touched something and touched my eyes or mouth. I understand rabies virus doesn t have long in the air but of course I m paranoid it s somehow still active when I ve touched something or something s touched my toes. - I want to know how effective Verorab is as a pre-vaccine and whether many documentated cases have been recoded of people getting rabies despite having pre shots (I understand you d need booster shots on day 0&3 after an exposure but for peace if mind I wondered how vital this is). For instance I ve heard technically you only need the booster shots as we can t be certain how much immunity the preshots have given us- and as no one is willing to risk it, just to be safe they advise getting further shots. - How effective is immunity if additional shots are given after the recommended 24 hours after exposure? Ie if I had them when I return home just to be safe... - When I return to the uk I want to get the additional booster shots just to be safe with the hope that if there was any contamination- the booster shots would get rid of it before symptoms kick in. Is this possible and correct? My biggest fear is successfully returning to the UK but living in fear of the very long incubation period and not knowing... If I had the booster shots and say a month later I m fine, does this mean 100% I did not have rabies or if I did, it s gone for good? Or could it still be incubating and present itself later in life? As you can see I m going through a lot of distress and it s causing me to fear leaving my hotel room. If anyone can shed any light and facts on the above topics I d be grateful. Please note I am receiving treatment for OCD but this rabies fear is a new theme and with me being here in Asia the risk is outdoing the irrationality, meaning my steps aren t working. I hope a doctor will understand. Thank you","Doctor":"Verorab is an effective vaccine for pre-exposure prophylaxis. If you have taken it you shouldn't be worried. In case of a bite by a stray or licks on broken skin or mucous membrane you should take the booster on Day 0 and Day 3."},{"Patient":"Yes, I am a 45 year old female who works out at the gym and I wear nylon stretch pants.

The hospital has been trying to contact me with the results for 3 weeks, so it has, unfortunately, been untreated for those 3 weeks. A couple of days ago, an itchy ringworm-like patch appeared on my forearm. Could this be related to the MRSA?

As the MRSA infection is quit serious infection my frank opinion to you is that if in doubt do not waste the time & consult your physician as the  exact diagnosis regarding the lesion can only be given after the proper visual impression of the lesion. As MRSA are multi drug resistant proper choice of the antibiotics also required.Even though the patch on your forearm  may not be the MRSA you should be very careful about the MRSA in surgical incision.BUt as said above the itchy patch with the looks like ring worm has less chances of being due to MRSA.But according to me your MRSA of more concern than patch .
