Although it is not supported by a generous amount of research, for many acai berry seems to be a viable option for the treatment of kidney disease, as well as weight problem,  since it is high in anti oxidants thus can be safely used to fight free radicals produced due to impaired kidney [joint pain] and also boosts the Immune system.PS.  It is important to exercise caution when considering the purchase of an OTC [over the counter product] which makes claims to cure of any physical ailment. It is also important to double check that acai berry will not interfere with any medications already taken. Because there is still very little research on the use of acai berry for treatments of major disease, it is best to use it with caution.2. the most effective way of losing weight is only diet control and exercise. You can get a specialized diet [for kidney patients] from your dietitian."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor good after noon.

If you think you have an eating disorder, then it's really important to talk to your midwife or primary care Doctor [gynecologist] as soon as you can. It may not be easy for you to tell them, but it will be worth it. PS. You may also be more likely to develop postnatal depression (PND) .

Thank you....","Doctor":"1. since your age and sex is unknown, thus it is wise to mention that it mostly occurs in Men than in women in between 40-60 age group, and since it is a symptom and not diagnosis thus one has to undertake a meticulous examination to find any secondary [hidden] cause of the same.2. since fungal infections are common around anal area, thus moist,warm conditions and/or sweating around Anal area both results in overgrowth of Candida (yeast infection) causing  fungal infection resulting in inflammation and subsequent irritation and itching.PS. also one has to look out for any Immunocompromised state [as routine] like diabetes,HIV3. In Ayurveda we hold that most of the itching is caused due to problems associated with ‘Vata dosha’ and by pacifying the aggravated ‘vata’i.e. impurities in the Rakta (blood) and Stress we can bring down the signs and symptoms of itching.4. Make sure, after bath you give enough time to the area to get itself DRY, either Sun exposure or drying with Soft Towel,because Fungus grows in warm, and moist area.5. Reduce sugar intake, as it is the main food of yeast, bacteria and fungus.6. You can opt for a variety of Ayurveda medicines like Haridra,Amalaki,Trikatu, Triphala, Neem capsules,Haridrakhand,Agastya Rasayan by Consulting with an Ayurveda Physician for further necessary management.7. since itching is main concern thus WARM sitz bath [kati snan in Ayurveda] is recommended. [Boric acid sometimes may cause irritation or problems from absorption, thus if irritation persists, consult your Doctor]PS. because hot baths cause blood vessels to dilate, on rare occasions some people can feel dizzy or have palpitations (rapid or abnormal heartbeat), do check with a cardiologist regarding any baseline Investigation."},{"Patient":"hi,I am 23 years old.i have been suffering from acne since 5 yrs,but still cant over come tem.right now em using medimix soap, cetaphill cleansing lotion and benzoyl peroxide cream for acne.my mensural  cycle is of 1 n hlf or 2 mnths..i found this as one my  reason for acne..n also because my blood is not purified.plz suggest me a syrup which can purify my blood.Also plz suggest me a day or night cream for fairer skin which can b used for a long time and without side effect..can i use himalaya herbal  fairness cream instead?","Doctor":"1. acne at your age is physiological [since this is the age of Pitta] in Ayurveda which is concerned with Acne outbursts, and also Pathological because of Hormonal imbalance as well as Pelvic problem, so in best interest first get a gynecologist checkup [pelvic examination] along with necessary Investigations [Thyroid Profile, Hemoglobin, Ultrasonography, Estrogen-Progesterone ratio]2.

If you can masturbate normally and ejaculate then physically you are fine.

However her foot is red, swollen and very painful.  She was given a topic medication (I don't know what that is) and pain killer.  Is there any home/natural remedy to cure her foot?","Doctor":"Erysipelas is a bacterial infection in the upper layer of your skin. It is similar to another skin disorder known as cellulitis, an infection in the lower layers of your skin. The bacteria that most commonly cause erysipelas are known as streptococci, and they normally live on your skin and other body surfaces without causing harm. They can, however, enter your skin through a cut or a sore.Usually, the affected body part must be raised higher than the rest of your body to reduce swelling. In your case leg is affected, you should aim to rest as much as possible with the leg elevated above your hip. For example, lie down, and prop your leg up on some cushions. It is important to get up and walk about from time to time and to keep up your fluid intake. The almond cold pressed oil is one of the most efficient way to get rid of the anesthetic erysipelas red spots. All you need to do is to anoint your skin with the almond oil twice a day, early in the morning and right before bedtime.Antibiotic treatment and usually penicillin is the kind of treatment that would be used in case of erysipelas and antibiotics are a must.  All the bestRegardsDr Santosh"},{"Patient":"I ve been getting these really hard spots in the groin area, which I believe are cysts.

Congratulations for having accepted to take the all this while and keep your health in a good state.There are many products out there which claim to be able to keep you blood pressure well controlled. All by themselves, it is very difficult and in most cases impossible. They are rather supportive measures that may reduce the dose of medications that you need to keep your blood pressure controlled. Also, these products are not validated to be used as medications and sure no doctor would want to expressly prescribe them as main treatment option. Weight loss, low calorie diet, low salt intake and regular exercises are helpful in achieving and maintaining a normal blood pressure. Talk with you treating physician to get more specifics and let him know how you feel about these medications at this time. He may suggest a review based on your numbers.Hope this helps.

They are normal skin changes occurring in pregnancy due to hormonal changes. During pregnancy, there is increase in the levels of some hormones that in turn increase the secretion of the skin color pigment by cells in the skin called melanocytes. The secretion is however not uniform in all areas thus some areas are particularly affected and become darker.People on hormonal contraceptives some times have this same presentation. You do not need to border, they will fade away though gentle after delivery.Hope this helps you.Dr Achuo"},{"Patient":"hi, i was just diagnosed yesterday to have an ovarian cyst in left ovary measuring 3.8cm. would like to know the right diet or food to eat for me. i don t want to undergo another surgery for this, that s why i am looking for natural remedy for my cyst. last 2011 i had already undergone surgery for cyst found in my right ovary and this time, another cyst for my left one. hope u could help me? thanks!","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query to H.C.M.

I have good libido always but i could not have sex at 2nd time after even 1 hour.  Iam getting good errection but i could not release my semen through intercourse.  what are the best foods to get good volume and which are the best way to cum in the 2nd time without much efforts.  Please advie.  Thanks","Doctor":"Hi,First of all I must congratulate you for having a good libido after 10 yrs of Type 2 DM. You are fortunate for the following facts:1) To get an erection, men need healthy blood vessels, nerves, male hormones, and a desire to be sexually stimulated. Diabetes can damage the blood vessels and nerves that control erection. Therefore, even if you have normal amounts of male hormones and you have the desire to have sex, you still may not be able to achieve a firm erection.2) Pt's with Type 2 DM usually suffer from - Premature ejaculation, where as you are c/o delayed ejaculation and that too with good libido.If you can't release your semen by regular intercourse - 1) Start intercourse only after fully aroused mentally (even though you have good libido) and think only sex (in any form) during intercourse 2) Oral and other ways can be tried.When God has given good libido and delayed ejaculation don't you think that it is too much to ask for a second erection within 1hr. Consider yourself that you are sex wise extraordinarily benefited and get satisfied and content with that.Best wishes"},{"Patient":"I've had a large painful lump on my forehead about a week now.

Wash all of your sheets, towels and dirty clothing in hot water. Dry in a very hot dryer. A thorough vacuuming of your carpet and furniture will only take a couple times since lice do not live long without a host. Also remember to clean the upholstery in your car.

It's not very large (smaller than a pea) and I just started adding heat to it. I'm starting a new job On Monday, and being that I can't take off right away I'm hoping it can be treated without surgery. Are there any home remedies that could help me?","Doctor":"Hello & thanks for your Q on HCM I recommend applying a warm compress to the cyst up to four times a day until the swelling reduces and finally disappears. Hold the warm compress on the affected area for 10 to 15 minutes at a time to soften the blockage and speed up the draining process. Always wash your hands well before applying the compress and use a fresh clean cloth. Never heat the water for a compress in a microwave as it can become too hot and burn the delicate skin of the eyelids. Instead of tap water, you could use normal saline solution. ( salt water). Other home remedies for eye cysts are Use of guava leaves as a compress. Warm these leaves and place them in a clean dry cloth. Place this cloth over the swelling and leave it on for a while to reduce pain and redness. Boil some acacia leaves in water. Remove the leaves and use this water to soak a towel or clean cloth. Place the warm compress over the eyelids to remove in order to get rid of the chalazion cyst naturally. Apply a mixture of rosewater and honey directly on the eye which has a soothing effect and helps the eye heal at a faster rate. Tea bag eye treatments are effective in treating an eye cyst-  the used teabag of chamomile tea should be chilled for a while and then applied to the affected eye for 5 to 10 minutes or so.

Some of the most popular home remedies are briefly discussed below. RICE – RICE stands for Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation. This simple treatment can provide relief to most types of knee pain Studies have shown that steam baths have the ability to reduce knee pain by improving the blood circulation around the knees, thereby reducing inflammation. A slight massaging of the knee, while in the steam bath, can help make this remedy all the more effective Several herbal remedies such as dried ginger, wintergreen, Devil’s claw, Cat’s claw and a few other herbs have also been very effective at reducing or even eliminating pain in the knees A great and simple remedy that almost anyone can try is by mixing a powdered form of Bishop’s weed seeds into a glass of warm water that is then ingested You can also try another innovative home remedy that will require you to create a paste using the following ingredients. Castor, wheat, turmeric and Goat’s milk. If you can’t find any goat’s milk, just use some clarified butter instead. This paste does wonders when it is applied on the area of the knee that is generating the pain Another simple home remedy simply involves the light massaging of the knee area, with some easily available oils like coconut oil, mustard oil or even olive oil. Just be sure to warm up the oil a little bit and also use it about three times in a day, to get adequate relief Some very specific yoga exercises and certain physiotherapy type exercises can also go a long way in helping you reduce or even eliminate knee pain. More of that is discussed just a little bit later.....  Regards Dr.D.P.Bura"},{"Patient":"Hello, doctor i am nishrin sadriwala from rustumpura  area.

Aloe gel is taken by mouth for Osteo arthrities, Constipation including Stomach ulcers.It is also used as a general tonic. Because aloe gel contains , water, minerals, vitamins, aminoacids and phytonutrients. Most people use aloe gel topically, as a remedy for skin conditions including burns, sunburn, psoriasis , coldsores and acne.

Do not take aloe vera for 2 weeks perior to any  surgical procedure as it may cause increased bleeding during surgery. It is not possible to interact with the blood group.

What are your views on this treatment? I have been doing it for about a week now and I am starting to see some results. What is the reason that most doctors dont recommend this treatment for people? It seems to me that a lot of people have cured themselves like this. I am aware that the virus still remains in the body, but it seems to take care of the worst. I have had my warts for about 3 years now and have tried almost everything my doctor told me from freezing to burning it with acid.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for your query,There is no single effective cure for removal of genital warts. A number of treatment options exist; however, no treatment is 100% effective in eliminating warts and preventing them from coming back in all patients. It also is not possible to eliminate infection with human papillomavirus once it has occurred. Genital warts may go away on their own in about 10%-20% of people over a period of three to four months. Cryotherapy: This technique freezes the wart using liquid nitrogen or a \\"cryoprobe.\\" It is an excellent first-line treatment because response rates are high with few side effects. Laser treatment: This treatment is used for extensive or recurrent genital warts. It may require local, regional, or general anesthesia. The laser physically destroys the HPV-induced lesion. Disadvantages include high cost, increased healing time, scarring, and potentially infectious viral particles in the air caused by the laser plume. Electrodesiccation: This technique uses an electric current to destroy the warts. It can be done in the office with local anesthesia. Of note, the resulting smoke plume may be infectioon ... with good health... regards, Dr. Sharmila"},{"Patient":"Hello,yes I am currently taking 20mg of Cipralex each day and although I was initially prescribed these for anxiety issues,I am finding that my stress is a major difficulty for me right noe.

I m assuming that stronge substance scent they used to stick the carpets might have been the reason behind my cough. Should I worry? What natural remedie could I use to sooth the coughing?","Doctor":"hello welcome to health care magic Here are few remedies you can opt for 1. Lemon tea with a dash of ginger may prove to be one of the easiest home based remedies for curing prolonged spells of cough. The medicinal properties of ginger suppress various respiratory ailments like common cough and cold. With its soothing element, it helps to keep the body well hydrated which acts as an antidote to coughing. The ascorbic acid contained in lemon helps to neutralize the phlegm content of coughing. The tea leaves may be boiled with juice of grated ginger being added to it. Thereafter juice of lime may be added on to it to be sipped piping hot. 2. Honey with its analgesic (pain killing) properties is also known since time immemorial for its soothingly refreshing effects on patients down with cough. One tea spoon of honey may be added to any hot beverage like tea or milk to be drunk at regular intervals. But honey works wonders if blended with hot water and lemon. Lemon juice may be mixed with honey in proportion of one is to two. The resulting mixture may be mixed with little hot water so that you can have one to two tea spoons of it at least after every hour. The resulting mixture will not only help clear mucus but it will also keep your throat well soothed. 3.Honey acts as a topical anti biotic suppressing the bacterial causes of cough. If one is prone to the disgusting phenomena of night coughing two tea spoons of raw honey taken after dinner will work significantly towards reducing cough. 4.A spoonful of natural honey may be enriched with black pepper to be had twice a day. 5.If you are unable to take raw honey, you may add two spoons of it to a glass of carrot juice. Dilute the juice of four to five carrots with water. Drink the concoction at least thrice a day to soothe yourself from cough. 6.Two spoons of honey may be added to a glass full of aloe vera juice purchased from a pharmacist’s. The said concoction helps drastically in reducing dry cough. 7.Inhaling steam will give you a refreshing feeling aiding the release of mucus in the affected passage. Thus it is one of the most scientific processes helping one in the recovery of throat. Inhaling vapor accompanied by sipping the concoction of lime, water and honey will prove to be doubly effective. 8.Including grapes in your diet also ensures redemption from cough, because the expectorant nature of grapes helps not only in toning the lungs but also activates the release of mucus from the affected parts of respiratory organs. In cases of cough being triggered on by asthma, grapes play a beneficial role in the healing process with its enriched phytochemical contents. Grape juice with a spoonful of honey will be relieving and effective as well. 9.Gurgling in salt water always proves to be beneficial in offering relief to an infected or an itchy throat aggravated by coughing. But for an effective change one may resort to gurgling in spinach juice after extracting and warming the same with a dash of salt. 10.Herbal tea enriched with basil and aniseed may turn out to be soothingly effective as a homemade remedy for sore throat. 11.Nutritionally resourceful almonds also play a proactive role in the healing of cough. Paste made out of soaked almonds can be had with a touch of butter for relief from cough. 12.Another medicinal herb in turmeric is also known for its therapeutic effect on cough particularly the dry one. After roasting and powdering of its root, the powder can be had at least twice a day after being duly combined with water and honey. 13.A sauce of raisin, water and sugar or honey may be prepared and preserved at home for serving as a homemade expectorant against cough. Equal measures of raisin and sugar/honey may be boiled in water until it acquires a sauce like consistency. Two table spoons taken daily will help to cure cough. hope this will work out for you. thanks Dr payal"},{"Patient":"Hi, have been using Tretoin for acne recently but my face has increased in redness.

Most coughing is due to a viral infection, which means that medicine won't solve the problem. You simply have to let it run its course. Infant cold medicines can be dangerous in a child who is only 6 months old, so you should only give them under the direction of your doctor. some natural remedies, Run a humidifier at night. A dry room can exacerbate any coughing problems that your baby may have. A cool-mist humidifier can help relieve his coughing problems. If you want, you can use a eucalyptus enhancer with the humidifier. Feed your baby on demand. When fighting off a cold, babies need extra calories to help fight the infection. Don't try to stick to a usual feeding schedule. If your baby seems hungry, feed her. Keep your baby as upright as possible. Lying down can make a coughing problem worse, as sinuses drain to the back of the throat. hope helped your query regards dr.surendiran"},{"Patient":"Hi I was recently diagnose to have HIV and am still awaiting for my first apointment with the CDC.

Applying lemon juice, once a week, lightens the shade of the lips as it carries bleaching property. Vitamin C and E rich diet is apt for renewing the tissue that was damaged. Eating strawberry is also a good remedy as it helps to lighten the shade of the lips. Honey - a natural moisturizer- also proves beneficial.

Thank you for your help. Terry","Doctor":"hi there, prostatomegaly simply means enlargement of the prostate, and most of the time it is age related, which means that it tends to enlarge in men as they age. The UTI that has occured could be due to this enlargement which causes incomplete evacuation of the bladder leading to residual urine which is a good media for bacterial growth .An enlarged prostate cannot be made to shrink back to normal size but there are drugs to halt the process of further enlargement, as far as antibiotics go it is best to get a urine culture and senstivity done and then to take the anytibiotic to which the infecting organism is sensitive to. Anti inflammatories can decrease the size of the inflammed prostate if thats what it is but not of an enlarged prostate. You need to visit your local urologist and get an opinion on your urine test and also if required to take medication to restrict the prostatomegaly.

A daily intake of 2 teaspoons of coconut oil is a good home remedy for psoriasis. Or it can be applied on the affected skin 3 times daily. 3. Take a cup of fresh juice of bitter gourd vegetable, mixed with one tea spoon of lime juice on an empty stomach every day. This needs to be done for four to six months. 4. Cabbage leaves washed in warm water and dried with a towel should be flattened, softened and smoothed out by rolling them with a rolling pin after removing the thick veins.

Few food items need to be avoided in dandruff problem: Avoid Citrus fruits (e.g. orange), bananas, meats, sugar, white flour, string tea or coffee, pickles. No hair tonic (internal or external) will work until your dandruff problem get solved. Home remedies for dandruff: Fenugreek seeds: 2 tablespoon seeds should be soaked overnight in water and ground into fine paste in the morning. This paste should be applied all over the scalp and left for half an hour. The hair should be the washed thoroughly with soap-nut (ritha) solution or shikakai. Green Gram Powder: The hair should be washed twice a week with 2 tablespoons of this powder mixed with half cup of curd. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, My Baby boy is 1 month 22 days old.

But again I dint get my periods this month. My date was 27th of march. Can you tell me whether PCOs has got reduced or i should again start tablets. Also can you suggest me some diets and excersize to control PCOs naturally without any tablets","Doctor":"Hi, You need to get an ultrasonogram of the pelvis regularly to monitor the size of your cysts. Femilon makes your cycle regular as long as it is consumed. So, if you stop it and your periods do not appear, it means that the PCOS has not been cured. PCOS is a medical condition stemming out of hormonal imbalance. The cause is unknown but it has been observed that stress is known to be a triggering factor. Stress causes the sex hormones in your body to go in for a toss, and that can manifest as polycystic ovaries. I would advise you to go in for homeopathy as it will take care of the stress, hormonal imbalance and in turn the cysts. Also keep a regular check on your weight because, in PCOS, you tend to gain weight, and develop excess hair on your body (called Hirsutism). Go for regular walks, eat small meals frequently (5-6 in a day), avoid oily food and eat more of fresh fruits and veggies, and make sure you sleep for a minimum of 7 hours (11 pm-6 am), because this is the time when the hormone melatonin is maximally released in the body and it helps to keep your weight in check.

Use aloe vera on your healing scars daily. 6.Use fresh aloe vera extract for better results. You can also use aloe vera ointments and lotions. 7.Eat vitamin-K-enriched foods for better healing and to reduce the appearance of these scars. Foods that have this vitamin include spinach, tomatoes, broccoli, liver, dairy products, and cabbage. Lean meats and even turnips are also rich in vitamin K. Drink lots of water. Keeping yourself hydrated will help keep your skin elastic and will also help with the healing process. Cocoa butter also has properties that promote healing and scar reduction.

It is their eggs which are too small to be seen by naked human eye. These worms lay their eggs at the anal opening at night time and cause irritation, leading to itching. When you scratch the anal opening due to itching, these tiny eggs get collected under your nails and when you eat something these eggs get transferred orally to the stomach where they grow into adult worms and the cycle is repeated.To avoid reinfection, keep your nails closely cropped, wash your hands with soap and water regularly, especially after toilet.

I tried all of the creams and gels at pharmacies and none of them worked. I was diagnosed with vitamin b12 deficiency which causes dark under eye circles.

A few months ago I was experiencing severe tingling (I had other symptoms too, but the tingling was most bothersome) so I told my new doctor to test me for absolutely everything that can cause it. My b12 level came back at 30 which is extremely low.The funny thing about it was that I took b12 vitamins all the time... so my body just wasn't absorbing them.

Thanks","Doctor":"Hello, Can't possibly know if it is serious without an examination. And, inflammation occurs after the injury and increases. This causes accumulation of tissue fluid (swelling) the swelling causes the joint to be (temporarily mostly) deformed by the tissue fluid and less mobile. The tissue fluid distorts the area and makes it pull. Warm water causes resorption of the fluid. elevation moves it out by gravity and deep water submersion pushes it out.

It doesn t hurt on it s own but if she touches the injection site she feels the shock? Should she be concerned? Will it go away?","Doctor":"Hi, Cannot say in your particular case AND, local irritation generally subsides. Ice immediately and warm compress after the first day and anti-inflammatories often speeds resolution of inflammation.If a nerve is plain SEVERED/Destroyed, it is the outgrowth of a nerve cell and it mostly grows back. There can be some disruption and some residual funny feelings even after it grows back. This is more likely the more damage there is like amputation in which there's nothing for it to go back to. In cases where the path to reconnect is there, things do better and generally get back to near normal. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Taking opiates that are not prescribed is dangerous, illegal and signals more of an issue than just pain. The other key point is that the system gets used to opiates and more and more is needed for the same effect.

I have a healed brocken back from an injury when I was young, although now that I m sporting double nickels in age the arthritis is visiting quite frequently. I use a walker to walk my dog, as my L ankle was crushed in an Industrial Accident, which was resolved, no more Workmans Comp. nonsense. When the injury incurred in my youth didn t keep me from being active in sports, since the injury occurred, my R ankle has broken consistently about every other year. With the L ankle basically out of commission and the R ankle not able to work properly due to all of the breaks over the years it is getting much more difficult to do the simple things such as walking, which is taken for granted, since most people can walk consistently without incurring an injury. With me, that is not the case. The scar tissue in my back and ankles basically cripple me, and the pain in my legs is getting worse and worse. I don t scream as much as I did when I was younger, nor do I wake up screaming anymore from the pain. I am on Social Security Disability due to the disabling factors of the accumulated injuries. I am a former Nursing Student, I was getting ready for the clinical rotation when my L ankle was crushed, so I am very aware of how detrimental opiates are. However, I have tried shots in the back, an epidural block that lasted for three days and the physician that did that procedure refused to do another one, due to the fact that the epidural only provided me with three days of relief. I have also had two different types of shots to thwart the pain, however my legs are in agony every day and when I used to drive, I d have to stop the car and walk around before I could concentrate on driving. The pain got in the way of responsibly driving a vehicle, and I didn t want to hurt anyone. Now I am aware of the current hysteria concerning the prescribing opiates for pain, however I don t think I should have to live in agony due to the current hysteria surrounding the prescribing of opiates for chronic pain. I would like the experts to deal with the pain I have every day, and than call me a wuss when I seek relief from the pain I endure every day. I need a pain management physician who is not caught up in the growing hysteria that results when the physician prescribes something effective to deal with the pain. I live in New Castle County in Delaware, and the politics the result from a physician prescribing effective pain relief when all procedures have failed is sad. The current mood in this area prevents physicians who want to help patients due to the hysterical politics that surround this mind set. I would like to find a physician who is willing to work with a patient who has valid, chronic pain and is not going to be hampered by the current mood in the area in which I live.","Doctor":"Hello, There is considerable anger and frustration involved here. The bottom line is \\"how to get opiates.\\" There are many \\"pain management\\" centers that offer them--usually with other less proven modalities being more or less required.

It started about a year after I had Lieomyosarcoma with a IVC and right kidney resection. The pains have gotten worse over the last two years. Three neurologists have prescribed, Gabbapentin, Gabbapentin, and Atavan to sleep. pain management prescribed Methadone on top of those. Accupuncture said stop Atavan and Methedone to see if Accup. works. I ve been seven times and no help. I also have had a growling and semi-diarehia for about six weeks. Sounds like the third world war in there. My internist said stop the Gabba. and the accup. and start Methadone. This is apparently a last resort. I have chronic-severe stage iv kidney failure in my remaining kidney. Will I kill that kidney by taking Methadone for life and bring on dialysis sooner? Any other suggestions for the pain? Could I have paralytic ileus and how is that discovered? Is Pot a viable thing? Sure hope you have some answers. I am a married male, 77 years old. Thank you.

People are on it for decades there are drugs for the paralytic ileus from the methadone that just work on the gut. Cannabis, probably wont' work.

I was given naproxen for four days at the er. I also received an X-ray which was normal of the shoulder and chest. As I was not able to get an appointment with my family doctor for six days I took Advil extra strength for the last two days and am now continuing with the naproxen. The pain is not limited to my shoulder and extends into my back neck and hand. It is confined to the left side of my body. The pain is intense and has prevented me from going into my classes at university. My family doctor suggested the arm pain may be causes by my also having tennis elbow. Given that these both tend to be caused by repetitive motion and sports injury I am somewhat dubious as I have had no recent injuries, and do not play any sports or engage in any repetitive motions. There is no weakness to the arm or hand, but using it causes an intense almost tearing pain. To manage the pain I have been taking two tylenol 1s with codeine 8 times a day since my injury began. I am concerned that though I am not a heavy drinker and have abstained totally from alcohol while on pain killers that this high dose of tylenol May be damaging to my liver. I wish to know what other potential causes there may be for this pain and for how many weeks it is safe to keep taking the Tylenol 1? Would seeking alternative treatment such a massage or acupuncture be detrimental?","Doctor":"Hi, It isn't a question of how long.. it is how MUCH. Water, sodium, most drugs, and tylenol are very different at usual amounts and at high overdoses. The liver can detoxify tylenol but only up to about 4 grams at a time, higher than that and it is toxic to the liver. Safe is under 4 grams in a day. Hope I have answered your query.

But the key point here, is that the pain often has some either inflammatory or nerve components. These are better treated by non-narcotic medications. Tolerance can be overcome by time off from narcotics and/or on a narcotic blocker. Otherwise you're just stuck going with just higher doses.

This backwash can irritate the lining of your esophagus and throat. I advise you to take a stomach acid-suppressing drug-like pantoprazole along with domperidone one hour before breakfast on an empty stomach or 2 hours after having meals for at least 4-6 weeks. Besides you should have also lifestyle that may help reduce the frequency of acid reflux like maintain a healthy weight, stop smoking, alcohol consumption, elevate the head of your bed by 6-9 inches, do not lie down after a meal and avoid tight fitting clothing. Avoid foods and drinks that trigger reflux like fatty or fried foods, tomato sauce, alcohol, chocolate, mint, garlic, onion, and caffeine. Hope I have answered your query.

Symptoms: fever, body aches, general sinus stuff, cough.","Doctor":"Hi, Without an exam, I can only give general information, but it's pretty good in this case. Fever implies inflammation. this can be from a generalized condition like an auto immune response or an infection which is generally pretty localized to one area and has symptoms that focus On That Area such as cough and sinus stuff. Chronic sinus/lung/ or infection anywhere along the respiratory pathway can give fever and might need just antibiotics or with chronic conditions often/usually has something bent out of shape like an abscess or stopped up sinus that needs (usually really minor) surgical correction.

Frozen shoulder is a pretty simple straightforward condition: the area gets scarred if there is inflammation and lack of moving it. Mild cases are FIXED by physical therapy and maybe some aspirin like drugs. More serious cases need surgery first. This is going to be limited by pain. Steroid injection can fix it enough to start the physical therapy. It's a bit of a balance between moving the shoulder enough to free it and moving it so much as to injure it BUT, it takes a LOT to injure it. Piano, pretty okay, Trombone or cello, not so good.

There's rather a lot of options for pain. One would be more drugs, but another would actually be less drugs. Besides getting used to them, narcotics also change the perception of pain. Every system in the body re calibrates. So, if you are out in the sun, you temporarily lose light sensitivity.

On the one hand, it's done, you know what part is causing the pain, BUT why it is causing the pain is an issue. Mostly, this occurs with MINIMAL JOINT PROBLEMS and it is from the hip cartilage wearing through AND the same way the brakes in the car make the most noise when ONE spot has worn thru, so, the hip pain is the most when there is the FIRST spot wearing through. The pain decreases paradoxically when the hip become shot; and becomes a good case for hip replacement. So, MRI to see what's gone wrong.

Already had a TKR, have OA in both ankles, other knee getting shaky, bursitis in both hips, carpal tunnel both wrists, OA both hands, and need a new shoulder joint. During rehab for my TKR they also showed me exercises to help my shoulder, and it helped a lot. Only thing is at night the pain can be pretty severe, but okay during day. My othro DR. was giving me Tranadol plus Percocet.. Gov. Wolfe (Pa) passed a new tough drug law because of opioid mess. So my Dr. on last visit cut me off from not only Percocet but Tramadol too,and tells me just to start taking OTC drugs. I have been a patient at Ortho since 2013, and all of a sudden, despite knowing my history, just abruptly did this and said go to my GP for drugs, great specialist not helping me... I would take one 50 Tram twice a day, and never more than a 1/4-1/2 of a 5MG Percocet, only twice did a take a whole tab out of a 50 count script. The combo worked and let me sleep. The Dr. was such a jerk, last visit he only gave me Tram and said no Perc, just double the Tram. Then when I called for refill of Tram he said no more just the OTC. I m not a doctor shopper nor an addict, just a worn out farmer looking for pain relief. I ve read that 90 million people take Oxy, most must have real pain and not be druggies. So , the big question is what to sub for Percocet??? I just want to work a couple of more years then retire. The meds made this possible, now I feel like I m being punished for always following directions and using these drugs properly. As my GP said, a lot of cut off people will probably seek out illegal drugs like opium! Sounds like a great plan for harming a lot of innocent people! What do you think, and what non-opioid combo would be a effective? Thanks for advice","Doctor":"Hi, Without an exam, I can only give general information. Frankly with wear and tear, the opiates aren't all that great and aspirin like drugs are about equally effective and equally dangerous in different ways.

Codesoft EPO (Evening Primrose Oil Capsules 1000 mg) (2). Novex (Ormeloxifen Hydrochloride) My last MC was on 14th of June. Till today i.e 15th July i didnt get my next MC so today I visited Doctor again. Doctor told me that since Noves is a contraceptive pill, this may happen. Then i realized that i started to take it from 1st of July and my last MC was from 14th of June. Meanwhile I might have got pregnant.The doctor had my pregnancy test and it was positive. She asked me to avoid to take above mentioned medicines and given others instead, saying it wont have affected pregnancy/ baby anyways.

KINDLY ADVISE.","Doctor":"Hi, Most causes of pain in the breast are benign and not serious. There are a number of harmless causes for breast pain and tenderness that may primarily be related to changes in hormone levels. These can include Menstruation and premenstrual syndrome (PMS), Mastitis, Menopause and Fibrocystic Breast Tissue which is most common. Fibrocystic breasts are not necessarily linked to cancer, and the lumps are fluid-filled cysts rather than a mass of cells. However, it is advisable to do breast ultrasound and mammography just to be sure and start regular follow up of possible cysts. In case of redness, fever, and progressive pain this may indicate abscess and then it should be surgically drained or evacuated by needle under control of ultrasound. Hope I have answered your query.

Though the pain is severe, I doubt if it needs emergency attendance. When Calcium becomes too low, cramps become generalized, involuntary and some people start experiencing problems with the heart rate and sensitivity problems. If you are not experiencing any of these, you might not need to rush to the ER room, but getting blood Calcium levels checked is important. In case they are low, checking for blood Magnesium levels shall be important. The metabolism of Calcium and Magnesium go hand in hand. Untreated low Magnesium levels make correction of blood calcium difficult. It is also important to check your kidney function since they predispose to low blood calcium levels. Getting a good electrolyte panel done (including calcium and magnesium) are important. Left untreated, cardiac problems might intervene and could be dangerous. But I doubt from your description if it should be very low to deserve emergency care. Checking for local problems that can cause cramps is important too. Hope I have answered your query.

Blood pressure that is not consistent and certainly when it is not done with a good 5 min of rest is NOT VALID for risk assessment. The heart rate of 52 in someone who exercises a lot and has no cardiac problems nor symptoms strongly implies good cardiovascular shape.

However, if it is able to be triggered by a touch that tells you where the area is. If it is not constant, then it is hard for it to be a major injury in general. Easy bruisibility is pretty common just from thin skin. Cannot say in your particular case, but some people are built without very thick connective tissue.

What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi, This is going to be a problem. Cannot say specifically in your case without an exam and the pain can be from a minor problem with sore muscles (and the pain would be almost entirely demonstrable by light pressing on the muscles if that's the main problem...doubtful). And moving the hips in various directions or standing on the feet would trigger hip pain which \\"large effusion\\" implies a lot of hip problems. On the other hand, lumbar spine problems can also cause thigh pain in a particular pattern and this might even be more serious than hip problems. Healing is very long with tendons and never for cartilage (labrum). Surgery is generally not very good except for total joint replacement and that isn't going to necessarily help the tendons. There is the usual advice of heating pads, aspirin-like drugs, specifically increasing physical therapy to help support the areas of pain but the response with tendon and hip arthritis isn't going to be great.

This started about a week ago during a shower when I was sitting down and I thought I d just torn the skin a bit while adjusting my position (scrubbing my feet). I get slight tears in any of my soft tissue or cracks quite often, so I thought that this was the same case here and figured it would as it usually does, just go away after a while. However, the pain has been getting worse not better. I have Crohn s disease because of the types of vit deficiencies that I suffer from most, is why I say that I get tears often and I also get ulcers sometimes pretty bad in my mouth, throat, and once in a while I even get them vaginally. Sometimes if I am shaving and I move wrong I will tear the skin between my pelvic area and upper leg. Probably not describing it correctly. And maybe this happens to lots of people sometimes, however when I do tear the skin even just a little it tends to take sometimes up to months to heal. That is why I didn t think about this one too much. Until tonight I decided to take a close look, I expected just to see a red mark in between the crack but instead I found what look like small lesions or ulcers or whatever they might be. I will say right now that I am free and clear of any STDS, I do know this for a fact as I have been married for 10 yrs and due to my current health conditions even if he were cheating on me we aren t currently active together so that is not a possibility. Besides I m routinely tested anyway just because I have moved a lot lately and any Doctor I see tends to want to rule that out. The redness starts at the top of my crack or right at tail bone and goes down probably about 2 inches. It s pretty skinny, doesn t span more than a half an inch width wise. Most of it is just red and looks irritated almost like a diaper rash. There s just a small section about the size of a quarter that has what look like as I said before lesions or ulcers. They look a lot like the ones I get in my mouth just smaller. They re roundish to oval shaped and it s white in the middle like it s puss but I don t know if that s what it is or not. I have been suffering from Crohn s since 2005. before that I was diagnosed with cancer rhabdomyosarcoma at age 4, I am almost 31 now. I ve seen a lot of stuff with my health and been through a lot. This is new to me. It s got me concerned. I just moved so I don t have a new DR yet and I don t want to go to ER over this unless I really think I need to. I m a little lost.","Doctor":"Hi, At this area, it may indicate several issues and most common are a pilonidal cyst or perianal abscesses. These are inflammatory processes in the sacral and perianal area usually manifested with pain, redness, swelling, fever and pus discharge.

This is mostly caused by beta-hemolytic streptococcus and it necessitates antibiotic treatment with Augmentin, or combination of ciprinol+ metronidazole. You should also, apply cold compresses, take nonsteroid painkillers such as ibuprofen 400mg and rest. If there is no improvement within 2 days, you should see a doctor and have intravenous antibiotics. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

This has been going on for a little over a year (about Oct '13). I was seen by a doctor a year ago, but could not find the problem. It started coming on strong then, and nearly passing out when I bent over to tie my shoes or in the shower. I had a new eye exam and prescription, but only very minor change. I noticed no difference in the lightheadedness. I had xrays done, I think to neck and chest, found nothing.  I'm having balance issues like I can not stand still, I wobble.2. About a week ago, I was driving home from work and started having a very sharp pain behind my right ear, it came on quick and lasted about 10 minutes, then, a loud pop was heard and felt in that area and the pain quickly went away. Don't know if it's related to anything. No repeated issues. I'm diagnosed with migraines, but I don't think it was that.3. I've had ringing in my ears for about as long as the lightheadedness, don't know that it's related, but it is getting worse and is constant 24 hours a day.4. Two weeks ago while at the gym, I started some new abdominal exercises, twisting side to side machine. I only did a few with little weight. Since then, I've had a sharp pain in my lower abdomen, like I need to go to the bath room, not from he exercise itself.

I just got a new doctor and waiting for an appointment to go talk to her about this. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi, 1. This is most likely to be a referred pain form the teeth to the ear and surrounding area. The other possibility is the cervical nerves. 2. The pain sensation is mediated by the common nerve supply from the Trigeminal (Fifth Cranial Nerve). Chronic pain can alter the brains perception of the pain, making it more difficult to treat. The C3 dermatome supplies the region of the neck that you experience pain in. 3. Consult a neurologist to get an examination and a prescription for neuralgic pain killers (such as amitriptyline/ carbamazepine/ gabapentine / pregabalin). Do not self medicate as these medications can cause several side effects (including drowsiness and blurring of eyesight). 4. Other painkillers would give a partial relief in higher doses.  5.

First, yeah, localized symptoms in the breasts are something with the hormonal cycle and NOT something with the nerves. Then, a lot of things change the hormonal cycle. The most obvious are changes in the hormones through pregnancy, birth control pills, weight gain or loss, changes in daily routine. Pregnancy tests are pretty good. Blood tests are a bit better. Of course, the delay between getting the second test means it will automatically be more accurate since the pregnancy is further along or isn't.

It felt perfect for a while and I played all of the playoffs, but for the last half a year, i ve been having chronic pain shooting up and down the fibula. I ve had multiple x rays and an MRI that all check out fine. It is apparent on the images that the bone has not formed completely, but it is strong. Two orthopedic specialists have told me they don t know why it hasn t healed completely and aren t exactly sure what to do because it is such a rare injury. One recommended a bone stimulator. I m just looking for another opinion on what treatment options are out there.","Doctor":"Hi, Cannot say in your particular case, indeed I'm not 100% sure I understand the question. If the bone hasn't knitted together and if the area is not cast, obviously moving around a broken bone will hurt and the treatment is to have the area entirely immobilized and probably to not bear weight on it. Then, on the healing, the options are simple and so I don't know any orthopedists who wouldn't know all of them:1) the bones have to be touching to stick together. This often requires an operation to bolt them together. on a small bone they might not want to go to the trouble since the bone doesn't do much. They might even be considering plain removing it.2) Immobilization as mentioned.3) there has to be the stuff to heal them. I had a diabetic with no bone in the area of her nerve pain. The nerve damage is certainly enough to cause loss of circulation and loss of bone. She did NOT have bone problems elsewhere if the nerves and circulation were not horrible. Never-the-less, she had low vitamin D and her healing went much better after she went onto it. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

What I figured out is that no exercise is tried. So in all the procedures above the muscle would have gone weak by now and making joints to friction by touching of the end plates of the joints. Also, the muscle weakness will lead to fatigue to set in faster and release more of the lactic acid. Improving the overall muscular physiology with the help daily general exercise and some specified for the muscular system where the pain is more will help to have some relief.

It's subjective feel will be different. So, people have a different effect each time they take a different tablet. What not to do is increase narcotics. Other options are anti-inflammatories, massage, acupuncture, nerve damping pills like amitryptiline, possibly anti-depressants (but doubtful) and then..... change the relationship to pain. Obvioulsy there are the drug levels of the drug (first order), then there is a change in the level of drug (second order). This can be changed NOT by the drug, but by the level of pain, so increasing the level of pain in a way that you have agency over (called physical therapy and / or exercise) or other pain like activities (Church, volunteering, parenting, etc) will lower pain when you stop doing them. Then, related to this is the relationship to the ups and downs of pain (third order). If you regularly have pain and stop, you get over it. It is another sensation. You detach from it.

This was after I started to worry about having contracted something. I had some urinary difficulties that my GP felt were probably a UTI, and I was treated with Cipro. The current difficulty is that I started to focus on my penile area when I first began to sorry about it. Since then, I have noticed an almost constant tingling/burning in my penis (this has been over a period of probably 6-8 weeks. It seems to affect the end of the penis and the underside. There are no lesions.sores to be seen. It seems not to be there when I wake up, but worsens as the day goes on. I also seem to feel a tingling in the sole of my left foot.

My concern is whether there could be a clinical reason","Doctor":"Hi, The tingling in the penis is a non-specific issue, manifested by excess thoughts and fear of having STD and other issues.

They generally don’t have any threat to the testicles. To diagnose a hydrocele, the physical examination needs to be performed.

If it is tender, it needs to be treated by intake of analgesic medications. Most often, hydroceles typically go away within six months with conservative management by giving adequate scrotal support.

This is usually treated with 10 days of antibiotics, usually ciprofloxacin and there are no permanent consequences. Masturbation and intercourse should be avoided till pain persist, if possible since I may prolong inflammation course. Some more serious conditions such as tumors or torsion are rare but in doubtful cases, you should do Doppler ultrasound or scintigraphy.

I also notice that my stomach has recently become bloated with gas. I also have dry mouth. Thanks for your responce.","Doctor":"Hello, There are many reasons for lower back pain. Here are few that might have caused the problem to you- inappropriate way of sitting while you work, trauma to muscle or nerve due to some injury that went unnoticed. Here are a few things I suggest to my patients who come with similar complains. First of all for a long standing pain over 2 months like this its very important to know the underlying cause and its advisable to visit a doctor in person for this cause history plays a very important role in diagnosis. Secondly if needed you will have to undergo some medical imaging tests to find out exact reason for the pain. After diagnosis is made you will be given proper medications for pain management. Also its advisable to see a physiotherapist later for better management of the pain as some pain relieving exercises are taught by the physiotherapist which work well. For the other complains like bloating which can be due to acidity, some antiacid medicines like pan 40 can help in this. The other issue of dry mouth can be of various reasons and I advise you to mention the same to your visiting doctor as he might advise you to do some blood tests if needed.

Mostly it is not tested in humans for most of what I see around. Pharmaceutical Grade MIGHT be safety tested. BUT, it is a powerful inhibitor of harmful inflammation that does NOT suppress useful immunity.

The incidence of SOME back pain is basically 100%. This includes enough back pain to prevent working but is not as severe as yours. I cannot say in your particular case what is going on but prostate cancer invasion of the area, blood blister on the spine, fracture due to cancer, infection of the bones of the spine, fracture due to very very thin bones are all ones I have seen. Mostly they were really obviously not the usual back pain--the infection occurred after back surgery and had pus coming out of the back for example.

Nerve pain can result from nerve injury. The nerve has to heal back FROM ITS SOURCE and the thumb is a long way from the brain and spine. And sometimes it grows back slightly wrong and the pain lingers. Nerve dampers are pretty much guaranteed to work on localized cuts. There Are A LOT. Since it is going on the surface of a small area, very little is used and even if all of it gets in, the amount is too little to do anything anywhere but right at where it is put so they are basically cheap, effective and 100% safe. Lidocaine creme is the first. Under doctor supervision, deadening of the nerve also is an option this can be done by hot chili oil provided it feels burning, that sensation is that the chemical is overstimulating the nerve, tetracycline, physical burning with electrodes, or botox. Destruction must ONLY be done under doctor supervision and just damping down the nerve and allowing it to grow back is the first option used. Hope I have answered your query.

Increased stress hormone levels at the level of spine and probably brain, block or take attention away from pain. So, everything is the same but the feelings are damped down. It doesn't actually lower pain and generally, it is not enough by itself. This is more likely to work well the more the pain is due to nerves and spine nerve or spinal pain and less if it is due to a non-nervous tissue cause. So, a lumbar disk hitting nerves or spine will lower pain some with Cymbalta but there is enough direct trauma that it won't work completely. On the other hand, a disorder in which the nerves are the whole source of the pain such as shingles or fibromyalgia might be really helped by just the Cymbalta. Hope I have answered your query.

It s still numb after 16 hours, and the instructions said it could last up to 36 hours, so I m only slightly worried about getting my control back. I ve also been prescribed oxycodone (10.325 mg every 4 hours), and I ve been taking it since being released. The nurse talked to me about making sure not to get behind the pain, but I m concerned that I m taking it while the nerve block is still active - unnecessarily and putting more medicine in my liver. It s 2:30 am here and I m reluctant to call the doctor. 1) Is there risk in taking the oxycodone if I don t need it to manage the pain? 2) If I discontinue taking it and wait until I start feeling pain in my leg, will I have enough time for it to be effective, and will I risk being behind and catching up? 3) Am I keeping the oxycodone in my system for the initial wearing off of the nerve block? 4) Will the nerve block wear off all at once or gradually? Thank you, Susan","Doctor":"Hi, How bad is drinking water? Ok, 1 gallon a day is probably ideal. 5 gallons could be fatal. 1 325 of Tylenol is safe. it takes ten times that at one time to be bad for the liver. so, it is safer than water. In each case, having taken a gallon or a Tylenol yesterday isn't going to make taking it again today unsafe. So, the Tylenol issue won't accumulate. On the other hand, there are a lot of reasons not to overtake narcotics. You can get used to them in a few days and then they don't work as well because you've gotten used to them. It is equally true that if you don't have any pain, you don't know when to take them. The other feature the nurse is correct about is that they start working only about 40 min after you take them. Their peak effect is like at 90 min. So, if you wait on the pain, you will have a lag before relief. But there are also reasons to wait. The nerve block wears off pretty suddenly.

The only thing the PT did that did help was unravel the really tight muscles in her neck but it only helped for a couple of days of at most a week.

I went in to have it checked and my doctor thought that maybe I had some tendonitis going on and had me try some excercises and had me wear some braces for awhile. I did all that I could but the pain continued and really hurt.....started to feel like it was really deep like in my bones. hen it would let up some fter lasting for abut three months and then start up again even worse3 eventually including all of my body. I eventually started having trouble getting around because I was also really stiff and rigid feeling. I started feeling a little confused and noticed that cognitively I wasn t the same. I went to a neurologist and he did a CT scan and an EMG to test for MS AT that timme he said I didn t have enough criteria to meet an MS diagnosis but he couldn t say it isn t MS.

I have been treated by a Board-certified physician in Naples, Florida, for over 13 years. I have remained stable and have worked as an infusion RN while maintained on 40 mg Methadone daily for cervical radiculopathy and radiculitis, ( traumatic injury in 1993 with fusions and nerve damage) neuro pain in the area of my left greater trochanter/femur ( sustained a fall taking my garbage out and shattered the trochanter and fractured thefemur and now have a titanium rod, dynamic screw...bolts and plates. The rod extends into the left knee, but I now need knee replacements from Erosive Osteoarthritis and the docs are scratching their heads on what to do with the knee) and pain in both feet, ankles, and toes. Both knees are bone on bone, but the osteoporosis is a roadblock as the docs are concerned with the healing process. Bottom line, if there is a joint, I hurt there. I cannot take Neurontin as I suffered a pseudo-DIC syndrome and bled from every orifice until they got it stopped. I take Celebrex, but will eventually have the same issues I have had with all the other anti-inflammatories...GI distress. I have been through numerous medication protocols and finally found that the Methadone and Celebrex gave me enough relief that I could function and not be a slug with pain. I have minimal family and want to remain independent. I am doing my best at the age of 62 to function without being a burden to society. The problem is I recently moved to be nearer my daughter, who has my granddaughter and so I wanted to be closer to them, My pain management physician, who is Board certified, wrote a letter for me to bring to the new doc (he referred me to the only one he knew in Atlanta but she has retired) along with some of my records. He gave me three RX scripts with post-dated not to fill dates so that I would have my medication while securing a pain doctor. The problem is that I have been trying for almost 3 months to see someone and it is impossible. I cannot see a Rheumatologist at Emory until July, and I cannot see a pain management doctor because I do not have a referral. I cannot get a referral because I cannot get a doctor early enough. My insurance does not require it, but Emory does. This is frightening. I do not know what to do. I am terrified as I know what the pain is like and my docs told me that I could not just stop the Methadone after being on it since 1996. I was told by one PCP to just stop taking it! And I was told my an internal medicine doctor that he would not see me because he did not support treating anyone with Methadone unless he or she was an addict, and even then, he could not treat with Methadone. He wouldnt take me as a patient! It is scary. I have never encountered this kind of treatment. I am staying with friends and if I cannot move....I just do not want to do that to anyone. No one should have to deal with my pain. I do not know where to turn. I do not want to have to drive 10 hours to Naples just to get my prescriptions. I want to go back to work but know it will be impossible without my medication. My hands are so very painful as well. It is so depressing and I dont know what to do or how to get help. I was told by the registration desk at Emory that the pain doctors do not prescribe opoids for non-cancer pain. Please...where do I go as I will be out of my medication in less than a week. I have been trying to get in with someone for almost 3 months.","Doctor":"Hello, As a first line management, you can take analgesics like Paracetamol or Aceclofenac for pain relief.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!","Doctor":"Hello, This would have to be done by a physician of course. The blocker in suboxone is short-acting and 2 days at the very most (and more likely 12 hrs) would be enough to get the blocker out of the system. The suboxone is still there. It is a strong narcotic. It often helps the pain. The first thing which you may have already done is to go with a heavy dose of anti-inflammatories since this does not interact with the suboxone and is a strong pain reliever for dental pain.

Any advice","Doctor":"Hello, The location and movement of a pain give clues as to what is going on. and it's usually pretty obvious if it is the joint or the muscle or the butt or the hip joint. There can be irritation of the sciatic nerve with nerve type pain the goes from the back down the buttock and down the back of the leg. There can be muscle tone changes and this is the most common cause of nocturnal leg pain. Sometimes potassium and/or magnesium supplements may help but muscle relaxants or Parkinson's disease drugs are more commonly useful. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

It began gradually as stiff hips, legs (both sides) then moved to my shoulders that have become very painful and my range of motion is limited. I ve been to an Orthopedist who did xrays and indicated there was no visible signs of damage, I have been to a Rheumatologist who indicated possibly I might have Polymyalgia but my blood work came back normal so she referred me to my OB/GYN for possible hormone therapy. He reviewed my bloodwork and said he didn t understand the referral. I am not sure what my next steps should be. I have considerable pain in my arms and shoulders. My shoulders have begun to pop and my hands are stiff. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hi, The location and movement of a pain gives clues as to what is going on. Ok, then the localization to the upper body alone and whether it is in the joints or muscles. Aches in the joints and stiffness especially in the morning would fit with an inflammatory condition like early rheumatoid arthritis. A sed rate, C reactive protein, and fibrinogen would show inflammation. you probably had some / all of these. They might not be elevated immediately. The treatment for an inflammatory condition would be anti-inflammatories to start and also exercise. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Been going on for about 3 weeks. The more I move my left arm around, the better it feels but after a nights sleep the pain is horrible. Like the worst cramps ever.","Doctor":"Hi, The location and movement of a pain give clues as to what is going on. Pain that shoots in the direction of a nerve often is due to a local injury of the nerve. In particular, the spine in the neck often produces pain going out from the neck, down the shoulder, and to the hand. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Nothing seems to help except soaking in a hot bath, which I can t do all day. Any suggestions on how to relieve some of the pain?","Doctor":"Hi, The location and movement of a pain give clues as to what is going on. Cannot say in your particular case, but generally, Aspirin-like drugs, physical therapy, and surgical evaluation would be the first steps. Hope I have answered your query.

Warfarin for 2.5 years and dropped instantly when under a different PCP. All during that time, I have had pain, dizziness, and a constant skin rash. 8 months ago, I endured an AAA with emergency surgery upon it s rupture. The pain I experienced prior to surgery has increased at least double fold now. I need some sort of pain relieve as that it has me immobilized for weeks at a time. During my recovery, I was prescribed oxycodone which left me feeling the best I have in at least 15 years. I m really not a pill taker but, I was able to do things I couldn t for a long time. Without it, the constant pain and agony is near unbearable most of the time. If there is something better to live what life I have left, please inform me of this this. Otherwise, I am forced to do what I must to alleviate this 24/7 life of misery. The VA seems to be oblivious to this so, I can t deem it as a resource for any improvement in that area. Anything to remove the pain is under my consideration. Highest regards, Dave Sorrell","Doctor":"Hi, Cannot say in your particular case, but generally, if someone is on anticoagulation, Aspirin-like drugs are too risky to use. Tramadol is a lower risk narcotic that is extremely helpful in the more complicated pain and less so in simple joint and disc disease. Other places that prescribe narcotics are Methadone and Suboxone clinics. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I am in constant pain all the time. I watch my diet, my weight, do stretches, take meloxicam, tumeric and a handful of other vitamins. The only relief I get is my tens unit, which I ve used the past 10 plus years. I m not fond of wearing patches and lead wires all the time, so I only wear it when I really can t stand the pain. I done physical therapy and seen a pain management doctor but I don t want needles in my neck or back and I don t want to have surgery. I ve lived with this pain for many years, but as I m getting older, it s getting worse, I m 65 years old and the quality of my life (in pain all the time) makes me miserable. Do you have any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hi, Ankylosing spondylitis is really a very bad disease. Rheumatology should be consulted. In theory immune suppressants such as Methotrexate lower the progression of the disease. It is quite debilitating and even a Methadone program would not be a wrong direction for it.

I work as a track worker and I m concerned I may not be able to bend down to do my work. I ve tried Vicks vapor rub. It only takes away the pain to help me sleep, but the symptoms are still there. What can I do?","Doctor":"Hi, The location and movement of a pain give clues as to what is going on cannot say in your particular case, but generally, one can tell if the knee problem is on the inside out outside and the severity and treatment is totally different. I examine legs and knees all day and kneel with the knee on the concrete many times a day. The outside is sore, bruised, locally tender and responds to simple Aspirin. But the movement is fine and the knee is stable. If there is movement with a lax knee joint, then the inside is messed up and surgery might be helpful but it is a much more serious condition. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

They all hurt all the time and seem to worsen while relaxing.. My right knee and back have really been bothering me a lot while laying down...getting out of bed or standing after sitting for a short time is brutal...","Doctor":"Hi, The location and movement of a pain give clues as to what is going on. And a localized joint problem implies that particular joint(s) is damaged. This can be fixed surgically. Aspirin-like drugs often also are helpful. Mechanically, taking the weight off of the joint is helpful. Canes, walkers, braces are helpful exactly to the extent they take weight off. All will be more likely to have more effect than dieting which is unlikely to result in even a 10% change. Moving more gracefully through ballroom dance, tai chi or yoga will likely have the most effect on the strain on the area. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

As soon as I sit down to relax, the pain radiates through my wrists, arms, elbows, shoulders, legs, and back. I nearly groan out loud with the pain and become terribly exhausted. Lying down makes it worse. Sometimes, between spasms, I fall asleep for a minute of less while watching TV in a recliner, and that helps relax my body for about 15 minutes. I am on 1 mg ropinirole HCL at dinner time which helps. When I go without, the pain keeps me awake until 3 AM or later. Pain meds do not help. Walking around does not help. One of my doctors said the pain is from a variation of restless leg syndrome. Since it responds to ropinirole, that makes sense. Your opinion will be appreciated. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi, The location and movement of a pain give clues as to what is going on. And if it is all over, then it is not due to a particular joint, muscle, disk, or nerve problem. Overall problems such as electrolytes, hormones, inflammation might do it. Psychological causes are easily 10 fold more commonly associated with it. Indeed, an otherwise second-rate anti-depressant Cymbalta became quite popular due to its side effects that also work on pain. Hope I have answered your query.

I have taken only 5 mg lately because of foot and leg pain and since then have had an increase in my lipid profile. I tried crestor and the symptoms were worse. Is there another statin I can try before going on injectables?","Doctor":"Hi, Not really. Crestor, due to its relative potency, has a mild tendency to be less likely to give myalgias. If the symptoms reliably associate with one statin, it will occur with the entire class because they act the same way on the muscles. Niacin is different. Hope I have answered your query.
