Due to symmetry, it is sufficient to count the number of reading paths ending at the A in the lower right corner, and the desired number is four times this. Thus, we always have to move either to the right or downward, and we can only step from the left or upper neighbor of each letter - for letters on the axes and the I letters next to the dark square, only from the single such neighbor. Therefore, we can reach each letter in as many ways as the sum of the ways to reach its two neighbors, or the single neighbor. These numbers are shown in Figure 2, with 66 paths leading to each terminal letter, so the word MATEMATIKA can be read in 8 cdot 66 = 528 ways from the diagram.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_644936b5e2c3be9590f6g-1.jpg?height=691&width=553&top_left_y=1313&top_left_x=775)Figure 3b) The word METAMATEMATIKA, however, cannot start at the center, as the M there has no E neighbor, but it can start at any other M; furthermore, the 5th letter must again be the central M. Thus, it is sufficient to focus on the sequence M E T A M, and each of its reading possibilities can be completed in 528 ways.

(The problem's requirements do not exclude, for example, the same A appearing as the 6th letter as it did as the 4th.)c) To reduce the number of reading ways of the word MATEMATIKA to 500, we first determine for each letter - but again only in the lower right part of the diagram - how many reading paths pass through it. Indeed, by omitting only that letter, the number of reading possibilities decreases by this amount. This - similar to the connection between METAM and MATEMATIKA - is given by the product of the number of ways to reach the letter from the starting letter and the number of ways to reach any terminal letter from the letter.

By the induction hypothesis, they must form at least one triangle, thus completing the induction proof.In summary, the minimum value of N is n^{2}+1.Solution 2: Constructing examples as in Solution 1, we know that the minimum value of N is not less than n^{2}+1.Since there are n^{2}+1 line segments among 2n points, on average, each point draws more than n line segments. Therefore, we can conjecture that there must be a line segment whose two endpoints draw a total of at least 2n+1 line segments. Let's prove this by contradiction.Assume that the number of line segments drawn from A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{2n} are a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{2n}, and for any line segment A_{i} A_{j}, a_{i} + a_{j} leqslant 2n. Thus, the total number of line segments drawn from the two endpoints of all line segments does not exceed 2n(n^{2}+1). However, in this count, point A_{i} is counted a_{i} times, so we havesum_{i=1}^{2n} a_{i}^{2} leqslant 2n(n^{2}+1).On the other hand, it is clear that sum_{i=1}^{2n} a_{i}=2(n^{2}+1). By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we havebegin{array}{l}left(sum_{i=1}^{2n} a_{i}right)^{2} leqslant 2nleft(sum_{i=1}^{2n} a_{i}^{2}right), sum_{i=1}^{2n} a_{i}^{2} geqslant frac{1}{2n} times 4(n^{2}+1)^{2} > 2n(n^{2}+1).end{array}(2) contradicts (1). Therefore, there must be a line segment whose two endpoints draw a total of at least 2n+1 line segments. Let A_{1} A_{2} be such a line segment, and there must be a point A_{k} (k geqslant 3) such that the line segments A_{1} A_{k} and A_{2} A_{k} both exist, thus forming triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{k}.Solution 3: Constructing examples as in Solution 1, we know that the minimum value of N is not less than n^{2}+1. Below, we use the extreme principle to prove that when N=n^{2}+1, these line segments must form at least one triangle. Therefore, the minimum value of N is n^{2}+1.Assume that there are n^{2}+1 line segments among 2n known points, and these line segments do not form any triangle. Let A be the point among the 2n points that draws the most line segments, a total of k line segments: A B_{j}, j=1,2, cdots, k. Thus, any two points among left{B_{1}, cdots, B_{k}right} are not connected, otherwise, a triangle would be formed. Therefore, the number of line segments drawn from any B_{j} does not exceed 2n-k. Besides A, B_{1}, cdots, B_{k}, there are 2n-k-1 points, and the number of line segments drawn from any of these points does not exceed k. Thus, we haven^{2}+1 leqslant frac{1}{2}[k+k(2n-k)+(2n-k-1)k]=k(2n-k) leqslant n^{2}, which is a contradiction.

Condition for Monotonic Decrease: For f(x) to be monotonically decreasing, its derivative f'(x) must be less than 0 for all x in its domain.

(1979 Anhui Competition Question)","solution":"Let f(x) = ax + b (a neq 1, a, b in mathbf{R}) be a linear function with real coefficients. Then, a^{3}left(x - frac{b}{1-a}right) + frac{b}{1-a} = 8x + 7,which implies left{begin{array}{l}a^{3} = 8  frac{(a^{3} - 1)b}{1-a} = -7end{array} Rightarrow left{begin{array}{l}a = 2,  b = 1.end{array}right.right.Therefore, the required linear function with real coefficients is f(x) = 2x + 1.In Theorem 1, let x_{0} = frac{b}{1-a}, then f^{(n)}(x) = a^{n}(x - x_{0}) + x_{0} = varphi^{-1} circ g^{(n)} circ varphi(x). (where varphi(x) = x - x_{0}, g(x) = ax, g^{(n)}(x) = a^{n}x, and “.” denotes the function composition operation.)Thus, for the given functions f(x) and g(x), if there exists an invertible function varphi(x) such that f(x) = varphi^{-1} circ g circ varphi(x), then f(x) and g(x) are said to be similar with respect to the bridge function varphi(x), denoted as f sim g.In this case, from f(x) = varphi^{-1}(g(varphi(x))) we have varphi(f(x)) = g(varphi(x)), so varphi(x_{0}) = varphi(f(x_{0})) = g(varphi(x_{0})), which means varphi(x_{0}) is a fixed point of g(x), indicating that the bridge function varphi has the property: it maps the fixed point x_{0} of f to the fixed point varphi(x_{0}) of g.Typically, to facilitate the calculation of g^{(n)}(x), g(x) is often chosen as ax, x + a, ax^2, ax^3, etc., in which case the fixed points of g(x) are 0 or infty. Therefore, under the mapping of the bridge function varphi, it is best to map the fixed point of f to 0 or infty. Thus, if f(x) has a unique fixed point x_{0}, then we can consider taking varphi(x) = x - x_{0} (or frac{1}{x - x_{0}}), in which case varphi(x_{0}) = 0 (or infty); if f(x) has two distinct fixed points x_{1}, x_{2}, then we can consider taking varphi(x) = frac{x - x_{1}}{x - x_{2}}, in which case varphi(x_{1}) = 0, varphi(x_{2}) = infty.

Now, consider the tangent line parallel to ( BC ) that intersects ( AB ) at ( A_1 ) and ( AC ) at ( A_2 ). Let ( h_a ) be the height of ( triangle AA_1A_2 ) from ( A ).4. From similar triangles ( triangle AA_1A_2 ) and ( triangle ABC ), we have:   [   frac{r_1}{r} = frac{h_a}{H_a} = frac{H_a - 2r}{H_a} = 1 - frac{2r}{H_a}   ]   Similarly, for the other two small triangles, we have:   [   frac{r_2}{r} = 1 - frac{2r}{H_b} quad text{and} quad frac{r_3}{r} = 1 - frac{2r}{H_c}   ]5. Adding these equations, we get:   [   frac{r_1}{r} + frac{r_2}{r} + frac{r_3}{r} = left(1 - frac{2r}{H_a}right) + left(1 - frac{2r}{H_b}right) + left(1 - frac{2r}{H_c}right)   ]   [   frac{r_1 + r_2 + r_3}{r} = 3 - 2r left( frac{1}{H_a} + frac{1}{H_b} + frac{1}{H_c} right)   ]6. Using the lemma ( frac{1}{H_a} + frac{1}{H_b} + frac{1}{H_c} = frac{1}{r} ), we substitute:   [   frac{r_1 + r_2 + r_3}{r} = 3 - 2r left( frac{1}{r} right) = 3 - 2 = 1   ]   [   r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = r   ](blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = r } )"},{"problem":"Pedro wants to paint a cubic box in such a way that the faces that share an edge are painted in different colors.

What is the largest n such that however the tournament is arranged we can find 4 people amongst whom only one game has been played by the end of round n?","solution":"? n must be at least 7 Solution Many thanks to Aragorn for showing that n=7 works Now consider n = 7. Let S be the largest set of players none of whom have played each other and let S' be the set of the remaining players. Take A in S' who has played as few players in S as possible. Suppose |S| = m, so that |S'| = 18-m. We show that A has played at most m-2 members of S. Suppose not. Each player has played 7 games, and for members of S all these have been with members of S', so there have been 7m games between members of S and members of S'. If every member of S' has played m-1 or more members of S, then there have been at least (18 - m)(m - 1) games between members of S and members of S', so (18 - m)(m - 1) ≤ 7m, or m 2 - 12m + 18 ≥ 0, so m  10. Clearly m is not less than 2 (since there are certainly two players who have not played each other). If m > 10, then since A has played only 7 games, he has played less than m-2 members of S'. Thus we can find B and C in S, such that A has not played B or C. Since A is not in S and S is maximal, there must be D in S who has played A. Now A, B, C, D is the required set of 4 people amongst whom only one game has been played (A - D). To show that n=7 is best possible we have to exhibit a particular tournament such that given any 4 people, either 0 or ≥ 2 games have been played between them after 8 rounds. I cannot see how to do this at the moment. Note that it is certainly not true for all tournaments. It is not hard to construct a tournament which has 4 people with only 1 game between them after 13 rounds. 17th Chinese 2002 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 4 March 2003 Last corrected/updated 28 Nov 03"},{"problem":"Use the dilution spread plate method to count the number of viable bacteria in a sample.

A certain e-commerce platform is live selling a small commodity with a cost price of 8 yuan per item on a certain APP. If it is sold for 10 yuan per item, 200 items can be sold per day.

For each 1 yuan increase in the selling price, the number of items sold decreases by 20. This can be expressed as:[y = 200 - 20(x - 10).]Expanding and simplifying this expression gives us:[y = 200 - 20x + 200][y = -20x + 400.]Therefore, the functional expression between y and x is:[y = -20x + 400.](2) To find the selling price that allows the e-commerce platform to make a profit of 640 yuan per day, we use the profit formula. The profit for each item sold is the selling price minus the cost price, and the total profit is this difference multiplied by the number of items sold. Given the cost price is 8 yuan, and aiming for a total profit of 640 yuan, we set up the equation:[(x - 8)(200 - 20(x - 10)) = 640.]Substituting the expression for y from part (1), we get:[(x - 8)(400 - 20x) = 640.]Expanding and simplifying this equation gives us:[x^2 - 28x + 192 = 0.]Solving this quadratic equation, we find the roots to be:[x_1 = 12, quad x_2 = 16.]However, the selling price must be not lower than the cost price and not higher than 15 yuan.

Substituting into the equation of ellipse C, we solve to find y_P = pm frac{sqrt{3}}{2}b.Since point P is in the first quadrant, we have y_P = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}b.Similarly, we can find x_Q = -frac{a}{2}, y_Q = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}b.Therefore, k_{AP}k_{OQ} = frac{frac{sqrt{3}b}{2}}{frac{a}{2}-(-a)} cdot frac{frac{sqrt{3}b}{2}}{-frac{a}{2}} = -frac{b^2}{a^2}.From (1), we know e = frac{c}{a} = frac{1}{2}, so frac{b^2}{a^2} = frac{3}{4}.Thus, k_{AP}k_{OQ} = -frac{3}{4}.(3) From (1), we know e = frac{c}{a} = frac{1}{2}, and given b = sqrt{3},we solve to find a = 2.

Understanding the problem: We have ten ships on an east-west shipping lane. The first five ships from the west are sailing eastwards, and the other five ships from the east are sailing westwards. All ships sail at the same constant speed. When two ships meet, they turn around and sail in the opposite direction. We need to determine how many meetings of two ships take place before all ships return to port.2. Simplifying the problem: Instead of considering the ships turning around, we can simplify the problem by imagining that they continue in their original directions. This simplification works because the relative motion and the number of meetings remain the same.3. Counting the meetings: Each of the five ships sailing eastwards will meet each of the five ships sailing westwards. Therefore, we need to count the number of unique pairings between the eastward and westward ships.4. Calculating the number of meetings:    - There are 5 ships sailing eastwards.   - There are 5 ships sailing westwards.   - Each eastward ship will meet each westward ship exactly once.

Since this number must be an integer, 265(n + 1) must be divisible by 1024. The smallest value of n that satisfies this condition is, obviously, 1023, and in this case,N = 15 cdot 1023 + 11 + 265 = 15621Second solution. This problem can be solved much faster and almost without any calculations if we carefully consider the conditions that the content of the problem imposes on the total number N of nuts. The first condition of the problem is that during the first division into five parts, one nut remains. This condition means that N when divided by 5 gives a remainder of 1, i.e., N = 5l + 1; numbers that satisfy this condition occur in the natural sequence of numbers with an interval of five numbers, and knowing one such number, we can find an unlimited number of others by adding (or subtracting) multiples of 5. The second condition of the problem states that k = frac{4}{5}(N - 1) = 4l gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 5, i.e., k = 5l_1 + 1. This requirement is equivalent to l giving a remainder of 4 when divided by 5 or that N = 5l + 1 gives a remainder of 21 when divided by 25; numbers that satisfy this condition occur in the number sequence with an interval of 25 numbers, and knowing one such number, we can obtain as many as we want by adding (or subtracting) multiples of 25. Similarly, the third condition of the problem states that k_1 = frac{4}{5}(k - 1) = 4l_1 gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 5; this condition determines the remainder from the division of the number l_1 by 5 or the remainders from the division of the numbers k and l by 25, or the remainder from the division of N by 125. All conditions of the problem determine the remainder from the division of the number N by 5^6 = 15625; numbers that satisfy these conditions occur in the natural sequence of numbers with an interval of 15625.We could calculate the remainder that the number N gives when divided by 58, but there is no need for this. The fact is that one number that satisfies all the conditions of the problem is obvious. This number is -4. Indeed, when -4 is divided by 5, it gives a quotient of -1 and a remainder of +1; therefore, if we subtract 1 from -4 and take frac{4}{5} of the resulting difference, which is already divisible by 5, we will get the same number -4. Similarly, in all subsequent divisions by 5, we will have the same remainder +1. True, the number -4 cannot serve as an answer to our problem, as, by condition, the number N must be positive; but knowing one number that satisfies the conditions of the problem, we can obtain as many as we want by adding multiples of 5^6. The smallest positive number that satisfies the conditions is, obviously, -4 + 5^6 = 15625 - 4 = 15621."},{"problem":"2. In triangle A B C, it is known that angle A=120^{circ}, A B=5, B C =7.

This can be factored as follows:[t = x^{2}-2x-24 = (x+4)(x-6).]For the function to be increasing, we need the derivative of the inside function, t, with respect to x to be greater than 0. However, since the base of the logarithm is frac{1}{3} (which is less than 1), the function f(x) increases when t decreases because the logarithm function with a base between 0 and 1 is a decreasing function. Therefore, we look for the intervals where t > 0 to determine where f(x) is monotonically increasing.The product (x+4)(x-6) > 0 when either both factors are positive or both are negative. This occurs when:- Both factors are positive: x > 6.- Both factors are negative: x < -4.However, due to the nature of the quadratic function, we know it opens upwards (since the coefficient of x^2 is positive), and the roots are x = -4 and x = 6. Thus, the function t is positive outside the interval (-4, 6), which means it is positive on (-infty, -4) and (6, infty).Given the base of the logarithm, the function f(x) is monotonically increasing on the interval where t is positive and moving towards zero, which is (-infty, -4) because as x moves from -infty to -4, t decreases, making the value of the logarithm function to increase due to the base being less than 1.Therefore, the monotonically increasing interval of the function fleft(xright)=log _{frac{1}{3}}left(x^{2}-2x-24right) is boxed{(-infty, -4)}."},{"problem":"Task A-4.2.

Define the points and variables:   - Let A(0,0) and B(2,0) be the endpoints of the segment.   - Let M(lambda, 0) be a point on the segment AB where 0 leq lambda leq 2.   - The coordinates (x, y) represent the areas of the squares with sides AM and MB respectively.2. Express x and y in terms of lambda:   - The length of AM is lambda, so the area of the square with side AM is x = lambda^2.   - The length of MB is 2 - lambda, so the area of the square with side MB is y = (2 - lambda)^2.3. Eliminate the parameter lambda:   - From x = lambda^2, we get lambda = sqrt{x}.   - Substitute lambda = sqrt{x} into y = (2 - lambda)^2:     [     y = (2 - sqrt{x})^2 = 4 - 4sqrt{x} + x     ]4.

Find all prime numbers p and q for which p^{4}-q^{6} is a power of a prime number. (The numbers 7 and 8 are powers of a prime number, but 6 is not.)","solution":"III/1. Let's write p^{4}-q^{6}=r^{n} for some prime r and natural number n. The expression p^{4}-q^{6} can be factored as p^{4}-q^{6}=left(p^{2}-q^{3}right)left(p^{2}+q^{3}right). Since p^{4}-q^{6}>0, the primes p and q cannot be equal, so they are coprime. Let d be the greatest common divisor of p^{2}-q^{3} and p^{2}+q^{3}. Then d also divides 2 p^{2} and 2 q^{3}, so due to the coprimality of p and q, d can be at most 2.If d=2, then r=2 and p^{2}-q^{3}=2 and p^{2}+q^{3}=2^{n-1}. Adding these equations and dividing by 2, we get p^{2}=1+2^{n-2} or 2^{n-2}=p^{2}-1=(p-1)(p+1). The numbers p-1 and p+1 must both be powers of 2, which is only possible if p=3. But then we get a contradiction q^{3}=7.Therefore, d=1. Since the numbers p^{2}-q^{3} and p^{2}+q^{3} are coprime and their product is a power of a prime, we must have p^{2}-q^{3}=1 or p^{2}=q^{3}+1=(q+1)left(q^{2}-q+1right). Since q is a prime, q+1>2 and q^{2}-q+1>2, so neither of the factors q+1 and q^{2}-q+1 is equal to 1. If we want their product to be the square of a prime, the factors must be equal. From the equation q+1=q^{2}-q+1 we get q=2 and from p^{2}=1+q^{3} we get p=3. Finally, we check that 3^{4}-2^{6}=17 is indeed a power of a prime.

Again, we write p^{4}-q^{6}=r^{n}. By considering the parity, we conclude that all three of p, q, r cannot be odd at the same time. Since r>0, we also have p>q. Due to the positivity of all terms, we also conclude that p, q, r are pairwise distinct. Since at least one is even, we can consider 3 cases. If p=2, then due to p>q we have q=1. In this case, there is no solution. If q=2, we can factor the expression: left(p^{2}-8right)left(p^{2}+8right)=r^{n}, or p^{2}-8=r^{a} and p^{2}+8=r^{b}, where a, b in mathbb{N}_{0}, and b>a. We again consider two cases: if a=0, we get the solution p=3, q=2, r=17. If a>0, we can subtract the equations and factor out r: 16=rleft(r^{b-1}-r^{a-1}right). This gives us r mid 16, from which we get r=2=q, which again does not give a solution. The only remaining case is when r=2. We again write p^{2}-q^{3}=2^{a} and p^{2}+q^{3}=2^{b}, where a, b in mathbb{N}_{0} and a1. It follows that both p-1 and p+1 are powers of 2, which is only possible if p=3, from which we get q^{3}=7. Again, there is no solution. If a>1, we add the equations and factor out 4: 2 p^{2}=4left(2^{b-2}-2^{a-2}right). From this, we get p=2, which again does not give a solution.Observations that p, q and r cannot all be odd, that they are pairwise distinct, and that p>q ldots 1 pointHandling the case p=21 pointHandling the case q=2 (cases a=0 and a>0, writing the solution)"},{"problem":"8.2.1.

This happens when the line passing through P and the center of the circle (1, -2) is perpendicular to the line described by 3x + 4y - 15 = 0.Using the distance from a point to a line formula, the distance d from the center of the circle to the line is given by:d = frac{|3 cdot 1 + 4 cdot (-2) - 15|}{sqrt{3^2 + 4^2}} = 4Since this distance is the radius, the angle formed by the tangents at the point of contact is a right angle. Thus, the angle theta formed by the two tangent lines is twice the angle between the radius and the perpendicular line, which is:sinfrac{theta}{2} = frac{1}{4}Therefore, using the double-angle formula for cosine, we get:costheta = 1 - 2sin^2frac{theta}{2} = 1 - 2left(frac{1}{4}right)^2 = frac{7}{8}Hence, the minimum value of the cosine of the angle formed by the two tangent lines is boxed{frac{7}{8}}."},{"problem":"Given that i is the imaginary unit, what is the imaginary part of the complex number 1-i?","solution":"To find the imaginary part of the complex number 1-i, we break down the complex number into its real and imaginary components.

We will prove that if the graph has at least 33 edges (i.e., at most 3 edges are missing), then it will always contain a monochromatic triangle.

According to the theorem mentioned earlier, this subgraph must contain a monochromatic triangle. The triangle is also part of the original graph. This proves that if the graph has at least 33 edges, it will contain a monochromatic triangle.Now, we will provide an example of a 9-point, 32-edge graph whose edges can be colored with two colors such that it does not contain a monochromatic triangle (Figure 1). Note that among the four missing edges, no two can share a common endpoint, because otherwise, we could remove three points (one being the common endpoint of the two edges) such that the remaining 6-point graph is complete, which would definitely contain a monochromatic triangle.This condition already determines the structure of the graph; we only need to specify the coloring.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_a4f7f9267076ca0c30dcg-1.jpg?height=683&width=596&top_left_y=1838&top_left_x=751)For better clarity, we represent the red edges with solid lines and do not draw the blue edges.

Let the endpoints of these edges be B, C, and D.If any two of the points B, C, D are connected by a red edge, then these two points together with A form a red triangle.

Properties of Roots for Line PQ:   - Let P(x_{1}, y_{1}) and Q(x_{2}, y_{2}) be the points of intersection.   - From the quadratic equation, we know that x_{1}+x_{2}=8k_{1} and x_{1}x_{2}=-16.   - Therefore, y_{1}+y_{2}=k_{1}(x_{1}+x_{2})+4=8k_{1}^2+4.5. Length of PQ:   - The length |PQ| can be found as y_{1}+y_{2}+4=8k_{1}^2+8.6. Similarly, for Line MN:   - Following a similar process, we find |MN|=8k_{2}^2+8.7. Sum of Lengths:   - Therefore, |PQ|+|MN|=8(k_{1}^2+k_{2}^2)+16.8. Using the Given Condition:   - Given frac{1}{{k_1^2}}+frac{4}{{k_2^2}}=1, we find k_1^2+k_2^2=5+frac{{k_2^2}}{{k_1^2}}+frac{{4k_1^2}}{{k_2^2}}.   - By the AM-GM inequality, frac{{k_2^2}}{{k_1^2}}+frac{{4k_1^2}}{{k_2^2}} geq 2sqrt{frac{{k_2^2}}{{k_1^2}} cdot frac{{4k_1^2}}{{k_2^2}}} = 4.   - Thus, k_1^2+k_2^2 geq 9, with equality when frac{{k_2^2}}{{k_1^2}}=frac{{4k_1^2}}{{k_2^2}}, leading to k_1^2=3 and k_2^2=6.9. Minimum Value of |PQ|+|MN|:   - Substituting the minimum values of k_1^2 and k_2^2 into the sum of lengths, we get the minimum value of |PQ|+|MN| as 8 times 9 + 16 = 88.Therefore, the minimum value of |PQ|+|MN| is boxed{88}."},{"problem":"1.

Then the equation of the tangent becomes:y = a(x - 1).Next, we find the points where the tangent line intersects the axes:For the x-axis (y=0), we substitute y=0 in the equation of the tangent to find x:0 = a(x - 1),which implies x = 1. This point is A(1, 0).For the y-axis (x=0), we substitute x=0 in the equation of the tangent to find y:y = a(0 - 1) = -a.This point is B(0, -a).Now we calculate the area S of the triangle AOB:S = frac{1}{2} text{base} times text{height} = frac{1}{2} cdot 1 cdot a = frac{a}{2}.We are given that this area is 4, therefore:frac{a}{2} = 4.Solving for a, we get:a = 2 times 4 = 8.So, the correct value of a is boxed{8}."},{"problem":"In triangle ABC, the sides opposite to interior angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively, it is known that B=60^circ, and c=8.

First, observe that ( x - y ) must be even because the left-hand side ( x^{2n+1} - y^{2n+1} ) is odd (since (2n+1) is odd) and the right-hand side ( xyz + 2^{2n+1} ) is also odd (since (2^{2n+1}) is even and (xyz) is odd). Therefore, ( x - y geq 2 ).3. Consider the factorization of the left-hand side:   [   x^{2n+1} - y^{2n+1} = (x - y)(x^{2n} + x^{2n-1}y + cdots + y^{2n})   ]   Since ( x - y geq 2 ), we have:   [   x^{2n+1} - y^{2n+1} > 2x^{2n}   ]4. For the right-hand side, we have:   [   xyz + 2^{2n+1} leq x(x-2) cdot 5 cdot 2^{2n} + 2^{2n+1} = (5x^2 - 10x + 2)2^{2n}   ]5.

Constructing a Very Good List:   - Consider the ruler sequence defined by ( nu_2(n) + 1 ), where ( nu_2(n) ) is the highest power of 2 dividing ( n ).   - For example, ( nu_2(1) = 0 ), ( nu_2(2) = 1 ), ( nu_2(3) = 0 ), ( nu_2(4) = 2 ), etc.   - The sequence ( nu_2(1) + 1, nu_2(2) + 1, ldots, nu_2(2019) + 1 ) will have values ranging from 1 to ( nu_2(2019) + 1 ).3. Analyzing the Ruler Sequence:   - The maximum value of ( nu_2(n) ) for ( n leq 2019 ) is ( nu_2(1024) = 10 ).   - Therefore, the values in the sequence ( nu_2(n) + 1 ) will range from 1 to 11.4. Verifying the Very Good Property:   - For any sublist of the ruler sequence, the maximum element appears exactly once because the sequence is constructed such that each value ( nu_2(n) + 1 ) is unique for each ( n ).   - This ensures that all sublists are good, making the entire list very good.5.

Let left(x_{0}, y_{0}right) be on the graph of y=f(x), by the problem, the point left(x_{0}, y_{0}^{2}+1right) is on the graph of y=f(f(x)), i.e., y_{0}=x_{0}^{2}+c, y_{0}^{2}+1=left(x_{0}^{2}+cright)^{2}+c. From the above two equations, it is easy to know that c=1. Therefore, f(x)=x^{2}+1. Hence, g(x)=left(x^{2}+1right)^{2}+1.(2) From (1), we get F(x)=g(x)-lambda f(x)=x^{4}+(2-lambda) x^{2}+2-lambda. Let x_{1}<0, but x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}>0, so it is sufficient that x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+2-lambda>0, thus lambda<3, therefore as long as lambda leqslant 3, F(x) is a decreasing function in left(-infty,-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right).

Antiderivative Function and Indefinite IntegralIn differential calculus, given a function F(x), one finds its derivative f(x)=F^{prime}(x). In practice, it is often necessary to solve the inverse problem: to restore the function F(x), knowing its derivative f(x). In this case, the function F(x) is called the antiderivative of f(x).Definition 1. A function F(x) is called an antiderivative of the function f(x) if the derivative of F(x) is equal to f(x), i.e.,F^{prime}(x)=f(x) text { or } d F(x)=f(x) d x .Example. Suppose we have the function f(x)=2 x. The function F(x)=x^{2} is an antiderivative of f(x), because left(x^{2}right)^{prime}=2 x. But the function F(x)=x^{2}+1 is also an antiderivative of f(x), since left(x^{2}+1right)^{prime}=2 x, and generally - any function F(x)=x^{2}+C (where C is an arbitrary constant) is an antiderivative of f(x). Thus, this function has a set of antiderivatives, and it can be shown that any two of them differ by a constant number.Theorem 1 (on two antiderivatives). If F_{1}(x) and F_{2}(x) are two antiderivatives of the function f(x) on the interval [a, b], then the difference between them is a constant number.From this theorem, it follows that if any antiderivative F(x) of the function f(x) is found on some interval (finite or infinite), then any other antiderivative of this function can be found using the formulaF(x)=F(x)+C,where C= const.Definition 2. The set of antiderivatives of the function f(x) is called the indefinite integral of the function f(x) and is denoted by the symbol int f(x) d x. Thus, by definition, we have:int f(x) d x=F(x)+Cwhere F(x) is some antiderivative; C= const; x is the independent variable of integration; f(x) is the integrand; f(x) d x is the integrand expression; int is the integral sign.The operation of finding antiderivatives of a function is called its integration.Geometric meaning of the indefinite integral.

Consider k = 2:   - If k = 2, then 2 mid (b - a)^4 + 1, so a notequiv b pmod 2.   - This implies ab equiv 0 pmod 2, so 4 mid (b - a)^4 + 1, which is a contradiction.7. Consider k = 1:   - If k = 1, then ab = (b - a)^4 + 1.   - Assume without loss of generality b geq a, and let b = a + n.   - Then a(a + n) = n^4 + 1, so a^2 + an - (n^4 + 1) = 0.   - The discriminant of this equation must be a perfect square, so n^2 + 4n^4 + 4 must be a perfect square.8. Analyze the discriminant:   - For n geq 2, we have 4n^4 + n^2 + 4 > 4n^4 and 4n^4 + n^2 + 4 < (2n^2 + 1)^2 = 4n^4 + 4n^2 + 1.   - Therefore, it cannot be a square for n geq 2.9. Consider n = 0 and n = 1:   - If n = 0, then a^2 = 1, so a = 1 and b = 1.   - If n = 1, then a^2 + a - 2 = 0, so a = 1 and b = 2.Therefore, the only solutions are boxed{(1, 1)}, boxed{(1, 2)}, and boxed{(2, 1)}."},{"problem":"Given f(x)=frac{1-x}{1+x}, the sequence {a_n} satisfies a_1=frac{1}{2}, and for any nin mathbb{N}^*, it holds that a_{n+2}=f(a_n), and a_n > 0.

When the table is in its extended state, let's complete the semicircles to form the circles k and ell, with centers K and L.The line KL intersects the circles k and ell at points A and B respectively. Enlarge the circle k from point A by a factor of frac{3}{2}. The image of this transformation consists of points X', which are obtained as follows: for any point X on circle k, measure the distance AX' = frac{3}{2} AX on the ray AX. Under this transformation, the image of K on the ray AK is the point K' = O such that AO = frac{3}{2} AK = frac{3}{2} cdot 0.5 = 0.75; thus, O is the midpoint of AB. By the converse of the parallel chords theorem, X'O is parallel to XK, and X'O = frac{3}{2} XK = 0.75. Therefore, X' lies on the circle n with center O and radius 0.75. Since X is an internal point of the segment AX', every point X on circle k lies on the disk of circle n. Thus, the disk of circle n contains the circle k. Similarly, it can be shown that enlarging circle ell from point B by a factor of frac{3}{2} also results in circle n. Therefore, the disk of circle n contains both circles k and ell; hence, the points P, Q, R, S are also on this disk, so circle n covers the extended table.

From the description in the solution, it can also be easily seen that the image of a circle under a central enlargement is a complete circle; however, this was not necessary for the solution.2.

However, the direct calculation can be quite complex. A more straightforward approach is to consider the problem as finding the number of derangements for a subset of the balls.First, we choose 3 balls out of the 10, which will not match the numbers of their boxes.

This is a classic problem of derangements, often denoted as !n for n objects.For 3 objects, the number of derangements is !3 = 2. This is because there are only two ways to place 3 distinct objects into 3 distinct places without any of them being in their original place.Therefore, the total number of ways to place the balls such that exactly 3 balls do not match the numbers of their boxes is binom{10}{3} times !3.Calculating this gives us binom{10}{3} times 2 = 120 times 2 = 240.Thus, the number of ways to place the balls such that exactly 3 balls do not match the numbers of their boxes is boxed{240}."},{"problem":"Solve the following equations:  2x + 62 = 248;           x - 12.7 = 2.7;          x ÷ 5 = 0.16;            7x + 2x = 6.3.","solution":"Solution: Solve:  (1) 2x + 62 = 248       2x = 248 - 62       2x = 186       x = 186 ÷ 2       x = 93;  So, x = boxed{93}.

At one meal, Karlson can eat no more than 5 kg of jam. If he opens a new jar of jam, he must eat it completely during this meal. (Karlson will not open a new jar if he has to eat more than 5 kg of jam together with what he has just eaten.)Little Boy has several jars of raspberry jam weighing a total of 50 kg, each weighing no more than 1 kg. In the least number of meals, how many meals will Karlson definitely be able to eat all the jam?","solution":"Answer: 12.Solution. We will prove that in 12 meals, Karlson will always be able to eat all the jam.We will distribute the jars into piles according to the following algorithm. In each pile (starting with the first, then the second, and so on), we will place jars one by one until the pile contains more than 5 kg of jam. The last jar we place in the pile will be called the extra jar. Since Little has 50 kg of jam, there will be no more than 10 such piles.Obviously, if we remove the extra jar from a pile, Karlson will be able to eat all the remaining jam in one meal. That is, Karlson will eat all the jam except the extra jars in 10 meals. And he will spend no more than 2 meals on the extra jars, as there are no more than 10 of them, and each weighs no more than 1 kg.Now we will show that Karlson will not always be able to eat all the jam in 11 meals. Suppose there are a total of 5 cdot 11 + 1 = 56 jars, and each contains frac{25}{28} kg of jam. If Karlson managed to eat all of this in 11 meals, then by the pigeonhole principle, there would be a meal during which he ate at least 6 jars of jam. But 6 cdot frac{25}{28} = frac{150}{28} > 5, a contradiction.Another construction example. We will demonstrate that Karlson will be able to eat at least frac{25}{6} kg of jam in one meal if there is at least that much jam left.First, we will select jars one by one until we accumulate more than frac{25}{6} kg of jam. Then we will start returning the selected jars one by one so that the total remains at least frac{25}{6} kg of jam.Suppose we can no longer return any of the selected jars, but the total amount of jam in them is still more than 5 kg. Clearly, then we have at least 6 jars, and the smallest of them contains no more than frac{1}{6} of the total mass of jam. We will select and return it; then there will be at least frac{5}{6} cdot 5 = frac{25}{6} kg of jam left. Contradiction. Therefore, Karlson can open and eat the remaining selected jars in one meal.Thus, Karlson will be able to eat at least frac{25}{6} kg of jam in one meal, except for the last time when he finishes the remaining. Then, obviously, in frac{50}{frac{25}{6}} = 12 meals, he will manage."},{"problem":"7.

Express the problem in terms of ( p ):   Let ( p = 2n + 1 ). Then ( n = frac{p-1}{2} ). We need to find ( p ) such that ( p ) divides ( (n!)^2 + 2^n ).2. Use Wilson's Theorem:   Wilson's Theorem states that for a prime ( p ), ((p-1)! equiv -1 pmod{p}). Since ( p = 2n + 1 ), we have:   [   (2n)! equiv -1 pmod{p}   ]   We need to relate this to ( (n!)^2 ).3. Relate ( (n!)^2 ) to ( (2n)! ):   Using the fact that ( (2n)! = (2n)(2n-1)cdots(n+1) cdot n! ), we can write:   [   (2n)! = (2n)(2n-1)cdots(n+1) cdot n!   ]   Since ( n = frac{p-1}{2} ), we have:   [   (2n)! = (p-1)! equiv -1 pmod{p}   ]   Therefore,   [   (n!)^2 equiv (-1)^n (2n)! pmod{p}   ]4. Simplify the congruence:   Since ( (2n)! equiv -1 pmod{p} ), we have:   [   (n!)^2 equiv (-1)^n (-1) pmod{p}   ]   [   (n!)^2 equiv (-1)^{n+1} pmod{p}   ]5. Consider the term ( 2^n ):   We need ( p ) to divide ( (n!)^2 + 2^n ). Thus,   [   (n!)^2 + 2^n equiv 0 pmod{p}   ]   Substituting the congruence for ( (n!)^2 ):   [   (-1)^{n+1} + 2^n equiv 0 pmod{p}   ]   [   2^n equiv (-1)^{n+1} pmod{p}   ]6. Analyze the powers of (-1):   We need to determine when ( 2^n equiv (-1)^{n+1} pmod{p} ). This depends on the parity of ( n ):   - If ( n ) is even, ( (-1)^{n+1} = -1 ).   - If ( n ) is odd, ( (-1)^{n+1} = 1 ).7. Use quadratic reciprocity:   We use the fact that ( 2^{frac{p-1}{2}} equiv left( frac{2}{p} right) pmod{p} ), where ( left( frac{2}{p} right) ) is the Legendre symbol. By quadratic reciprocity:   [   left( frac{2}{p} right) = (-1)^{frac{p^2-1}{8}}   ]   Thus,   [   2^{frac{p-1}{2}} equiv (-1)^{frac{p^2-1}{8}} pmod{p}   ]8. Determine ( p mod 8 ):   We need ( (-1)^{n+1} equiv 2^n pmod{p} ).

Define the set ( A ) as ( A = { k^{19} - k : 1 < k < 20, k in mathbb{N} } ). We need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in ( A ).2. Consider the expression ( k^{19} - k ). We know that for any integer ( k ), ( k^{19} - k ) can be factored as ( k(k^{18} - 1) ).3. We need to find the common divisors of ( k^{19} - k ) for ( k = 2, 3, ldots, 19 ). Notice that ( k^{19} - k ) is divisible by ( k ) and ( k^{18} - 1 ).4. By Fermat's Little Theorem, for any prime ( p ), ( k^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p} ) for all ( k ) not divisible by ( p ). This implies ( p mid k^{p-1} - 1 ).5. Therefore, if ( p ) divides ( k^{19} - k ), then ( p ) must divide ( k(k^{18} - 1) ). Since ( p ) is a prime, it must divide ( k^{18} - 1 ).6. For ( p ) to divide ( k^{18} - 1 ) for all ( k ) in the range ( 2 leq k leq 19 ), ( p-1 ) must be a divisor of 18 (since ( k^{18} equiv 1 pmod{p} )).7. The divisors of 18 are ( 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18 ). Therefore, ( p-1 ) can be ( 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18 ), which means ( p ) can be ( 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 19 ).8. However, since ( p ) must be a prime number, the possible values of ( p ) are ( 2, 3, 7, 19 ).9. The GCD of all elements in ( A ) must be the product of these primes, as they are the common prime factors of ( k^{19} - k ) for all ( k ) in the given range.10. Therefore, the GCD ( G ) is ( 2 times 3 times 7 times 19 = 798 ).The final answer is (boxed{798})."},{"problem":"2.2.1.

Similarly, the slope of line MB, k_2, is k_2 = frac{8}{y_2 + 4}.Given that these lines are angle bisectors, k_1 + k_2 = 0, which leads to y_1 + y_2 = -8.The slope of line AB, k, is k = frac{y_1 - y_2}{frac{y_1^2}{8} - frac{y_2^2}{8}} = frac{8}{y_1 + y_2} = -1.

These four problems are based on the same idea, which is as follows. Let P be any statement, and let A be any inhabitant of the island of knights and liars. Then if A makes the statement: \\"If I am a knight, then P,\\" he must be a knight, and the statement P must be true! This is hard to believe, and we will prove our surprising assertion in two ways.1) Suppose that A is a knight. Then the statement \\"If A is a knight, then P\\" must be true (since knights always tell the truth). Therefore, A is a knight, and it is true that if A is a knight, then P. From these two facts, we conclude that P must be true. Thus, taking as premises the assumption that A is a knight, we obtain as a conclusion the statement P. Thus (taking into account fact 4 about implication), we have proved that if A is a knight, then P. But this is precisely what A asserted! Therefore, A must be a knight. And since we have proved that if A is a knight, then P, we conclude that P must be true.2) Another way to convince ourselves of the truth of our assertion is as follows. Recall that from a false statement, any statement follows. Therefore, if A is not a knight, then the statement \\"If A is a knight, then P_{text {}}\\" automatically becomes true and, therefore, could not have been made by a liar. Thus, if someone, about whom it is known that he can be either a knight or a liar, makes such a statement, then he can only be a knight and the statement P must be true.Let us apply this principle to our problems. Let us start with problem 109. If we take as P the statement \\"B is a knight,\\" it is clear that A must be a knight, and his statement must be true. Therefore, B is a knight, and we get the answer: A and B are both knights.In problem 110, let us take as P the statement \\"A will have to eat his hat.\\" We see that A must be a knight and that he will have to eat his hat. (Thus, it is proved that although knights possess undeniable virtues and righteousness, they can nevertheless be somewhat foolish.)Answer to problem 111: A is a knight.The correct conclusion that can be drawn in problem 112: the author is again hoaxing the readers!

The coordinates of point P are (x_0, y_0) = (1, 1). Plugging these into the distance formula, we get: d = frac{|cos α + sin α - 2|}{sqrt{cos^2 α + sin^2 α}} Since cos^2 α + sin^2 α = 1 (by the Pythagorean identity), the distance simplifies to: d = | cos α + sin α - 2 | To maximize the distance, we analyze the term inside the absolute value: begin{align*}d &= | sqrt{2}sin(α + frac{π}{4}) - 2 | &= | sqrt{2}(sin α cos frac{π}{4} + cos α sin frac{π}{4}) - 2 | &= | sqrt{2}(frac{sqrt{2}}{2} sin α + frac{sqrt{2}}{2} cos α) - 2 | &= | sin α + cos α - 2 | &= | sqrt{2} sin(α + frac{π}{4}) - 2 |end{align*} Considering the range of the sine function is [-1, 1], the expression  sqrt{2} sin(α + frac{π}{4})  can vary between -sqrt{2} and sqrt{2}.

Solving for r, we get r = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}.3. Calculate the surface area of the sphere:Using the formula for the surface area of a sphere, 4pi r^2, we get 4pi left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)^2 = 3pi.Thus, the surface area of the circumscribed sphere is boxed{3pi}."},{"problem":"4.

According to the problem, we can set the equation of the parabola to be y^2 = 2px.  From the equation of the ellipse, we have F_1(-1, 0) and F_2(1, 0). Hence, p = 2 and the equation of curve C is y^2 = 4x.  The equation of line PQ can be set as x = my - 1 (m > 0). Substituting the equation of PQ into the equation of curve C, we get y^2 - 4my + 4 = 0.  Therefore, y_1 + y_2 = 4m and y_1y_2 = 4. Since overrightarrow{F_1P} = lambda overrightarrow{F_1Q}, we have x_1 + 1 = lambda(x_2 + 1) and y_1 = lambda y_2.  Also, left(frac{y_1 + y_2}{sqrt{y_1y_2}}right)^2 = lambda + frac{1}{lambda} + 2 = 4m^2. As lambda in [2,4], we have 2 + frac{1}{2} leq lambda + frac{1}{lambda} leq 4 + frac{1}{4}.

The base is an equilateral triangle with edge length a. The area of this triangle can be calculated (as in any triangle) via A_{G}=frac{1}{2} cdot a cdot h_{g}, where h_{g} is the length of a height in the triangle.Since the heights in an equilateral triangle coincide with the medians, such a height divides the equilateral triangle into two right triangles, where one of the legs of such a triangle is the height h_{g}, the second leg is half the base, and the hypotenuse is the uncut side of the triangle.By the Pythagorean theorem, we get h_{g}^{2}+left(frac{a}{2}right)^{2}=a^{2}, thus h_{g}=frac{sqrt{3}}{2} a and therefore A_{G}=frac{sqrt{3}}{4} a^{2}.For the height of the regular tetrahedron, note that it coincides with the corresponding median (the line connecting a vertex to the centroid of the opposite face). This results in a right triangle with the \\"apex of the tetrahedron\\", the \\"centroid of the base\\", and a vertex of the base as vertices.The hypotenuse of this right triangle is an edge of the regular tetrahedron, one leg is the height h, and the second leg is the segment of the median in the base between the centroid and the vertex.

Also, since these angles form an arithmetic progression, we can reason out that (a)+(a+3d)=(a+d)+(a+2d)=180.For the sake of simplicity, lets rename the angles of each similar triangle. Let angle ADB = angle CBD = alpha, angle DBA = angle DCB = beta, angle CDB = angle BAD = gamma.Now the four angles of ABCD are beta, alpha + beta, gamma, and alpha + gamma.As for the similar triangles, we can name their angles y, y+b, and y+2b. Therefore y+y+b+y+2b=180 and y+b=60. Because these 3 angles are each equal to one of alpha, beta, gamma, we know that one of these three angles is equal to 60 degrees.Now we we use trial and error. Let alpha = 60^{circ}. Then the angles of ABCD are beta, 60^{circ} + beta, gamma, and 60^{circ} + gamma. Since these four angles add up to 360, then beta + gamma= 120. If we list them in increasing value, we get beta, gamma, 60^{circ} + beta, 60^{circ} + gamma. Note that this is the only sequence that works because the common difference is less than 45.

Since AGTH is a rectangle, |HT| = x and |SH| = |SA| - |AH| = frac{a}{2} - r.

The equation of the parabola is y=-5(x+m)^2-3. This tells us the parabola is a vertical parabola that opens downwards because the coefficient of (x+m)^2 is negative (-5 < 0).2. The axis of symmetry for a parabola given by y=a(x-h)^2+k is x=h. For our parabola, comparing it to the standard form, we find that h=-m. Therefore, the axis of symmetry for our parabola is x=-m.3. Since the coefficient a=-5 is less than zero, the parabola opens downwards. This means that on either side of the axis of symmetry, the value of y first decreases as x moves away from the axis of symmetry, reaches a minimum at the vertex, and then increases as x continues to move away from the axis of symmetry. However, since the parabola opens downwards, the \\"increase\\" part does not apply to our scenario; instead, y decreases as x increases, especially to the right of the axis of symmetry.4. Given that y decreases as x increases for x geqslant 2, and considering the parabola's axis of symmetry is at x=-m, for y to decrease as x increases from x=2, the axis of symmetry must be to the left of or at x=2. This translates to -m leqslant 2.5. Solving the inequality -m leqslant 2 for m, we get m geqslant -2.Therefore, the range of values for m that satisfies the given condition is m geqslant -2.

The basic function log_2 x is monotonically increasing for all x > 0. However, it is negative for 0  1.2. When we take the absolute value of log_2 x, the function y = |log_2 x| will reflect the part of log_2 x that is negative (for 0 < x < 1) about the x-axis.3. This results in y = |log_2 x| being monotonically decreasing on the interval (0, 1] because as x increases from 0 to 1, the absolute log function is moving down from positive values towards 0.4. Once x reaches 1 and beyond, the function starts to increase, because the log function itself is positive and increasing.Knowing these properties, we can determine the interval on which y = |log_2 x| is monotonically decreasing.As per the condition given in the problem,y = |log_2 x|text{ is monotonically decreasing on }(0, a].Therefore, for the monotonic decrease to hold true, a must be within the interval where |log_2 x| is decreasing, which as we've established is (0, 1].Thus, we deduce that a must satisfy0 < a leq 1.So, the range of the real number a is (0, 1].[boxed{a in (0, 1]}]"},{"problem":"1.

So 1 must be alone and we have one of the solutions envisaged in H n+1 . If n + 1 is not alone, then if we remove it, we must have a solution for n. But that solution cannot be the n, 1, 2 to n - 1 solution. For we can easily check that none of the three boxes will then accomodate n + 1. So it must be the mod 3 solution. We can easily check that in this case n + 1 must go in the box with matching residue, which makes the (n + 1) solution the other solution envisaged by H n+1 . That completes the induction. My much more plodding solution (which I was quite pleased with until I saw the more elegant solution above) follows. It took about half-an-hour and shows the kind of kludge one is likely to come up with under time pressure in an exam! With a suitable labeling of the boxes as A, B, C, there are 4 cases to consider: Case 1: A contains 1; B contains 2; C contains 3 Case 2: A contains 1,2 Case 3: A contains 1, 3; B contains 2 Case 4: A contains 1; B contains 2, 3. We show that Cases 1 and 4 each yield just one possible arrangement and Cases 2 and 3 none. In Case 1, it is an easy induction that n must be placed in the same box as its residue (in other words numbers with residue 1 mod 3 go into A, numbers with residue 2 go into B, and numbers with residue 0 go into C). For (n + 1) + (n - 2) = n + (n - 1). Hence n + 1 must go in the same box as n - 2 (if they were in different boxes, then we would have two pairs from different pairs of boxes with the same sum). It is also clear that this is a possible arrangement. Given the sum of two numbers from different boxes, take its residue mod 3. A residue of 0 indicates that the third (unused) box was C, a residue of 1 indicates that the third box was A, and a residue of 2 indicates that the third box was B. Note that this unique arrangement gives 6 ways for the question, because there are 6 ways of arranging 1, 2 and 3 in the given boxes.In Case 2, let n be the smallest number not in box A. Suppose it is in box B. Let m be the smallest number in the third box, C. m - 1 cannot be in C. If it is in A, then m + (n - 1) = (m - 1) + n. Contradiction (m is in C, n - 1 is in A, so that pair identifies B as the third box, but m - 1 is in A and n is in B, identifying C). So m - 1 must be in B. But (m - 1) + 2 = m + 1. Contradiction. So Case 2 is not possible. In Case 3, let n be the smallest number in box C, so n - 1 must be in A or B. If n - 1 is in A, then (n - 1) + 2 = n + 2. Contradiction (a sum of numbers in A and B equals a sum from C and A). If n - 1 is in B, then (n - 1) + 3 = n + 2. Contradiction ( a sum from B and A equals a sum from C and B). So Case 3 is not possible. In Case 4, let n be the smallest number in box C. n - 1 cannot be in A, or (n - 1) + 2 = 3 + n (pair from A, B with same sum as pair from B, C), so n - 1 must be in B. Now n + 1 cannot be in A (or (n + 1) + 2 = 3 + n), or in B or C (or 1 + (n + 1) = 2 + n). So n + 1 cannot exist and hence n = 100. It is now an easy induction that all of 4, 5, ... 98 must be in B. For given that m is in B, if m + 1 were in A, we would have 100 + m = 99 + (m + 1). But this arrangement (1 in A, 2 - 99 in B, 100 in C) is certainly possible: sums 3 - 100 identify C as the third box, sum 101 identifies B as the third box, and sums 102-199 identify A as the third box. Finally, as in Case 1, this unique arrangement corresponds to 6 ways of arranging the cards in the given boxes. 41st IMO 2000 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 30 Aug 2000 Last corrected/updated 30 Aug 2000"},{"problem":"I2.3 If X=sqrt{(100)(102)(103)(105)+(Q-3)} is an integer and R is the units digit of X, find the value of R.I2.4 If S is the sum of the last 3 digits (hundreds, tens, units) of the product of the positive roots of sqrt{2012} cdot x^{log _{2012} x}=x^{R}, find the value of S.","solution":"Let y=102.5, thenbegin{aligned}& (100)(102)(103)(105)+(12-3) = & (y-2.5)(y-0.5)(y+0.5)(y+2.5)+9 = & left(y^{2}-6.25right)left(y^{2}-0.25right)+9end{aligned}begin{array}{l}=y^{4}-6.5 y^{2}+frac{25}{16}+9=y^{4}-6.5 y^{2}+frac{169}{16} =left(y^{2}-frac{13}{4}right)^{2}=left(102.5^{2}-frac{13}{4}right)^{2}=left(frac{205^{2}}{4}-frac{13}{4}right)^{2} X=frac{42025^{2}-13}{4}=10503end{array}R= the units digit of X=3Method 2 X=sqrt{(100)(102)(103)(105)+9}=sqrt{(100)(100+5)(100+2)(100+3)+9}=sqrt{left(100^{2}+500right)left(100^{2}+500+6right)+9}=sqrt{left(100^{2}+500right)^{2}+6left(100^{2}+500right)+9}=left(100^{2}+500right)+3R= the units digit of X=3begin{array}{l}log _{2012}left(sqrt{2012} cdot x^{log _{2012} x}right)=log _{2012} x^{3} frac{1}{2}+left(log _{2012} xright)^{2}=3 log _{2012} xend{array}Let y=log _{2012} x, then 2 y^{2}-6 y+1=0begin{array}{l}y=log _{2012} x=frac{3 pm sqrt{7}}{2} Rightarrow x=2012^{frac{3+sqrt{7}}{2}} text { or } 2012^{frac{3-sqrt{7}}{2}} =2012^{3} equiv 12^{3}(bmod 1000) =1728(bmod 1000) end{array}Product of positive roots =2012^{frac{3+sqrt{7}}{2}} times 2012^{frac{3-sqrt{7}}{2}}S= sum of the last 3 digits =7+2+8=17"},{"problem":"18.

Step 2: Let (f(2) - f(1) = 2k + 1). Choose (a) such that (2a + 2k + 1 = p), where (p) is an odd prime.6. Step 3: Consider:   [   f(a) + 4a + f(2) = u^2   ]   [   f(a) + 2a + f(1) = v^2   ]   We must have:   [   u = frac{p+1}{2}, quad v = frac{p-1}{2}   ]   Hence:   [   P(a, 2) implies f(a) + 4a + f(2) = left(frac{p+1}{2}right)^2 = (a + k + 1)^2   ]   [   implies f(a) = (a + (k-1))^2 + (k+1)^2 - (k-1)^2 - f(2)   ]   [   implies f(a) = (a + b)^2 + c   ]   where (b = k-1) and (c = (k+1)^2 - (k-1)^2 - f(2)).7.

(1) Find S_{n};  (2) Determine if there exists a constant lambda such that the sequence {S_{n}+lambda} forms a geometric sequence. If it exists, find the value of lambda; if not, explain the reason.","solution":" Step-by-Step Solution# Part (1): Find S_{n}Given the conditions:1. a_{2} + a_{3} + a_{4} = 392. 2(a_{3} + 6) = a_{2} + a_{4}From these, we can solve for a_{3} as follows:- From the second condition, we have 2a_{3} + 12 = a_{2} + a_{4}. Since a_{2} + a_{4} = 39 - a_{3} from the first condition, substituting gives 2a_{3} + 12 = 39 - a_{3}, leading to 3a_{3} = 27, so a_{3} = 9.Given a_{3} = 9, we find a_{2} + a_{4} = 30. Since a_{3} = a_{1}q^{2}, we have 9 = a_{1}q^{2}. Also, since a_{2} + a_{4} = a_{1}q + a_{1}q^{3} = a_{1}q(1 + q^{2}) = 30, and we know a_{3} = 9, we can solve for q:- 9(frac{1}{q} + q) = 30, which simplifies to frac{1}{q} + q = frac{10}{3}. Solving this equation gives q = 3 or q = frac{1}{3}. Since q > 1, we choose q = 3.Therefore, a_{1} = frac{a_{3}}{q^{2}} = frac{9}{9} = 1.The sum of the first n terms, S_{n}, is given by:S_{n} = frac{a_{1}(q^{n} - 1)}{q - 1} = frac{1 times (3^{n} - 1)}{3 - 1} = frac{3^{n} - 1}{2}Hence, the sum of the first n terms is boxed{S_{n} = frac{3^{n} - 1}{2}}.# Part (2): Determine if there exists a constant lambdaFrom part (1), we have S_{n} = frac{3^{n} - 1}{2}. Assume there exists a constant lambda such that {S_{n} + lambda} forms a geometric sequence. Then, we must have:(S_{2} + lambda)^{2} = (S_{1} + lambda)(S_{3} + lambda)Substituting the values of S_{n}, we get:(4 + lambda)^{2} = (1 + lambda)(13 + lambda)Solving this equation for lambda gives lambda = frac{1}{2}.Therefore, S_{n} + frac{1}{2} = frac{3^{n}}{2}, and the ratio between consecutive terms is:frac{S_{n+1} + frac{1}{2}}{S_{n} + frac{1}{2}} = frac{frac{1}{2} times 3^{n+1}}{frac{1}{2} times 3^{n}} = 3Thus, the sequence left{S_{n} + frac{1}{2}right} forms a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 3.Hence, there exists boxed{lambda = frac{1}{2}} such that the sequence {S_{n} + lambda} forms a geometric sequence."},{"problem":"Given that x^{3}-x^{2}-7x+t has a factor of x+1, then t= ?A: 1B: -1C: 5D: -5","solution":"Since x^{3}-x^{2}-7x+t has a factor of x+1, let x^{3}-x^{2}-7x+t=(x+1)(x^{2}+ax+b).Expanding (x+1)(x^{2}+ax+b) gives x^{3}+ax^{2}+bx+x^{2}+ax+b=x^{3}+(a+1)x^{2}+(b+a)x+b.Comparing coefficients, we get a+1=-1, b+a=-7, and b=t.Solving these equations, we find a=-2, b=-5, and t=-5.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{text{D}}.This problem tests the understanding of factorization, with the key step being to set x^{3}-x^{2}-7x+t=(x+1)(x^{2}+ax+b) based on the given information."},{"problem":"When the line with equation y=-2 x+7 is reflected across the line with equation x=3, the equation of the resulting line is y=a x+b.

It is obvious that the base N of the square number N^{2} is a three-digit number, so N can be written in the form N=A cdot 10^{2}+B cdot 10+C, where A, B, C are the digits of N. Thus, its square isN^{2}=A^{2} cdot 10^{4}+2 A B cdot 10^{3}+left(2 A C+B^{2}right) 10^{2}+2 B C cdot 10+C^{2}Due to the second digit of N^{2}, A^{2}<3, so A=1. The fourth, fifth digit's place value is 10, for which only the 2 B C cdot 10 and C^{2} terms have an influence. Among them, the first is divisible by 20, so the tens place of C^{2} must be odd. Among the squares of the digits, only C=4 and C=6 are such. In both cases, the units digit is 6, so the last digit of N^{2} is 6.For C=4, the value of the last two terms is 80 B+16 and this is of the form 100 k+56, where k is an integer. From this, 80 B=100 k+40, simplifying to 8 B=10 k+4, and since only 3 cdot 8 and 8 cdot 8 end in 4 in the multiplication table of 8, B=3 or 8. Thus, N=134 or 184. However, in their squares, the first digit is 1 or 3, so they do not match.For C=6, similarly from 120 B+36=100 k+56 we get 12 B=10 k+2, so B=1 or 6, hence N=116 or 166.

Some elements of the following solution can only be found in the solution of László Pázmándi (Budapest, József A. High School II. grade).II. solution. Based on the given digits, the sought square number N^{2} is 20050 leq N^{2}<30000, so for its positive square root 142 leq N leq 173.The place value of the fourth digit is 10, so it belongs to the \\"two-digit ending\\" of N^{2}, or the number written with its last two digits, which is in a simple relationship with the two-digit ending of the base N as follows. In the following, we will ignore numbers of the form N=5 k because the ending of N^{2} is 00 or 25, so its tens digit is not 5.The two-digit ending of the squares of integers a and b is equal if and only if the difference a^{2}-b^{2} ends in 00, i.e., a^{2}-b^{2}=(a-b)(a+b)=100 k=2^{2} cdot 5^{2} k. Thus, both factors a-b and a+b must be even, because the sum and difference of two integers have the same parity - either both are even or both are odd - now, however, one of them must be even. The product's two 5 factors can only come from one of the factors, because the opposite assumption, that both factors are divisible by 5, leads to a-b=10 m, a+b=10 n and consequently a=5(m+n), which leads to the excluded case. Therefore, either a-b or a+b is divisible by 50. From a-b=50 p we get a=b+50 p, or the two-digit endings of squares repeat every 50 on the integers, and from a+b=50 r we get (a+b) / 2=25 r, or the two-digit endings of squares of numbers that are \\"mirrored\\" about a multiple of 25 are the same, i.e., if a=25 r+s, then b=25 r-s.Accordingly, for example, from the squares of the integers from 1 to 24, not divisible by 5, we can get every two-digit ending different from 00 and 25. Among them, only one has a tens digit of 5, which is the two-digit ending 56 from 16^{2}. This two-digit ending is also given by every base ending in 16+50=66, 50-16=34, and 100-16=84.Accordingly, among the limits of N, 142 and 173, only N=166 can match, and since we have no further data (constraint) on it, it must match."},{"problem":"In a community, there are 600 households, among which there are 150 high-income families, 360 middle-income families, and 90 low-income families.

Project the resulting regions perpendicularly onto a line f that is perpendicular to e. Prove that the ratio of the projection segments cannot be greater than (1+sqrt{2})!","solution":"Let's prove the statement for an arbitrary convex planar domain K instead of a polygon.Let the line e intersect K at points A and B, and divide K into two equal-area parts K_{1} and K_{2}. Clearly, K_{1} and K_{2} are convex.# 1987-03-111-1.eps Let C^{*} and D^{*} be points on the perimeter of K_{1} and K_{2}, respectively, such that their orthogonal projections onto the line f are points C and D, and the segment CD forms the projection of K onto the line f. If the orthogonal projection of points A and B onto the line f (due to the perpendicularity of e and f) is denoted by E, then it suffices to show that C E: E D leqq 1+sqrt{2}, because by the symmetry of points C and D, it follows that D E: E C leqq 1+sqrt{2} as well.Since K_{1} is convex, the triangle A B C^{*} is a part of K_{1}, and thus its area is at most the area of K_{1}.Due to the orthogonal projection, the line D D^{*} is parallel to e. Let the intersection points of the line D D^{*} with the lines C^{*} A and C^{*} B be F and G, respectively. We will show that the trapezoid A F G B contains the domain K_{2}. Since K_{2} is convex, it lies entirely on the side of the line e that contains D^{*}. Suppose there is a point P in K_{2} that is not in the trapezoid A F G B! Then, due to the convexity of K, the segment C^{*} P lies entirely within K, and thus its intersection point Q with the line e is also in K. However, from our assumption, it follows that the point Q is not on the segment A B. This is a contradiction because the convex domain is intersected by the line e at a segment, and in our case, A and B were the endpoints of this segment. Therefore, the trapezoid A F G B indeed contains the domain K_{2}, and thus its area is at most the area of the trapezoid.Since K_{1} and K_{2} have equal areas, the area of the triangle C^{*} A B is at most the area of the trapezoid A F G B. In other words, the area of the triangle C^{*} A B is at most half the area of the similar triangle C^{*} F G. This means that the height of the triangle C^{*} A B corresponding to the side A B (which is equal to the segment C E) is at most frac{sqrt{2}}{2} of the height of the triangle C^{*} F G corresponding to the side F G (which is equal to the segment C D).

It is clear from the proof that if the domain K coincides with the triangle C^{*} F G, then the ratio of the projection segments is exactly 1 + sqrt{2}, so the statement of the problem cannot be improved further."},{"problem":"In any finite grid of squares, some shaded and some not, for each unshaded square, record the number of shaded squares horizontally or vertically adjacent to it; this grid's [i]score[/i] is the sum of all numbers recorded this way. Deyuan shades each square in a blank  ntimes n grid with probability k; he notices that the expected value of the score of the resulting grid is equal to k, too! Given that k > 0.9999, find the minimum possible value of n.[i]Proposed by Andrew Wu[/i]","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the minimum value of ( n ) such that the expected score of an ( n times n ) grid, where each square is shaded with probability ( k ) and ( k > 0.9999 ), is equal to ( k ).2. Score Calculation:   The score of the grid is defined as the sum of the number of shaded squares horizontally or vertically adjacent to each unshaded square. This can be interpreted as the number of pairs of adjacent squares with opposite colors.3. Expected Score Calculation:   The expected score of the grid is the expected number of pairs of adjacent squares with opposite colors. By the Linearity of Expectation, we can calculate this as follows:   - There are ( 2n(n-1) ) pairs of adjacent squares in an ( n times n ) grid (considering both horizontal and vertical pairs).   - Each pair can be either (shaded, unshaded) or (unshaded, shaded), giving us 2 ways.   - The probability of a pair being (shaded, unshaded) is ( k(1-k) ).   Therefore, the expected score ( E ) is:   [   E = 2n(n-1) cdot 2 cdot k(1-k)   ]4. Setting Up the Equation:   Given that the expected score is equal to ( k ), we have:   [   4n(n-1)k(1-k) = k   ]5. Simplifying the Equation:   Dividing both sides by ( k ) (since ( k > 0 )):   [   4n(n-1)(1-k) = 1   ]6. Substituting ( k ):   Given ( k > 0.9999 ), we substitute ( k = frac{9999}{10000} ):   [   4n(n-1)left(1 - frac{9999}{10000}right) = 1   ]   Simplifying inside the parentheses:   [   4n(n-1) cdot frac{1}{10000} = 1   ]7. Solving for ( n ):   [   4n(n-1) = 10000   ]   Solving this quadratic equation:   [   n(n-1) = 2500   ]   [   n^2 - n - 2500 = 0   ]8.

What are the possible values of n? Solution","solution":": n = 7. It is a nice question whether one has to show that n = 7 is a solution! [Does the question give as a fact that there exists a solution?] Clearly, there are no other possible solutions. Suppose the n-gon has side 1. Then A 1 A 3 and A 1 A 4 are obviously strictly increasing functions of n. So 1/A 1 A 3 + 1/A 1 A 4 is a strictly decreasing function of n, whereas 1/A 1 A 2 is always 1. So there can be at most one solution. Moreover, for n = 6, the lhs is 1/√3 + 1/2 > 1, whereas for n = 8, 1/√(2 + √2) + (2 - 1) < 1. So if there is a solution it is 7. If we are not allowed to assume that there is a solution, then we have to prove equality for n = 7. A kludgy (but easy) proof is as follows. A 1 A 3 = 2 cos π/7, A 1 A 4 = (1 + 2 cos 2π/7). Put c = cos π/7. The cos 2π/7 = 2c 2 - 1. So the result is true if 8c 3 - 4c 2 - 4c + 1 = 0. Put s = sin π/7. Then (c + is) 7 = - 1. Expanding and comparing real parts, we get: c 7 - 21c 5 (1 - c 2 ) + 35c 3 (1 - c 2 ) 2 - 7c(1 - c 2 ) 3 + 1 = 0, or 64c 7 - 112c 5 + 56c 3 - 7c + 1 = 0. But we know that c = -1 is a solution (not the one we want), so we can factor that out to get: 64c 6 - 64c 5 - 48c 4 + 48c 3 + 8c 2 - 8c + 1 = 0. But we know that this has three repeated roots (cos π/7 = cos (-π/7) etc), so it should factorize as the square of a cubic and indeed it does: (8c 3 - 4c 2 - 4c + 1) 2 = 0, so 8c 3 - 4c 2 - 4c + 1 = 0 as required. 2nd BMO 1966 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 30 Aug 2000"},{"problem":"A factory took out a loan of a million yuan at the beginning of this year, with an annual interest rate of r (calculated using compound interest).

Choose 8 points from the 24 points such that the arc length between any two points is not equal to 3 or 8. How many different ways are there to choose such a group of 8 points? Explain your reasoning.","solution":"Solution 1: Number the 24 points as 1,2, cdots, 24, and arrange them in a 3 times 8 number table according to the \\"bad relationship\\" as follows:begin{array}{l}1,4,7,10,13,16,19,22, 9,12,15,18,21,24,3,6, 17,20,23,2,5,8,11,14end{array}It is easy to see that the arc length between any two adjacent numbers in each row is 3, and the arc length between any two adjacent numbers in each column is 8 (the first and last numbers are also considered adjacent). This way, the requirement in the problem for selecting 8 points is transformed into selecting 8 numbers in the table such that no two numbers are adjacent. Therefore, exactly one number is selected from each column, and at most 4 non-adjacent numbers are selected from each row. Thus, the number of different ways to select numbers from the 3 rows are:{4,4,0},{4,3,1},{4,2,2},{3,3,2}(1) {4,4,0}. Choose one row from the 3 rows to not select any number, which has 3 different ways. From the other two rows, select 4 non-adjacent numbers from the first row, which has 2 different ways. The remaining 4 columns are uniquely determined for the 4 numbers to be selected from the other row. By the multiplication principle, there are 6 different ways in this case.(2) {4,3,1}. Choose 4, 3, and 1 numbers from the 3 rows, which has 3!=6 different arrangements. Select 4 non-adjacent numbers from one row, which has 2 different ways. Select 1 number from the remaining 4 columns in another row, which has 4 different ways. Finally, select 1 number from the remaining 3 columns in the last row, which is uniquely determined. By the multiplication principle, there are 6 times 2 times 4=48 different ways in this case.(3) {4,2,2}. Select one row from the 3 rows to select 4 non-adjacent numbers, which has 3 different ways to choose the row and 2 different ways to select the numbers, totaling 6 different ways. The remaining 4 columns are non-adjacent. Select 2 columns from the 4 columns in the second row, which has mathrm{C}_{4}^{2}=6 different ways. By the multiplication principle, there are 6 times 6=36 different ways in this case.(4) {3,3,2}. Select one row from the 3 rows to select 2 non-adjacent numbers, which has 3 different ways to choose the row and mathrm{C}_{7}^{2}-1=20 different ways to select the numbers (subtracting 1 to exclude the case where the two numbers are in the 1st and 8th columns).After selecting the two numbers, the remaining 6 columns are divided into two parts, with 3 different segment scenarios: {1,5},{2,4}, and {3,3}. The number of different segment scenarios are 8, 8, and 4, respectively. It is easy to see that:i. For the {1,5} segment, selecting 3 non-adjacent columns has 2 different ways.ii. For the {2,4} segment, selecting 3 non-adjacent columns has 4 different ways.iii. For the {3,3} segment, selecting 3 non-adjacent columns has 2 different ways.So the number of different ways in this case is3 times{8 times 2+8 times 4+4 times 2}=168In summary, the number of different ways to satisfy the problem's requirements is6+48+36+168=258Solution 2: As in Solution 1, write the 24 numbers in a 3 times 8 number table. Thus, when selecting 8 numbers, exactly one number is selected from each column. At this point, selecting 1 number from the 1st column has 3 different ways. After selecting the 1st column, the number selected from the 2nd column cannot be in the same row as the number selected from the 1st column, so there are 2 different ways. Each subsequent column also has 2 different ways, resulting in a total of 3 times 2^{7} different ways. However, all the ways where the number selected from the 1st column and the number selected from the 8th column are in the same row do not meet the requirements.If we denote the number of different ways to select one number from each column of a 3 times n number table such that no two adjacent columns (including the n-th column and the 1st column) have numbers in the same row as x_{n}, then the above conclusion isx_{8}+x_{7}=3 times 2^{7}Similarly, we can getx_{n}+x_{n-1}=3 times 2^{n-1}By recursion, we getbegin{aligned}x_{8}= & 3 times 2^{7}-x_{7}= & 3 times 2^{7}-left(3 times 2^{6}-x_{6}right)= & 3 timesleft(2^{7}-2^{6}right)+x_{6}=cdots= & 3 timesleft(2^{7}-2^{6}+2^{5}-2^{4}+2^{3}-2^{2}+2right)= & 3 times 86=258end{aligned}Thus, the number of different ways to satisfy the problem's requirements is 258."},{"problem":"Example 6 (1997 National High School League Question) If three lines a, b, and c in space are pairwise skew lines, then the number of lines that intersect a, b, and c is ( ).A. 0 linesB. 1 lineC.

This is not necessarily true because if two lines are parallel, it doesn't imply that one line is parallel to a plane containing the other. A line parallel to another can either lie within the same plane or be outside the plane, not necessarily maintaining a parallel relationship with the plane. Hence, statement A is false.B: The proposition claims that if a line a is parallel to a plane alpha, then a is parallel to any line inside alpha. This assertion is incorrect because a line parallel to a plane could be skew to lines within the plane; that is, it neither intersects nor is parallel to those lines. Therefore, statement B is false.C: The claim here is that if both lines a and b are parallel to plane alpha, then a is parallel to b. This isn't always true because when two lines are parallel to the same plane, they can have three different relationships: they might be parallel to each other, they might intersect (if they lie in a plane parallel to alpha), or they could be skew lines (not in the same plane and not intersecting). Thus, statement C is false.D: Finally, this proposition states that if line a is parallel to plane alpha, and line b is inside plane alpha, then a is parallel to b or a and b are skew lines. This statement is true because a line parallel to a plane cannot intersect a line within that plane. Therefore, the lines a and b are either parallel (if b is also parallel to alpha) or skew (if b is not parallel to alpha and thus lies in alpha).Therefore, after analyzing each proposition, we conclude that the correct answer is:boxed{D}"},{"problem":"Example 7 Let S={1,2, cdots, 98}.

Identify the principle of conservation of energy: In a frictionless system, the total mechanical energy (sum of kinetic and potential energy) remains constant. This principle can be expressed as:   [   E_{text{total}} = KE + PE = text{constant}   ]   where ( KE ) is the kinetic energy and ( PE ) is the potential energy.2. Express kinetic and potential energy:   - Kinetic energy (( KE )) is given by:     [     KE = frac{1}{2}mv^2     ]     where ( m ) is the mass of the cart and ( v ) is its velocity.   - Potential energy (( PE )) is given by:     [     PE = mgh     ]     where ( m ) is the mass of the cart, ( g ) is the acceleration due to gravity, and ( h ) is the height above a reference point.3. Analyze the relationship between kinetic and potential energy: Since the total energy is conserved, an increase in kinetic energy must correspond to a decrease in potential energy, and vice versa. Therefore, the velocity of the cart is maximized when its kinetic energy is maximized, which occurs when its potential energy is minimized.4. Determine the point of minimum potential energy: The potential energy is minimized when the height ( h ) is minimized. By examining the diagram, point ( C ) is the lowest point on the track.5.

We can also arrive at the result through pure reasoning as follows:The third one fired 26 fewer shots than the total of the first two, but together with the second, they fired 38 more. The number of shots fired by the second one makes up for the 26 shortage and the 38 excess, meaning the middle one fired 26+38=64 shots.However, according to the third condition of the problem, the first and third together fired (64+24), that is, all three together fired 64+24+64= 152 shots. If we subtract 26 from this (152-26=126), and imagine that we subtracted it from the number of shots fired by the first two, then—since according to the first part of the problem, the number of shots fired by the first two, reduced by 26, equals the number of shots fired by the third—we essentially obtained twice the number of shots fired by the third.

The equation of line l is given by mx-y-3m+4=0. This line passes through a fixed point M(3,4).2.

Calculate OM using the distance formula: OM = sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = sqrt{9 + 16} = sqrt{25} = 5.5.

From this, we have beta=97 / 56 and delta=-1 / 56, which contradicts the hypothesis that delta geq 0 (alternatively, it is not possible that beta+delta<beta-delta).(b) If beta=7 / 4, then delta^{2}=1 / 4. Therefore, the roots of the polynomial are (3 / 2,7 / 4,2), and we obtainp(x)=(x-3 / 2)(x-7 / 4)(x-2)=x^{3}-frac{21}{4} x^{2}+frac{73}{8} x-frac{21}{4}(c) If beta+delta=7 / 4, then beta-delta=12 / 7. From this, we have beta=97 / 56 and delta=1 / 56. Therefore, the roots of the polynomial are (12 / 7,97 / 56,7 / 4), and we obtainp(x)=(x-12 / 7)(x-97 / 56)(x-7 / 4)=x^{3}-frac{291}{56} x^{2}+frac{14113}{1568} x-frac{291}{56}"},{"problem":"The value of arctan sqrt {3}-arcsin (- frac {1}{2})+arccos 0 is ( )A: frac {5π}{6}B: πC: 0D: - frac {π}{3}","solution":"According to the definition of inverse trigonometric functions, we have arctan sqrt {3}= frac {π}{3}, arcsin (- frac {1}{2})=- frac {π}{6}, and arccos 0= frac {π}{2}.Therefore, arctan sqrt {3}-arcsin (- frac {1}{2})+arccos 0= frac {π}{3}+ frac {π}{6}+ frac {π}{2}=π.Hence, the answer is boxed{B}.By the definition of inverse trigonometric functions, we have arctan sqrt {3}= frac {π}{3}, arcsin (- frac {1}{2})=- frac {π}{6}, and arccos 0= frac {π}{2}.

Case 2: ( n ) is odd.   - If ( n ) is odd and perfect, it must be square-free and of the form ( n = p_1 p_2 cdots p_k ) where ( p_i ) are distinct primes.   - The sum of divisors function (sigma(n)) for odd ( n ) is:     [     sigma(n) = (1 + p_1)(1 + p_2) cdots (1 + p_k)     ]   - Since ( n ) is perfect:     [     sigma(n) = 2n     ]   - Comparing both sides:     [     (1 + p_1)(1 + p_2) cdots (1 + p_k) = 2p_1 p_2 cdots p_k     ]   - Taking the 2-adic valuation ( v_2 ) on both sides:     [     v_2((1 + p_1)(1 + p_2) cdots (1 + p_k)) = v_2(2p_1 p_2 cdots p_k) = 1     ]   - Since ( p_i ) are odd primes, ( 1 + p_i ) is even, and ( v_2(1 + p_i) = 1 ).

Identify the problem constraints and goal:   - We need to find the maximum number of subsets of ( S = {1, 2, ldots, 2n} ) such that no subset is contained in another and no two subsets cover the whole set ( S ).2. Propose a candidate solution:   - The proposed solution is that the maximum number of such subsets is ( binom{2n}{n-1} ). This is achieved by considering all subsets of size ( n-1 ).3. Verify the candidate solution:   - Assume that our collection ( C ) contains a subset of size ( s ) with ( s > n ). Choose the maximal such ( s ). Let ( C ) contain ( m ) sets of size ( s ).   - Each ( s )-set has ( s ) subsets of size ( s-1 ), and each ( (s-1) )-subset is counted at most ( 2n-s+1 < s ) times.   - Replace the ( s )-sets with their ( (s-1) )-subsets, enlarging ( C ). Thus, all subsets in ( S ) have size at most ( n ).4. Consider subsets of size less than ( n-1 ):   - If ( C ) contains an ( s )-set with ( s < n-1 ), choose the minimal such ( s ). If ( S ) contains ( m ) ( s )-sets, replace them with their ( (s+1) )-oversets.   - This enlarges ( C ), and the new ( C ) still satisfies the properties.5. Achieve a collection with only ( n )-sets and ( (n-1) )-sets:   - Let ( C ) contain ( x ) ( n )-sets and ( y ) ( (n-1) )-sets. Assume ( x + y > binom{2n}{n-1} ).6. Use a probabilistic argument:   - Place the elements of ( S ) around a circle at random. Consider the sets from ( C ) formed by an arc of ( n ) or ( n-1 ) consecutive elements on the circle.   - Calculate the expected number of such sets:     [     mathbb{E}(a) = 2n cdot frac{x}{binom{2n}{n}} = frac{2n^2}{n+1} cdot frac{x}{binom{2n}{n-1}}     ]     [     mathbb{E}(b) = 2n cdot frac{y}{binom{2n}{n-1}}     ]     [     mathbb{E}((n+1)a + nb) = 2n^2 frac{x+y}{binom{2n}{n-1}} > 2n^2     ]7. Derive a contradiction:   - There exists a circular order of ( S ) such that ( (n+1)a + nb > 2n^2 ).   - If ( a = 0 ), then ( b > 2n ), which is absurd.   - Since ( a leq n ) (as ( C ) cannot contain two complement arcs of size ( n )), we get ( n(a+b) > 2n^2 - a geq 2n^2 - n ), thus ( a + b geq 2n ).   - For any ( n )-arc in ( C ), its initial segment of size ( n-1 ) does not belong to ( C ). This gives ( a ) distinct ( (n-1) )-arcs not in ( C ).   - Similarly, we get ( a ) distinct final segments also not in ( C ). Since ( b = 2n - a ), this is possible only if the final segments and initial segments are the same ( a ) arcs.   - This implies that if an arc belongs to ( C ), its shift by 1 also belongs to ( C ), leading to all ( n )-arcs belonging to ( C ), which is absurd.8.

To find the least possible value for n, we need to find a fraction frac{m}{n} that lies within this interval and has the smallest possible denominator n.3.

Let ( a = b^2 ) and ( a + p = c^2 ) for some integers ( b ) and ( c ). Then:[c^2 - b^2 = p implies (c - b)(c + b) = p]Since ( p ) is a prime, the only factor pairs are ( (1, p) ) and ( (p, 1) ).

Let the number covered by the top left corner of the tile be denoted as z.

Notice that the numbers in each column give the same remainder when divided by eleven. The last three columns from the left (the first three from the right) thus contain numbers that give remainders of 9, 10, and 0 when divided by eleven; these are the numbers 9, 10, 11 (first row), 20, 21, 22 (second row), and so on up to 86, 87, 88 (eighth row).With this preparation, we can calculate the sum of the numbers that the tile will cover.

Then the area of the triangle is r frac{a+b+c}{2}, and from the condition of the problem:r=frac{a+b-c}{2}follows. If the vertices of the triangle are denoted by A, B, C in the usual way, and the points of tangency of the inscribed circle on the sides are D, E, and F, then C D=C E=frac{a+b-c}{2}. (A proof of this can be found, for example, in Kiss Gy.: What is Good to Know About Triangles, KöMaL, 2002/3 issue, pp. 130-139.)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_bbe8ded23f565b726f87g-1.jpg?height=288&width=499&top_left_y=539&top_left_x=802)The quadrilateral O D C E is thus a rhombus, because each of its sides is frac{a+b-c}{2} long, and it has two right angles, because the tangent to the circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. Therefore, O D C E is a square, which means that the angle at C in the triangle A B C is a right angle.This is also the largest angle of the triangle, so the sought angle is 90^{circ}.II. solution. According to Heron's formula, the area of the triangle is:frac{1}{4} sqrt{(a+b+c)(a+b-c)(a-b+c)(b+c-a)}Thus, in our case,sqrt{(a+b+c)(a+b-c)(a-b+c)(b+c-a)}=(a+b+c)(a+b-c)From this, squaring and dividing by (a+b+c)(a+b-c), we get that(a-b+c)(b+c-a)=(a+b+c)(a+b-c)Rearranging this, we get c^{2}-(a-b)^{2}=(a+b)^{2}-c^{2}, and solving for c^{2}, we find that c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}.According to the converse of the Pythagorean theorem, this means that the angle opposite the side c of the triangle is a right angle.

Therefore, 1 + a = 2.Solving this equation, we find that a = 2 - 1 = 1.Now that we have the value of a, the binomial becomes (x+ frac{1}{x})(2x- frac{1}{x})^{5}, and we need to find the constant term.The constant term in the expansion of a binomial expression (A+B)^n will come from the term where the powers of x cancel out. In this case, we need to consider terms from (2x- frac{1}{x})^{5} that, when multiplied by x or frac{1}{x}, will yield a power of x^0 (which is 1).To find the constant term from the binomial (2x- frac{1}{x})^{5}, we should look at the general term of the binomial expansion (2x- frac{1}{x})^{n}:T_{k+1} = binom{n}{k}(2x)^{n-k}left(-frac{1}{x}right)^{k}.For n=5, the powers of x cancel out, i.e., x^{5-k-k}=x^0, when k=3. Therefore, substituting k=3 and n=5 into T_{k+1}, we get:T_{4} = binom{5}{3}(2x)^{2}left(-frac{1}{x}right)^{3} = 10 cdot 4x^2 cdot -frac{1}{x^3}.The constant term is therefore:T_{4}^{text{const}} = 10 cdot 4 cdot -1 = -40.However, this is not the final answer yet. We need to remember that the original problem had (x+frac{1}{x}) as a factor as well. The term that we just found must be multiplied by the constant term from (x+frac{1}{x}), which is 2 (1 from x and 1 from frac{1}{x}). Thus, we have:text{Constant term} = -40 cdot 2 = -80.But upon reviewing, we realize that the final constant term cannot be negative since the magnitude of the coefficient in the term x(2x-1/x)^5 is always positive. Therefore, the calculation must be revisited. Also, the term from (2x- frac{1}{x})^{5} that we're interested in would yield a positive constant when x is multiplied by (2x- frac{1}{x})^{5}.So, let's find the correct constant term without including the -1 factor from the previous step:T_{4}^{text{const}} = 10 cdot 4 = 40.This time, multiplying by the constant term from (x+frac{1}{x}) gives us:text{Constant term} = 40 cdot 2 = 80.But this is too high, indicating a mistake in our calculation. The correct approach to find the constant term T_k in the expansion (x+frac{1}{x})(2x- frac{1}{x})^{5} when a=1 involves choosing terms in the expansion of (2x- frac{1}{x})^{5} that, when multiplied by x or frac{1}{x} from the other factor, result in no remaining x factors. Thus, we have to look at the terms in the expansion of (2x- frac{1}{x})^{5} which contain x^3 and x^2 respectively, as those will be the ones to cancel out with the x and frac{1}{x} in the other factor.The term in the expansion of (2x- frac{1}{x})^{5} that contains x^3 will come from taking three factors of -frac{1}{x} and two factors of 2x, which corresponds with the term given by C_5^3(2x)^2(-frac{1}{x})^3. Simplifying, we get 10 cdot 4 cdot (-1)^3 = -40.The term in the expansion of (2x-frac{1}{x})^{5} that contains x^2 comes from taking two factors of -frac{1}{x} and three factors of 2x, corresponding with the term given by C_5^2 (2x)^3 (-frac{1}{x})^2. Simplifying, we get 10 cdot 8 cdot (-1)^2 = 80.Hence the constant term is the sum of these two parts:text{Constant term} = -40 + 80 = 40.Therefore, the correct answer for the constant term in the expansion is boxed{40} (which corresponds with option D)."},{"problem":"The sequence {a_{n}} satisfies frac{1}{{3{a_1}}}+frac{1}{{5{a_2}}}+frac{1}{{7{a_3}}}+⋯+frac{1}{{(2n+1){a_n}}}=frac{n}{{2n+1}}.

Substituting the magnitudes of the vectors:Considering the magnitudes |overrightarrow{a}|=3, |overrightarrow{b}|=|overrightarrow{c}|=2, we can replace the squared magnitudes into the equation:9 + 2overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} + 4 = 43. Solving for overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b}:We notice a mistake in the transcription of the solution. To correct and proceed, we actually aim to simplify the equation correctly:The correct step should be recognizing that overrightarrow{c}^2 = 4, thus:9 + 2overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} + 4 = 4The equation above is incorrect as per the original solution's logic; it should instead directly follow from the given magnitudes. Let's correct this oversight and head directly to the calculation of overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} using the correct approach:From the provided magnitudes, we should have:9 + 2overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} + 4 = 4This doesn't logically follow as it seems to incorrectly simplify the given magnitudes. The correct interpretation of the magnitudes leading to the calculation of overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} was mistakenly represented. The equation derived from squaring both sides should be correctly approached by acknowledging the actual equality established by the squared magnitudes, which leads to identifying the error in the simplification process. Given the mistake in the transcription and the logical flow, let's directly use the correct outcome from the relationships between the vectors' dot products and their magnitudes:Given |overrightarrow{a}|^2 = 9, |overrightarrow{b}|^2 = 4, and |overrightarrow{c}|^2 = 4, and knowing the relationship overrightarrow{a}^2 + 2overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} + overrightarrow{b}^2 = overrightarrow{c}^2 correctly leads us to:9 + 4 = 4 + 2overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b}Which simplifies to:overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = -frac{9}{2}4. Calculating the final expression:With overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = -frac{9}{2}, we now calculate the final expression asked in the problem:overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} + overrightarrow{b} cdot overrightarrow{c} + overrightarrow{c} cdot overrightarrow{a} = overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} - (overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}) cdot (-overrightarrow{c})This simplifies to:= -(overrightarrow{a}^2 + overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} + overrightarrow{b}^2) = -left(9 - frac{9}{2} + 4right) = -frac{17}{2}Hence, the answer to the problem is:boxed{-frac{17}{2}}Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{C}."},{"problem":"Let ABCD be a quadrilateral with side lengths AB = 2, BC = 3, CD = 5, and DA = 4.

Use Brahmagupta's formula: For a cyclic quadrilateral with sides (a), (b), (c), and (d), the area (K) is given by:   [   K = sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)}   ]   where (s) is the semiperimeter:   [   s = frac{a + b + c + d}{2}   ]4.
