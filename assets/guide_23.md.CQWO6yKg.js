She has passed many stones in those 5 years. This weekend she experienced the worst pains she has ever experienced. She began passing a white, think sandlike substance for several days She would experience horrible pain and pressure and then push and the substance would release in clumps. I am very worried about her . We have made an appointment at her urologist , but not expecting anything because they rarely have any answers for her. I was wondering if we should consider going to a nephrologist instead of a urologist. I am beginning to think we may be dealing with something in addition to kidney stones. Do you have any ideas of where we should turn at this point.","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to HCM. It could be chyle(fat globules) or turbid urine. Urologist is the best pErson to see, not because i am one, but we are the ones to do surgical procedure if required. But there is no harm in seeing a nephrologist as well. She needs urine analysis, culture, urine for chyle, renal function tests and IVP/CT scan. Based on the results treatment can be started. If pain is severe, obstruction can be relieved by a stent.

This means kidneys are only functioning at 10 to 15 percent of their normal capacity.  When chronic kidney disease develops into ESRD, dialysis or a kidney transplant is necessary to stay alive. Since you are already having GFR of 30 ,it indicates a stage 4 CKD. What can be done to either delay the progression of disease or, in many instances, prevent it? 1... Control your BP meticulously with either ACE inhibitors or ARB's 2...Control excess body mass 3..If it is deemed safe by your physician, low impact exercise for 20 to 30 minutes a day may be beneficial. It is certain to improve the quality of life and well-being 4...Controlling Lipids 5...Refraining from Cigarette Smoking 6... Avoiding Drugs Known to Damage the Kidneys like pain killers and antibiotics like gentamicin At the end I would like to mention that you can simply try to postpone the event of ESRD but you can not totally stop this event.

Urine is filtered from the blood by two kidneys (right & left) which are located in the backside just below the last rib. Then it passes thro' ureter to the Urinary Bladder - stored there till certain amount of collection & passed to the exterior thro'  Urethra (inside the penis / vulva). As long as stone is within the Kidney it may produce pain but there will not be  any blockade (acute & very severe pain). Problem starts once the stone descend down via the ureter. If it descends and passes out there will be sudden onset acute pain sometimes vomiting also but relived after some time. Usually it gets blocked in the upper. middle or lower part / end - at the junction  To treat this problem urine should made to secrete fast (forced diuresis) hoping the urine will flush away the stone.

WWW.WWWW.WW BRB/aeh D:12/27/2012 / T:12/28/2012","Doctor":"Hello Unilateral hydronephrosis with increased echogenicity and normal bladder suggests some obstruction above the bladder and below the kidney. Although increased renal cortical echogenicity in comparison to liver indicates impaired renal function,acute and chronic failure can't be labelled on the basis of ultrasonography finding only. So I would suggest to get some basic investigations done like urine routine, microscopy, culture sensitivity, blood urea, serum creatinine and electrolytes. Consult a nephrologist as investigations like IVP and renal scintigraphy may be required to assess accurately the anatomical or functional abnormality in the kidney.

Women are at increased risk of heart diseases during and after menopause. Since you are approaching menopause, you are at risk for heart diseases.

So get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of Ecg). If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases.

She wont go to the doctor, but I think it could be serious. Why is she having these pains or peeing blood?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM Pain in the region of kidney and passage of blood in urine indicates some kind of pathology in the urinary tract. The most common pathology is the presence of stones in kidney or in the upper ureter. You need to get some investigations done. First and fore most an ultrasound of the abdomen. A X-ray of the abdomen is also helpful because majority of kidney stones are radio-opaque (visible on X-ray film). If required some other investigations can also be ordered by your doctor like an Intravenous pyelogram (IVP). Secondily, complete urine examination which includes routine urine examination and culture. In case of urinary stone, infections are common which can be identified by urine culture. Antibiotic course will help to resolve the infection. The management of the stone in kidney or in the ureter depends on the position and size of the stone/ stones. They can be removed by simple laser or by open surgery. So, consult your doctor for investigations and management. Thanks and take care Dr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"Hi.

In this setting with symptoms of chest pain and vomiting, it is important that you get your father admitted to hospital. Firstly, a myocardial infarction (heart attack) needs to be ruled out by doing an ECG along with cardiac enzymes and perhaps an echocardiography depending on your father's examination findings . There is a particular type of MI (known as inferior wall MI) that presents in this way and if untreated could be life threatening due to complications. His loss of fluids through vomiting will need to be addressed in the hospital as untreated this can lead to low blood pressure and shock. While pancreatic disease can present with chest pain and occasional vomiting, the vomiting is usually not so severe. It may also be associated with fever,headaches, nausea, weakness, infection and abdominal pain. Kidney disease presenting with chest pain and vomiting could be seen in kidney failure with an associated heart condition called uremic pericarditis but it is less likely. If a heart attack is ruled out and fluids are replaced further evaluation will can be done at the hospital."},{"Patient":"My husbands  blood pressure has climed in the last half hour from 198/?? too distressed didn't note or remember to 250/???too distressed didn't note or remember now 224/147 what I should do, keep monitoring him?

The drug, Flexon is an analgesic, that is for pain relief. Citralka is a urine alkalanizer which helps to dissolve certain type of stones. Management of kidney stones depends on so many factors like size, type and number of stones. As your symptoms persists, I would suggest you to have a review and re-evaluation of treatment."},{"Patient":"hi, My mom is 50 yrs old.since her legs were swollen she got her blood test done and doctor prescribed for a scan which showed that she has diffuse renal parenchymal diseaese with bilateral normal sized kidney in grade 1. biopsy is done today and we are waiting for the result.she is a High Blood Pressure patient.Is this disease curable?Does she needs dialysis?","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for the query. Dialysis is needed to replace the function of failing kidneys.

Congratulations to your husband on completing 13 years post transplant. Presence of albumin in urine indicates early damage to the kidneys. It becomes more common as the transplant gets older as is your husband's case.

One of the kidney has an extrarenal pelvis. A kidney is involved in the formation od urine. The urine is formed and enters the urine tube called ureter. An ureter is dilated to form a receptacle called pelvis. Normally, the pelvis is present inside the borders of the kidney. In some cases the pelvis is large and is extends outside the kidney. This is called extrarenal pelvis. It is just a structural anomaly and does not any effect on the function of the kidney. However, due to large size there may be urine stasis or reflix of urine. This reflux causes recurrent UTI. So, there is no antenatal risk in your wife or baby. However, after birth upto 10 years of life recurrent UTI may occur depending on the severity of the structural abnormality. Micturating cystography and DMSA scan may be required but only after consultation with pediatrician.

That is why it is very important to have blood sugar monitored regularly. Kidney stones is a disease which likes to recur as well. Such stones are mostly caused by diet habits. To get to know what products should be eliminated, the stone should be tested. Getting know what is the stone build of, will tell what causes stones.

From the description of the symptoms it looks like your child has most likely had a relapse. This will be confirmed if the urine protein is 3+ on 3 days. Childhood nephrotic syndrome is known to relapse and recur frequently. Dietary modifications usually do not work and in fact as the child is growing he needs a nutritious diet. The appropriate thing at this stage would be to consult your pediatric nephrologist who will most likely restart the medications.

But stones should be present in both kidneys to cause this condition. So it is suggested for you to have fool blood work with creatinine level.

Occasionally, it may obstruct - apart from size, surrounding swelling caused by its irritation may be responsible. Removal straight away is is the best option.   It is not 'surgery' in the true sense of the word - a procedure!  They put a tube from below (Ureteroscope) and extract the stone.  It is fast but expensive...

The frequent episodes of UTI that you have mentioned occur in sexually active women. To avoid frequent episodes of UTI, pass urine after every act of intercourse. Drink plenty of water. Add more citrus fruits to diet. Inorder to treat urinary tract infection, get an antibiotic prescribed by your doctor.

I also I have a pituitary tumor as well as diagnosed primary progressive MS with complication of kidney stones that caused obstructed kidney in the last two months that I still suffer flank pain from. where should i start to feel better..any clue?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM You have mentioned that you have had partial thyroidectomy for goitre which turned out to be Hashimoto's thyroiditis. After the surgery you should get your thyroid function tests regularly to rule out any abnormality of thyroid hormones. Regarding the pituitary tumor, it is important to know if there are any symptoms associated with the pituitary tumor. If there are symptoms surgical removal needs to be done. For this you will have to refer a neurologist. Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis is a progressive degenerative disorder in which there is destruction of myelin. In primary progrssive MS the disease process is relapsing and remitting. During this stage certain medications help eg Interferons, polypeptites which protect the myelin and immunosupprants which prevent the destruction of myelin. These drugs only halt the progression but do not cure the disease. Lastly, about kidney stones you need to get it removed soon as it is causing obstruction. Before that get your urine examination and X-ray of the KUB region.

If there is a bladder tumor or urethral stricture or benign hypertrophy of prostate they can lead to bilateral hydronephrosis and bilateral changes. Kidney pain may be caused by renal stone itself even in the absence of urteral patholgy. Renal cell carcinoma may also cause pain. Bilateral hydronephrosis on few occassions may cause pain. Please do consult a urologist and go for cystoscopy or ascending cysto-urethrogram for better delineation of the pathology causing bilateral hydronephrosis.

As you have mentioned that your husband had had a stone in the same kidney, there can be a recurrence of the stone. a large stone can obstruct the passage of urine from the kidney and cause its enlargement, which can be palpable. Development of cysts in kidney, however this is not very common after kidney stones. A kidney tumor can also form a palpable mass. Other soft tissues in the region like fat, muscle, fibrous tissue can also form a palpable mass. Lymph nodes in the region can get enlarged due to inflammation or due to maliganancy.

Back ache is often part of pregnancy. But it can also be due to urine infection or stones. I suggest you consult your obstetrician for concerns regarding low weight gain. You should also see a urologist, who might suggest blood tests, blood sugar levels and a sonography. Kidney swelling can occur even in normal pregnancy due to pressure by the growing baby.

I think your friend had a blocked kidney tube due to stones and so a tube has been put into her kidney from the flank to drain the kidney (called pcn tube). this is done to reverse the kidney swelling and prevent further kidney damage due to blocked kidney tube. It is also done in case the urine in kidney is infected or pus-like (pyonephrosis or infected HN).

Most probably it just might be a case of dysmenorrhoea (painful menstruation). We can rule out urinary tract infection as the urine test has come back as normal. Renal stones sometimes have a genetic predisposition. Might want to get an ultrasound of the abdomen mainly focussing on the kidneys, ureters and bladder to rule out stones in the renal tract. In the meantime, give her a pain relief medication along with an antispasmodic. Advise her to drink plenty of warm fluids. Application of hot water bag on the lower abdomen and back might help.

Yes possibly autologous mesenchymal  stem cells harvested from body itself becomes possible in near future, even if it helps in reducing the rejection of transplanted kidney. Right now also very good result with the drugs available. Be hope ful Good luck to you"},{"Patient":"Hi, I just passed a 4mm kidney stone yesterday morning. But now I am very bloated and my abdomen is very tender. It hurts when I walk and lay down. Last night I had to sleep sitting up. I havent gone #2 in four days and don t even feel the need to which is what worries me. What should I take? Is this normal after passing a kidney stone? Thanks.","Doctor":"Dear friend, welcome to HCM. Is your pain constant or comes on and off like a colic? Was an Xray KUB or sonography done for the stones? Have you passed adequate urine? There could be another one. There could be complications like dilatation or infection. You should see your doctor to get evaluated for anything serious. Urine routine, USG and Xray KUB will be needed. Take OTC pain killer like paracetamol till then. Drink lot of water if no kidney failure declared by your doctor. Take care and keep me updated on your progress. Good luck !! DR. Prasad Akole"},{"Patient":"My patient is not conscious, suffered a TIA and is having very high levels of potassium . He has previously suffered stroke and is a known diabetic Type 2 as well as hypertensive. At the moment, the gums and feet are bleeding? Doctors think that this may be kidney failure. I would want to be helped to understand the gravity of the situation.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting your query. Your treating doctor is right...your patient is already suffering from diabetes and hyperkalemia (increased potassium) is very common in renal failure. Your patient is unconscious and has gum & feet bleeding, there may be high chances of intracranial bleed making patient unconscious. You should go for CT/ MRI brain to rule out bleed. You should also go for bleeding time, clotting time, prothrombin time to clarify the cause. Yes, your patient is serious and bleeding is not a good sign. You should also go for liver function test, renal function test, complete blood count also. You patient needs intensive care.

And after transplant all this problem will remove or not? Can i sit, bow, run after transplant?","Doctor":"Dear Niteen, Normally urine passes from the the kidneys to the bladder via ureters. There is a valve like mechanism at the junction of ureter with the bladder, that prevents urine coming in the reverse direction. However when this mechanism fails the urine refluxes back towards the kidneys and damages it. Joint and bone pains can be there due to renal failure, itself. Usually a person can return to almost al normal activities after transplant, including sitting / running Regards"},{"Patient":"I had a kidney stone pass and CT showed swelling on the right side of my bladder and swelling of the right ureter .

He had a hemodialysis about 3 days earlier- then he had a bleeding episode- a hemorrhage and then he was admitted to critical care unit. He was kept on medicines and then one more dialysis was conducted on him just 2 days before he died. After this dialysis, he was kept in the CCU only for two more days. On the third day he had breathing problems. He was given oxygen through a mask. After about 15 hours, the docs said he has to be put into mechanical ventilation support. However, he did not survive in the ventilation. He died in about 1 and a half hours time. Could you please let me know if this death was timely or was it caused by some wrong medicines during his last dialysis.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting your query. Were your father was suffering from chronic kidney disease? Were there any defect in clotting time/ bleeding time/ prothrombin time? Had your father derangements of liver function test or any abdominal symptoms? Those patients who had already deranged liver and renal function may have deranged platelet function & prothrombin time with defect in coagulation. All these factors predisposes patient to bleeding with decreased clotting ability. Although heparin is given during dialysis but all these are applied by trained staff by measurement. So there is least likely possibility of wrong medicines. You can also understand that when dialysis was not started, he got hemorrhagic episodes. So I think medicines are not the likely cause. Once bleeding is started, then a vicious cycle starts in body and if not controlled within time then its very difficult to save life whether all medicines have been given by expert doctors. So doctors are also helpful at few places and we have to accept the judgment of god.

The disease is highly variable and can range from no symptoms to rapidy progressing. The treatment involves monitoring your son's urine for protein or blood, blood pressure control to prevent the blood pressure from causing further damage (some blood pressure medications would also reduce the proteins in the urine, steroid use,low protein diet. Poor Prognosis is usually determined by: persistant hematuria (blood in the urine), persistant proteinuria, sustained high blood pressure, impaired renal function,smoking. Some histological findings (what is seen in biopsy) can also affect outcome. It is unlikely to affect the kidneys differently.

You need to speak to your doctor to determine the chemical compostion of the stone that was passed earlier because based on that you could change your diet to reduce the chances of reoccurence. To prevent future stone formation you need to: drink copious fluids (1) if your stone was made up of calcium oxalate increasing fluid intake of citrate rich fluids such as lemonade or orange juice will help (2)limit sodium intake to less than 2300mg a day (1 tsp) (3) have a calcium intake of about 1000 mg to 1200mg (4)limit intake of animal protein to less than 2 meals a day if it was a uric acid stone (5)limit intake of foods with alot of oxalate such as spinach, strawberries,nuts, cocoa,dark chocolate I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"hi doctor i was a patient of calculi in kidney size 5 mm in middle pole and 6mm in lower pole what can i do for that problem please help me?","Doctor":"HI, Keep waiting if pain is not severe and frequent.Review every 6 months by ultrasound.Take plenty of fluid.

Kindly don't worry. The PCOD with which you have already been diagnosed is having no role with this current issue.

Usually any kind of abnormalities in renal physiology can cause frequent and reccurent urinary tract infection. Urine test may be negative for microorganism since there is a minimum requiered level of bacteria's are needed for a positive result. Urine results may not be correlated with the level of symptoms experienced and this is particularly true for women. So she needs to take antibiotics when there is signs of UTI. Also consult your urologist for further course of action.

Terrible pain in back. The took culture and I ended up having a fungus growing on the inside of my body, they put me on Cipro because the Bactrum they had me on became resistant to what I had. Here I am again, no with a bladder infection . The night it hit me, I woke up at 5 am vomiting and with heavy pain in my back, horrible pressure almost feeling like I was about to have all my organs pop out of my back. My father took me to the ER, I vomited non stop for 5 hours, as well as diarrhea ( which I m still experiencing). It s been a week since then and I have seen my doctor. The hospital misplaced both records of my cultures so I must wait yet another week to find out what going on. I m scheduled an ultra sound on my kidneys a week from today. I m experiencing excruciating sharp pains and spams underneath the back of my ribs and lower back. I ended my period the night before last and woke up in orange menstural blood .

I just want a serious helpful answer, so I can become healthy again and enjoy this upcoming junior school year of mine. Please help me, I m begging you. : c","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for query. The first possibility is of kidney or ureteric stone. Stone causes repeated urinary infection. The pain below ribs & back with vomitting is a symptom of urinary stone.

Due to kidney diseases the kidney  shows enlargement in size but cortex & medula both enlarged or only single one is an important aspect.

A further distinguishing feature is parenchymal echogenicity. Diseased kidneys in general show increased echogenicity, however in the early stages echogenicity may still be normal. Increasing echogenicity is directly correlated to histopathological abnormality. acute obstructive disease ,acute pyelonephritis or renal failure may be the possibility.

I am 55 yrs old and in good health.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for query, Your blood in stool needs attention.Is that frank red or black.? The reason of frank blood may be piles or fissure.But if it is black aspirin might produce internal bleeding. Your kidney region pain is also needed attention.It may be a referred pain of stomach or of kidney stone. You should consult your doctor.

I am now having pain on the right side of my back. I had hydronephrosis of pregnancy 6 years ago and it feels like the same type of pain. I see my doctor again on tuesday but this morning my urine was completely clear","Doctor":"it could be uti, just get a urine routine examination. if there are pus cells>5/HPF it points to Urine infection. do not worry for hydronephrosis which occuered in pregnency. that can be phsiological and dissapears after pregnency."},{"Patient":"giddy back in ,March i had my gall bladder removed have never been the same again Have had 3 seizures in hospital 3 times last visit real bad broke 7 ribs when collapsed at the bank.

Sodium ( Na), Potassium (K), and Calcium are important ions in body and there deficiency or excess is likely to cause seizures. ion imbalace are common in patients with tubular kidney diseases. amiloride is likely to improve  sodium related problems. generally these disorders are benign. one has to correct the electrolytes and that is it."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am XXXXXXX. I have some problems regarding while urinating, some thing like feeling not fully urinated even if I have completed urination . Today, I had urine test to check the presence of infection. The result is there is presence of albumin , 30-35/hpf pus cells, and 8-10/hpf red blood cells. I just want to know what can be the cause of this problem? Is this situation called albuminuria and is there any danger or problem in the functioning of my kidneys?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for choosing HCM yes it is urinary tract infection(UTI) presence of albumin in urine is called albuminuria...but if it is in traces ,you need not worry because it stops when the infection subsides Do you get UTI frequently? because if it is so ,urine might of gone up in the urinary tract towards the kidneys and damages its tissue leading to scars.... what is  your age? any history or family history of diabetes and hypertension? please get these checked up and take proper treatment because in diabetes ,proteinuria is seen and hypertension(bp) may also be due to kidney damage dont worry drink lots and lots of water ,it flushes the infection take treatment if recurring common problem with uti is when antibiotics are prescribed for 5 days or so,you start taking it and when you take half the course your symptoms subsides ,so you will stop the medication. that is wrong ......... because  though your symptoms subside some of the infection is still present which flares up after you stop taking medicine and it also causes resistance so that the antibiotic will not be effective when you use the next time(even if you take a bigger dose) so take care ,talk to the doctor and take up all tests needed get a ultrasound abdomen (scan )done if suggested. take treatment depending on the pathology hope i answered your queries feel free to contact me for further queries thank you"},{"Patient":"I am having fever with heavy leg pains.

Any help would be great!","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for asking on HCM!Your symptoms could be related to a musculo-skeletal pain or chostochondritis. Gastro-esophageal reflux or gastritis can not be excluded either. For this reason, I would recommend trying an antiacid or PPI (omeprazole, esomeprazole). If it helps relive your symptoms, it would indicate possible gastritis or gastro-esophageal reflux underlying your symptoms. In such case a fibrogastroscopy would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Otherwise, I recommend trying ibuprofen. If your symptoms are relied by ibuprofen, it would indicate possible musculo-skeletal pain (including chostochondritis), as the main cause of your complaints. Anyway, as a cardiologist, I would like to reassure you that your symptoms are not related to the heart, as they are not characteristic of any cardiac disorders.

If treated properly, is unlikely to recur. Pregnancy itself is a strainful condition to the ureters. The gravid uterus compresses the pelvic inlet and the ureters. This can lead to urinary retention.

I am always very tired and the docs have come back with nothing from my blood tests. What can this be???","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms could be related to a sinus infection. It is less likely that your symptoms are related to switching to omeprazole, as it is a similar drug to pantoprazole. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing sinus X ray study coupled with a sinus discharge study. If these tests result normal, I would recommend trying to switch again to pantoprazole for some days. If this helps improve your situation, it would indicate possible low tolerance to omeprazole. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. Hope you will find this answer helpful!Wishing good health, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"I am 44 years. I had CGN detected in March, 2009.

You should know that it is quite normal to have a higher heart rate during anxiety of physical activity. This is caused by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to increase adrenaline and noradrenaline levels, causing an increased heart rate and blood pressure values. This is a normal reaction in every normal individual. Anyway, I would recommend performing some tests to exclude a possible cardiac arrhythmia: -a resting ECG and cardiac ultrasound- thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction- complete blood count for anemia- electrolyte levels for electrolyte imbalance. An ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring would help examine your heart rhythm trends for a prolonged time and exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia. If all the above tests result normal, you should focus on your anxiety as the main cause of your complaints. In such case it would be better consulting with a specialist of this field (psychiatrist for psychotherapist), who would help manage your anxiety.

I am happy to address your questions, the normal creatinine range for a man is 0.6-1.2 with a critical value being >4. Creatinine is used in skeletal muscle contraction and is excreted entirely by the kidneys.  There are slight increases in creatinine levels after meals, especially after eating large amounts of meat. Certain medications can increase your creatinine levels as can diabetes, reduced renal blood flow (from CHF or dehydration), or a urinary tract obstruction. There are other conditions that can cause an elevated creatinine as well but you would be symptomatic with them. Also, simple dehydration can cause some elevation. Prolonged high blood pressure, or hypertension, is the most common cause of kidney damage,  the worst is kidney failure.  Try to control high blood pressure to prevent kidney disease, cardiac disease and stroke. It may be brought under control through exercise and diet (especially salt avoidance). It may need drug treatment. Your doctor can best guide you on this. If you improve blood pressure, the serum creatinine may go down, but more importantly, it is less likely to go up, meaning your kidney function is less likely to worsen. Hope I have answered your query. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help. Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hi, I m a 25 year old female, weigh 53kg, 5 6 tall.

Your daughter is having repeated upper urinary tract infection which may be due to several causes for eg. reflux of urine, duplex kidney and ureter due to which urine from one ureter moves back and forth to other ureter (yo-yo reflux), some hold-up in the urinary tract (which may be since birth) or simply a body predisposition to certain bacteria. So one, she needs a thorough evaluation by a urologist or a pediatric urologist to find the cause of infections. If she cant void during the special X-rays, the procedure can be done under anesthesia and gentle pressure applied on lower abdomen to look for reflux. Two, her kidneys need to be protected from further infection related damage, so she may require long-term low dose antibiotics to prevent infection. go see a urologist early. good luck."},{"Patient":"hi, I have lots of problem but Mizar is heart pain and swilling, brain all vain are starch and more pain, and i have both kidney stone . left kidney more pain swilling and, legs swilling, w omitting, i cant eat any thing i not filling good, i m very tide. filling very bed and i cant control my self i would like to finish my self. please give me some suggestion.","Doctor":"hi dear, you need help first from your family doctor, who can then send you to the appropriate specialist.

After 3 months, things got back to normal, except the feeling of anxiety. I thought then its an blood ph imbalance, so i ate more fruits, but to no avail. Ive had my insides/abdomens checked (ultrasound),all are normal, had my liver and kidneys checked, results are normal,had my triglycerides and cholesterol checked, normal,except for LDL (.5 units lower than the lowest in range, i think its caused by lots of jogging). There was this time wherein i physically felt as if the anxiety just turned off without any reason at all, and it lasted for 2.5 weeks, then it turned on again. I hate this feeling. It feels like there s an impending doom, therefore causing me to have sleepless nights. I dont know what kind of doctor do i have to go to, hematologist? endoctrinologist? nutritionist? can you please guide me on this?Jon","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I passed carefully through your question and would explain that your symptoms seem to be related to anxiety. Low cholesterol levels can contribute in sleep disturbances and in anxiety too. Coming to this point, I would recommend consulting with a specialist of this field (psycotherapist or psychiatrist), who can help you to deal with your anxiety in a professional way. Yoga and meditation can help too. I would also encourage you to continue on your healthy diet and your daily physical activity.

The underlying cause of uric acid excess has to be made out and treating it will put an end to the stone problem.

Urine was clean, I have an elevated white cell count on my CBC, and kidney stones in my right kidney. Dr said the elevated white count was due to the prednisone I was given for an allergic reaction I had the day prior and could not give an answer for the flank pain. Could the kidney stones be causing the pain? I have had at least one of the stones found in my kidney since Oct of 2009. And would only 3 doses of prednisone elevate my white blood cell count?","Doctor":"Hi there,I hope you are feeling better now. Your elevated white cell counts can indeed be due to prednisone treatment, or it also could be because of any underlying infection.As you say that you have kidney stone the pain could be caused if the stone is small enough to have passed into the ureters that is the tube that connects you kidney to the bladder. The passage of these stone give rise to flank pain. Even a single dose of prednisone can give rise to elevated WBC counts but then tend to come back to previous levels once the drug is stopped. If the pain continues it would be a good idea to get a KUBor IVP done to rule out stone in the ureter and a permanent treatment. Neglected cases may lead to kidney damage in the future. Your urologist will be the best guide in such matters. Take care!"},{"Patient":"I am a 31-year-old male, sedentary worker diagnosed with renal colic a month ago. What is the best remedy for renal colic and how to take preventive measures?","Doctor":"Hi there. Thank you for posting your question with Healthcaremagic. I will do my best to help you. The prevention of kidney stone is a complex subject and there is loads of good information on this on the Internet. I would recommend the Mayo Clinic's web site as an excellent place to start. Also, you need to discuss this with you own doctor or urologist. First of all it depends on what type of stone is developing in your kidney or bladder. This has to be determined. If you can, develop the habit of urinating through a sieve just in case you can catch a small stone for your doctor to send for analysis. Most stones are calcium based. Dietary restrictions in calcium is however no longer recommended. This is because it does not seem to work and, in any case, calcium is an important mineral for proper bodily functioning. Some stones are composed of uric acid in which case allopurinol, to lower uric acid levels, may be prescribed. All recurrence rate of all stones can be reduced by increasing daily fluid intake. The cheapest way to achieve this is by drinking lots of water. The aim should be to increase fluid intake to the point where you are passing at least four pints of urine every day. I hope that I have answered your questions at least to some extent and been of some help.  If you have anymore questions please contact me again anytime.

I was diagnosed in the emergency room and referred to a urologist . I haven t been able to be seen by the urologist because there is only one office in my area so appointments are hard to come by, let alone even receive a phone call in return. The past few days I thought I possibly had passed the stone without realizing it. However, today I feel as though it is sitting at the opening of my vagina and I feel it more so when I urinate. It is more of an uncomfortable feeling rather than actual pain. Also, I am experiencing what seems to be air bubbles coming from that area. Not passing gas, just very small air bubbles . In your opinion, do you believe that the stone is still present? Are these bubbles normal/have anything to do with the passing of a kidney stone? Also, what can I expect when the stone actually passes? Will there be a great deal of pain and blood involved?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HealthcareMagic forum. Renal stones less than the size of 10mm are flushed out easily without major complications. It occurs in 2 stages - origin till the urinary bladder and from the bladder to outside. Pain, abdominal cramps, bloody urine and discomfort which are usual accompanying symptoms as the stones pass out is found only in the first stage. Second stage is asymptomatic and rarely one can experience flattened stream of urine or double stream urine. From your description, your symptoms are unlikely related to renal stone passing. The discomfort in the vaginal region is probably due to localized infection. Consulting your local gynecologist will be helpful. Drink plenty of fluids and cranberry juice can help in the meantime. Also important is to abstain from unprotected sexual intercourse until complete recovery. Hope this helps. Wish you good health.

I would like to tell you that in people with calcium oxalate stones, calcium restriction is NOT NECESSARY. To prevent further stones, I would recommend the following steps: a. Drink plenty of fluid.

Limit the amount of protein you are consuming: You should be having a total 2 servings of milk and milk products + fish/poultry/meat/legumes to 140 g per day.

Day 4: Start period? attribute back pain to menstrual cramping Day 6: See Urologist on suggestion of my retired General Surgeon father; Urologist asks questions but doesn t physically check me; calls in results from urine culture and reports that nothing was detected so she is concerned about kidney stones; did do a urine test, blood detected, but at the tail end of period so means nothing; changes my abdominal CT to w/ and w/o contrast; tells me to stop taking Cipro because it is not doing anything Day 8 (exactly 1 week after symptoms began): do abdominal CT w/ and w/o contrast Day 9: NP receives results: abdominal CT does not detect kidney stones nor anything unusual with the urinary tract , though does detect a 1.6 cm cyst within the left ovary (which is where the more pronounced pain is felt); recommendation is to see OB/GYN regarding further exploration; called OB and nurse for ultrasound appointment; received urine culture results directly which states: Polymicrobes detected consistent with urethral flora and/or colonizing bacteria .

There appears to be at least 3 different organ systems involved.","Doctor":"Hi, please don't be so upset. A 1.6 cm cyst in the ovary is of no clinical value we don't even call it a cyst, it may just indicate an un-ruptured follicle which may be painful. Even then, if this is bothering you, all you have to do is repeat an ultrasound pelvis after 6 weeks to make sure it has disappeared. All the other symptoms are likely to be related to your UTI. This infection may cause nausea, vomiting, lower abdominal pain, back pain etc. The antibiotic you are taking may also be responsible for all that nausea. Your dizziness may be due to the medications you are taking for sinus problem. Your diarrhea may be a consequence of antibiotic therapy or due to an ongoing infection. Just complete your antibiotic course and take any many medicine to stop your nausea after discussing with your physician. Please repeat urine culture some time after your treatment and period  is over to make sure all has cleared up.

What does it mean when there is a UPJ obstruction with some cortical thinning? My son (9 months old) has a UPJ obstruction with hydronephrosis , he has cortical thinning according to his last ultrasound and I was wondering what that means. We are faced with waiting 3 months to see if things get better or going into surgery for a pyeloplasty right now so I m trying to weigh our options and make the best decision for him.","Doctor":"Hello Kari.Maki, Welcome to Healthcaremagic.com As I'm sure you know, ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction is a blockage in the area that connects the renal pelvis (part of the kidney) to one of the tubes (ureters) that moves urine to the bladder. UPJ obstruction generally occurs when a baby is still growing in the womb. This is called a congenital condition (present from birth). Most of the time, the blockage is caused when the connection between the ureter and the renal pelvis narrows. This causes urine to build up, damaging the kidney. The most severe cases of UPJ obstruction may require surgery early in life. However, the majority of cases may not require surgery until later in life, and some cases do not require surgery at all. Early diagnosis and treatment of UPJ obstruction may help preserve future kidney function. UPJ obstruction diagnosed before birth or early after birth may actually improve on its own.  Most patients do well with no long-term consequences. Significant kidney damage may occur in those who are diagnosed later in life. Current treatment options provide good long-term outcomes. Pyeloplasty provides the greatest long-term success. A tube called a stent may be placed to drain urine from the kidney until the patient heals. A nephrostomy tube, which is placed in the patient's side to drain urine, may also be needed for a short time after the surgery. This type of tube may also used to treat severe infections before surgery. Cortical thinning indicates that there is ongoing kidney damage.  Once this damage occurs, it is irreversible.  The cortex of the kidney is the portion that filters the urine. Talk with your nephrologist as to the complications of having the pyeloplasty or waiting to see if your son's condition improves.

The sciatic nerve is located quite far away. I am sure you doctor must have done an X-ray before and after removing the stent to be sure that there are no more stones left behind.

Renal calculus can cause acute pain but this is not generalised but mostly restricted to renal angle region. This colic can be associated with vomits also. The pains you are having apparently are linked to debility. I believe you are not in habit of regular exercise and as per ayurved this leads to excess of kaph in body which is responsible for lethargy and sleepy feeling. To get rid of stone tab. sheet prabha is good. For spermaturia tab. Neo and for generalised pains have tab. triodashang guggul.

Recently I had them on my legs, and before the bruises appeared, I had this terrible itcht on the bottom of my legs. The following day my carer pointed out the bruises to me. I think it is important to let you know that I do have Kidney problems, for that I go two times a week for dialysis . I am physically well, what do you think is causing the buises to appear and then later go away. Thanking you","Doctor":"In patients suffering from chronic renal failure , the platelets usually develop a dysfunction. They are responsible for preventing small bleeds. But if they cease to function then the patient develops a propensity for small hemorrhages which usually develop spontaneously. As soon as the dialysis session is completed the platelets will function optimally for some time. If the problem goes beyond control then a particular medication is given which is a synthetic anologue of vasopressin. You should consult your nephrologist who will guide you in this respect."},{"Patient":"Hi, For about the past week now whenever I urinate I have a sharp abdominal pain right as I m finishing. the pain is very weird to describe but it isn t like a burning or itching sensation, it s very sharp.

First thing is to get a urine routine and microscopy examination. It will say whether there is pus cells /crystals etc. Visit your doctor who might also ask you to get an ultrasound of the abdomen to look for any renal/bladder calculi.

The episode is generally paroxysmal i.e. it occurs during that time only and mostly doesn't recur back. If it is treated at that time we generally do not give any medication but if there are certain risk factors like dilated heart chamber (Left Atrium) or heart dysfunction we continue it for prophylaxis. You can stop the medication if you don't have risk factors or the arrhythmia has never recurred again. If it has and you are feeling side effects of beta-blockers than for such patients we can start on another type of anti-arrhythmic called calcium channel blockers (Tab Diltiazem). For BP you have to check your BP daily and if it is normal on medication than you definitely need them if the BP is lower than 110/70 you can try tapering the dose to half tablet and gradually stop it.

The distinction is important because a different antibiotic would be used.  Generally, we look for a fever, flank (upper, not lower back pain). to distinguish between kidney and bladder infections.  Leukocytes are generally higher in a kidney infection, but not necessarily.  In more severe cases, the patient would be vomiting and would need IV fluids and antibiotics. Sometimes when a patient has leukocytes and no symptoms, doctors will not treat as the body's own defense system will take over or because the urine dip may have been inaccurate.

Drinking water and other fluids is the most important thing a person can do to prevent kidney stones. Diets high in salt, or sodium, can increase the excretion of calcium into the urine and thus increase the risk of calcium containing kidney stones. Reducing salt intake is preferred to reducing calcium intake.Foods rich in animal proteins-such as meat, eggs, and fish-contain purines and can increase the risk of uric acid stones and calcium stones. Calcium from food can help prevent kidney stone formation and help maintain bone density. Avoiding foods rich in oxalates, such as spinach and rhubarb, may help prevent calcium oxalate stones.

Although this case is rare, it exists truly. Once PKD occurs, it is almost impossible for us to eradicate radically, because we have no methods to remove all the cysts from kidneys. Surgery is the traditional treatment for PKD and it treats PKD through breaking big cysts.

As per the doctor he saying it will have variations. how is this stage how shecan recover this. Thanks","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for your query. I will try my best to provide you with best possible professional recommendations to your questions. Normal levels of creatinine in the blood are approximately 0.6 to 1.2 milligrams (mg) per deciliter (dl) in adult males and 0.5 to 1.1 milligrams per deciliter in adult females. Any condition that impairs the function of the kidneys will probably raise the creatinine level in the blood. It is important to recognize whether the process leading to kidney dysfunction (kidney failure, azotemia) is longstanding or recent. The most common causes of longstanding kidney disease in adults are high blood pressure and diabetes mellitus. Certain drugs can sometimes cause abnormally elevated creatinine levels. Serum creatinine can also transiently rise after ingestion of large amount of dietary meat. Creatinine level will vary depending on the disease. Kidney problem is vague description I would like to know the exact diagnosis, only after that i can speak about the prognosis.

Get regular USG to make sure the left kidney is fine. 3. It is possible for the right kidney function to reduce further as the child grows. This is because the left kidney will grow normally while your right won't. Most of the times, the left kidney will enlarge and take up the extra- work. Just monitor his BP and if it goes out of range, get him treated."},{"Patient":"Hi my grand mother is 86 years old and in a stage 4 almost 5 kidney desease.

These include performance anxiety, emotional weakness, inferiority complex, stress, marital or relationship problems, low mood, feelings of guilt, and the effects of a past sexual and emotional trauma. Physical causes: Include neurological disorders, alcoholism, drug abuse, hormonal imbalances, diabetes, hypertension, blood vessel disease and chronic diseases. Following measures will help you: • do not worry. • Daily aerobic exercise to increase blood circulation. • Yoga and relaxation exercises. • Treatment of physical causes if present. • Ask about effect of current drugs on your sexual functioning from your physician as they may cause lower sperm count.

The sudden pancytopenia in your mother can be due to a parvovirus infection. This is a viral infection which can cause a sudden aplastic crisis. The night sweats, fever and chills can be due to sepsis or infection in the blood stream.  She would be particularly susceptible to these as her white blood cells (which fight infections) are low. The persistent edema is more likely to be due to chronic kidney disease and would only decrease when the blood counts start improving.

Peripheral oedema.Severe hyperlipidaemia (total cholesterol often >10 mmol/L) is often present.

It is a common cause cause of nephrotic syndrome in children [Nephrotic syndrome is a disorder in which the kidneys are damaged, causing them to leak large amounts of proteins from the blood into the urine].

Chronic kidney Disease (CKD) is the gradual loss of kidney function. Since how long is he on Peritoneal Dialysis (PD)? You should be taking to his NEphrologist so that he can examine him and suggest any rescheduling in PD. It is common for a CKD patient to have loss of appetite, not to worry. He will require few blood tests to see for the amount of wastes in his blood and also the hemoglobin level. If the test results show that the dialysis schedule is not removing enough wastes, your doctor may change the dialysis routine. This might involve changing the number of exchanges, increasing the amount of solution used for each exchange or using a dialysis solution with a higher concentration of dextrose. In addition to this, he should be eating right amount of food, low in sodium and phosphorus. Kindly consult a dietitian for this so that he/she can develop a diet plan suiting his weight, personal preferences, remaining kidney function and other medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. Finally, he should be taking his medications as directed by his Doctor for achieving the best possible results and go for regular follow up.

The mean dimensions of the kidneys upon maturation are: length-about 12cm, breadth-about 6cm and thickness-about 3cm. The weight of one kidney averages about 120-150 g. Any decrease in size is abnormal. Prominence of the pelvocalyceal system means that maybe because of distal blocking ( probably due to a stone )there is collection in the pelvocalyceal system and hence the CT scan of the kidney, ureters and bladder is suggested. This is a more precise form of investigation. The urine forms in the kidneys and flows into the bladder through the ureters. Any blockage in the ureters will cause accumulation of urine in the kidneys.

For this reason, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical exam and some tests: -an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring in order to examine your heart rhythm for a prolonged time- complete blood count for anemia- thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance- a cervical spine X ray study to examine your cervical vertebral column for possible degenerations- a nerve conduction study to examine your nerves in your upper limbs. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests. Wishing good health, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"Hi There.

I am about 60 pounds overweight and I think that I have been drinking too much caffeine and my diet of course needs much improvement.","Doctor":"Hi, I would suggest continuing your antihypertensive medication for blood pressure control and preventing complications. Your blood sugar levels are actually normal, but I would suggest a more accurate test like the glycated hemoglobin to check for your sugar levels for the past 3 months. And there are also a lot of causes for tingling sensation in the hands and feet, which includes, but not limited to diabetes mellitus, dietary deficiency of Vitamin B, and musculoskeletal problems. I would also suggest weight loss by regular aerobic exercise and a low fat and high fiber diet as these are proven to lower your blood pressure on top of the medications, and in general, lower your risk of atherosclerotic disease like heart attack and stroke. I recommend a check-up with your doctor (even as an outpatient basis) for further examination and proper medication prescription as there are different drugs that fit a particular profile.

I have had my heart checked out and docs have said it is healthy apart from a leaky heart valve which is apparently verging on the norm. I have been told that I have anxiety and do agree as I am constantly worried, tense and nervous. I started taking fluexotine anti-depressant yesterday. The only worry I have still is that once every month I get a very sudden heart flutter, that feels like my heart plummets for a few seconds. I get this when I am not anxious and it makes me scared. Can you explain this please?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that it is quite normal to have palpitations during anxiety or physical activity. This is because of the activation of the sympathetic nervous system during these situation, leading to increased circulating levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline, which increase the heart rate and blood pressure values. Some ectopic heart beats are quite normal in every healthy individual during anxiety.So, as your doctor has reassured you that your heart is OK, there is nothing to worry about. Fluoxetine will help relieve your anxiety, but it may need a couple of weeks to show its effects. So, you should just be patient.

In acute renal failure, kidney function is lost rapidly and can occur from a variety of insults to the body. The list of causes is often categorized based on where the injury has occurred.  Prerenal causes (pre=before + renal=kidney) causes are due to decreased blood supply to the kidney. Examples of prerenal causes are:  * Hypovolemia (low blood volume) due to blood loss  * Dehydration from loss of body fluid (vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, fever )  * Poor intake of fluids  * Medication, for example, diuretics (\\"water pills\\") may cause excessive water loss.  * Loss of blood supply to the kidney due to obstruction of the renal artery or vein.  Renal causes (damage directly to the kidney itself) include:  * Sepsis: The body's immune system is overwhelmed from infection and causes inflammation and shutdown of the kidneys. This usually does not occur with urinary tract infections.  * Medicat"},{"Patient":"Which is better for kidney failure?

Now kidney specialist has advised for kidney transplant. What are the treatment options for patient with kidney failure other than kidney transplant and kidney transplant is better than other treatment options? Are there different kinds of kidney transplants? What is rejection? What are the chances that a transplanted kidney will continue to function normally? Will I need to follow a special diet?","Doctor":"When an individual's kidneys fail, three treatment options are hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplantation. Many patients feel that a successful kidney transplant provides a better quality of life because it allows greater freedom and often is associated with increased energy levels and a less restricted diet. There are two types of kidney transplants: those that come from living donors and those that come from unrelated donors who have died or non-living donors. The most important complication that may occur after transplant is rejection of the kidney. The body's immune system guards against attack by all foreign matter, such as bacteria. This defense system may recognize tissue transplanted from someone else as foreign and attack the foreign tissue (transplanted kidney). Results of transplantation are improving steadily with research advances. In the event that a transplanted kidney fails, a second transplant may be a good option for many patients. Kidney transplants, like other treatments for kidney failure, often require following special diet guidelines. If someone is on dialysis before transplant, the diet which is recommended after transplant is less restricted. The length of time must follow the special diet varies. Progress will be followed closely, consulting doctor and dietitian will modify diet as needed."},{"Patient":"Uncle Having Diabetes and high Level of Creatinine in his blood Hello Sir, My uncle is suffering from diabetes and high level of creatinine in his blood.

The creatinine level is absolutely normal. The normal value of creatinine is 0.5 to 1.5. So nothing to be worry at all. Regarding the blood pressure here is the detail. Blood pressure means the pressure of the blood exerts on the wall of the blood vessels during flowing. What you eat that absorbs into blood and transport to all your trillion and trillions of cells passing through blood.  Inside the cells they are burnt (i.e. called metabolism) and the essential substances are produced and the unused materials are expelled out to the blood again and pass to the kidney . for every work you need energy the energy is produced inside your cells from the nutrients and oxygen that comes through blood. When you run you need more energy so your cell need more nutrients and more oxygen  and thus more blood should flow so that the cell requirement can be fulfill. So for this purpose more blood flows and that’s why it exerts more pressure and that is why your blood pressure rises. It is normal phenomena. If you have diarrhoea, or severe vomiting or profuse bleeding your blood pressure will be low. So what you are telling your blood pressure is varying it is normal. Blood pressure will vary according to the situation.

Any rise above that number is associated with an increase in adverse events. Trails done says that;Every 10 mm rise in diastolic pressure causes a doubling of incidence of adverse events such as heart attack, stroke, kidney failure and heart failure.When the heart beats it pushes blood out into the very large blood vessels. These vessels are elastic and take up some of the force by expanding. Then while the heart rests between beats the large vessels contract towards their normal size thus continuing to push blood around the body. This pressure in vessel during relaxation is called diastolic bp.As age progresses fat starts to accumulate in arteries and they loses their elasticity hence does not relax properly causing a elevated diastolic pressure.Increased diastolic pressure can not be alone treated with medicines ,severe life style modification is required 45 minute of strenous exercise should be donelow salt food must be takenavoid fatty and oily food30 minutes of brisk walk dailyecosprin 75mg can be taken daily prevents future cardisc risk a serum lipid pfl should be doneit will take atleast 3 months to notice any change he is on high dose of ramipril which causes hypokalenia hence he should take potaasium supllements like banana coconut water dailydont use diuretics now first try wat i advised for 3 monthstx"},{"Patient":"I am a 18 year old boy n hav kidney stone. 2 to 3 days back I m hav burning sensation while urination and today even blood came out with the urine a little.

Two years ago,I was diagnosed of a left kidney cyst, 1.6cm..my doctor didn t prescribe any medicine for me because he said the cyst is benign, but I was advised to have urinalysis every 3 months and an ultrasound after a year..It so happened that I am only earning less than what my familiy needs, a hand-to-mouth-existence, I was not able to have my doctors advice..It is already more than two years without any medication and follow ups..And now, I have been suffering from beriberi, more than a week, can be seen on my legs and sometimes on my arms till my face..not so transparent anyways but, I can feel the heaviness of my body..

You should consult a surgeon for proper treatment for stone removal. For kidney stones that do not pass on their own, a procedure called lithotripsy is often used. In this procedure, shock waves are used to break up a large stone into smaller pieces that can then pass through the urinary system. Surgical techniques can also be used for stone removal.

While the main action of atenolol is lowering the heart rate and preventing tachycardia or cardiac arrhythmia. It has a low effect on lowering blood pressure too. So, lisinopril is not equivalent to atenolol, as it has no action on the heart rate.

But, considering your past medical history, angina can not be excluded either. For this reason, I recommend trying an antiacid or PPI (omeprazole, esomeprazole) first. If this helps improve your situation, it would indicate possible gastroesophageal reflux as the main cause of your complaints. In such case a fibrogastroscopy would be needed. But, if your symptoms persist, I recommend consulting with your cardiologist for a careful physical exam and a coronary angio CT scan or Dobutamine stress echo, in order to investigate for coronary artery disease.

She should exercise regularly and Maintain a healthy weight, avoid stress and Practice relaxation techniques like Yoga and Meditation.

Coming to this point, her complaints could be related to an inner ear disorder, chronic degenerations of the cervical spine or low blood flow to the brain, probably caused by narrowed cervical arteries. Another possible cause to consider would be orthostatic hypotension. In such case her symptoms would be triggered by standing up. Does this happen to her?For this reason, I would recommend consulting with an ENT specialist and performing labyrinthine tests to exclude an inner ear disorder first. Other tests to consider if an inner ear disorder is excluded are: - a Doppler ultrasound of the neck vessels to examine the blood flow in them- complete blood count for anemia- blood electrolytes for possible imbalance- fasting glucose- a Head Up Tilt Test for possible orthostatic hypotension. You should discuss with her doctor on the above issues.

Only if this fails surgery is done.Stones can recur in the future.To avoid you should stay hydrated so as to flush the kidneys.Three liters of water on a daily basis is the recommended amount for kidney stones prevention and although this may have you running to the toilet every five minutes, it can stop the painful kidney stones from occurring.

Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy is a procedure where surgeon makes a small incision in the back to remove kidney stones. He/she then puts a hollow tube into the kidney and a probe through the tube. It is done either under, general, regional or spinal anesthesia. A small catheter inserted into the kidney will drain urine until the kidney heals. You father will be needed to stay in the hospital for 2 to 3 days and take rest for a week. The procedure should take 1 to 2 hours on an average but depneding upon the Doctor's expertise, it can be earlier or later than this.

What can you advise him to do?","Doctor":"Dear It is not unusual for people to have only one kidney to do the work that two kidneys ordinarily do. Many people are born with a single kidney - this occurs in about one out of 750 people. This is not usually due to a particular disease or an illness, it is just a variation of nature. Being born with a single kidney is more common in males, and the left kidney is more often absent. A single kidney will grow faster and larger than a normal kidney. For this reason, people with this condition usually have entirely normal kidney function when measured. The increased growth of the single kidney assists in compensating for the absence of the function of a second kidney. the child with one kidney can live normal life except for very hard work Thanks"},{"Patient":"I m 19 and I had a kidney stone that blocked my kidney and caused pyelonephritis and then lead to sepsis, which almost killed me.

I had back surg. in 1991 it left my right leg very weak now I don t have one good leg or foot???

Foot drop could be of variety of reasons and one among them is diabetes. If your diabetes has been well controlled, it is unlikely your diabetes is the sole reason, but still can occur. In such situation NCS and EMG can give us some information. Based on those reports and clinical examination, we could decide on treatment."},{"Patient":"my mother is a hypertensive, but inspite of medication, her bp is 180-190/100-110 mmhg, how to test if she is suffering from renal parenchyma disease,blood test - kidney function test are within normal range, pus cells in urine today 6-10,renal doppler 18 months ago-no stenosis","Doctor":"thanks for the choosing healthcaremagic.I am happy to know that you are worried about effects of blood pressure on kidney,which majority of people are not even aware of.any way come to your query usually kidney function tests  are mirror image of the functions of kidney and when they are normal,we are almost sure about safe kidneys.still you can go for ultrasound for kidneys,for more information.but blood pressure definitely need to be controlled."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 1 year and 5 months old.She was running high fever for about a week and doctors earlier diagnosed ear infection and my baby was put on antibiotis, but at the end when the fever was persistent,it came to us that she had UTI. the pus cells are 6 to 8.Is it quite serious to have pus cells in her urine.Would these pus cells god forbid cause kidney damage.She is again on antibiotics?","Doctor":"FOR YOUR BABY YOU CAN GIVE LAKSHMIVILAS RAS 2TAB 2TIMES FOR 1WK."},{"Patient":"i had blood two times during motion... what is the problem?","Doctor":"Hello..

I have no other symptoms.","Doctor":"Dear S Krishnan, Welcome to healtcaremagic forum... High creatinine and BUN indicates renal failure.. The severity of the condition is predicted by GFR... Dialysis is needed, if one has symptoms of fluid overload, electrolyte abnormalities, or when the GFR is very low - less than 10-15ml/min (normal 120ml/min). Asymptomatic CKD with GFR above 20 can be managed conservatively with fluid and dietary restriction, risk factor control and other supportive medications...

His Creatinine level is around 6.5 since last 3 yrs. He is not on dialysis . However recently he has severe problems with his limb movements and a swollen face with his phosphorous levels have gone high to 7. Can you recommend something.","Doctor":"Welcome to HealthCarMagic I am concerned about 2 things: 1.High phosphate levels. 2.The limb movements which could be from neuropathy secondary to renal failure. High phosphate levels can be corrected by Phosphate binders. They include calcium carbonate and calcium acetate. They will decrease the phosphate by binding to phosphate in the gut. Because they also increase your calcium levels, they should be guided by your MD after carefully looking at the serum calcium levels. If the weakness in limb is getting worse he might need dialysis. Fluid over load can be corrected with diuretics. If the load is not controlled with diuretic medicines, then he needs dialysis.

Kidney stones tend to recurr even after the surgery as the tendency for the formation of stone still persists, unless this tendency is treated a person keeps getting them even after many surgeries.

I m 27 m kolkata. I am suffering from kidney stone of 6 mm in my right kidney which was confirmed after going through USG since 5 months. I am very much afraid of surgery . what is the procedure of removal of kidney stone ? Ayurvedic or Homoeopathy ? Kindly suggest.","Doctor":"Dear Prodipto.. Welcome to healthcaremagic forum.. Kidney stones are often asymptomatic and do not require any treatment. With proper hydration they get flushed out. Treatment is planned if symptoms occur... The treating options are planned based on the size and the location of the stone. A stone of less than 10mm usually gets flushed out. Plenty of water intakes with or without use of diuretics are all that is needed. Stones bigger in size would need therapeutic management - ECWL or cystoscopic removal. In your case, since the size of the stone is smaller, such treatment strategies will be planned only if you persist to have symptoms.. Consult an urologist who will guide you through this.

I m writing on behalf of my elderly mother who doesn t know how to write. She has been experiencing intermittent palpitations that occur sometimes after she eats or in the middle of the night when she is asleep. They are so alarming that she awakens. She takes her blood pressure measurement when this happens and usually her pulse is elevated. The longest episode has been approx. 4 hours. Her medical history is: high blood pressure, tachycardia, thyroid, osteoarthritis and some stomach problems. She takes medication for all. The palpitations frighten her and she wants to know if they are serious to her health or if they will increase her chances of heart attack or stroke. All her medical tests are normal. I have limited information as I don t live with my mother. Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hi, From your mother's data, it seems that there are certain factors which could be the source of her palpitations. In particular, thyroid disease and hypertension can cause palpitations. And both needs work-up to check for complications of chronic hypertension leading to heart failure or thyrotoxicosis/hypothyroidism. This would require thyroid function tests and probably a 2D echocardiogram to check for heart function and structural changes. I highly recommend a check-up with your doctor to check for other signs seen in your mother which would support either of the two possible causes of your mother's palpitations. As well, the doctor would be able to discover any other causes, as your mother is examined. And this would direct treatment, depending on the results. Hope I have answered your query.

Could u explain this in detail?","Doctor":"The transplant rejection is condition in which cells from the transplanted tissue of a donor initiate an immunologic attack on the cells and tissue of the recipient. The donated organ, called an allograft if the donor and recipient are unrelated, is transplanted into the recipient, called the host. Rejection can occur when the host?s immune responses are directed against the graft. The rapidity and reversibility of rejection depend on the various mechanisms involved, such as peritransplant ischemia and mechanical trauma, preformed antibody interactions with graft antigens, alloantigen-reactive T cells, and abnormal tissue remodeling. Graft rejection syndromes can be divided into three subtypes, based on timing of onset and mechanisms involved."},{"Patient":"CAN A URINARY TRACT INFECTION CAUSE BREATHING PROBLEMS ?","Doctor":"Hi..

Normally urine will not contain muscle in it. There can't be muscles present in the urine. But myoglobin, a protein present in the muscle cells, can be found in the urine in cases of muscle destruction. Myoglobinuria is usually the result of rhabdomyolysis or muscle destruction. Any process that interferes with the storage or use of energy by muscle cells can lead to myoglobinuria. The most common causes of myoglobinuria in adults are Alcohol and Drug abuse, usually in relation to muscle necrosis from prolonged immobilization and pressure by the body weight. Prolonged ethanol consumption and seizure activity, similar to excessive physical activity, can produce an imbalance between muscle energy consumption and production, resulting in muscle destruction.  In children and adolescents, the most common causes of rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria are viral myositis, trauma, excessive exercise, drug overdose, seizures, metabolic disorders, and connective tissue disease and also seen in athletes. The appropriate hydration and drugs with frequent monitoring can help the person to come out of the situation."},{"Patient":"sir i have a urin flow problem..........","Doctor":"Hi..

Can hemodialysis be done at home? What are the potential complications of hemodialysis?","Doctor":"Hemodialysis is a procedure in which a machine filters harmful waste and excess salt and fluid from your blood. Dialysis is indicated in patient with renal failure due various causes, pulmonary edema not responding to diuretics, poisoning, severe bleeding diathesis, ascitis without hepatic disease, infectious complications, severe hypertension and severe hyperkalemia. A needle is inserted into arm through a special access point. Blood is then directed through the needle to a machine called a dialyzer, which filters your blood a few ounces at a time. The filtered blood returns to body through another needle. With special training and someone to help, it's possible to do hemodialysis at home. Complications of long term dialysis includes lack of red blood cells anemia, bone diseases, chest, low blood pressure, muscle Cramps, nausea  and vomiting,  fever and chills, inflammation of the membrane surrounding the needle, high potassium levels, which can affect your heart rhythm, nerve damage, infection and  heart disease."},{"Patient":"I had a triple bypass in July of 2009, I healed from my heart surgery, after my release from the hospital I returned home,I was administered back to the hospital only three weeks later due to complications of kidney failure.

Although the sound waves don't really hurt, they are used at such a high strength that the skin can become brush burned.

He is advised renal dialysis for the same and has to undergo Arterio- venous fistula for the same. what is Av fistula?","Doctor":"ESRD is End Stage Renal Disease and the presently your father is in renal failure and needs to drain away the bodily wastes artificially for which frequent dialysis is done. As a part of carrying out the dialysis the AV created. An arteriovenous (AV) fistula is an abnormal passageway between an artery and a vein. Although it most often occurs in the legs or arms, an AV fistula can occur anywhere in the body, including the brain. An AV fistula may also be created surgically to provide access for hemodialysis in people with end-stage kidney failure as in your father?s case. Normally, blood flows from arteries through capillaries and back to the heart in veins. When an AV fistula is present, blood flows directly from an artery into a vein, bypassing the capillaries. If the volume of diverted blood flow is large, tissues downstream receive less blood supply. In addition, heart failure may occur due to the increased volume of blood returned to the heart."},{"Patient":"Should they tell him he is going to die in a few days?

He has been diabetic patient for last 38 years. He is CRF ans presently the frequency of dialysis is biweekly. I want to know: 1. What should be the preferred frequency of dialysis. 2.Whether dialysis can be termed as good ao bad based on some criteria. 3.What should be the levels of creatinine and urea just after dialysis. 4. How much reduction in creatinine and urea is expacted in single attempt of dialysis. 5. What are the chances of reduction of frequecny of dialysis for such patient. 6.WHether some other treatment ( Ayurvedic, Homeopathic etc) shouldbe taken along with Allopathy. 7. Whether this diseases can be cured in allopathy.","Doctor":"As per history the condition is presumed to be End stage renal disease with Diabetic Nephropathy on Biweekly dialysis. Chronic renal failure (CRF) requiring dialysis or transplantation is known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). 1) The preferred frequency of dialysis depends on the blood urea and creatinine levels. If the Glomerular Filteration Rate falls to less than ~20% of normal, symptoms of uremia may begin to occur. They almost are invariably present when the GFR decreases to less than 10% of normal. If these values are on a higher range, dialysis frequency may be more. If its moderate then the frequency reduces. 2). Since dialysis does what is supposed to be done by kidneys(an essential organ for disposing waste), it is more a good than seeing bad in it. 3) As it is the problem of CRF  the levels cant come to normal or subnormal, maximum reduction in creatinine and blood urea levels should be tried at each session without interupting the comfort of the patient. 4) The reduction of creatinine and urea after dialysis depends on the pre dialysis creatinine and urea levels, the nephrologist takes the final decision on this, even if the values are on a higher range. 5) Allopathy medicine never recommends ayurvedic and homeopathic treatment. 6) The disease cant be cured as its a damage to both kidneys, kidney transplantation is the other option. The problems are age of the patient, availablity of donors to donate kidney, the transplantation surgery after that, complictions of transplanted kidney.  To summarise, Dialysis is the longer the better, the slower the better, more often the better, the gentler the better.  Let me give few good medical tips regarding diet for CRF patients on dialysis. Dietician's consult is crucial. a) The diet should maintain a balance of electrolytes, minerals, and fluid in patients who are on dialysis. b) Diet includes high in protein and low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. c) Fluid intake is also restricted. d) Before dialysis, you may be asked to limit protein to slow the progression of kidney disease. At the start of dialysis, you will need much more protein. Many patients need to take vitamin supplements. e) Diet alone can usually meet the requirements for the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Vitamin D may be supplemented, depending on your calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone levels."},{"Patient":"From past two days i am observing some discharge from my pennis...it is white in colour and it is disturbing a lot...i had sex with a call girl last Saturday.Is there any relationship with discharge??","Doctor":"white discharge form penis warns you for sexually transmitted disease. get a screeing test for STD, not to delay. be quick. its better touse   condoms when you have sex with any partner known or unknown."},{"Patient":"my nephwe is suffering from hypertension since 16 years and recentely i came to know that he is advised dialysis for kidney failyre. do hypertension cause kidney failure?","Doctor":"Yes, hypertension which is not controlled or not treated properly can treat kidney failure.

It gets very stressful at times as I am the only Clinical Nurse in the office that sees 25-40 patients a day. On 10/14/11 all of the the sudden I had tremendous (1-10 pain scale it was at least a 9 or 10) pain under the mid section of the rib cage.At the time of the onset of this attack I was in an exam room taking a patient s vitals & going through the normal routine of allergy, medications, etc. updates with the patient, nothing stressful. I had these attacks before but never as bad as this one, and the last attack was about 4-6 months ago & again, was doing nothing stressful at the time. The pain finally subsided after about 15-20 minutes (down to about a 3-4 out of 10). I excused myself from work & drove myself to the hospital (the hospital is 1/8 mi. away from my work). I went into the E.R. & explained to them what was going on, they immediately took an EKG & CXR that showed nothing. After talking with the E.R. Dr. & telling her about the last attack but that there was pain in my back associated with that one. The E.R. Dr. said it sounded like a classic case of gallbladder stones. They performed an U/S of the Gallbladder & it showed no stones however it was enlarged & dilated from what they said. Next, they performed an MRI w/o contrast that showed the gallbladder as distended for the patient s age , again no gallstones. I was D/C from the hospital & was told to follow up with a G.I for an Upper GI Endoscopy and to go from there.

Gallbladder with small calculi should be removed by laparoscopy as small stones bring risk of bile ducts obstruction and acute pancreatitis.2. Chronic liver parenchymal disease most likely means that you have fatty liver. You should avoid alcohol, fatty foods, spicy foods, medicines involving liver to reverse fatty liver process.3. Mild degree of splenomegaly should be consulted with hematologist as this can be a symptom of many many diseases including leukemia, liver hypertension, infectious diseases.4. CBD borderline dilated can be caused by sludge or small stones inside. I suggest you to have liver tests (AST,ALT,GGTP,AP), lipase, amylase, bilirubin checked.You should be operated anyways as small stones are more prone to move to bile ducts and cause acute pancreas disease.Hope I have answered your question.

Two years back, I was diagnosed with fatty liver. Last month, I started feeling extremely weak and consulted a Dr. Blood tests revealed low Haemoglobin levels of 10.8. Last year it was 14. I was advised upper GI endoscopy, Colonscopy and stool for routine and occult blood tested. Upper GI endoscopy result:-Gastritis in antrum and healed duedonal ulcer. Colonoscopy report :Normal. and occult bleeding in stool negative. Dr prescribed Vivolib 500, Omez 500, Kinpride, Pibizyme, ursocol 300 and mild iron supplement Livogen(once daily at night).

How do I strike a balance. Please advise accordingly. I am still young and keep worrying constantly due to my helath conditions.","Doctor":"Hello, You are definitely a high risk for Fatty liver disease. If you dont consume alcohol then it is Non alcoholic fatty liver disease. Weight reduction and restricted intake of Refined carbohydrates will help in the management. No specific medications are available to manage Fatty liver except for Vitamin E intake. You need to monitor you Serum lipid profile and blood sugar profile.Now coming to your anaemia. I would need to know your complete blood profile to check for the nature of anaemia. If it is iron deficiency anaemia intake of Iron intake will help. Only in specific conditions like Thalassaemia (even carriers) and Haemochromatosis oral iron intake is to be restricted. Once the haemoglobin level is normal you need not continue Iron intake. Antral gastritis usually does not reduce Hb levels. Only severe erosions in the GI tract, bleeding ulcers and vascular malformations can cause low Hb levels. Usually Stool for OBT is positive in these cases. I would suggest you to monitor your Hb levels and check stool for Routine examination (as worms are a common cause for anemia). You may discontinue your iron supplements once your Hb level normalises and monitor henceforth. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Would like to understand what this disease is and how far her liver is functioning. Her health is deteriorating day by day and she is loosing weight. We would like to know in which direction her treatment should start..rather what is the next step and probable medicines to be given.","Doctor":"Hello, Unfortunately Chronic liver disease is not a curable condition. It can arise due to various reasons like prolonged diabetes, viral hepatitis, certain alternate medications etc. In CLD the liver functions are compromised. The protein albumin decreases and pressure in the portal vein increases (as the liver gets shrunk). This leads to fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites) and swollen legs (oedema). Fluid overload in the body and ascites can cause breathing difficulties. It is important to check the ascites fluid as it may get infected and an antibiotic course is needed in that cases. There is no specific treatment for CLD. The mainstay of therapy is supportive like prevention of constipation (by lactulose syrup), prevention of bleeding (by Vitamin K injection), drainage of the ascitic fluid, intravenous albumin etc. The liver function tests (including INR) and complete blood counts need to be monitored. Your Gastroenterologist may plan for an endoscopy to check for an venous swelling in the oesophagus. You just need to monitor for some dangerous signs like confusion, severe abdominal swelling, black stool, bleeding from any site. I can just advise to reduce the salt intake in the diet and fluid restriction (depending on urine output). The medical therapy needs to be discussed with your gastroenterologist in details.

Later I found out that I will most likely need a liver transplant within 10-15 years, and if I do not I will die within that time period. So now I really need to ask, how often do people whom need a liver get one based on economic status, location, liver availability ect. and how long is a person expected to live based on things such as living / deceased donor, condition, age of receiver and donor.","Doctor":"Hi,Regarding Liver Transplant: It is of two types one is Live donor and other is Deceased donorLive donor in which half of liver from one person who is normal, is taken out and transplanted in the patient.Advantages- Liver is available immediately.Disadvantages - 1.You have to arrange for donor and it should be your near relative preferably first degree relative and that after some paper work and completing the legal formalities.2. Both donor and recipient undergo major surgeries and donor also have more risk of complications (although it is very safe these days but due to major surgery risk is definitely high)Deceased Donor in which a person who is dead or brain dead is used to get full liver. Advantages - 1. Full liver is available.2. As donor is already dead, no risk to donor.Disadvantage -1. Wait list is very long as it depends on some one who died2. It also depends that whether blood group of that person is matching with you or not.Different hospitals and different regions have their own preferences. In some places, mainly it is Live Donor while in others, it is mainly deceased donor, but live donor is also there.Cost - In private set-up it is quite expensive for surgery and later on for follow up investigations and treatment (which is life long), you would need a monthly expenditure plan just for this. While in Govt. set-up, it would be lesser. Regarding 2nd part of your question - and how long is a person expected to live based on things such as living / deceased donor, condition, age of receiver and donor. The quality of life after liver transplant is excellent if everything goes well. However, there are many factors which effects the outcome both donor and recipient related. It is quite a complicated equation. It depends upon the co morbidities in recipients like heart disease, DM, Hepatits C or B, history of Alcohol or cigarette smoking etc., and quality of liver which you receive like how fatty or fibrotic it is.
