Vacation outside of your area, mobiles phones to be off.You must have noticed already that these changes help a lot. Try to avoid anything which you are / have to do against your will and wish.

There are several physiotherapy procedures which will benefit you such as TENS, Ultrasound treatment, exercises.As you are a personal trainer I will advise you to start with light exercises and concentrate on developing your back muscles. Plan a regime to improve your muscle mass.Talk you your doctor and ask for CT/ MRI spine to rule out disc prolapse. Also consult obstetrician for planning next pregnancy. You can talk to your gynecologist about loss of bladder control. It may be due to reason as simple as urinary tract infection, or due to neurogenic causes. Hence needs to be properly investigated.Hope I have answered your query. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help.Thank you,Dr. Narasimha G L"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...I am into IT job.

The tip of the tail bone has a set of three very small bones with joints between them.

Treatment involves sitting on a ring cushion with a hole at the centre of the cushion. You should sit with the tip of your tail bone on the hole and buttocks on either side.

Well, my question was do this liver  thing make me have horrible back pain and I dont wanna eat anything or drink anything.","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for the query,raised liver enzymes at 65ui/l generally require no serious action. you might advised to test for Hepatis B and C. At this stage, monitoring of liver function shall be the normal practice. It becomes a serious call for concern when the values increase two to three fold (generally greater than 80 and 90).

Severe lower abdominal pain can not be due to acidity; it causes upper abdominal pain.Secondly, your pain is severe and not associated with the menstrual cycle. The most probable causes of a severe pain in lower abdomen which takes breath away can be due to:Twisting of the ovarian cyst.Lower Ureteric stone.Volvulus , meaning twisting of the intestine along its own axis. I would advise you the following in such conditions.First of all get a X-ray of the Abdomen in the standing position. This is the simplest form investigations giving the maximum information particularly when you are in a pain.Ultrasonography, blood and urine test will help for further diagnosis.The treatment will depend necessarily upon the diagnosis one gets."},{"Patient":"I have always had an unusually large tailbone but recently,a patch of hard skin has developed which is pressing on the bone when I sit.It is similar to a callus.Could it be caused by pressure of the bone on the skin which is possibly thinning with age?

If your father is otherwise healthy then this should be no problem. There can be an elevation in blood sugar while on the medication. But since it is only a few days, it is usually safe in otherwise relatively healthy people.

I live in Kenosha wi I am not good at computers,all I know is I need help","Doctor":"Sorry to hear this. First, you must address his psychological state. He very much sounds like he has underlying depression, which is very common after retirement. And uncontrolled depression makes everything worse, including pain disorders. I know it is often taboo, especially in the older generation, to seek mental health care. But it can be a life saver. Because if he can achieve inner peace, his body has a better chance of achieving outer peace. And besides, the brain does control the spinal cord and peripheral nerves, which controls pain and function in all of these areas."},{"Patient":"I have back ache every single day and it's getting worse through the night, it seems to be worse if I have been walking a lot through the day, I am very active and go to the gym but if I stand too long then my back really hurts and it seems to go all round my pelvic area.","Doctor":"It could be Sacro-Iliitis, which is inflammation of the joints that connect the lumbar spine and the pelvis. You should have x-rays taken to begin with. Physical therapy, including use of a Sacro-Iliac Belt, can help. As well, simple injections can be performed, with x-ray guidance, into the SI joint to control the inflammation."},{"Patient":"hi my sister has been uder a doctors care here in santa maria (laggattuda) pain management she has cronic back pain and now has developed adema he has perscribed methadone for pain but she can not function when on it she has swollen ankels due to the adema. can you help? thank you","Doctor":"Everybody's chemistry is different, and your sister may have a reaction to Methadone that results in edema. Ankle edema is often a side effect of anti-inflammatory medications, or NSAIDs (such as Ibuprofen or Naproxen). There are many pain medicines to choose from beyond Methadone. And it sounds like the Methadone might be too sedating? Another newer option that has been well tolerated is Nucynta, which comes in long and short-acting form. I would give that a try. Non-pharmaceutical options should have been tried also, including a TENS unit, or even a lumbar traction unit."},{"Patient":"my mother is having serve back pain and her stomach is also getting fat like a balloon, my doctor have earlier prescribed Ultracet and pan-d, but my mother is not getting relief from that. Now one my my known doctor told me to give her zule forte. Can I give both of these together or suggest me some good remedy for her","Doctor":"You must get to the root cause of pain. And the abdomen increasing in size is a concern.  She must have testing, beginning with an x-ray to begin with, not only to look at the lumbar spine, but to look at the bowels and seek a reason for the bloating. But for acute pain relief, ultracet is for pain, and zulu forte is a muscle relaxant, and you can give them together as long as she is not driving or operating any other type of machinery."},{"Patient":"thanks. i had a colonoscopy on thursday, and now my lower right abdomen is very uncomfortable, and i ve not had a bowel movement since the prep for the test. 9 polyps were removed. should i still feel discomfort, and is this lack of a bowel movement for 3 days a concern?","Doctor":"You are right it is just a paresis of gut due to instrumentation ......you will get relief in 2-3 days"},{"Patient":"hi i had an accident on 1 week of auguest i got injury on head i got 16 stiches over there from that day am suffering from back pain exact back to my chest doctor said that it doesnt need surgery only suggested to take rest can u suggest me how can i get over this pain its horrrible to me cant bare this","Doctor":"If you've had back pain since august, then you must get further testing. Start with an x-ray of the part of the spine that is painful (lumbar for low back, cervical spine for upper back). Then, for treatment, a trial of physical therapy should be done for further relief. If the x-rays don't give much information, then an MRI would be the next test. But, yes, spine surgery should be a last resort after everything else has been tried."},{"Patient":"i get very bad pain in my lower back simply just standing and wwhen i walk the pain gets very unbearable and my back goes numb it goes up my spine and into my neck if i try and walk thru the pain i start sweating and my whole back is numb and i feel as though i am gonna pass out","Doctor":"Numbness of the back itself is usually not worrisome.  The sweating and feeling of passing out sounds like an acute reaction to pain, so you need medications to nip the painful episodes in the bud before they escalate. But the type of medication depends on how long you've been getting this pain. And if it's been months, then you need testing, beginning with x-rays."},{"Patient":"I have been having severe back pain today, with some nausea, and at 2 a.m. I started passing nothing but blood and mucus in the stool.  I'm 64 years old, have had a spinal fusion (that's what I thought the back pain was from) and am having pretty severe pains in my lower abdomen.What should I do at this point?","Doctor":"This sounds more gastrointestinal than spinal. You may have a stomach virus, or less likely food poisoning. If it's not getting better, you should seek emergency treatment, or urgent care, for IV fluids, possible IV anti-nausea medications, and possible abdominal x-rays."},{"Patient":"past 3 to 4 weeks i started having sharp pains in my back (but more to the right side), some days it was there, then would be gone the next. As weeks and days went by the pain increased, and was more daily and constant, it also starting radiating up below my right scapula, and around my right side, to my front below the right side of my ribs. I had blood tests done and an ultrasound - abdomin (upper). The doctor thinks I have shingles, but I have no rash,  and the ultrasound showed an enlarged liver. my pain in now both front and back, and increases with most any movement I do (standing, walking, bending, twisting..etc). the pain is less, and more of a dull pain when laying down. my doctor gave me norco for the pain, but wants me to take acyclovir for shingles, but this medication caused my mom to have kidney failure about 3 months ago, and I'm affraid to take, since the ultrasound also shows I have an enlarged kidney to. Could the enlarged liver cause pain, by putting pressure under my rib cage, causing back and front pain when making movements. (when moving the pain is about a 7 to 9) 10 being the worst, and about a 5-6 when laying down. I heard there is a blood test for shingles, but alot of my problem, is I have no insurance or income to take a lot of test or get treatment. I feel the problem is more with my liver. I am obese, but have lost about 30 lbs since the pain started. I was at 416, and now at 386, but without dieting, with the abdominal pain, I'm just not hungry that much any more, sorry for typing so much...","Doctor":"Organ involvement such as kidney or liver is much less likely to be the cause of this type of back pain. And low cost blood tests can rule out dysfunction of these organs. It sounds more muscular in origin. A course of physical therapy would help greatly. Or even local muscle trigger point injections by the doctor. Topical ice and heat are things that you can do yourself."},{"Patient":"I have been having pain in my back located under my left sholder which I can feel thourgh my chest for a few weeks. The pain is medum in the back and light through the chest. it seems to be at its worst in the am. Could this be related to heart issues?","Doctor":"It is more likely to be muscular than heart-related. Cardiac pain is much more associated with exertion. However, cardiac chest pain must be ruled out, especially if you are in your 40's or beyond. But if you get physical treatments to the shoulder blade, such as massage or physical therapy, that fully resolves the pain, then it would be more clearly muscular."},{"Patient":"I am 45 and smoker, I have had a sharp shooting pain that is going into my left rib cage, in the middle of the rib, it wakes me up at night, and is random on when it happens. I am not sure that I should see a doctor. I has been going on for about 3 days now.","Doctor":"It sounds muscular in origin. You can try NSAIDs, such as Advil or Alleve initially, in addition to topical ice or heat. If these don't help then you should see your doctor."},{"Patient":"Hi  A friend of mine can not walk,stand or sit, she has an extreme high pain tolerance but now is crying from the pain in her lower back. She can't move or have anything touching her back.  The pain runs from her back, hip and down to her knee. She called an ambulance to take her to the emergency room after 10 hours and an x-ray was told that it is her siatica.  She is given morphine but still feels the pain.  She is told to go home and take T3 until she sees her regular doctor.  I am concerned it is not the siactic, can this be misdiagnosed?  What can she do to have the doctors check all possiblities.","Doctor":"A lumbar radiculopathy, or \\"sciatica\\" is one of the most common causes of low back pain that radiates down the leg. They would likely have done screening blood tests in the ER to look at other remote possibilities. In addition to Tylenol #3 she would probably benefit from a prescription muscle relaxant. Otherwise, physical therapy, and then possibly lumbar epidural steroid injection/nerve root block would be the next option."},{"Patient":"Hi, I've been having lower back problems for quite some time at least for 6 mths now. The odd thing is that it happened when I decided to try the cabbage soup diet I was on it for one day with alot of bowel movements, I remember the pain that followed the next few days almost for 2 weeks, I coud barely walk, sit my kids had to tie my shoes, and it has never been the same since.","Doctor":"If you had a lot of bowel movements, with the cabbage soup diet, then there is a distinct possibility that you developed bowel problems, such as hemhorrhoids from the straining. It is less likely to be mechanical/musculoskeletal back pain simply from a course of cabbage soup. I would see your doctor and have the gastrointestinal system checked. Another possibiliyt is the Pilonidal Cyst, which is an infection of the hair follicles around the anus. This can swell up and become exquisitely tender, and would have to be drained. So, again, go see your doctor."},{"Patient":"I woke up with lower back pain and no appetite whatsoever. Its been about 6 hours since ive been awake and im still feeling the pain and i still havent eaten anything even tho my stomach feels empty. I tried forcing myself to eat but it didnt work.

So you must take a rest in regards to strenuous use of the arms. Topical ice or heat on the mid back will help. Over the counter anti-inflammatory medications like Advil or Alleve will help also. If no better with these, then see your doctor, who could prescribe physical therapy or do local muscle trigger point injections."},{"Patient":"I was taking medicine for skin tb for the last three months now i am taking rcinex 600/300 and vitamin benadane.

But the severe pain should be gone within a week."},{"Patient":"Hi...were experiencing something real strange...my husband started having lower back pains not so long ago, and well since yesterday they have been at their worst. And I just notice that he has two bruises that just appeared out of no where...should we worry?","Doctor":"If your husband has no history of any blood disorders, then this is likely nothing to worry about.

Either way it would require conservative treatment: massage, topical ice or heat, or even physical therapy/chiropractic. Antiinflammatories like Advil/Alleve would help also. If none of that helps you should see your doc for xrays, but you would need to see the doc for a physical therapy prescription anyway."},{"Patient":"Hi, my fiance' took a hard blow to the back from being pushed backwards, the stair rail was behind him and hit pretty hard; now his lower left side hurts.

Neither requires surgery, but you should get x-rays taken to rule out a fracture. Otherwise take pain meds/anti-inflammatories to control the pain as it heals. Could also use topical ice."},{"Patient":"I have had this pain spot at end of spine/top of ass crack/tail bone area for a while. I have a high pain tolerance, but this is bothering me too much. It registers in my mind as feeling like a tight spot or nub, but there does not seem to be an actual visible injury to that area. I cannot walk, sit, lay down, or even shift a little without a shooting and stabbing pain there. Even when I find a semi-comfortable position where the pain is at least bearable, there is still a stabbing throbbing pain. It even woke me up from a deep sleep","Doctor":"If there was any history of trauma, the it could be a tailbone injury/fracture. If there is any tender spot, or swelling, then a Pilonidal Cyst could be present, which is an infection of a hair follicle. An x-ray of lumbar spine/tailbone would help with the diagnosis."},{"Patient":"I have undiagnosed lower back problem which my doctor suspects might be a bulging disc.

But went to a museum today and almost asked for a wheelchair.","Doctor":"You would appear to be having residual muscle spasms from the original fall. It is a very good sign that the frequency has decreased. You could use topical ice or heat. Otherwise a muscle relaxant, for intermittent use, from your doctor could help."},{"Patient":"My 15 year old complained of neck and back pain and I noticed a hump/knot at base of neck at c7. Pediatricion ordered an X-ray and ref to ortho but didn't sign order so I am waiting for a new order from her. Any ideas? She's aid could be from a \\"growth spurt\\", but had no real idea what it was","Doctor":"This could very well be from a \\"trigger point\\" of the muscle, which causes pain to radiate in different directions. This can often be injected to release it. Topical ice can be applied also. Sometimes can be from growth deformities. Either way, I wouldn't worry too much, is it sounds less likely to be serious."},{"Patient":"My daughter fell off the monkey bars a week ago. She was sore for the first day or so, but now she tells me her stomach hurts, but only when she jumps. If she s not jumping, she s ok. Do I need to take her in to see a doctor or just keep an eye on it? Are there any specific signs I should watch for after a fall like this?","Doctor":"Hello...dont get panic,she is just having sore muscles which will subside on its own in a few days,just keep a watch she dont do any physical activity which involves sudden movements like jumping,running,climbing stairs..dont give any strong pain killers to a baby,it will do more harm than benefit...."},{"Patient":"had lower back surgery in 2002 and since then I can only sleep in reclined position.also use\\"2\\" arm style crutches as back didnt heal and L4 non fused.I had a large inner thigh cramp about the size of a softball 2 days ago and now is all black and blue from knee up half the thigh and not able to lift leg as it hurts to lift it and the pain is from right side of buttock down to knee then down to bottom of foot","Doctor":"First, if there is any swelling, warmth, or exquisite tenderness to the thigh, then you should get it evaluated to rule out a blood clot. But for low back pain that radiates down to the leg, your best bets would be physical therapy and possibly a lumbar epidural steroid/nerve root block injection."},{"Patient":"yes sir this is s.m karim i have disc prolapse before 20 years and had surgery in dxb but after 2 years again i had pain started before 2 years i took mri it was shown that i had l3-l4-l5and s1 problem dr advised me to do surgery what is your advise","Doctor":"It depends on the severity of the disc injuries. But the rule in general regarding the spine is to keep surgery only as a last resort. Try everything else first: physical therapy, massage, acupuncture, medications, etc. Then only if things remain unbearable then consider surgery, because the outcomes of spine surgery simply aren't as reliable as we would like (or as reliable as the surgeons would admit!)."},{"Patient":"Hello Dr. Good Morning This morning i woke up i bend down to take something from floor i am having a terrific backache dr.  i had 3 dose of voltaren Retard but no relief and even i massage with some pain killer cream but i have no relief Dr..  Please help me Dr.thanks YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"You need acute pain relief. Topical ice would help greatly. If no better with that, and with the voltaren/paincream, then you may simply need stronger pain meds for the short term, like hydrocodone, as well as muscle relaxant medications, both of which you'll need to see your doctor for."},{"Patient":"hi=) my daughter is 11 . she has been complaining intermitantly  about back pain and yesterday andtoday she can not move well because of it. i started in gym class yesterday while she was running. but she had complained many occassion before this, i thought it was herbed or the way she sleeps with 3 pillows. what specialist shall  i take her to? a sports medicine dr?","Doctor":"You should start with her Pediatrician, as backpain in an 11 year old is not that common. Often it is a simple bony abnormality, such as scoliosis. She should have an x-ray ordered by her pediatrician, who can refer to a specialist based on the results. I wouldn't worry too much, however. It is often nothing serious."},{"Patient":"Im 14, weighing 65-69 kg and im a female. I have pain on my lower left part of my back 3 days after running during PE.

I feel dizzy whenever I try to stand up quickly and i am always tired/sleepy. My skin has loss most of its tan but now it looks a little pale. Not too pale. Should i see a doctor?","Doctor":"Yes, you should see a doctor. It would start with some screening lab studies, particularly to look at your Complete Blood Count. An internal medicine problem must be ruled out before considering a musculoskeletal cause of your pain. And the fatigue, paleness, and dizziness are definitely a concern. It could be some form of anemia, so testing is needed."},{"Patient":"Im 14, weighing 65-69 kg and im a female. I have pain on my lower left part of my back 3 days after running during PE.

He also has not a broken spine but a compressed and swollen spine from the accident that happened 3 weeks ago.  He has been paralyized but has regained feeling in his toes, feet, knees, can feel urinating, passing stool and farting, can feel his shoulder and move one hand and his eyes.","Doctor":"The foot should do just fine post replacement. But he obviously has some level of spinal cord injury. His ultimate functional level will likely be determined by where he is at functionally/neurologically at about the 12 week mark. So, he should be a part of a good Spinal Cord Rehabilitation program to maximize his recovery."},{"Patient":"I recently had a CT scan done on my pelvis due to pain in my lower back,  and groin area and goes down my right leg which was caused by a car accident last August.  The CT scan showed that my bone marrow on the right side looks abnormal. A full body scan has been ordered for me.  What could the diagnoses be?","Doctor":"often such a finding is benign, but obviously the doctor wants to be sure there is no sort of true bone marrow abnormality or blood disorder. But since the result is many times not worrisome, you should not fear the worst prior to the bone scan."},{"Patient":"Hi,Yesterday, my friend tripped me over from the back of my ankle and I fell on the grass. The right side of my back hurt and I had a headache. The next morning I woke up and the right side of my back and neck hurt. After a few hours, I felt dizzy when I walked. When I tried to look or concentrate at something, I felt even more dizzy. What can I do to stop feeling dizzy and cure the back/ neck pain?","Doctor":"Topical ice would help greatly with the muscle spasms, as would over the counter antiinflammatories (Advil or Alleve). The dizziness could be coming from head trauma, or from jerking of the neck, or from the ongoing muscle spasms. Rest and the above measures should help, but if you develop vomiting, or pass out at all, then you should seek medical attention."},{"Patient":"wHEN i'M SLEEPING i WAKE UP TO HORRIBLE PAINS IN THE CENTER OF MY LOWER ABDOMINE.

So, topical ice, antiinflammatory medications (advil/alleve), topical creams (aspercreme, tiger balm), massage can all help. If it doesn't improve over the next week or so, then you should see a doctor to get an x-ray of the chest/ribcage."},{"Patient":"My father aged 70 had a lacunar infaraction an year ago.After consulting a neurologist and taking few pills  he recovered 90 percent.But, he also developed server pain in the lower back and in the legs region, which is  causing extreme difficulty while walking.He however manages to walk a mile per day slowly.After consulting an orthopedican and getting an MRI done, he discovered that there is a disc bulge l4 l5  and thats causing the problem and suggested phisio-therpay as a solution. But phisiotherapy didnot work and he is still facing the same problem.When consulted with other doctors, they are of the opinion that it may be related to the brain or due to lacunar infaraction and not really anything to do with disc bulge l4 l5 ( herniated disc), or wear and tear in the spinal cord which is generally associated with this age. We are a kind of unsure as to whom to contact and how to proceed with medication. Please help as what can we do from here","Doctor":"I would say that the pain is very unlikely to be related to the lacunar infarct. It is more likely due to degeneration of the spine, which is indeed age related. I would consider surgery an extreme last resort. But if physical therapy didn't work, then medications (like easy-to-tolerate pain killers like Tramadol or Nucynta) would help, as well as likely lumbar epidural steroid injections."},{"Patient":"my back hurts when i bent it. it has been a couple days and when someone press on my stomach it is quite painful, specially when lying down. i been under a lot of stress lately just to add on to everything. today when i went to the washroom i peed blood but it was only one time. what do you think thats happening?","Doctor":"With blood in the urine, you have to strongly consider the possibility of a bladder infection, or the possibility of a kidney problem. Therefore you should see your doctor to explore these possibilities."},{"Patient":"I have back pain, right side, above waist, no symptoms otherwise of kidney infection nor do I get them. It's getting worse since last night when it started suddenly, Advil didn't dent it. Trying to figure out what's causing it. I'm physically active, no problems. Thanks! L","Doctor":"Quite often the cause of back pain is musculoskeletal. You may have slept awkwardly, or incurred some other gradual physical trauma. Topical ice would help control the stifness/spasms. You also could apply topical pain cream such as Aspercreme. If there are no other symptoms, the it's just a matter of rest and pain control until it heals and resolves. But if over the counter pain meds aren't cutting it, then you may need to see your doctor to get something stronger, and/or a muscle relaxant. Another quick option is chiropractic."},{"Patient":"yes i  vomited and hurt my back ... the er doc  was having a bad day or something   and i think he missed something  .... it has been 3 weeks and im still in serious pain,...       what could have happened  what should i look for with my normal doc during followup","Doctor":"At this point you should have an x-ray done. Most often the cause is still musculoskeletal, so a trial of physical therapy would be in order. Injections could also help: local muscle trigger point injections can be done in the office, or you could be referred for spinal epidural steroid injections done with x-ray guidance."},{"Patient":"My husband fell on his back, landing on a block of wood.  He felt a burning/stinging pain in his low back (like he'd cut himself) & felt like vomiting.  He has taken a muscle relaxant, put an ice pack on for 15 minutes, had a bath & is icing again.  What else can I do for him?  Should he get an x-ray?","Doctor":"If the pain does not resolve within a week, then an x-ray would be in order. Continued icing is a good idea, as are continued muscle relaxants.

Chronic back conditions are prone to flare-ups as you know. This sounds like an elevation in muscle spasms. So a trial of a new muscle relaxant would be in order, as well as a course of physical therapy. If the new symptoms persist for weeks despite treatment with medication/therapy, then an MRI would be warranted."},{"Patient":"I have had hip pain for almost 6 months...went to dr, did    x-ray....diagnosis was trochanteric bursitis...also had MRI on my back.....slight stenosis, level 1 slippage...took steroids for the usual 6 doses...then an injection in the hip...now in physical therapy and she feels it is not the ilitobial band as the dr suggested but tight glutes...says I am not tight in the IT band area....no relief of any kind yet, still at square 1....going to quit the PT....no confidence when the dr and PT do not agree as to the problem and especially when she wants me to start each session of PT riding a bike...I hurt when walking or standing....very tired ot this","Doctor":"I would further explore the hip by way of an MRI of the hip, looking for any possible hip ligament tears.

But this 4-5 month juncture is probably a good time to see your doctor and at least get an x-ray. Also anti inflammatories and/or muscle relaxants will likely calm the muscles of the back/rib cage."},{"Patient":"Hello I have a son that is 10 year old. he had a sharp pain on his lower back fallowed by a dizzy and cold sweat spell he had a blueish color on him and as this happened he also had a loss of bladder control.

Two doctors think it is gonorrhea.","Doctor":"Well I understand your problem.First of all , if the gonorrhea test is positive ,you and your partner should get treated for the same.Secondly, you have abdominal pain ,bloating sensation with dark or bright colored urine.This highly suggests of Jaundice.I would like to suggest you to get your Liver function test done along with WBC counts.It is a blood test and we can come to know if there is any injury to your liver.and also keep an eye on your skin color and stool color as well.If you see yellowish discoloration of your skin or eyes or pale or dark stool please report it  to your family physician."},{"Patient":"The right side of my middle to lower back hurts.

It is usually tender to touch, and when manipulated can send pain radiating in different directions. It responds well to local injections of lidocaine, called trigger point injections. It can also respond to massage therapy, as well as acupuncture."},{"Patient":"hi. i suffer from constant and limiting back pain. i have been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease, syringomyelia, schmorels nodes, slight scoliosis and today was diagnosed with scheuermanns disease by a surgeon. can u tell me what scheuermanns disease is, i can only find info about the disease in children. im 41 yrs old, have had back pain here and there since my 20 s. in the last 8 yrs it has increased a little more frequently but manageable. in the last 1 to 2 yrs it has gotten so bad that i am unable to work.","Doctor":"Scheuermann's disease is a malformation of the backbones, commonly of the thoracic spine of the mid back.

Other options with this condition include local muscle trigger point injections, and acupuncture, not to mention medication management."},{"Patient":"mid to lower left back and side pain I have been having a terrible pain in my mid to lower back and it goes around to my left side it has been going on for a while now but it has gotten so.bad this week that I can barely stand or sit and it hurts to even lay down. should I got to the doctor about this what could it be?","Doctor":"It is very likely musculoskeletal, but if it has been going on for weeks to months, then you should have it evaluated, starting with an x-ray. A course of physical therapy or chiropractic could be the first treatment upon seeing a doctor, but you could start antiinflammatory medications (Advil/Alleve) at home."},{"Patient":"I just had lower back surgery and some nerves were pinched b my left leg for left leg has no pain but right leg has pain and two last toes are numb. Doctor said work was mma mainly done Linn right side and that our should stop in a few days outs this true","Doctor":"Yes, spinal nerve roots can be \\"jangled\\" during spine surgery. Nerve tissue is particularly delicate, so it can take months, and sometimes years, for it to settle down.

The pain is also probably provoking anxiety. So you should seek treatment/medications to calm your system, such as anti-anxiety treatment. And since that involves seeing a doctor, you should be evaluated for inherent high blood pressure as well. And of course, better control of the pain will allow for less shock to your system, so getting back on your pain meds will help that also."},{"Patient":"Hi I have been experiencing upper right back pain for 4 weeks now and have lost over a stone in 2 months.

I took a course of 500mg Flucloxacillin afterwards.","Doctor":"Any pain associated with unexplained weight loss warrants imaging, including x-rays followed by MRI, to rule out a mass.

Topical ice, anti-inflammatory medications (advil/alleve), or massage could help greatly. Sometimes muscle spasms from one region (low back) can communicate with the muscles of a neighboring region (upper back), so this is common and not likely worrisome. If these measures don't work, see your doctor and they can prescribe physical therapy/chiropractic."},{"Patient":"I have been having back pains and tightness for over a year now, but the pain has drastically got worse the past month. I have also noticed a lump under my skin in the lumbar section of my spine a few months ago, about nickel size. I can move the lump around with my fingers. I went to a family practitioner and he took x rays and says I have a slight curve in my lumbar (scoliosis) and that the lump is a cyst. He also told me that I need to change career field due to my back problems. I am an HVAC technician so my job is physically demanding. Should I get a second opinion? Does his diagnoses sound right? Should I find a new career? So many questions.","Doctor":"Advising a career change right off the back is certainly jumping the gun. This type of fatty cyst, if it is indeed a \\"lipoma\\" is very common, and if it is too tender to lie on, then it can be removed in a simple surgical procedure. You should have x-rays and MRI's of the lumbar spine for further evaluation before any grand statements about career should even be considered. Definitely get another opinion. And physical therapy should be tried also."},{"Patient":"I am a 54 year old male, in otherwise very good health. I had lower back pain for about a week and it has mostly subsided (almost completely).

That is a very significant question and i appreciate your problem. I will try my best to answer your queryI wont suggest the over the counter pain killers- they can have serious side effects. And should really be avoided as they mix up the examination by your primary care physician.However, I would suggest that you spend the time in few basic investigations like the x ray of the spine so that the examining physician has something more specific to go on, and so you can get relief faster with properly prescribed medicines.I think eventually he will need you to put you up on physiotherapy , and medicines like pregabalin/gabapentin, but lets be sure about the diagnoses firstI hope this helps you.

I will try my best to answer your queryI think one thing that you may try is using a lumbar belt. This is a belt like structure that you tie to the stomach. It makes sure that the muscles of the back are supported while you move.

I am Dr Saumya Mittal, MD.Read your query. That is a very significant question and i appreciate your problem. I will try my best to answer your queryThe backache is probably due to the constant stooping posture you assume while working on your console. The best possible way to avoid this pain therefore is to keep taking short breaks when you move from the console and mobilize yourself and take short walks. This will help in relaxing the constant stooped posture of the frame of the body and will relax the muscles. The walks will also help you move and therefore have some mild exercise that may help in reducing the growth of your increasing size of the belly. Exercise is the best option for growing belly size.

There is a very high likelihood that your spine surgeon is right. Sprains of the paravertebral muscles can cause those sharp pains. Now, how do you deal with it. Ideally, resting that area is very important. You need to stop lifting things for awhile and see if you can get assigned lighter work, maybe paperwork for a few weeks.Nextly ask your doctor to give you some muscle relaxants that can help loosen up the muscles. Pain killers and back massages are helpful as well. A lumbar support belt can be used when you are up and about and dhould help the muscles heal faster. If none of these things work. Then you will need to get an MRI of your back to see the extent of the injury.I hope this helps.

Do not lie down on soft mattress use hard one instead, do not sit for longer duration and do not travel long distance for 2 weeks . You can also apply some good anti inflammatory pain killer gel on your back. If the pain increases do some hot fermentation locally and make a routine of doing some back strengthening exercise daily .

One client in particular needs assistance with chronic back pain and other medical issues. Can you help me, Dr. Grief?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for your query.I suggest you to follow the below mentioned measures to reduce your back pain-- Usually 1-2 days of bed rest will calm severe back pain. Do not stay off your feet for longer, though.- Avoid lifting weights as it imparts more strain on your back- Change your daily activities so that you avoid movements that can cause further pain, especially bending forward and lifting as it will worsen the intervertebral disc problems. if you want to bend forwards, do it with your hips and knees flexed.- Use a lumbosacral back support to stabilize your spinal muscles and to provide support for your spinal column.- After the initial pain has subsided, remedial exercises to strengthen the spine are very important to restore normal spinal movements and muscle strength. The main aim of exercise is to encourage mobility, reduce muscle spasm, prevent further deterioration in the muscles and speed recovery.- You should maintain an optimum body weight to decrease the strain on your vertebral column causing more degeneration and arthritic changes.- At times, spinal steroid injections and Facet blocks will help in alleviating the lower back pain.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"My mother is suffering from spinal tb.her age is 55.she has pre and para vertebral abscess extending from D10 to D12.she is suffering from severe back pain and stomach pain.now she is bed ridden.she can t even sit because of pain.plantar reflex is normal.now she is taking anti tuberculosis drug.when will she become normal?is surgery is required?when she will walk and do her normal day to day works?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to Health care magic forum.

When the defect is large enough the spinal cord can protrude from the gap.Spina bifida occulta is a condition in which the gap is very small and it does not allow the spinal cord to protrude.It is asymptomatic in majority of cases however, it can be associated with back pain not responding to conventional treatment for back ache.Surgical closure of the defect is possible however, the functional abnormalities (if present) cannot be corrected.However, functional abnormalities are rare with spina bifida occulta.Thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"I have had a sharp and achy pain in my very low left back for the past three days.

Because it is in your right side, be careful not to favour your right side more than the left. This is a bad habit and will lead to more injury in the future as it creates an unnatural balance of muscle. Do not lie in bed for more than 48 hours as you will begin to weaken the muscles and increase the chances of recurring lower right back pain. Try to continue with your non-strenuous daily activities if possible.You can apply ice for the first 24 to 48 hours if there is swelling. After ice treatment, or if there is no swelling, apply heat in order to increase blood flow to the painful area.Tylenol should be your first choice for pain medication. If Tylenol is not available, try other anti-inflammatory medication.Start light stretching and exercise after a few days.If your fear of re-injury is preventing you from performing normal functions, make an appointment to see a specialist.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"my wife is suffering with her lower back  when she has stood doing her jobs around the house she has had lower back trouble in the past but has been ok for some time now is there a recommmended pain killer that has no side effects she is 72 and is not on any hp/t tablets","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for your query.The following measures will help with the pain• Lie on a hard bed.• Anti -inflammatory drugs like Tablet Motrin 1 tablet as and when required ( do not repeat a dose before 6 hours) with food will help relieve the pain. • Avoid forward bending.• Correct your posture while sitting• Avoid prolonged sitting • Avoid strenuous activity & lifting heavy weights.• Apply diclofenac gel on the affected area.

The back ache which you are complaining about is most likely due to the spine problem. By your history i assume that when they say that your spine is not straight , you might be having a condition called as scoliosis (mild to moderate) and the pain might be due to the bent spine.     But its really helpful if you can give me complete details of your liver and intestine problems as you have mentioned. That ways its easier for us to rule out the possible causes in your case.If the pain is getting relieved while taking tablets and then recurring it might have some underlying deformity.   Get a Xray done of the lower spine as well as the cervical spine and do consult a orthopedician with the results . He will be able to assess and evaluate you better. Meanwhile reduce stress, straining yourself by excess work load, or heavy exercises. A course of physiotherapy will bring you a lot of relief and you could sleep on a flat surface for reducing the pain..Hope this helps and answers your query satisfactorily .Do write back to us if you need further assistance,Wishing you good health .Take care,Regards."},{"Patient":"Fell down steps, hit the step with upper right back, pain under right breast, severe right after fall,eased enough to get to a bed.

Back pain is honestly one of the worse things in the world to experience for any amount of time and all you want to do is get rid of it. Back pain after Cesarean can be caused by the epidural that was in your spine during the surgery.Back pain after Cesarean can also caused by a muscle imbalance of your abdominal muscles during pregnancy being stretched to their limit and our back muscles being constantly tight to compensate for our weak abdominal muscles. A muscle imbalance such as this can throw out spine and pelvis out of whack, thus causing constant back pain.Alternating hot and cold remedies can also be helpful. This is something simple that you can do right in the comfort of your own home. For example, lay on a heating pad for no more than an hour - and usually half an hour will do - and then replace it with an ice pack.One of the greatest things in the world for back pain as well is going to be hot baths. Just throwing in some Magnesium sulfate salt and soaking in the tub for a while will definitely help you a great deal. And finally, Mild exercise and Physiotherapy is great for back pain after Cesarean. Physiotherapy  strengthens abdominal muscles while stretching the back muscles. Physiotherapy achieves this with a series of gentle exercises. Thus, making it the perfect solution for back pain after Cesarean.Hope this helps.Please write back for further queries.Wishing you good health."},{"Patient":"Mri shows severe disc height loss and small disc osteophyte complexes, mild canal stenosis and moderately severe foraminal stenosis sencondary to uncinate spurring along with posterior annular fissure all in cervical spine.

Do not stay off your feet for longer, though.- Avoid lifting weights as it imparts more strain on your back- Change your daily activities so that you avoid movements that can cause further pain, especially bending forward and lifting as it will worsen the intervertebral disc problems. if you want to bend forwards, do it with your hips and knees flexed.- Use a lumbosacral back support to stabilize your spinal muscles and to provide support for your spinal column.- After the initial pain has subsided, remedial exercises to strengthen the spine are very important to restore normal spinal movements and muscle strength. The main aim of exercise is to encourage mobility, reduce muscle spasm, prevent further deterioration in the muscles and speed recovery.- You should maintain an optimum body weight to decrease the strain on your vertebral column causing more degeneration and arthritic changes.- At times, spinal steroid injections and Facet blocks will help in alleviating the lower back pain.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"This is the second time I am trying to place query in regards to L5-s1 inter-vertebral disc spaces are mildly reduced.

It has been going on for almost two years now.  Do I need to go see the doctor immediately or is there any stretching techniques I can do to fix it.  If i need to see the doctor what kind of doctors I should see.  Thank you","Doctor":"Hi,Low backache looks like a positional anomaly. The low back ache is a result of muscle spasm which in itself is a protective mechanism body develops so that the back avoids abnormal posture. For pain to go, it takes not only rest (on a comfortable bed) but also avoidance of particular positions (during work, rest or recreation).Avoid sleeping on sides and stomach in case you do. While on work don't sit in one position for more than an hour and take frequent stretch breaks. Do not bend forward to lift things up, bend the knees and hips for that. Also discontinue any strenuous activity or exercises for some time.Having said that, you might want to consult your orthopaedician for a detailed physical examination and appropriate investigations.For future query, you can directly approach me through my profile"},{"Patient":"got severe back pain.... im a software engineer. on 14th feb i slept on bed with matress and next day morning it started with a fair amount of pain and now its killing pain... cant walk easily. cant do anything easily.. please can anyone help me what is the matter with me....","Doctor":"HiYou have severe muscle spasm  leading to backache.

Today I went sled riding with my children and when I went down the hill I ended up hitting my tailbone in the wood part of a big bush.

Can anyone help me with this. Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for writing to HCM.Based on the description, your symptoms are highly suggestive of COCCYDYNIA (pain arising in and around the tail bone -coccyx). This condition is caused by an injury or stress that affects the tailbone, as well as the muscles and nerves surrounding it. An xray of the sacrum is needed to rule out any bony injury (fracture)The general treatment guidelines for the condition are as follows -* Sit completely upright with proper posture — keeping your back firmly against the chair, knees level with your hips, feet flat on the floor and shoulders relaxed* Sitz baths (which involves soaking hips and buttocks in warm water)* Lean forward while sitting down* Sit on a doughnut-shaped pillow or wedge (V-shaped) cushion* Apply heat or ice to the affected area *Physical therapy involving strengthening of pelvic area muscles , stimulation with ultrasound therapy* Take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil)If your symptoms are not resolving with the above measures, consult an orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation and management.

I am on pantalaprozole and zantac. Still have same symptoms. I just had tests for my gall bladder which were normal. So now my Dr is finally sending me to a specialist, but not for 2 months. I m suspecting a paraesophageal hiatal hernia bc of my symptoms. Everything I eat causes pain in my back, & my food feels stuck, sometimes with nausea. I m worried about waiting so long to see the specialist. How do I know if I should go to the ER? And what can I eat or what should I avoid doing in the meantime?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us. The pain in the back that you have is due to hiatus hernia. It is best to have small frequent meals and avoid lying down after the meals.

I have had 9 sets of injections in my back and just had 6 weeks of Graston, slowburn excerise and dry needleing - the Graston, etc. has helped with the pain some but still have the deep sore pain in the middle of my lower back - any suggestions.","Doctor":"Hello sir You have a valid question to which I want to answer with a simple illustration our spine is like a snake it is flexible and can bend to a great extend. What spinal fusion surgery does is it makes two units into one so they ease the pain , but what it also does it makes the back stiff,so now the load on the adjacent vertebra is more on bending. The drawback is now the spine has lost its flexibility. Earlier in the spine were 33 units each unit contributing to the flexibility now after fusion surgery at one level renders two vertebrae into one unit so now  only 32 vertebrae can bend. It also increases the load on the vertebrae level one above and one below the fused vertebra.  So in long run they also we'd start paining, which has started now with uwhat u need to do now is take care of your back, avoid straining it. Take your doctors opinion and get an Mri done to see the status of disc prolapse on adjacent vertebra and get treated appropriately"},{"Patient":"I have been having lower back pain almost tailbone pain since my 3yr old twins where born..

It had started in the morning after getting out of bed and got suddenly worse  PM. She received Oramorph (liquid morphine), a Paracetamol drip and Entinox. These did little to reduce the pain.  Later she was given Tramadol. This helped slightly. Blood tests were normal, apart from the D Dimer test which was raised (level 21). Initially though to be a blood clot on her lung, the Consultant said that that was unlikely as an X Ray of her chest was clear and heart trace normal. She was then given Diazepam (to relax her muscles). This seemed to help and later that day she was discharged. She is still in a lot of pain. The medication does help when it kicks in. She had a check-up today. The Doctor said he could detect muscle strain as he side and back muscles were in spasm. Any idea what caused this, what it is, is it likely to return and what about the D Dimer level?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for your query.I suggest you to try back strengthening exercises by extension of the back muscles which can be taught by your Orthopedician or Physiotherapist. This will help to relieve the possible muscle strain which causes the pain.you may be prescribed pain killers and/or muscle relaxants which should give you relief. Physiotherapy may also be advised if necessary. I would suggest you to try swimming as this will help most in back conditions.Avoid weight bearing exercises.

Core stabilizing spine exercises will help.You may consult physiotherapist for further guidance. He may start TENS, or ultrasound which is helpful in your case.Hope this helps.

Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for your query.• Lie on a hard bed.• Use a lumbosacral back support to stabilize your spinal muscles and to provide support for your spinal column.. After the initial pain has subsided, remedial exercises to strengthen the spine are very important to restore normal spinal movements and muscle strength. The main aim of exercise is to encourage mobility, reduce muscle spasm, prevent further deterioration in the muscles and speed recovery.. You should maintain an optimum body weight to decrease the strain on your vertebral column causing more degeneration and arthritic changes.• Avoid forward bending.• Avoid strenuous activity & lifting heavy weights.• Apply diclofenac gel on the affected area. Warm compresses will also help.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"i had an epidural for lower back, after 10 days of a new pain (up and down back) i went back to dr complaining about pain.

Do not stay off your feet for longer, though.- Avoid lifting weights as it imparts more strain on your back- Change your daily activities so that you avoid movements that can cause further pain, especially bending forward and lifting as it will worsen the intervertebral disc problems. if you want to bend forwards, do it with your hips and knees flexed.- Use a lumbosacral back support to stabilize your spinal muscles and to provide support for your spinal column.- After the initial pain has subsided, remedial exercises to strengthen the spine are very important to restore normal spinal movements and muscle strength. The main aim of exercise is to encourage mobility, reduce muscle spasm, prevent further deterioration in the muscles and speed recovery.- You should maintain an optimum body weight to decrease the strain on your vertebral column causing more degeneration and arthritic changes.- At times, spinal steroid injections and Facet blocks will help in alleviating the lower back pain.- Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is another procedure which is used to reduce pain. RFA can be used to help patients with chronic (long-lasting) low-back and neck pain and pain related to the degeneration of joints from arthritis. The degree of pain relief varies, depending on the cause and location of the pain. Pain relief from RFA can last from six to 12 months and in some cases, relief can last for years. More than 70% of patients treated with RFA experience pain relief. I personally feel that your symptoms will improve with the above measures and you can go well with all your regular activities of daily living.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"Hi I am a 27 year old white female.

Do not stay off your feet for longer, though.- Take rest breaks throughout the day, but avoid sitting for long periods of time.- Maintain optimum body weight,if you are obese- Avoid lifting heavy weights as it imparts more strain on your back- Change your daily activities so that you avoid movements that can cause further pain, especially bending forward and lifting  as it will worsen the disc protrusion. if you want to bend forwards, do it with your hips and knees flexed.- Use a lumbosacral back support to stabilize your spinal muscles- Intermittent pelvic traction (under the supervision of a physiotherapist) might be helpful to cause a regression of the protruded disc- After the initial pain has subsided, remedial exercises to strengthen the spine are very important to restore normal spinal movements and muscle strength. The main aim of exercise is to encourage mobility, reduce muscle spasm, prevent further deterioration in the muscles and speed recovery.- Use analgesics and muscle relaxants to relieve pain and muscle spasm, as needed. Vitamin B12 supplements & Pregabalin may be helpful in controlling the neuropathic pain.If your fail to improve with the above measures, an Epidural steroid injection may provide good symptom relief for a few months. There is good evidence that epidural injections can be successful in 60-70% of patients who have not been helped by 6 weeks or more of conservative management ( nonsurgical care).Hope this information is helpful. Good day"},{"Patient":"have had very low back pain for about two weeks now...mostly on left side.

Do gentle, low-impact exercising such as swimming or cycling. See a physio for instruction on building muscles to support your lower back. These are simple conservative measures. If these produce no benefit then you may need to consider epidural steroid injections which reduce the inflammation around the nerve root.Regards,Dr K A Pottinger,MBChB  FRCA"},{"Patient":"my mom having back pain. we took scan also. some doctors said need to surgery in thoracic curve affected. if any other remedies for back pain. my mom taking tablets when she have a pain. that is for few hour of relief. i just want know about status, surgery need or not, and approximate surgery expanse ?","Doctor":"hi,    For back pain it is required to diagnose the condion first n if there is no any gross bony abnormality or nerological involvement then the treatment is conservative through regular physiotherapy , analgesic , ppi, vit , n prosthesis , warm compression with life modification.

If it persists beyond 1 month, then further investigations are done. Since you have a bad pain I will suggest the following: - Back pain can be due to many reasons. You should get x-ray lumbosacral spine done in AP and Lateral done send us report or discuss it with your doctor. Only then further management can be advised. - Avoid heavy weight lifting pushing and pulling heavy objects, because it will further increase back pain. - You can take medicine like painkillers + muscle relaxants by discussing it with your doctor. You may need stronger pain-killers which are available on prescription only. You can try ibuprofen or naproxen till you see your doctor. - Apply hot packs for 30 min in morning and evening .

To confirm the diagnosis, a magnetic resonance scan will be demanded.Treatment may be nonsurgical or surgicalNonsurgical treatment is recommended in patients who do not have neurological deficits. This involves rest, non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (e.g Ibuprofen or Naproxen), physical therapy and epidural steroid injection (needs to be done by an expert).In the majority of cases, a herniated lumbar disc will slowly improve over a period of several days to weeks. Typically, most patients are free of symptoms by 3 to 4 months. However, some patients do experience episodes of pain during their recovery.Only a small percentage of patients with lumbar disc herniations require surgery. Spine surgery is typically recommended only after a period of nonsurgical treatment has not relieved painful symptomsIn my opinion, I would suggest you take an appointment with your doctor for proper evaluation  and management but in the meantime you may take some anti inflammatory drugs to relieve the pain.I hope this answers your query.I wish you good healthDr Bihle"},{"Patient":"I'm 17, around 5'4, and weigh 105 pounds.

You may get the following tests: CBC, Quantiferon Gold Test for Tuberculosis, mantoux, PCR for TB.If no medicines is helping , it is wise to get started in anti-tubercular treatment on an empirical basis.

If periods have not started within 10 days of expected period dates, or if you have got abnormal periods, or if you suspect chances of pregnancy, consider visiting your doctor/gynecologist at the earliest for thorough examination (to confirm pregnancy related changes/signs in body) and blood/serum HCG level test (to confirm/rule out pregnancy accurately).

Do not stay off your feet for longer, though.- Change your daily activities so that you avoid movements that can cause further pain, especially bending forward and lifting  as it will worsen the disc protrusion. if you want to bend forwards, do it with your hips and knees flexed.- Avoid lifting heavy weights as it imparts more strain on your back- Use a lumbosacral back support to stabilize your spinal muscles- Use analgesics like advil or aleve and muscle relaxants to relieve pain and muscle spasm, as needed. Vitamin B12 supplements & Pregabalin may be helpful in controlling the neuropathic pain.- After the initial pain has subsided, remedial exercises to strengthen the spine are very important to restore normal spinal movements and muscle strength. The main aim of exercise is to encourage mobility, reduce muscle spasm, prevent further deterioration in the muscles and speed recovery.If your fail to improve with the above measures, an Epidural steroid injection may provide good symptom relief for a few months. There is good evidence that epidural injections can be successful in 60-70% of patients who have not been helped by 6 weeks or more of conservative management ( nonsurgical care).Hope this information is helpful.

Recently I began experiencing pressure on my tail bone when I need to defecate. I'm sick of the constant pain...any ideas?","Doctor":"Hi,I have read your problem.Usually back pain is managed with pain-killers till 1 month period. If it persists beyond 1 month, then further investigations are done. Since you have a bad pain I will suggest the following: - Back pain can be due to many reasons. You should get x-ray lumbosacral spine in AP and Lateral  and x-ray coccyx in lateral view done send us report or discuss it with your doctor. Only then further management can be advised. - Avoid heavy weight lifting pushing and pulling heavy objects, because it will further increase back pain.Try to sit on soft surface or on pillow. - You can take medicine like painkillers + muscle relaxants by discussing it with your doctor. Your husband may need stronger pain-killers which are available on prescription only. He can try ibuprofen or naproxen till he sees his doctor. - Apply hot packs for 30 min in morning and evening in affected parts . I hope it helps. You are welcome to ask further health related queries. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I'm a girl and Ive just turned 14.

How can I get it to stop and why does it hurt?","Doctor":"Hello, I have studied your case.Most probable reason for your symptoms could be postural problem as you may be sitting for long time and lack of exercises.Some exercises which can be done after pain has reduced include- Spine extension exercises, Lying on your stomach flat lift leg 6 inches from ground, do it for other leg.Now lift both hand and leg simultaneously, 6 inch off the ground and stayPosition for around 10 breathes. Core stabilizing spine exercises will help.You may consult physiotherapist for further guidance. He may start TENS, or ultrasound which is helpful in your case.Some life style modifications to prevent pain– Take break every 40 min from computer and do some lumbar rotation, stretches, walk and get back to work. Sit with taking support to your back, and do not watch television constantly.I will advise to check your vit B12 and vit D3 level.Hope this answers your query.

He landed on the asphalt driveway. He broke two ribs and punctured a lung as well as fracturing his L5 vertebrae. He spent 5 days in a trauma center. His ribs seem to be healing well but he has low back pain that is causing him a lot of pain. He has problems lifting his left leg and has started to \\"swing\\" his leg forward in order to walk. The limp is extremely evident. The accident happened exactly 4 weeks ago. What is our first step in finding the appropriate help for him?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for writing to HCM.As your husband had sustained a fall with fracture of L5 vertebra, I suspect that there could be an associated disc protrusion causing pressure over the nerve roots that is causing some weakness in the muscles leading to the limp and altered gait.I suggest an MRI scan of the Lumbar spine which clearly dipicts the severity of the disc protrusion,spinal cord compression and any other soft tissue pathology in the spine. Nerve conduction studies may also be needed to establish any neurological injury in the leg.Management depends on the condition diagnosed.Hope this information is helpful.

Please type your query here... dear doctor my diet is normal but for past 4 years i have been having severe stomach pains- it is a stabbing pain. the pain usally starts at night and it will go on for good 6 hours approximatley. i cannot sleep noramally- i have to curl myself to reduce the pain. i vomit during that pain . yesterday was worse i tried some painkillers but the pain was still there. the pain is just on one spot of my stomach ......","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.Read the history and understood the problem.I am sorry to know that you are suffering from such a severe stabbing  pain with vomiting for the last 4 years. It is difficult to understand why have you not investigated or consulted a Gastroenterologist. This is occurring only during night time and makes you curl on, meaning it is so severe. The most probable causes are:Vascular insufficiency to the intestines after the dinner- the requirement of blood supply increases many folds .Internal hernia, again very difficult to diagnose.Volvulus of some part of the intestinal tract. To get a proper diagnosis you should be seen by a Doctor / Gastroenterologist- preferably - during the attack. The investigations done when not in attack may turn out to be normal. I would advise the following investigations strictly to be done during the attack of pain. -X-ray of the whole abdomen in standing position, this helps to have a suspicion about the intestinal obstruction and the cause of it. This is followed by CT scan next time to confirm the diagnosis. Exploratory Laparascopy or Laparotomy. This helps tremendously for the diagnosis and treatment too."},{"Patient":"for about a week I have had r side back pain. it seems to b worsening also it hurts to breath in if I try for a deep breath it hurts my torso it seems im tired and not hungry now when I walk it hurts I cant lay on my r side without pain It wakes me up","Doctor":"Hi there .Firstly the cause of such severe pain needs to be investigated as it is not advisable to take too much painkillers .Pain on movement is mostly muscular in origin.

The treatment of acute pain is different from that of chronic pain.Rather than simply using oxycodone for symptomatic supression of pain, the cause for your bad back pain and neck pain is to be thoroughly investigated and evaluated. And thus the identified cause has to be treated accordingly.So, I personally feel that there is no rationale in simply using pain killer medications without knowing the underlying pathology.I suggest you to consult an orthopedic surgeon for a detailed workup and further management.Hope this information is helpful.

So, avoid any activity that produces pain- Apply ice to the painful area once in 2-3 hours in a day. Ice will help calm the inflammatory response and stimulate blood flow to the area- Before activities, gentle heating can help loosen the muscle. Apply a heat pack to the painful area prior to stretching or exercising- Oral anti-inflammatory medications (such as Aleve or Motrin) can help relieve symptoms of pain and also calms the inflammation- Physical therapy may speed up the recovery process. Therapeutic modalities such as Ultrasound, Massaging and specific exercises will be helpfulIf your symptoms are not improving with the above measures, consult an orthopedic surgeon for a clinical examination and appropriate investigations to diagnose the exact problem.Hope this information is helpful.

A fall of such a nature is not good for you as you already have had compression fracture in the past. First and foremost get an Xray done immediately to rule out any fractures.

He patient who has the extreme desire of having Motherhood again develops this sort of a problem. No one really knows the reason and the exact mechanism by which this happens. Consult your Senior Gynecologist who has seen such more cases for counselling and further management.2.

Once i was on the crutches i seperated my right shoulder on them. I have had three knee surgeries over 10 years ago. No problems after the last acl reconstruction. Now i am having extreme pain in my right leg, mainly knee with shooting pain up and down my leg. I also have my shoulder that is killing me i can barely lift it above my head. I have been treated my an ortho who believed my knee to have rsd and sent me to a pain management specialist. They have done every test known, blood mri xrays bone scan. The pain management doc wants the ortho to do exploratory surgery on my knee. I am worried if i have rsd that will make it worse. How do i handle that. I also had problems about two months after the initial injury with my back hurting. I thought it was matress and after a month of pain it went away. The pain management doc asked if i had any back pain because he wanted to check for injuries that could affect my knee. i told him about the pain and he ordered an mri. After it came back it showed a fractured spine and a hemangioma. When i saw the spine specialist he said that the hamangioma had to be there since birth. My research shows that no one really knows how they happen some believe genetics others trauma to tissue. He also said wc will not cover that because the fracture was due to the hamngioma weakening my back. but he says that it doesnt need to come out. My back has been really hurting for about two weeks and he said hemagiomas do not cause pain, my research again shows that some do. Also wc has not approved my shoulder therapy for three months now and the pain is just as bad and sometimes feels worse. My questions should i seek a second opinion and how to find the right one to help me in my area. My knee pain is terrible if i put weight on my leg it bruises easily and swells up. I am just lost on what i should do. I feel these doctors have just traded me back and forth and just keep putting me on different meds. I am on opana 10mg which does not work all day. Lyrica 150mg, zipsor and flexiril. I am just so tired of being in pain. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello, I have studied your case.Hemangioma do not give pain but fracture associated with it may give rise to pain.For these symptoms analgesic and neurotropic medication can be started.I will advise to consult two specialist knee and spine again for proper opinionTill time, avoid lifting weights, Sit with support to back.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.With the history it seems that either you have strained your back muscles and ligaments of spine(sprain)  or have developed a PID (Prolapsed intervertebral disc) while lifting your grand daughter. In the first case, some amount of physiotherapy and warm compresses (Short wave diathermy in a physiotherapy dept) along with some anti inflammatory drugs should give you some relief. However, in the second case (PID), the pain may aggravate without any relief, and you might have to take an orthopaedic consultation for the same who may advise you for an MRI of the spine to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of PID. Further management would depend on the report of the MRI.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in planning your treatment.

I try to walk around a little bit and take 600 mg ibuprofen every 4 hours.

However , now the injury is almost a week old, in which case hot fomentation would be ideal.Apply a small quantity of pain relief gel like volini(diclofenac gel) to the affected region of the back. Do not massage or rub the gel too  much.. Just apply it lightly. After half an hour or so apply a hot water bag/ hot fomentation to the affected area. Do the above at least 3 times a day. Reduce the oral intake of ibuprofen gradually. Too much of this pain relief medication can cause gastritis.Hopefully you should be completely okay in another week or so.

The most probable cause of pain in a child of 5 , which increases after food and in the morning before she eats are :-Tummy tonsils- meaning enlargement of the lymph nodes of the abdomen.-Appendicitis- by default this has to be ruled out in every case of pain in -abdomen of a child.-Worms.

What could cause dents in the lower back could be spina bifida occulta, a problem wihere the spine has a small defect from birth sometime associated with an area of darkened or hairy skin overlying it. In the majority of situations nothing needs to be done about it. And then it is something called spondylolisthesis, its a slip of one vertebra over the other wich could cause a bump. The pain could be because of instability or nerve root entrapment, Nerve entrapment causes pain by trapping nerves and may need surgical decompression.But it could also be some sort of an hip problem can make the spine curve a bit more, and give the impression of a dent in the back.

Generally, this is not a serious condition and usually resolves within a week. The general treatment guidelines for this condition is as follows -- Take Rest and do not do any activities that cause pain till the acute pain subsides- Apply ice or a cold pack to the painful area for 15 to 20 minutes, 4 times a day for several days. Wrap the ice or cold pack in a towel. Do not apply the ice directly to your skin.- Take  ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) to help relieve pain- Use heat only when you are returning to physical activity. Then use it before stretching. Gentle heating can help loosen the muscle- When the acute pain is gone, start gentle stretching exercises. Stay within pain limits. Hold each stretch for about 10 seconds and repeat 6 times.- Physical therapy may speed up the recovery process. Therapeutic modalities such as Ultrasound, Massaging and specific exercises will be helpful.If you fail to improve with the above measures, consult an orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation and management.Hope this information is helpful.

I would go for a routine stool test for ova and cyst, and treat them if positive. On the dietary part, I would advise you to add enough roughage in your diet along with sufficient liquids. On the medicine side, I would advise you to go for a proton pump inhibitor, and some liquid antacid. In case of no relief, I would advise you to get yourself assessed by a gastro enterologist for a possible endoscopic evaluation of your gastro intestinal tract to rule out a GERD, and also I would consider some investigations to rule out a cardiological prblem for your chest pain.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

And never satisfided. -Blur vision, to the point i havent driven in 2 wks, and survier eye pain. (Often cold rag on my eyes tends to relieve the pain only while in used) -Whole body aches and pressure headachs from ears forward that dont let up. -The past 2 weeks to seem to be in the bathroom peeing every 10 minutes or so, a large amount of pee even when i havent drank alot of fluides. Pee seems to be strong dark and in large amounts. -Septic fumes traveling up my throat into my mouth with hardly any relief. -Ringing in ears every once in a while the past few days mainly left side and loudly. - a few times these have even came along with a bad fever over night but doesnt last long. -2 months ago was tge first time my first three finger on both hands but worse on my left went numb. Feet are the same but travels past my anchels. -I have a long history of kidney infections and uti. -Sometimes my neck is stiff but that maybe from being in the bed all the time -right before my current spell of all these symptoms i had the biggest flare up of psoriasis patches i have ever have, almost over night, which now covers 80% of my chest, stomach, hips, back and but.

The most probable cause for such pans you described in the lower left chest and upper abdomen can be :-Costo-chondritis due to inflammation of the lower ribs and muscles. This inflammation can travel along the abdominal muscles originating from the ribs, giving pain in the upper abdomen.-Colitis of the splenic flexture of the large bowel - colon.- Inflammation of the left lower lungs and / or pleura.I would advise you to take a second opinion of a General Surgeon, get investigations done and diagnosed to be treated properly. X-ray of the chest, ultrasonography of the abdomen, blood and urine test. Pain on deep pressure on the lower chest on the lower ribs is classical of costo-chondritis and not seen on any investigations. I would advise you to get an MRI of the painful area, telling the Radiologist to be specifically see for the painful- tender area. This will confirm the diagnosis. I would suggest the following treatment.-Rest to the area by means of strapping with the Adhesive tapes during the deep Expiration phase. This will limit the movement, reduce the pain and give rest for healing to occur.-Anti-inflammatory medicines in full dose as per the weight.-Steroids if required for its strong anti-inflammatory role.-Lasix to reduced the edema.This sort of a treatment helps all my patients. and should help you too."},{"Patient":"I am experiencing acute chronic upper back pain in muscles from spine and around the ribs to under my arm. i have some arthritis in the area but normal everyday activity can trigger off pain .

It can be used for long term but there are higher chances of its physical dependence.In acute cases for immediate relief you can take NSAIDs. But for the long term relief other measures should be taken too like:Heat or ice to reduce pain and stiffness.Exercise to stretch and strengthen the muscles of your back, shoulders, and stomach.Physical therapy to help increase your flexibility, strength, and balance. Your physical therapist may teach you an exercise program so you can do it at home.Massage to help reduce muscle tension and pain and improve blood flow.Steroid shots to help reduce swelling and relieve pressure on nerves and nerve roots.

Bending often increases the pain. The pain generally radiates from the back and runs down till the calves and soles of your feet, at times touching the big toe.

Already taken MRI, BMD is very low . Pl. advise  the treatment for me. Thank youregardsudhay YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for writing to HCM.The initial management of cervical disc disease is always by conservative management (non surgical methods) and includes the following -Soft Collar: Soft collar  allow the muscles of the neck to rest and limit neck motion. This can help decrease pinching of nerve roots with movement. Soft collars should only be worn for short periods of time, because long-term wear can decrease the strength of neck muscles.Medicines: Analgesic are needed in the acute phase. Muscle relaxants are essential for relieving muscle spasms once the acute pain subsides. Neurotropic vitamins like METHYLCOBALAMINE (activated Vit B12) or PREGABALIN will help in alleviating the neuropathic pain.Cervical traction: may enlarge the disc space, permitting the prolapse to subside. Intermittent cervical traction for not more than 30 minutes at a time. Physiotherapy:  Once the acute phase of pain has subsided, Isometric strengthening exercises of the paravertebral muscles are started. Improving neck strength and flexibility with simple exercises may lessen discomfort and pain. Moist heat can be usefulEpidural steroids:  are useful for patients with severe radicular pains in the limbs. Cortisone is a powerful anti-inflammatory preparation and so its injections in the \\"epidural space\\" can decrease swelling as well as pain.If your symptoms are not resolving with the above measures, consult an orthopedic surgeon for further management.Hope this information is helpful.

The passage of the urine in peristaltic wave can cause the spasmodic , achy pain. The throbbing can be due to back-pressure. I would advise you the Following::: First of all the get an intravenous pyelography to for the structural damage the the urinary system. Ureteroscopy: helps in direct visualization, passage of the dye to get the contrast X-rays, this has a therapeutic value as passage of the stent across the stricture can relieve your pain, reduce the infection, reduce the back-pressure on kidney with its side effects.

Most of the cases can be managed by non surgical approach. surgical treatment required in only advanced cases.As your pain is not controlled by simpleEpidural steroid injections \\"may result in some improvement in radicular lumbosacral pain when assessed between 2 and 6 weeks following the injection, Physiotherapy helps in muscle strengthening exercise.These are few measures to reduce your pain:Try not to sit still for long periods of time.Avoid lifting heavy objects.Remember that movements such as bending and twisting (especially at the same time) can increase pressure on your damaged disc.Work on increasing your abdominal strength. Strong stomach muscles help to support the back. People who work hard on their abdominal muscles probably have much less recurrence of back pain over the long term, but only if they keep doing the exercises.Pay attention to posture while sitting, standing and walking.Flexibility exercises, performed regularly, can improve mobility and help reduce muscle tension and back pain.Include a gentle program of back-strengthening exercises.Hope this helps you.Regards"},{"Patient":"So about 4 years ago, I fell on my tail bone while rollerblading.

Coincidentally, the nerves and muscles are related to the internal organs like uterus or bowel. So, when you menstruate or strain due to constipation, you are putting more pressure to the affected area, thus, increasing the pain. I'd suggest to - do vaginal swab testing to exclude vaginal infection- urine analysis to rule out urinary tract infection- try to avoid being constipatedIf everything is ok, then, it is most probably due to fall.

It is true that they are good for such conditions as chronic back pain and may relieve your symptoms, but getting addicted to them will instead become a problem that will have to be solved as you can not be on those for the rest of your life ( I do not recommend continuous use). Your pain management doctor may advise other treatment options and give you alternative medications or therapies such as physical therapy/chiropractor. If I was to treat you, i will change your medications to equivalents such as tricyclic antidepressants (that can treat both nerve pain and depression that came as a result of the pain) and also antiinflammatory for about 1-2 months. Refer you to a physical therapist for that period until I can see you again in 2-3 months after which I will be able to see if treatment is effective or not.I also recommend you see a rheumatologist.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi I started last  Tuesday getting very uncomfortable lower back pain with lower stomach discomfort.

They came and went like contractions but my back still ached all the time. I couldn t sleep on my left or right side as my back wouldn t support the weight on the left side. Today has been terrible, the contraction like movements are still happening, I can t sit comfortably and I can t move or walk about freely. I now also feel that it is restricting my breathing because it is very painful when I take deep breaths. Can you tell me what this is and how I can relieve it please?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for your query.The fact that your pain is occuring with movements(during deep breath) indicates a muscle strain. Any strained muscle when stretched gives severe pain.To get relief from the pain and for quick healing:1. Do hot fomatation at the site.2. Apply local anti-inflammatory gel 2-3 times a day.3. Take anti-inflammatory drugs like Ibuprofen to reduce pain and local swelling or inflammation.4. Do not lift weight or try to do exercise that involve painful muscles. Give proper time to heal. I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query."},{"Patient":"I have pain on my right side about the waistline.

Thanks, Nancy","Doctor":"Hi Nancy.Thanks for your query.The cause of the pain above the waistline on the right side has to be diagnosed on physical examination by a Surgeon and diagnostic tests undertaken to prove or to rule out the probable causes. The probable causes are:Right kidney infection / impacted stone in pelvi-ureteric junction.Gall bladder stones and / or infection.Liver pathology.Colitis on the right side.Appendicitis particularly in retro-cecal position. and so on.I would advise you the following Get the blood , urine and stool tests done.

A faster progression of listhesis and higher chances of worsening  are very common in obese individuals.- Use a lumbosacral back support to stabilize your spinal muscles and prevent further progression of the listhesis.- Use analgesic and muscle relaxants as needed.If you fail to improve with the above measures or if your symptoms are worsening in due course of time, then you may needed a surgical fixation.Hope this information is helpful.

The initial management of this condition is always by conservative means (non surgical methods) which includes different modalities like Physiotherapy, Spinal manipulation, Ultrasound therapy, Epidural spinal injections, TENS etc. All these methods have to be followed for atleast 6 weeks period to have a symptom relief.As you have tried all varieties of treatment but without much improvement in your condition, I suggest you to try RADIO FREQUENCY ABLATION, which may help you. Radiofrequency ablation (or RFA) is a procedure used to reduce pain. RFA can be used to help patients with chronic (long-lasting) low-back and neck pain and pain related to the degeneration of joints from arthritis. The degree of pain relief varies, depending on the cause and location of the pain. Pain relief from RFA can last from six to 12 months and in some cases, relief can last for years. More than 70% of patients treated with RFA experience pain relief.   Hope this information is helpful.

Other thing is disc degeneration but i dont know mri cervical spine findings but if pain radiating down in upeer limb and constant pain you can take short wave diathermy and cervical traction. If that does not work you can take epideural injection if it still does not work then you should go for surgical modality.Hope your doubts are cleared.Thank you.Get well soon."},{"Patient":"actually me and and my boy friend had a unprotected sex on 6th but he did not insert but rubbed his penis into my vagina,we had it on may 6th and i had my periods on 27th april.i took immediately 2 hoours after on may 6th but am having lower stomach pain now..am i safe plz suggest me","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.Read your history and understood the problem.As per the history you have provided, your boy friend rubbed the penis into your vagina but you say there was no insertion. If no insertion, the chances of pelvic infection is remote, rather not possible.The cause of pain in your lower abdomen then can be due to :Enteritis,Any problem related to the Fallopian tubes or Ovary.PID-Pelvic Inflammatory disease if you had sex before.Appendicitis.I would advise you the following:Get blood and urine tests.Ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis to get an idea.Examination by a Gynecologist and / or Surgeon to see for the probable cause. Start treatment with an antibiotic and metronidazole, probiotics and supportive and symptomatic treatment under the guidance of the Doctor ."},{"Patient":"For 3 weeks have had middle back area, pain migrating to right side where there is small swelling with numbness and slight itching.

You are suffering with back pain since 5 years. Recently you had neck, shoulder, and head ache since 6 months.                    You are feeling that you are hypochondriac, but these two may be inter related. Back ache, and neck pain, shoulder pain, could be due to the spondilosis.                   Head ache could be due to anxiety, other cause being hypertension.                   I prescribe to my patients with such symptoms neurotropic injections for 10 consecutive days, and the every week, fortnightly, and then monthly, alprazolam at night, along with the pain medication S.O.S.
