These 63 lines cut part of the plane into equilateral triangles of side 2/sqrt{3}.  How many such triangles are formed?","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We are given three sets of lines:   [   y = k, quad y = sqrt{3}x + 2k, quad y = -sqrt{3}x + 2k   ]   where ( k ) ranges from (-10) to (10). These lines form equilateral triangles with side length (frac{2}{sqrt{3}}).2. Finding Intersections:   To form equilateral triangles, we need to find the intersections of these lines. The horizontal lines ( y = k ) intersect with the slanted lines ( y = sqrt{3}x + 2a ) and ( y = -sqrt{3}x + 2b ).3. Intersection Points:   Consider the intersection of ( y = sqrt{3}x + 2a ) and ( y = -sqrt{3}x + 2b ):   [   sqrt{3}x + 2a = -sqrt{3}x + 2b   ]   Solving for ( x ):   [   2sqrt{3}x = 2b - 2a implies x = frac{b - a}{sqrt{3}}   ]   Substituting ( x ) back into one of the equations to find ( y ):   [   y = sqrt{3} left( frac{b - a}{sqrt{3}} right) + 2a = b + a   ]   Thus, the intersection point is ( left( frac{b - a}{sqrt{3}}, a + b right) ).4. Range of ( y ):   The value of ( y ) must be within the range of the horizontal lines ( y = k ), which are from ( k = -10 ) to ( k = 10 ). Since the height of an equilateral triangle with side length (frac{2}{sqrt{3}}) is (1), the possible values of ( y ) for the vertices of the triangles must be between ( -9 ) and ( 11 ).5. Counting the Intersections:   We need to count the number of pairs ((a, b)) such that ( a + b ) falls within the range ([-9, 11]).   - For ( y = 11 ), ( a ) can range from ( 10 ) to ( 1 ), giving ( 10 ) possible pairs.   - For ( y = 10 ), ( a ) can range from ( 10 ) to ( 0 ), giving ( 11 ) possible pairs.   - This pattern continues until ( y = 0 ), where there are ( 21 ) possible pairs.   - Then, the number of pairs decreases symmetrically until ( y = -9 ), where there are ( 12 ) possible pairs.   Summing these, we get:   [   10 + 11 + 12 + ldots + 21 + ldots + 12 = 330   ]6. Triangles Facing Downward:   The same logic applies for triangles facing downward, giving another ( 330 ) triangles.7.

Finally, in the morning, all five of them together took out the bag, divided the remaining nuts into five parts, and one nut, which turned out to be extra, was again given to the monkey. It is required to determine the smallest number of nuts in the bag for which such a division is possible.","solution":"27. First solution.

The smallest value of n that satisfies this condition is, obviously, 1023, and in this case,N = 15 cdot 1023 + 11 + 265 = 15621Second solution. This problem can be solved much faster and almost without any calculations if we carefully consider the conditions that the content of the problem imposes on the total number N of nuts. The first condition of the problem is that during the first division into five parts, one nut remains. This condition means that N when divided by 5 gives a remainder of 1, i.e., N = 5l + 1; numbers that satisfy this condition occur in the natural sequence of numbers with an interval of five numbers, and knowing one such number, we can find an unlimited number of others by adding (or subtracting) multiples of 5. The second condition of the problem states that k = frac{4}{5}(N - 1) = 4l gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 5, i.e., k = 5l_1 + 1. This requirement is equivalent to l giving a remainder of 4 when divided by 5 or that N = 5l + 1 gives a remainder of 21 when divided by 25; numbers that satisfy this condition occur in the number sequence with an interval of 25 numbers, and knowing one such number, we can obtain as many as we want by adding (or subtracting) multiples of 25. Similarly, the third condition of the problem states that k_1 = frac{4}{5}(k - 1) = 4l_1 gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 5; this condition determines the remainder from the division of the number l_1 by 5 or the remainders from the division of the numbers k and l by 25, or the remainder from the division of N by 125. All conditions of the problem determine the remainder from the division of the number N by 5^6 = 15625; numbers that satisfy these conditions occur in the natural sequence of numbers with an interval of 15625.We could calculate the remainder that the number N gives when divided by 58, but there is no need for this. The fact is that one number that satisfies all the conditions of the problem is obvious. This number is -4. Indeed, when -4 is divided by 5, it gives a quotient of -1 and a remainder of +1; therefore, if we subtract 1 from -4 and take frac{4}{5} of the resulting difference, which is already divisible by 5, we will get the same number -4. Similarly, in all subsequent divisions by 5, we will have the same remainder +1. True, the number -4 cannot serve as an answer to our problem, as, by condition, the number N must be positive; but knowing one number that satisfies the conditions of the problem, we can obtain as many as we want by adding multiples of 5^6. The smallest positive number that satisfies the conditions is, obviously, -4 + 5^6 = 15625 - 4 = 15621."},{"problem":"In some computer languages (such as APL), when there are no parentheses in an algebraic expression, the operations are grouped from right to left.

The value of y at the vertex gives us the minimum value of the function on the given interval because the vertex of an upward-opening parabola represents the lowest point.Substituting t=frac{3}{2} into the vertex form of the equation, we find the minimum value of y to be:[y_{text{min}} = (frac{3}{2}-frac{3}{2})^{2}+frac{15}{4} = 0 + frac{15}{4} = frac{15}{4}]To find the maximum value of y on the interval, we evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval for t, which are 1 and 2. For t=1:[y = (1)^{2}-3(1)+6 = 1-3+6 = 4]For t=2:[y = (2)^{2}-3(2)+6 = 4-6+6 = 4]Therefore, the maximum value of y on the interval is 4, and the minimum value is frac{15}{4}. Thus, the range of the function on xin [2,4] is [frac{15}{4},4].Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{A}."},{"problem":"(512 (1) Given the function y=left(frac{1}{3}right)^{x} with the domain of the independent variable x being {x mid x geqslant-1}, find the corresponding range of function values;","solution":"(2) Find the range of the function y=2^{x^{2}+1 x}.Solution (1) Since y=left(frac{1}{3}right)^{x} is a decreasing function on (-infty,+infty), and x geqslant-1, we getleft(frac{1}{3}right)^{x} leqslantleft(frac{1}{3}right)^{-1},i.e., 0<y leqslant 3, the range of the function values is {y mid 0<y leqslant 3}.(2) The function y=2^{prime} is an increasing function on (-infty,+infty).

Identify the possible values of ( n ):   - We need to find all integer values of ( n > 3 ) such that there exists a convex ( n )-gon where each diagonal is the perpendicular bisector of at least one other diagonal.2. Check for ( n = 4 ):   - For ( n = 4 ), consider a rhombus. In a rhombus, each diagonal is the perpendicular bisector of the other diagonal. Hence, ( n = 4 ) works.3. Prove that ( n ge 5 ) does not work:   - Let ( mathcal{P} = A_1A_2 cdots A_n ) be the polygon.4. Claim 1: For each ( i ), the reflection of ( A_i ) in line ( A_{i-1}A_{i+1} ) (say ( B_i )) is a vertex of ( mathcal{P} ).   *Proof*:   - Consider a diagonal ( D ) such that line ( A_{i-1}A_{i+1} ) is the perpendicular bisector of ( D ).   - Then ( A_{i-1}A_{i+1} ) intersects ( D ) at the midpoint of ( D ), which lies in the interior of ( D ).   - Due to convexity, this forces ( A_i ) to be an endpoint of ( D ).   - By definition, ( B_i ), the reflection of ( A_i ) in ( A_{i-1}A_{i+1} ), should be the other endpoint of ( D ).   - It follows that ( B_i ) is a vertex of ( mathcal{P} ), as desired.

Then ( Z ) must be adjacent to at least one of ( X, Y ).   *Proof*:   - Assume the contrary. Pick two vertices ( A, B ) of ( mathcal{P} ) lying on the same side of ( XY ) as ( Z ) such that ( A, B ) are adjacent to ( X, Y ), respectively.   - By definition, (text{area}(triangle AXY), text{area}(triangle BXY) ge text{area}(triangle ZXY) implies text{dist}(A, XY), text{dist}(B, XY) ge text{dist}(Z, XY)).   - But this forces (angle AZB ge 180^circ), which contradicts the convexity of ( mathcal{P} ). (square)6. Claim 3: If (text{area}(triangle DEF) = lambda) where ( D, E, F ) are vertices of ( mathcal{P} ), then ({D, E, F} = {A_{i-1}, A_i, A_{i+1}}) for some ( i ).   *Proof*:   - We use Lemma 2 repeatedly. Considering ( D, E ) as fixed, we obtain ( F ) should be adjacent to at least one of ( D, E ).   - WLOG ( F ) is adjacent to ( D ). Then by considering ( D, F ) as fixed, ( E ) must be adjacent to at least one of ( D, F ).   - Our Claim follows. (square)7. Final Argument:   - By Claim 3, pick an index ( k ) such that (text{area}(triangle A_{k-1}A_kA_{k+1}) = lambda).   - By Claim 1, ( B_k ) (the reflection of ( A_k ) in ( A_{k-1}A_{k+1} )) is a vertex of ( mathcal{P} ).   - But also (text{area}(triangle A_{k-1}B_kA_{k+1}) = text{area}(triangle A_{k-1}A_kA_{k+1}) = lambda).   - This by Claim 3 forces ({A_{k-1}, B_k, A_{k+1}} = {A_{l-1}, A_l, A_{l+1}}) for some index ( l ).   - Since ( n ge 5 ), the fact ({A_{k-1}, A_{k+1}} in {A_{l-1}, A_l, A_{l+1}}) forces ( k = l ).   - This means ( B_k equiv A_k ), which is a clear contradiction.This completes the proof.

Analyzing Option A (fleft(xright) is an odd function):First, we explore the property of an odd function for f(x), which is defined as f(-x) = -f(x). Substituting -x into f(x) gives:[f(-x) = frac{{2}^{-x} - 1}{1 + {2}^{-x}} = frac{1 - {2}^{x}}{{2}^{x} + 1} = -frac{{2}^{x} - 1}{{2}^{x} + 1} = -f(x)]This confirms that f(x) is indeed an odd function. Thus, Option A is boxed{text{Correct}}.2. Analyzing Option C (fleft(xright) is an increasing function on R):The derivative or the slope of a function can help us determine if the function is increasing or decreasing. By transforming f(x), we get:[f(x) = 1 - frac{2}{1 + {2}^{x}}]Since y = 1 + {2}^{x} is always increasing on R (as the exponential function 2^x is increasing), the term -frac{2}{1 + {2}^{x}} is decreasing but overall, f(x) is increasing because it starts from a baseline of 1 and goes down less rapidly than it would go up due to the increasing nature of 2^x. Thus, Option C is boxed{text{Correct}}.3.

The statistical results are as follows: overline{{x_A}}=1042kg/acre, s_{A}^{2}=6.5, overline{{x}_{B}}=1042kg/acre, s_{B}^{2}=1.2. Which variety is more suitable for promotion in the village? (Fill in \\"A\\" or \\"B\\").","solution":"To determine which variety of hybrid rice, A or B, is more suitable for promotion in the village based on their yield per acre and stability, we analyze the given statistical results:1. The average yield per acre for variety A is overline{x_A} = 1042kg/acre, and for variety B is overline{x_B} = 1042kg/acre. This indicates that both varieties have the same average yield per acre, which is overline{x_A} = overline{x_B} = 1042kg/acre.2. The variance of the yield per acre for variety A is s_A^2 = 6.5, and for variety B is s_B^2 = 1.2. The variance measures the dispersion of the data points from the mean. A smaller variance indicates that the data points are closer to the mean, suggesting a more stable yield.3. Comparing the variances of the two varieties, we find that s_A^2 > s_B^2, which means the yield of variety A is less stable than the yield of variety B.4. Based on the analysis, since both varieties have the same average yield but variety B has a smaller variance, it indicates that variety B's yield is more stable across different conditions.Therefore, considering the stability of the yield as a crucial factor for promotion, the variety more suitable for promotion in the village is boxed{text{B}}.【Analysis】The decision is made based on the principle that a smaller variance in yield indicates greater stability. This is crucial for agricultural practices where consistency and predictability of yield are important for planning and resource allocation.【Comments】Understanding the significance of variance in statistical data is essential in many fields, including agriculture. It helps in making informed decisions by not only considering the average outcomes but also how those outcomes vary under different conditions.

We can rewrite this as f'(x) = frac{(2x - 1)(1 - ax)}{x}.- When a leq 0, f'(x) > 0 for all x > 0, meaning that f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0,infty) and therefore there are no extreme values.- When a > 0, setting f'(x) = 0 gives us the critical point at x = frac{1}{a}. Hence f(x) is increasing on (0, frac{1}{a}) and decreasing on (frac{1}{a},infty). The maximum of f(x) is obtained at x = frac{1}{a}, giving us f(frac{1}{a}) = ln frac{1}{a} + frac{1}{a} - 1.From these cases, we conclude that for a leq 0, f(x) has no extreme values.

Given a right triangle triangle ABC with AC perp BC, we need to prove that the area of triangle ABC is equal to k^2 given that the radius of the inscribed circles in triangle ADC and triangle CDB are equal.2. Let AB = c, AC = b, BC = a, AD = u, and BD = v. Since D is on AB, we have u + v = c.3. The radius of the inscribed circle in triangle ADC is given by:   [   r_1 = frac{A_1}{s_1}   ]   where A_1 is the area of triangle ADC and s_1 is the semi-perimeter of triangle ADC.4. Similarly, the radius of the inscribed circle in triangle CDB is given by:   [   r_2 = frac{A_2}{s_2}   ]   where A_2 is the area of triangle CDB and s_2 is the semi-perimeter of triangle CDB.5. Since r_1 = r_2, we have:   [   frac{A_1}{s_1} = frac{A_2}{s_2}   ]6.

A lining is considered completely worn out if it has traveled 15000 mathrm{~km} on a rear wheel, or 25000 mathrm{~km} on a front wheel. How far can the truck travel until all four linings are completely worn out, if at the appropriate time the front lining pair is swapped with the rear pair?","solution":"I. solution. Consider the state of the tires after, for example, 1000 mathrm{~km} of travel. The rear tires have worn out by 11/5 of their part, and the front tires by 1/25 of their part. (We assume that the car travels on an average quality road, and the wear is directly proportional to the distance traveled.) If we now swap the tires, then after another 1000 mathrm{~km} of travel, each of the four tires will have traveled an equal distance and can be considered worn out by 1/15 + 1/25 = 8/75 of their part. The tires can travel 2000 mathrm{~km} more times the ratio of the total wear to the wear that has already occurred, which is 1 to the 8/75 wear ratio. Therefore, the car can travel 2000 cdot 75 / 8 = 18750 mathrm{~km} before the tires are completely worn out, with half of this distance covered in the original arrangement and the other half with the swapped tires.László Jereb (Sopron, Széchenyi I. Gymnasium II. grade)Note. Similarly, it can be shown that if a tire wears out after a mathrm{~km} on one wheel and b mathrm{~km} on the other, then with the above swap, the distance that can be traveled with four tires isfrac{1}{frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{a}+frac{1}{b}right)}This value is known as the harmonic mean of the two numbers.II. solution. The ratio of the allowed kilometers is 15000: 25000 = 3: 5, so if a tire is moved from the rear wheel to the front wheel, the distance it can still travel increases by a factor of 5/3. If it is moved from the front to the rear, it decreases by a factor of 3/5.If the car has already traveled x km with the tires, then the front tires could still travel 25000 - x km, but after the swap, they can only travel frac{3}{5}(25000 - x) km, while the rear tires, instead of the remaining 15000 - x km, can still be used for frac{5}{3}(15000 - x) km. We need to determine x such that the distance the two types of tires can still travel is equal:frac{3}{5}(25000 - x) = frac{5}{3}(15000 - x)From this, x = 9375 mathrm{~km}, and the distance traveled after the swap is 3 cdot 15625 / 5 = 9375 mathrm{~km}, so the car can travel 18750 mathrm{~km}.Béla Pénzes (Esztergom, Temesvári Pelbárt Gymnasium II. grade)Note. We can also use the fact that the distance traveled before and after the swap is the same, otherwise, by the time the rear tire is completely worn out, the other tire would still be usable. This leads to the somewhat simpler equation 3(25000 - x) / 5 = x.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_c7e6978c848383369babg-1.jpg?height=686&width=900&top_left_y=1473&top_left_x=602)III. solution. Viewing a new tire as 100 % and a completely worn-out tire as 0 %, we will illustrate how the value state of the tires changes with the distance traveled. The value graph for the two types of tires from the initial setup is obtained by connecting the point A on the value axis marked 100 % with a straight line to the point on the distance axis marked 15000 mathrm{~km} or 25000 mathrm{~km}. When the tires are swapped, the slopes of their graphs also swap, and the four graph segments corresponding to the two distance segments form a parallelogram, which we want to construct.The two types of tires reach the 0 % value state after traveling the same distance, so the two graphs intersect on the distance axis, which will be the point C opposite A in the parallelogram. The other two vertices B and D correspond to the tire swap, so the two vertices are above the same point on the distance axis, meaning we know the direction of the BD diagonal: it is parallel to the value axis. From this, we can determine the position of the other diagonal. The segments of the lines parallel to the BD diagonal that lie in the BAD angle region are bisected by the AC diagonal. Thus, taking any line parallel to the value axis, the segment B^*D^* between the two graphs that is bisected by F^* is on the AC diagonal, so AF^* intersects the distance axis at C, and the corresponding abscissa value is the sought distance.Notes. 1. To answer the question of the problem, it is not necessary to construct B and D, but to carry out the tire swap, it is precisely this that needs to be known, at which position of the odometer the tire swap should take place.2. This solution is essentially a graphical version of the first solution. The similarity would be even more evident if we completed the D^*AB^* triangle to a parallelogram and drew the diagonal through the point C^*, which would correspond to the diagonal.3. The two diagonals bisect each other, so their intersection point is on a line parallel to the distance axis at the height corresponding to 50 %. If we reflect one wheel's value graph over this line, the reflection intersects the other graph at the point corresponding to the tire swap.We can also arrive at this directly by reasoning, since after the swap, one tire will wear out as much as the other has already worn out, so its usage is equal to the other's value, and the reflected graph illustrates the wear (value decrease) of the wheel (2nd figure).(Using an unnamed, textless graph)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_c7e6978c848383369babg-2.jpg?height=631&width=681&top_left_y=693&top_left_x=711)"},{"problem":"95.

Define the Problem and Initial Setup:   - We have a rectangle ( R ) with dimensions ( 2^m times 2^n ) and a ( 1 times 1 ) square removed from one of the corners.   - We need to tile ( R ) using ( m + n ) rectangles from set ( S ), where each rectangle has an area ( 2^0, 2^1, ldots, 2^{m+n-1} ).2. Claim 1: Tiling a ( 2^m times x ) Rectangle:   - If we have the correct sized blocks for a ( 2^m times x ) rectangle, it must tile as vertical strips ( 2^m times 2^{a_1}, ldots, 2^m times 2^{a_k} ) in some order if ( x = 2^{a_1} + cdots + 2^{a_k} ).   - Proof:     - Induct on ( x ). For ( x = 1 ), the statement is trivial.     - Assume ( a_1 < cdots < a_k ). The largest block ( 2^{m+a_k} ) must tile as ( 2^m times 2^{a_k} ).     - If it splits as ( 2^b times 2^{m+a_k-b} ), then:       [       2^b leq 2^m implies b leq m       ]       [       2^{m+a_k-b} leq x < 2^{a_k+1} implies m leq b       ]       Thus, ( b = m ), as desired.

Key Claim: Full Tiling Classification:   - There is a sequence of red vertical ( 2^m times -- ) tiles for some distance, then a sequence of blue horizontal ( -- times 2^n ) tiles from the bottom up to some distance, then a sequence of maximally vertical red tiles from the left to some distance, and so on.   - Proof:     - By Claim 2, there must be a sequence of ( 2^m times -- ) red rectangles starting from the left edge.     - Consider the maximal sequence of these ( 2^m times -- ) tiles, and chop them off.     - We are left with a ( 2^m times x ) dented rectangle for some ( x ).     - Since the sequence was maximal, there cannot be another ( 2^m times -- ) tile on the leftmost edge.     - Hence by Claim 2, ( x ) must be a power of 2, say ( x = 2^k ).     - Rotate by ( 90^circ ) and we now have a ( 2^k times 2^m ) dented rectangle, and finish by induction. (blacksquare)5. Counting the Number of Ways:   - Suppose we have placed ( k ) tiles in the ( 2^m times 2^n ) dented rectangle in the order mentioned in the Key Claim.   - We will show that there are at most ( m+n-k ) choices for the next block.   - Say the non-tiled dented rectangle in the top right is ( x times y ).

The derivative of g(x) is g'(x)=e^{x}-1. When x geqslant 0, we have g'(x) geqslant 0, indicating that g(x) is non-decreasing in this interval. Since g(0)=0, for x geqslant 0, g(x) geqslant 0.

Substitute the given point (3,sqrt{2}): (sqrt{2})^2-frac{1}{9}(3)^2=lambda3. Solve for lambda: 2-frac{1}{9}cdot9=lambda Rightarrow lambda=14. Obtain the hyperbola's standard equation: y^2-frac{1}{9}x^2=1Therefore, the hyperbola's equation is boxed{y^2-frac{x^2}{9}=1}."},{"problem":"Which of the following radical expressions is the simplest quadratic radical expression?A: sqrt{2a}B: sqrt{{a}^{2}}C: sqrt{5{x}^{2}y}D: sqrt{frac{1}{3}}","solution":"To determine the simplest quadratic radical expression among the given options, we analyze each option as follows:- Option A: sqrt{2a} remains as it is because it's already in its simplest form and involves a quadratic term a. - Option B: sqrt{a^2} simplifies to |a|. This is because the square root and the square cancel each other out, but we must consider the absolute value to account for both positive and negative values of a. This simplification results in an expression that is not a radical expression, thus not meeting the criteria.- Option C: sqrt{5x^2y} simplifies to sqrt{x^2}sqrt{5y}, which further simplifies to xsqrt{5y}. Here, the x^2 under the square root simplifies to x, and we're left with a radical expression involving sqrt{5y}. This expression, while still a radical, is not in its simplest quadratic form due to the presence of the y term under the radical.- Option D: sqrt{frac{1}{3}} simplifies to frac{sqrt{3}}{3} by rationalizing the denominator. This process involves multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by sqrt{3} to get rid of the square root in the denominator. This results in a simple radical expression but does not involve a quadratic term, thus not meeting the criteria.Given the analysis above, Option A, sqrt{2a}, is the only option that remains a quadratic radical expression in its simplest form, without further simplification that removes the radical or changes its fundamental nature.Therefore, the answer is boxed{A}."},{"problem":"Given sin(alpha+frac{pi}{3})=frac{3}{5}, frac{pi}{6}<alpha<frac{5pi}{6}, then the value of cos alpha is ______.","solution":"Given sin(alpha+frac{pi}{3})=frac{3}{5} and frac{pi}{6}0, we know that alpha+frac{pi}{3} is in the second quadrant, where the sine is positive.

The answer is mathbf{( C )}. The text asks for which n it is possible to arrange n tiles in a closed sequence where each tile has two adjacent tiles. Simple trials show that the first cases where this is possible are n=6 (an hexagon is formed where all tiles share a vertex), n=12 (a chain of tiles is formed with a triangular hole in the center, which is the difference between figures F_{1} and F_{0} of the next problem), n=14 (a chain of tiles is formed with a hole that is the union of two triangles). Focusing on the \\"hole,\\" the region left free by the chain, it is immediately clear that if it is chosen to be a triangle of side k, exactly 6(k+1) tiles are needed to surround it; moreover, it is not difficult to convince oneself that if it is enlarged by a single triangular space, exactly two more tiles are needed to surround it, provided it is not enlarged in a non-convex part of its boundary. Therefore, by enlarging by zero, one, or two triangles a triangular hole of side k-1, regions are obtained that are surrounded by 6 k, 6 k+2, and 6 k+4 tiles, respectively. By choosing k among the integers greater than 1, it follows that all even n geq 12 admit a solution.To see that solutions with odd n are not possible, suppose one exists and imagine constructing it on an infinite triangular chessboard that has the triangles alternately colored white and black (so that adjacent triangles always have different colors). Two consecutive tiles will necessarily be placed on triangles of different colors, so the sequence of colors associated with the different tiles must be an alternating sequence of colors, and it must be closed, thus showing the same number of whites and blacks.

Since P(x_1,y_1), Q(x_2,y_2) are on circle C: x^2+y^2-r^2=0,  Subtracting t^2 times the equation of circle C from the above yields (a^2-r^2)y^2-2ty(ax-r^2)-t^2(x^2-r^2)-t^2(x^2+y^2-r^2)=0,  Simplifying gives (a^2-r^2)y-2t(ax-r^2)-t^2y=0.

By plugging back into the initial equation, we get P(x)=16left(frac{x}{4}right)^{i} for some integer i geqslant 0 (and all these solutions are valid, conversely).## 4 Combinatorial Geometry (Rémi and Aurélien)## Useful Ideas1.

In how many ways can the napkins be placed, one for each seat, so that no two neighbours get napkins of the same colour?","solution":"1. Define the problem and initial conditions:   We need to find the number of ways to place napkins of three different colors around a round table with ( n ) seats such that no two adjacent seats have napkins of the same color. Let ( f(n) ) denote the number of such satisfactory placements for ( n ge 2 ).2. Base case:   For ( n = 2 ), there are 3 choices for the first napkin and 2 choices for the second napkin (since it must be different from the first). Therefore, ( f(2) = 3 times 2 = 6 ).3. Recurrence relation:   For ( n ge 3 ), consider the following:   - There are 3 choices for the first napkin.   - For each subsequent napkin, there are 2 choices (since it must be different from the previous one).   - This gives ( 3 times 2^{n-1} ) ways to place the napkins if we ignore the circular nature of the table.   - However, this count includes cases where the last napkin is the same color as the first napkin, which we need to subtract.   Therefore, the recurrence relation is:   [   f(n) = 3 cdot 2^{n-1} - f(n-1)   ]4. Finding a pattern:   By experimenting with small values of ( n ), we observe that ( f(n) ) can be expressed in terms of Jacobsthal numbers ( J_k ). The Jacobsthal numbers are defined by the recurrence relation:   [   J_k = J_{k-1} + 2J_{k-2}   ]   with initial conditions ( J_0 = 0 ) and ( J_1 = 1 ).5. Expressing ( f(n) ) in terms of Jacobsthal numbers:   We find that ( f(n) = 6 cdot J_{n-1} ) for ( n ge 2 ).6.

Claim the answer is 7: We start by claiming that the minimum number of elements in ( B(x) ) for any irrational number ( x ) in the interval ( 0 < x < 1 ) is 7.2. Construct an example: Consider the number ( a = 0.100000100000010000000ldots ), where there are ( 5, 6, 7, ldots ) zeroes separating consecutive ones. We need to show that ( a ) is irrational and that ( B(a) ) has exactly 7 elements.3. Prove ( a ) is irrational: Suppose ( a ) is rational. Then ( a ) would eventually become periodic after some ( k )-th digit. Let the repeated part contain ( l ) digits. Since there are infinitely many sequences of more than ( 2l ) consecutive zeroes, at least one such sequence must occur after the ( k )-th digit. This implies that the repeated part must contain ( l ) zeroes, but there are also infinitely many ones, leading to a contradiction. Hence, ( a ) is irrational.4. Determine ( B(a) ): The set ( B(a) ) consists of all subsequences of 6 consecutive digits in the decimal expansion of ( a ). These subsequences are:   [   B(a) = {000000, 000001, 000010, 000100, 001000, 010000, 100000}   ]   This set has exactly 7 elements.5. Upper bound of 7: Since we have constructed an irrational number ( a ) with ( |B(a)| = 7 ), the minimum number of elements in ( B(x) ) for any irrational ( x ) must be at most 7.6. Prove ( |B(x)| leq 6 ) implies ( x ) is rational: We now show that if ( |B(x)| leq 6 ), then ( x ) must be rational. Let ( B_k(x) ) be the set of all subsequences of the decimal expansion of ( x ) with ( k ) digits. We claim that if ( |B_k(x)| leq k ), then ( x ) must be rational. We will prove this by induction on ( k ).   - Base case ( k = 1 ): If ( |B_1(x)| = 1 ), then ( x ) must be of the form ( 0.yyyldots = frac{y}{9} ) for some digit ( y ), which is rational.      - Inductive step: Assume the statement holds for ( k ).

For what smallest N can the magician agree with the assistant so that the trick is guaranteed to succeed?","solution":"Suppose that for some value of N the trick is possible. Then for each variant of the sequence with two closed digits (let their number be k_{1}), the magician can restore the original; that is, to each sequence with two closed digits, the magician can uniquely correspond the restored sequence of N digits (let their number be k_{2}). Therefore, k_{1} geq k_{2}.Note that k_{1}=(N-1) 10^{N-2} (there are N-1 ways to cross out two digits, and for the remaining N-2 positions, there are 10 options for each). And k_{2}=10^{N}. Thus, N-1 geq 100, that is, N geq 101.We will show how to perform the trick for N=101. Let the sum of all digits in odd positions have a remainder s when divided by 10, and the sum of all digits in even positions have a remainder t when divided by 10 (positions are numbered from left to right by numbers from 0 to 100). Let p=10 s+t. Let the assistant cover the digits in positions p and p+1. Seeing which digits are covered, the magician will determine p, and consequently, determine s and t. Note that one covered digit is in an odd position, and the other is in an even position. Thus, by calculating the sum of the open digits in odd positions and knowing s, the magician will determine the covered digit in the odd position. Similarly, the covered digit in the even position is determined.## AnswerFor N=101."},{"problem":"Lenka is thinking of two two-digit numbers. One has both digits even, and the other has both digits odd. When she adds both numbers, she gets another two-digit number with the first digit even and the second digit odd. Additionally, Lenka revealed that all two-digit numbers are multiples of three, and one of the three odd digits is 9. What numbers could Lenka be thinking of? Find all possibilities.(V. Hucíková)","solution":"The sum of an even and an odd number is always an odd number. However, in the final sum, the digit in the tens place is even, which is only possible if the sum of the digits in the units place is greater than 10. At the same time, we realize that for the two addends, this sum is at most 18.Now we will determine which of the odd numbers can be 9:- If it were the second digit in the result, then the sum of the digits in the units place would be 19, which is too much.- If it were the first digit in one of the addends, then this addend would be at least 91. The addend with even digits is at least 20 (the tens place cannot be 0), so the resulting sum would not be a two-digit number.The only remaining possibility is that 9 is the second digit in the addend with odd digits. We don't see any problem here yet, so we continue to investigate:The addend with odd digits can be19, 39, 59, 79, or 99.Of these numbers, only 39 and 99 are multiples of 3. However, 99 is too large (adding any number would result in a three-digit number), so Lenka's number with odd digits can only be 39.From this, we see that the second addend must not be greater than 60 (to keep the sum a two-digit number). This number must have only even digits, and from the first paragraph, we know that the units place must be at least 2. Therefore, the addend with even digits can be22, 24, 26, 28, 42, 44, 46, or 48.Of these numbers, only 24, 42, and 48 are multiples of 3.

Therefore, the number in position 73 is the first number that starts with 4, which is the number 41235, while the number in position 96 is the last number that starts with 4, i.e., the number 45321.We conclude then that the number in position 85 is a number that starts with 4. What we will do now is repeat the process above for the second digit. Using the same argument as above, we have 3 times 2 times 1 = 6 numbers that start with 41, and these are clearly smaller than those that start with 42 (which are also 6).

Convert the angle alpha into an equivalent angle within one full rotation. Since one full rotation is 360^{circ}, we can express alpha as a sum of multiple full rotations plus a remainder angle that is less than 360^{circ}. This gives us:   [   alpha = 2022^{circ} = 360^{circ} times 5 + 222^{circ}   ]   This calculation shows that alpha is equivalent to an angle of 222^{circ} after accounting for full rotations.2. Since beta must have the same terminal side as alpha and be within the range (0, 2pi), or equivalently (0^{circ}, 360^{circ}), we find that beta corresponds to the remainder angle of 222^{circ} from step 1. 3.

First, analyze the given that y=f(x) is an increasing function defined on mathbb{R}, and it satisfies the solution set of |f(x+1)|<1 is {x|-1<x<2}. We are asked to find the points that the graph passes through. Considering |f(x+1)|<1, which means -1<f(x+1)<1, by the interval of the range and domain, and according to the function's monotonicity, we can directly determine the values at the endpoints. Thus, we can obtain the answer.  This problem mainly examines the solution method of absolute value inequalities, involving the issue of function monotonicity.

First, calculate the number of regions formed by s lines that are not parallel to each other and no three of which are concurrent.Let a_{n} represent the number of regions formed by n lines that are not parallel to each other and no three of which are concurrent.When we add one more line, it intersects the previous n lines at n points, meaning this new line is divided into n+1 segments (line segments and rays), and each segment divides the original region into two.Thus, adding one more line increases the number of regions by n+1, so a_{n+1}=a_{n}+(n+1).It is easy to see that a_{1}=2, so a_{n}=a_{n-1}+n=a_{n-2}+(n-1)+n=cdots=n+(n-1)+cdots+3+2+2=1+frac{n(n+1)}{2} .Therefore, s lines divide the plane into 1+frac{s(s+1)}{2} regions.Since each horizontal line intersects these s lines at s points, this horizontal line is divided into s+1 segments, and each segment divides the original region into two.That is, adding one horizontal line increases the number of regions by s+1.Thus, after adding h horizontal lines, the number of regions in the plane is h(s+1)+1+frac{s(s+1)}{2}=1992,which simplifies to (s+1)(2 h+s)=2 times 11 times 181, so we haveTherefore, the desired pairs of positive integers (h, s) are (995,1),(176,10),(80,21)."},{"problem":"Find all positive integers n such that 2^{n}+12^{n}+2011^{n} is a perfect square.","solution":"The answer n=1 works, because 2^{1}+12^{1}+2011^{1}=45^{2}.

Understanding the Problem:   We are given a continuous, even, non-negative function ( p ) with (int_{mathbb{R}} p(x) , dx = 1). This function ( p ) serves as the probability density function for the independent identically distributed random variables (xi_1, xi_2, ldots, xi_n). We need to prove that the probability that all random variables ( X_1, X_2, ldots, X_{n-1} ) lie between ( X_0 ) and ( X_n ) is (frac{1}{n}).2. Defining the Random Walk:   Define the random walk as follows:   [   X_0 = 0, quad X_1 = X_0 + xi_1, quad X_2 = X_1 + xi_2, quad ldots, quad X_n = X_{n-1} + xi_n   ]   This implies:   [   X_k = sum_{i=1}^k xi_i quad text{for} quad k = 1, 2, ldots, n   ]3.

For each of the (2n) points, we look at the first (2n-1) partial sums starting from that point. Notice that we can find exactly 2 points on the circle for which the partial sums have a constant sign.5. Summing Indicator Functions:   The event that (X_1, X_2, ldots, X_{n-1}) lie between (X_0) and (X_n) is equivalent to:   [   mathbf{1}_{xi_1, xi_2, ldots, xi_n} + mathbf{1}_{xi_2, ldots, xi_n, -xi_1} + cdots + mathbf{1}_{xi_n, -xi_1, ldots, -xi_{n-1}} + cdots + mathbf{1}_{-xi_n, xi_1, ldots, xi_{n-1}} = 2   ]6.

Simplifying the GCD:   [   gcd(f(m), k^2n) = k cdot gcd(f(m), kn)   ]   Therefore:   [   f(mkn) = frac{mkn}{gcd(m, kn)} cdot k cdot gcd(f(m), kn)   ]6. Conclusion:   From the above steps, we see that ( k ) must divide ( f(m) ) for all ( m ). Hence, we can write ( f(m) = km ) for all ( m ).7.

We will prove the statement of the problem by induction on n. For n=1 it is obvious. Let now f_{1}(x), f_{2}(x), ldots, f_{n}(x) be the given quadratic trinomials (n geqslant 2), and let f_{n}(x) be the trinomial with the smallest leading coefficient (if there are several, then any of them). Denote the boundary of our region by T. We can assume that T contains segments of all the graphs.Let S be the set of all numbers a such that the point of the set T with abscissa a lies on the graph of the trinomial f_{n}(x). In other words, the number a belongs to S if and only if the inequalities f_{n}(a) geqslant f_{i}(a) hold for all i=1,2, ldots, n-1. Denote by S_{i} the set of all solutions to the i-th inequality; then S=S_{1} cap S_{2} cap ldots cap S_{n-1}. Since the trinomial f_{n}(x)-f_{i}(x) either has a negative leading coefficient or is actually linear, S_{i} is either a segment (possibly degenerate), a ray, or the entire line. Therefore, S is also a set of this type.Thus, T has no more than two vertices lying on the graph of f_{n}(x). If we remove this graph, these vertices will disappear (and possibly new ones will appear). By the induction hypothesis, the new region will have no more than 2(n-2) vertices; hence, the original region had no more than 2(n-2)+2=2(n-1) vertices, which is what we needed to prove.Remark 1. The estimate given in the problem statement is achievable. As an example, we can take the quadratic trinomials 2 x^{2}, 2 x^{2}-(x-1)(x-2), 2 x^{2}-(x-3)(x-4), 2 x^{2}-(x-5)(x-6), ldots.Remark 2. We will present a scheme of another approach to the problem, which is suitable not only for quadratic trinomials but also for any continuous functions f_{1}, f_{2}, ldots, f_{n}, the graphs of any two of which intersect in no more than two points.Let T be divided by the intersection points of the functions into segments I_{0}, I_{1}, ldots, I_{k} of the graphs of the functions f_{m_{0}}, f_{m_{1}}, ldots, f_{m_{k}} (we assume that the segments are numbered from left to right).

It is also not difficult to show that it is impossible to obtain a word of the form (a, b, a, b), where a neq b, from the word M by deleting several letters (condition 2)^{*}.

Next, we need to consider if there are any other possible solutions. Suppose there exists at least one ( a_j neq b ). Without loss of generality, assume ( a_1 neq b ). Let us analyze the implications:   - If ( a_1 > b ), then ( a_1^{a_1} ) would be significantly larger than ( b^b ), making it difficult to balance the sum to exactly ( 2002b^b ) with the remaining terms.   - If ( a_1 < b ), then ( a_1^{a_1} ) would be significantly smaller than ( b^b ), requiring other terms to be larger to balance the sum, which again would be difficult to achieve.4. To formalize this, consider the growth rates of ( a_j^{a_j} ):   - For ( a_j > b ), ( a_j^{a_j} ) grows much faster than ( b^b ).   - For ( a_j < b ), ( a_j^{a_j} ) grows much slower than ( b^b ).5. Given the constraints and the rapid growth of the function ( x^x ), it is highly unlikely to find a combination of different ( a_j ) values that sum to exactly ( 2002b^b ) without all ( a_j ) being equal to ( b ).6. Therefore, the only feasible solution is:   [   (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2002}) = (b, b, ldots, b)   ]The final answer is ( boxed{ (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2002}) = (b, b, ldots, b) } )."},{"problem":"Find all functions ( f: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R} ) that satisfy the conditions [ f(1+x y)-f(x+y)=f(x) f(y) quad text{for all } x, y in mathbb{R} ]and ( f(-1) neq 0 ).","solution":"The only solution is the function f(x)=x-1, x in mathbb{R}. We set g(x)=f(x)+1 and show that g(x)=x for all real x.

Setting y=-1 in (1) gives  g(1-x)-g(x-1)=C(g(x)-1) .  Set x=1 in (2) to obtain C(g(1)-1)=0. Hence g(1)=1 as C neq 0. Now plugging in x=0 and x=2 yields g(0)=0 and g(2)=2 respectively. We pass on to the key observations  begin{array}{ll} g(x)+g(2-x)=2 & text { for all } x in mathbb{R}  g(x+2)-g(x)=2 & text { for all } x in mathbb{R} end{array}  Replace x by 1-x in (2), then change x to -x in the resulting equation. We obtain the relations g(x)-g(-x)=C(g(1-x)-1), g(-x)-g(x)=C(g(1+x)-1). Then adding them up leads to C(g(1-x)+g(1+x)-2)=0. Thus C neq 0 implies (3). Let u, v be such that u+v=1. Apply (1) to the pairs (u, v) and (2-u, 2-v) :  g(1+u v)-g(1)=(g(u)-1)(g(v)-1), quad g(3+u v)-g(3)=(g(2-u)-1)(g(2-v)-1) .  Observe that the last two equations have equal right-hand sides by (3). Hence u+v=1 implies  g(u v+3)-g(u v+1)=g(3)-g(1) .  Each x leq 5 / 4 is expressible in the form x=u v+1 with u+v=1 (the quadratic function t^{2}-t+(x-1) has real roots for left.x leq 5 / 4right). Hence g(x+2)-g(x)=g(3)-g(1) whenever x leq 5 / 4. Because g(x)=x holds for x=0,1,2, setting x=0 yields g(3)=3. This proves (4) for x leq 5 / 4. If x>5 / 4 then -x<5 / 4 and so g(2-x)-g(-x)=2 by the above. On the other hand (3) gives g(x)=2-g(2-x), g(x+2)=2-g(-x), so that g(x+2)-g(x)=g(2-x)-g(-x)=2. Thus (4) is true for all x in mathbb{R}. Now replace x by -x in (3) to obtain g(-x)+g(2+x)=2. In view of (4) this leads to g(x)+g(-x)=0, i. e. g(-x)=-g(x) for all x. Taking this into account, we apply (1) to the pairs (-x, y) and (x,-y) : g(1-x y)-g(-x+y)=(g(x)+1)(1-g(y)), quad g(1-x y)-g(x-y)=(1-g(x))(g(y)+1). Adding up yields g(1-x y)=1-g(x) g(y). Then g(1+x y)=1+g(x) g(y) by (3). Now the original equation (1) takes the form g(x+y)=g(x)+g(y). Hence g is additive. By additivity g(1+x y)=g(1)+g(x y)=1+g(x y); since g(1+x y)=1+g(x) g(y) was shown above, we also have g(x y)=g(x) g(y) ( g is multiplicative). In particular y=x gives gleft(x^{2}right)=g(x)^{2} geq 0 for all x, meaning that g(x) geq 0 for x geq 0. Since g is additive and bounded from below on [0,+infty), it is linear; more exactly g(x)=g(1) x=x for all x in mathbb{R}. In summary f(x)=x-1, x in mathbb{R}.

Understanding the Problem:   - We need to find ( N ) consecutive integers ( n, n+1, n+2, ldots, n+N-1 ).   - For each ( k ) from 1 to ( N ), the sum of the digits of the ( k )-th integer ( s(n+k-1) ) must be divisible by ( k ).2. Analyzing the Sum of Digits:   - The sum of the digits function ( s(n) ) is not straightforward to handle due to its non-linear nature.   - We need to consider the properties of digit sums and how they change with consecutive numbers.3. Key Insight:   - Consider the sum of the digits of numbers in the form ( n, n+1, n+2, ldots ).   - The sum of the digits function ( s(n) ) can be affected by carries when moving from one number to the next.4. Pattern and Carry Over:   - When moving from ( n ) to ( n+1 ), the sum of the digits can increase or decrease depending on the presence of carries.   - For example, moving from 999 to 1000 causes a significant change in the sum of the digits.5. Divisibility Condition:   - For ( s(n+k-1) ) to be divisible by ( k ), we need to ensure that the sum of the digits modulo ( k ) is zero.6. Constructing a Sequence:   - To find the largest ( N ), we need to ensure that the sum of the digits of each number in the sequence meets the divisibility condition.   - This is challenging due to the irregular changes in the sum of the digits.7. Example and Verification:   - The solution suggests that ( N = 21 ) is the largest number for which this condition holds.   - To verify, consider the sequence starting from ( n = 291 times 10^{10!} - 12 ).8. Checking the Sequence:   - For ( N = 21 ), we need to check if the sum of the digits of each number in the sequence ( n, n+1, ldots, n+20 ) is divisible by ( 1, 2, ldots, 21 ) respectively.   - This involves detailed checking of the sum of digits and their divisibility.9. Conclusion:   - The main idea is that among ( s(n+2) ), ( s(n+12) ), and ( s(n+22) ), there are two consecutive numbers which is impossible since all of them should be even.   - This implies that for ( N > 21 ), the condition cannot be satisfied.The final answer is ( boxed{ N = 21 } )."},{"problem":"Given an ellipse with the equation frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > b > 0) and an eccentricity of e = frac{sqrt{2}}{3}, the focal length is 2sqrt{2}.(1) Find the equation of the ellipse.(2) Point A is a point on the ellipse, and {F_1}, {F_2} are the two foci of the ellipse.

Since the quadratic trinomial takes its maximum value, its leading coefficient is negative, and the maximum value is reached at the vertex of the parabola, i.e., at the point x_{0}=-frac{b}{2 a}. This value is fleft(x_{0}right)=a cdot frac{b^{2}}{4 a^{2}}-frac{b^{2}}{2 a}+c=-frac{b^{2}}{4 a}+c.If we add x^{2} to f(x), we get the quadratic trinomial (a+1) x^{2}+b x+c, for which the maximum value is -frac{b^{2}}{4 a+4}+c. If we subtract 4 x^{2} from f(x), we get the quadratic trinomial (a-4) x^{2}+b x+c, for which the maximum value is -frac{b^{2}}{4 a-16}+c.

Among his extensive writings, he is most famous for his work \\"Complete Book of Music Theory.\\" In the eyes of Westerners, he was considered a scholar prince with encyclopedic knowledge. His greatest contribution to the arts was the creation of the \\"twelve-tone equal temperament,\\" a theory widely used in keyboard instruments around the world, including the piano. Therefore, Zhu Zaiyu is known as the \\"ancestor of piano theory.\\" The \\"twelve-tone equal temperament\\" refers to an octave with 13 notes, where the frequency ratio between adjacent notes is equal, and the frequency of the last note is twice that of the initial note. If the frequency of the second note is f_{2} and the frequency of the eighth note is f_{8}, then frac{{f_{8}}}{{f_{2}}} is ______.","solution":"To solve the problem, we start by understanding that the frequencies of the 13 notes in the \\"twelve-tone equal temperament\\" system form a geometric sequence. This is because each note's frequency is a constant ratio away from its neighbors, and the frequency of the last note is twice that of the first note. Let's denote this sequence as {a_{n}}, where n represents the position of the note in the sequence, and the common ratio of this sequence as q. Given that the frequency of the last note (a_{13}) is twice that of the first note (a_{1}), we can write this relationship as:[a_{13} = 2a_{1}]Since the sequence is geometric, we also know that the frequency of the 13th note can be expressed in terms of the first note and the common ratio raised to the 12th power (because there are 12 intervals between the first and the last note):[a_{13} = a_{1}q^{12}]Setting these two expressions for a_{13} equal to each other gives us:[2a_{1} = a_{1}q^{12}]Dividing both sides by a_{1} (assuming a_{1} neq 0) and solving for q gives us the common ratio:[q = 2^{frac{1}{12}}]Now, to find the frequency ratio between the second note (f_{2}) and the eighth note (f_{8}), we recognize that these correspond to a_{2} and a_{8} in our sequence, respectively. The frequency of any note in the sequence can be found by multiplying the first note's frequency by the common ratio raised to the power of the note's position minus one. Therefore, the frequency of the second note is a_{2} = a_{1}q^{1}, and the frequency of the eighth note is a_{8} = a_{1}q^{7}. The ratio of the frequencies of the eighth and second notes is then:[frac{f_{8}}{f_{2}} = frac{a_{1}q^{7}}{a_{1}q^{1}} = q^{6}]Substituting the value of q we found earlier:[frac{f_{8}}{f_{2}} = (2^{frac{1}{12}})^{6} = 2^{frac{6}{12}} = 2^{frac{1}{2}} = sqrt{2}]Therefore, the frequency ratio between the second and eighth notes in the \\"twelve-tone equal temperament\\" system is boxed{sqrt{2}}."},{"problem":"1.

Each day any groups not performing watch the others (but groups performing that day do not watch the others). What is the smallest number of days for which the festival can last if every group watches every other group at least once during the festival? Solution","solution":": 6 days. It is not obvious how to approach this. Consider the case of n groups. It is easy to make do with n days. For example, on day i, group i performs and the others watch. Or vice versa. For n = 3, 3 days are necessary, 1 watching 2, 2 watching 3 and 3 watching 1 must occur on separate days. It is not quite as obvious that 4 days are needed for n = 4. Suppose three days suffice. Then on some day two groups perform. Wlog 1 and 2 perform on day 1. Then we need two more days for 1 to watch 2 and 2 to watch 1. So assume 1 watches 2 on day 2 and 2 watches 1 on day 3. The only day 1 is in the audience is day 2, so 3 and 4 must perform on day 2. Similarly, 2 is only in the audience on day 3, so 3 and 4 must perform on day 3. But now 3 and 4 must be in the audience on day 1 in order to watch 1 and 2. That means they cannot watch each other. So we need 4 days. However, 4 days suffice for n = 6. For example: 1 2 3 watch 4 5 6 1 4 5 watch 2 3 6 2 4 6 watch 1 3 5 3 5 6 watch 1 2 4 Note that if m days suffice for n, then they also suffice for n-1 - just delete one group from the schedule. So 4 days also suffice for 5. They must be necessary, because otherwise we could do 4 groups in 3 days. We can now do 12 groups in 6 days (and hence also 11 groups in 6 days): 1 2 3 A B C watch 4 5 6 D E F 1 4 5 A D E watch 2 3 6 B C F 2 4 6 B D F watch 1 3 5 A C E 3 5 6 C E F watch 1 2 4 A B D 1 2 3 4 5 6 watch A B C D E F A B C D E F watch 1 2 3 4 5 6 Note that this is general. If m days suffice for n groups, then m+2 suffice for 2n groups. With a slight variant we can do 10 groups in 5 days: 1 2 3 A B C watch 4 5 6 D 1 4 5 A B D watch 2 3 6 C2 4 6 A C D watch 1 3 5 B 3 5 6 B C D watch 1 2 4 A 1 2 3 4 5 6 watch A B C D So to finish off we have to show that 5 days are not sufficient for 11 groups. If we also show that 4 are not sufficient for 7 groups, then we have dealt with all cases up to n = 12. Consider n = 7. Suppose we only need 4 days. If a group only performs once, then the other 6 groups must watch that day. So none of them watch each other. So they need at least 4 days to watch each other and only 3 are available. So each group must perform at least twice. But that means on some day at least 4 groups perform (4 days x 3 groups < 7 groups x 2 performances). On that day none of the 4 can watch each other. But they need 4 days to watch each other. So 7 groups need at least 5 days. Consider n = 11. Suppose we only need 5 days. Each day at least 6 groups are watching or at least 6 groups are performing. So there must be three days with at least 6 groups watching or three days with at least 6 groups performing. But that means that there are 4 groups which all perform on 2 days or which all watch on 2 days. In either case, they need a further 4 days to watch each other. Contradiction. [The claim that if 6 groups watch on three days, then we can find a particular set of 4 which watch on two of the three days is justified as follows. If only 3 watch on more than one day, then that leaves 8 who watch on just one day. So there is a day when at most 2 of the 8 watch. But then on that day at most 2 + 3 can watch, whereas 6 are supposed to.] Summary: n 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 days 3 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 6 6 13th CanMO 1981 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 21 June 2002"},{"problem":"Let x_1, x_2 in mathbb{R}, and let a > 0 be a constant.

Since the middle 3 seats cannot be occupied, there are 8 available seats left in the front row. For the back row, there are no restrictions, so all 12 seats are available.When arranging 2 people, if they are seated in the same row, we need to ensure they are not adjacent. If they are seated in different rows, there are no adjacency restrictions.1. Both in the front row: Since there are 8 available seats and they cannot sit next to each other, we treat them as a unit plus an extra \\"phantom\\" seat to ensure separation. This gives us 7 units to arrange, which can be done in 7 times 6 = 42 ways (choosing the first seat for the first person, then the next available seat for the second person).2.

Identify the problem constraints:   We need to find all positive integers ( d ) such that there exists a polynomial ( P ) of degree ( d ) with integer coefficients, and (|P(m)| = 1) for at least ( d+1 ) different integers ( m ).2. Construct examples for small ( d ):   - For ( d = 1 ), consider ( P(x) = 2x - 1 ). This polynomial satisfies (|P(1)| = 1) and (|P(0)| = 1), so it works.   - For ( d = 2 ), consider ( P(x) = 2x(x-2) + 1 ). This polynomial satisfies (|P(0)| = 1), (|P(1)| = 1), and (|P(2)| = 1), so it works.   - For ( d = 3 ), consider ( P(x) = x(x-1)(x-3) + 1 ). This polynomial satisfies (|P(0)| = 1), (|P(1)| = 1), (|P(2)| = 1), and (|P(3)| = 1), so it works.3. Prove that ( d geq 4 ) fails:   - We need at least ( d+1 ) total integer roots of ( P(x) - 1 ) and ( P(x) + 1 ). Without loss of generality, assume ( P(x) + 1 ) has at least (frac{d+1}{2}) of these roots.   - By shifting vertically, the problem is equivalent to having at least ( d+1 ) total integer roots of ( P(x) ) and ( P(x) - 2 ), with at least (frac{d+1}{2}) total integer roots of ( P(x) ).4. Analyze the case ( d geq 4 ):   - Since ( d geq 4 ), ( P(x) ) must have at least 3 integer roots. Write ( P(x) = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)Q(x) ) for some nonzero polynomial ( Q ) and distinct integers ( a, b, c ).   - If ( P(x) = 2 ), then we require ({x-a, x-b, x-c} = {2, 1, -1}) or ({1, -1, -2}). Since ( a, b, c ) are distinct, we cannot have ( x-a = x-b = 1 ) and ( x-c = 2 ).5. Consider the case ( P(x) - 2 ) has at least 2 integer roots:   - If ( P(x) - 2 ) has at least 2 integer roots, then ( P(x) ) still has at least 3 integer roots. Write ( P(x) = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)Q(x) ).   - For ( P(x) = 2 ), we need ({x-a, x-b, x-c} = {2, 1, -1}) or ({1, -1, -2}). This leads to contradictions as shown in the solution.6. Consider the case ( P(x) - 2 ) has exactly 1 integer root:   - If ( P(x) - 2 ) has exactly 1 integer root, then ( P(x) ) must have at least 4 integer roots. Write ( P(x) = (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)(x-d)Q(x) ).   - For ( x ) to be a root of ( P(x) - 2 ), we need ( x-a, x-b, x-c, x-d in {1, -1, 2, -2} ). By the Pigeonhole Principle, ({x-a, x-b, x-c, x-d} = {1, -1, 2, -2}), but then ( 4 mid P(x) ), leading to a contradiction.7. Consider the case ( P(x) - 2 ) has no integer roots:   - If ( P(x) - 2 ) has no integer roots, then all ( d+1 ) roots must belong to ( P(x) ). However, ( P(x) ) has degree exactly ( d ), so this is absurd. The only polynomial of degree at most ( d ) which has at least ( d+1 ) roots is the zero polynomial, which cannot have degree ( d ).8.

Rephrasing the Condition:   The condition ( x + y ) does not divide ( z ) can be simplified. Since ( x < y < z ), ( x + y neq z ) is a necessary condition. However, we need to ensure that ( x + y ) does not divide ( z ) for any ( z ) in ( M ).3. Constructing the Subset ( M ):   Let's consider the largest element in ( M ) to be ( n ). We will analyze the cases when ( n ) is even and when ( n ) is odd.4.

Anna and Baptiste are playing the following game. At the beginning of the game, 2022 white squares, numbered from 1 to 2022, are placed in front of them. Then, taking turns, starting with Anna, they choose a white square and color it in the color of their choice: either red or blue. The game ends after 2022 turns, that is, when the last white square is colored.Anna's score is then equal to the number of integers a leqslant 2019 such that the two squares numbered a and a+3 are the same color. Anna wants to have the highest score possible; Baptiste wants Anna's score to be as low as possible. What is the highest score Anna can ensure, regardless of the moves Baptiste chooses to play?","solution":"Solution to Exercise 2 For simplicity, we will say that two integers a and b are friends if a=b pm 3. We will say that a is pretty if a=b-3 and if a and b are colored the same color, and that a is ugly if a=b-3 and if a and b are colored different colors: Anna therefore wants to maximize the number of pretty integers at the end of the game. If a or b is not yet colored, a is neither pretty nor ugly.Furthermore, for each integer k=0,1 and 2, we will denote by mathcal{E}_{k} the set of integers n such that 1 leqslant n leqslant 2022 and n equiv k(bmod 3). We say that a set mathcal{E}_{k} is started as soon as at least one cell whose number is in mathcal{E}_{k} has been colored.We will first demonstrate that Anna can ensure a score of at least 1008 points. To do this, the strategy Anna adopts is as follows.1. If there exists an integer a that is not yet colored, and a friend, say b, is colored, then Anna chooses such an integer a and colors it the same color as b; if several integers a and/or b were available, any of these integers a and b will do.2. If, on the contrary, no such integer a exists, Anna colors a random white cell.In case 1, the integer min {a, b} becomes pretty, which increases Anna's score by at least 1. In case 2, if a set mathcal{E}_{k} was already started when Anna is about to play, it means that all its elements were already colored; consequently, with her move, Anna starts a new set mathcal{E}_{k}.In particular, case 2 occurs at most 3 times during the game, and since Anna plays 1011 moves, case 1 occurs at least 1008 times during the game. As expected, Anna thus ensures a final score of at least 1008 points.Conversely, we will now demonstrate that Baptiste can prevent Anna from scoring more than 1008 points, regardless of the moves she decides to play. To do this, the strategy Baptiste adopts is as follows.1. If there exists an integer a that is not yet colored, and a friend, say b, is colored, then Baptiste chooses such an integer a and colors it the opposite color to that of b; if several integers a and/or b were available, any of these integers a and b will do.2. If, on the contrary, no such integer a exists, Baptiste colors a random white cell. In case 1, the integer min {a, b} becomes ugly. In case 2, any set mathcal{E}_{k} already started when Baptiste is about to play was already colored; if n sets were started at that moment, it means that 2022 n / 3=674 n moves had already been played, and thus it was actually Anna's turn to play.Consequently, case 2 never occurs, and since Baptiste plays 1011 moves, there are at least 1011 ugly integers at the end of the game. Furthermore, the three integers 2020, 2021, and 2022 will be neither pretty nor ugly. Among our 2022 integers, there are therefore at least 1011+3 that will never be pretty, and Anna's score will thus never exceed 2022-(1011+3)=1008.Graders' Comments This problem was solved unevenly, with students falling into two main categories: on the one hand, those, quite numerous, who managed to solve the problem; on the other hand, those, equally numerous, who, although they had a reasonable intuition of what could happen, failed to correctly define strategies for Anna and Baptiste.Students in this second category simply described how, move by move, Anna and Baptiste were supposed to play if they wanted to play optimally. However, this could in no way constitute a proof: in general, when giving a strategy for a player, it is necessary to indicate what moves this player should make even if their opponent plays in an apparently random manner. Incidentally, doing so generally leads to much simpler proofs.Moreover, the description these students gave was almost systematically incorrect, as Baptiste is not required to directly counter Anna to prevent her from scoring more than 1008 points. For example, if Anna colors the integer 1 red, a relevant strategy for Baptiste could be to color the integer 7 blue.It is therefore unfortunate that many students end up with very few points, even though they thought they had solved the problem. For these students, it will be very important to remember the proper way to define a strategy for a player, as described above."},{"problem":"97.

If there are exactly two twos, then the zero must stand both between them and after them, but then there must be at least two zeros. Therefore, only on twos and zeros, we need 4 digits (either two twos and two zeros, or three twos and one zero).If there is one one, then before it should be 2,0,2, and after it - two more twos and a zero. At the same time, the zero stands both between the twos and after them (1220 and 1202), so we need one more two or one more zero, making it 8 digits in total.Suppose there are two ones. If there are exactly two twos, then we need a one after these twos (2021), between them (2120), and before them (1220), which leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there must be at least three twos. If there are 6 digits in total, then the zero is the only one. Then it stands after two twos and before one. From the number 1220, we get that one of the ones stands before the first two twos and the zero, and from the number 2021, we get that the other one stands after the last two. Then we definitely get the arrangement - 122021, but alas, from it, we cannot get the number 2120. Therefore, one zero is not enough, and we already have 7 digits.Suppose there are three ones. We need 4 more digits for twos and zeros, so we have 7 digits in total.Suppose there are 7 digits. The first digit is not zero, so it must be 1. If the next digit is 0, then it is useless (in our numbers, 0 appears only after twos). Two ones in a row or two zeros make no sense, as in each of our numbers, 0 or 1 appear only once. Therefore, the second most significant digit is 2, followed by 0, and then 1. 1201... We have three more digits, one of which is definitely a two.

Given that the mode is 5, and 5 is already present in the set, either x or y must be 5 to maintain 5 as the mode.3.

Let's complete a part of the graph of the functions f(x)={x}^{2} and g(x)=left{x^{2}right}. The function f is periodic, with the smallest period being 1, and the branches of the curve are translations of the arc of the normal parabola (Figure 1).1986-05-205-1 . mathrm{eps}Figure 1The graph of g can be obtained by slicing the graph of the function x rightarrow x^{2} horizontally, unit by unit, and then translating the half-open curve segments parallel to the y-axis so that their starting points fall on the x-axis (Figure 2).1986-05-205-2 . mathrm{eps}Figure 2Now consider the graphs of the two functions over one period of f, on the interval [k, k+1), where k geqq 1 is an integer. Here, the graph of g has as many branches as there are integers in the range of x rightarrow x^{2} when x varies over the interval [k, k+1). Since this function is strictly increasing, the number of branches is (k+1)^{2}-k^{2} (Figure 3).1986-05-206-1 . mathrm{eps}Figure 3It is clear that, except for the last one, each of these branches intersects the graph of f exactly once. (The first branch has its starting point on the x-axis, which is common with the graph of f.) This means that the equation (1) has (k+1)^{2}-k^{2}-1 solutions in the interval [k, k+1).Accordingly, the number of roots in the interval [k, k+1) issum_{k=1}^{99}left((k+1)^{2}-k^{2}-1right).In the sum, the square numbers appear with alternating signs, except for the first and the last, so the above sum is 100^{2}-1^{2}-99=9900. Since in addition to these, x=100 is also a solution, the equation has 9901 solutions in the interval [1, 100].Remark. In the above solution, we wrote: \\"it is clear that\\" the branches of the graph of g intersect the graph of f at one point. Indeed, we made concessions for the sake of clarity, but the graphs were derived from the image of the function x rightarrow x^{2}, whose properties are well known. What might be missing from the solution is a precise statement of which properties of the quadratic function we are actually referring to.## 1986-05-206-2 . mathrm{eps}Figure 4The existence of at least one common point for each branch is indeed obvious, and the fact that there is no more than one follows from the fact that both curve segments can be extended to parabolas, which are translations of the graph of x rightarrow x^{2}; one parallel to the x-axis, the other parallel to the y-axis (Figure 4). If two congruent parabolas have more than one common point, then the two curves are identical.For those who still find this \\"obvious\\" statement about the existence of a common point questionable - they are right - we will write down the equation that the x-coordinate of the intersection point of the extended parabolas must satisfy.The k-th arc of the graph of f is given by y=(x-k)^{2}, and the i-th arc of the graph of g in the interval [k, k+1) can be extended to the parabola y=x^{2}-left(k^{2}+iright). Thus, for the x-coordinate of the intersection point of the curves, we have (x-k)^{2}=x^{2}-left(k^{2}+iright), or x=k+frac{i}{2 k}, where i=0,1, ldots, 2 k.These roots, except for the last one, indeed fall within the interval [k, k+1), so the original equation has exactly 2 k, or left((k+1)^{2}-k^{2}-1right) solutions in the interval [k, k+1). This gives us the solutions of (1), although this was not our task.II. solution. Let k geqq 1 be an integer, and consider the solutions of (1) in the interval [k, k+1). If k leqq x < k+1, let x=k+alpha; then clearly alpha={x}. Substituting into (1), we getalpha^{2}=left{(k+alpha)^{2}right}=left{k^{2}+2 k alpha+alpha^{2}right}Here, since 0 leqq alpha^{2}<1, we have alpha^{2}=left{alpha^{2}right}. Now, the fractional part of two numbers is equal if and only if the difference of the two numbers is an integer. Thus, we get that left(k^{2}+2 k alpha+alpha^{2}right)-alpha^{2}=k^{2}+2 k alpha is an integer, and since k is an integer, 2 k alpha is also an integer. Therefore, if k geqq 1, then k+alpha is a solution of (1) for exactly those 0 leqq alpha<1 for which 2 k alpha is an integer. Since there are exactly 2 k such integers, 0,1,2, ldots, 2 k-1, the equation has exactly 2 k solutions in the interval [k, k+1).Thus, (1) has a total of 1+sum_{k=1}^{99} 2 k=9901 roots in the interval [1, 100] (since x=100 is also a solution).Remark. The equation (1) clearly has N^{2}-N+1 roots in the interval [1 ; N], if N is an integer. If, instead of (1), we are looking for the number of solutions of the equation {x}^{n}=left{x^{n}right}, then using the reasoning of the first solution, we get that the number of roots in the interval [1 ; N] is1+sum_{k=1}^{N-1}left((k+1)^{n}-k^{n}-1right)=N^{n}-N+1"},{"problem":"Find all triples (x, y, z) of positive integers satisfying the system of equationsleft{begin{array}{l}x^{2}=2(y+z) x^{6}=y^{6}+z^{6}+31left(y^{2}+z^{2}right)end{array}right.","solution":"From the first equation it follows that x is even.

Equations of the circles:   The equations of the circles are:   [   C_1: (a + y)^2 + b^2 = y^2   ]   [   C_2: (a - x)^2 + b^2 = x^2   ]3. Points on the circles:   Let ( A = (m, n) in C_1 ) and ( B = (p, q) in C_2 ).4. Lines through ( T ):   The lines ( AT ) and ( BT ) are:   [   l_1: y = frac{n}{m} x   ]   [   l_2: y = -frac{m}{n} x   ]   since ( angle ATB = 90^circ ).5. Point ( B ) on ( l_2 ):   Since ( B in l_2 ), we have:   [   q = -frac{m}{n} p   ]6. Substitute ( B ) into ( C_2 ):   Substitute ( B = (p, -frac{m}{n} p) ) into the equation of ( C_2 ):   [   (p - x)^2 + left( -frac{m}{n} p right)^2 = x^2   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   (p - x)^2 + frac{m^2}{n^2} p^2 = x^2   ]   [   p^2 left( 1 + frac{m^2}{n^2} right) - 2px + x^2 = x^2   ]   [   p^2 left( 1 + frac{m^2}{n^2} right) = 2px   ]   [   p = frac{2xn^2}{m^2 + n^2}   ]7. Equation of line ( AB ):   The line ( AB ) can be written as:   [   overline{AB} = l_3: y = -frac{2xmn + m^2n + n^3}{2xn^2 - m^3 - mn^2} x + frac{2xn(n^2 + m^2)}{2xn^2 - m^3 - mn^2}   ]8. Intersection with the ( x )-axis:   The intersection of ( l_3 ) with the ( x )-axis occurs when ( y = 0 ):   [   x' = frac{2x(n^2 + m^2)}{2xm + m^2 + n^2} = -2 frac{xy}{x - y}   ]   This shows that the intersection point depends only on the radii ( x ) and ( y ), not on the specific points ( A ) and ( B ). Therefore, all such lines ( AB ) are concurrent. Part (b)1. Circumcenter of ( triangle ATB ):   Let ( M ) be the midpoint of ( AB ). Since ( angle ATB = 90^circ ), ( M ) is the circumcenter of ( triangle ATB ).2. Perpendicular bisectors:   ( O_1M ) is the perpendicular bisector of ( AT ) and ( O_2M ) is the perpendicular bisector of ( BT ).3. Angle between bisectors:   Since ( angle O_1MO_2 = 90^circ ), ( M ) lies on the circle with diameter ( O_1O_2 ).4. Locus of midpoints:   The locus of the midpoints ( M ) of all such segments ( AB ) is a circle with diameter ( O_1O_2 ).The final answer is the locus of midpoints is a circle with diameter ( boxed{ O_1O_2 } )."},{"problem":"The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence {a_{n}} is S_{n}.

Before considering these cases, we note that whenever there is a block of consecutive T's and B's, then there are exactly two possible configurations for this block.

There are then 9 possible locations for the second mathrm{E} (columns 4 through 12).The leftmost mathrm{E} could be in column 3. There are then 8 possible locations for the second mathrm{E} (columns 5 through 12).We continue in this way to the last possibility, where the leftmost mathrm{E} is in column 10. There is then 1 possible location for the second mathrm{E} (column 12).This gives 9+8+7+cdots+1=45 possible locations for the E's.There are three blocks of T's and B's (to the left of the first E, between the two E's, and to the right of the second mathrm{E} ).There are 2 possible configurations for the each of the three resulting blocks of T's and B's.In this case, there are 45 times 2 times 2 times 2=360 sequences.Combining all of the cases, we see that there are 4+40+2+80+360=486 possible sequences, and so 486 possible ways of tiling the floor.## Part B"},{"problem":"3.

Use the given maximum distance:   - The length of the chord tangent to the inner semicircle is given by (2sqrt{R^2 - r^2} = 12).   - Solving for (R^2 - r^2):     [     2sqrt{R^2 - r^2} = 12 implies sqrt{R^2 - r^2} = 6 implies R^2 - r^2 = 36     ]4. Calculate the area of the room:   - The area of the room is the difference between the areas of the outer and inner semicircles.   - The area of the outer semicircle is (frac{1}{2} pi R^2).   - The area of the inner semicircle is (frac{1}{2} pi r^2).   - Therefore, the area of the room is:     [     frac{1}{2} pi R^2 - frac{1}{2} pi r^2 = frac{1}{2} pi (R^2 - r^2)     ]   - Substitute (R^2 - r^2 = 36):     [     frac{1}{2} pi (R^2 - r^2) = frac{1}{2} pi times 36 = 18pi     ]The final answer is (boxed{18pi})"},{"problem":"Example 8 Given real numbers a, b satisfy ab=10, a^{2}+ b^{2}=c^{2}.

Initial Observations:   - The set of divisors of ( n ) excluding ( n ) itself must be partitioned into two subsets ( F ) and ( T ) with at least 2 elements each.   - The number of divisors of ( n ) (denoted ( tau(n) )) must be at least 5 because ( |F| + |T| + 1 geq 4 ).2. Squarefree Condition:   - If ( n ) is not squarefree, it must be the square of a prime ( p ). However, in this case, ( n ) would have only 2 divisors (1 and ( p )), which contradicts ( tau(n) geq 5 ). Therefore, ( n ) must be squarefree.3. Case Analysis:   - Suppose ( n = p_1 p_2 cdots p_k ) where ( p_i ) are distinct primes.4. Case 1: ( 1 in T ):   - If ( 1 in T ), then for some ( u geq 2 ), the triangular numbers ( 1, 3, dots, frac{u(u+1)}{2} ) must divide ( n ).   - If ( u geq 3 ), then ( 6 mid n ), implying ( 2 in F ). Since ( 1 notin F ), ( 3 in F ) (as ( |F| geq 2 )), leading to a contradiction because ( 3 ) cannot be in both ( F ) and ( T ). Thus, ( u = 2 ) and ( T = {1, 3} ).   - ( n ) must be odd, so ( F ) cannot contain any even Fibonacci numbers, forcing ( |F| = 2 ). This implies ( n ) has exactly 5 divisors, which is impossible because ( n ) has ( 2^k ) divisors. Hence, this case yields no solutions.5. Case 2: ( 1 in F ):   - If ( 1 in F ), then for some ( u geq 2 ), the Fibonacci numbers ( 1, 2, 3, dots, F_u ) must divide ( n ).   - Since ( 8 notmid n ) (as ( n ) is squarefree), ( u ) can be 2, 3, or 4.   - If ( u = 2 ), then ( F = {1, 2} ). This implies ( 2^k = |F| + |T| + 1 geq 5 ), so ( n ) must be of the form ( 2pq ). However, one of ( p ) or ( q ) would exceed 5, which cannot be triangular. Thus, ( u = 3 ) or ( 4 ).   - If ( u = 3 ), then ( F = {1, 2, 3} ). No prime greater than 3 divides ( n ), so ( n = 2 cdot 3 = 6 ), which does not work because it has only 3 proper divisors.   - If ( u = 4 ), then ( F = {1, 2, 3, 5} ). This implies ( 2, 3, 5 mid n ), so ( 30 mid n ). The proper divisors ( 6, 10, 15 ) must be in ( T ). No prime ( p > 5 ) can divide ( n ), and ( 2^k geq 4 + 3 + 1 = 8 ), so ( n = 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 = 30 ).Thus, the only such positive integer ( n ) is ( n = 30 ).The final answer is ( boxed{30} )."},{"problem":"If the sequence {a_n} is defined by the general term a_n = 5 left(frac {2}{5}right)^{2n-2} - 4 left(frac {2}{5}right)^{n-1} where nin mathbb{N^{*}}, and the maximum term of {a_n} is the p-th term, and the minimum term is the q-th term, then q-p is equal to (　　).A: 1B: 2C: 3D: 4","solution":"First, let's denote t = left(frac {2}{5}right)^{n-1}, note that t in (0, 1] as n is a positive integer.

Moreover, since t in (0, 1], the minimum value for a_n based on the squared term alone would be -frac{4}{5}, and the maximum value would be 5(1-frac{2}{5})^2 - frac{4}{5} = 1.The maximum term of the sequence occurs for the minimum value of the squared term; that is, when t = 1, corresponding to n = 1 (since t = (frac{2}{5})^{n-1}).

We then examine the possibilities through case analysis:Let's start filling the boxes. Notice that since the sum 3 is formed, the cards 1 and 2 must go into different boxes. These two cards can be arranged in six different ways. Suppose the card 1 goes into box A, and the card 2 goes into box B. The card 3 cannot then go into box A, otherwise the sum 4 cannot be formed. Therefore, the card 3 either goes into box B - where the card 2 is - or into the previously empty box C. We claim that the placement of the remaining cards is unique in both cases.1. Case (the card 3 goes into box B):- Box C is not empty, so let the smallest card in C be k. Then k+1 can only go into A, otherwise 2+k=(k+1)+1, and the magician cannot decide.But then (k+1)+2=k+3, and the magician still cannot decide unless there is no card k+1. Thus, k+1 \\"does not exist\\", so k=100. In this case, there is one card in boxes A and C, the 1 and the 100, respectively, and the rest go into box B. This arrangement is clearly valid, so we have six cases.2. Case (the card 3 goes into box C):bullet 2+3=4+1,4 in A5+1=4+2 so 5 notin C, and 5+2=4+3, so 5 notin A. Thus, 5 in B. Similarly,6+1=4+3, so 6 notin B, and 6+2=5+3, so 6 notin A. Thus, only 6 in C is possible.By playing this with the second row, we find that the numbers are arranged according to their remainder when divided by 3, and this arrangement is indeed valid.

The correct interpretation is that corresponding angles are equal when two lines are parallel and cut by a transversal.

The length of the projection of a closed convex curve onto any line is 1. Prove that its length is pi.The length of the projection of a closed convex curve onto any line is 1.

Consider an inscribed polygon with perimeter ( P ) and the length of its projection on a line ( l ), equal to ( d_{l} ). Let ( 1-epsilon < d_{l} < 1 ) for all lines ( l ). The polygon can be chosen such that ( epsilon ) can be arbitrarily small. Since the polygon is convex, the sum of the lengths of the projections of its sides onto the line ( l ) is ( 2 d_{l} ).The average value of the quantity ( 2 d_{l} ) is ( 2 P / pi ) (see problem 13.39).

The geometric interpretation of this integral is the area of one quarter of a circle with center at the origin and radius 2. Therefore, int_{0}^{2} sqrt{4-x^{2}}dx = frac{1}{4} cdot 4π = π.2. Next, we evaluate the integral int_{0}^{2} cos frac{pi}{4}x dx. We can use the fundamental theorem of calculus and substitute u = frac{pi}{4}x, which gives us du = frac{pi}{4}dx Rightarrow dx = frac{4}{pi}du. The limits of integration become u(0) = 0 and u(2) = frac{pi}{2}. So, we have   int_{0}^{2} cos frac{pi}{4}x dx = int_{0}^{frac{pi}{2}} cos u frac{4}{pi} du = frac{4}{pi} int_{0}^{frac{pi}{2}} cos u du = frac{4}{pi} [sin u]_{0}^{frac{pi}{2}} = frac{4}{pi} left( sinleft(frac{pi}{2}right) - sin(0)right) = frac{4}{pi}.3.

Given that the circle is divided into two arcs by the x-axis in a ratio of 3:1, the central angle corresponding to the chord cut by the x-axis is 90^{circ}.4. The chord length cut by the x-axis is related to the radius by the equation sqrt{2}r = 4. Solving for r gives us r = 4/sqrt{2} = 2sqrt{2}.5. From the relationship b = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}r, we substitute r = 2sqrt{2} to find b = 2.6. The chord length cut by the y-axis is 2, leading to the equation r^{2} = a^{2} + 1.

Consider the colorings of a 5 times 5 table described in the problem (i.e., such that in each column and each row exactly one cell is colored).For convenience, let's introduce some notations. Let the top-left corner cell of the 5 times 5 table be called A, and the bottom-right corner cell be called B. Suppose that among the colorings of the first table, exactly a have the cell A colored, and exactly b have the cell B colored. Clearly, a=b due to symmetry.Notice that the number of colorings of the second table is equal to the number of colorings of the first table where the cell A is not colored. The number of colorings of the third table is equal to the number of colorings of the first table where neither A nor B is colored. To find this, we subtract from 120 the number of colorings of the first table where A or B is colored. To count the number of such colorings, we add a and b, and then subtract what has been counted twice - the ways where both A and B are colored.All colorings of the first table can be divided into two types: those in which the cell A is colored, and those in which it is not. This leads to the equation 120=a+96, i.e., a=24. Then b=24 as well.The number of colorings where both A and B are colored is the same as the number of ways to color the central 3 times 3 square.

Let's divide the DOD into two parts: x=0 and x geqslant 1.If x=0, then equation (8) turns into a true numerical equality. Thus, the number 0 is a solution to equation (8).If x geqslant 1, then |x|=x and sqrt{x^{2}(x-1)}=x sqrt{x-1}; therefore, equation (8) takes the form x sqrt{x-1}=x. Under these conditions, the left and right sides of the last equation can be divided by x. Then we have the equation sqrt{x-1}=1, which is equivalent to the equation x=2.Combining the solutions of equation (8) found on both parts of its DOD, we get x_{1}=0 and x_{2}=2 - the solutions of equation (8).The second method.

Thus, the two disjoint sets {f(1), f(2), cdots, f(k)} and {g(1), g(2), g(3), cdots, g(n)} contain all natural numbers from 1 to g(n). By counting the number of elements in these two sets, we get g(n)=k+n, i.e., g(n)=f(n)+n. Hence, equation (1) holds.Furthermore, from k+n=g(n)=f(k)+1, we get f(k)=k+n-1, i.e., f[f(n)]=f(n)+n-1.

The maximal number of houses is 50 .","solution":"Solution. Let us represent the tract as an 8 times 8-chessboard, with cells colored black if the corresponding parcel is occupied, and white otherwise. We denote by (i, j) the cell in the i- th row and j-th column (with the first row being the northernmost and the first column being the westernmost). We start by showing that an optimal configuration can be obtained by coloring all the cells along the east, south, and west borders.Assume that there is an optimal configuration in which one of those cells, for example (i, 1), is left white. Since we have an optimal configuration, this cell cannot be colored black. This means that by coloring (i, 1), we would block the cell (i, 2). In other words, we know that the cells (i, 2),(i, 3) and (i+1,2) are all colored black in this optimal configuration. However, we now see that we can color (i, 1) instead of (i, 2), keeping the same number of black cells and coloring (i, 1), without disturbing any of the other cells.We can apply the same reasoning to any of the cells (1,1)-(8,1),(8,1)-(8,8) and, similarly, to (8,8)-(1,8), thus showing that there is an optimal configuration in which all the cells along the E, S, W borders are colored black.Those cells being colored, we are left with a 7 times 6 area of the board. We can now show that no more than 28 cells in this area can be colored black. In order to obtain 28 , the average number of black cells per row has to be 4 . However, if any row contains six black cells, the next row down cannot contain any black cells, since such a black cell would block the cell immediately north of it. Similarly, if a row were to contain 5 black cells, the next row down would be able to contain at most 3 black cells (namely in the cell immediately below the single white one and the two next to it). This shows that the average number of black cells per row in our 7 times 6 area cannot be greater than 4 .![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_05_ef0be42837b45243f854g-23.jpg?height=374&width=375&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=652)(a)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_05_ef0be42837b45243f854g-23.jpg?height=369&width=388&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=1025)(b)Figure 1: Alternative SolutionThis gives us an upper bound on the total number of black cells: the 22 border cells plus 28 cells in the remaining 7 times 6 area, i.e., 50 cells in total.An example to show that 50 can indeed be achieved is the following.

However, if we substitute a = -1 into the third term of the set, we have a^2 + 3a + 3 = 1, which implies both the second and third terms would equal to 1, violating the uniqueness of elements in set A. Therefore, this case is not possible.- Case 2: (a+1)^2 = 1    Solving this equation gives us two solutions: a = 0 and a = -2.    - Subcase 2.1: If a = 0, then set A = {2, 1, 3}, which satisfies the condition that 1 in A without any violation of element uniqueness.    - Subcase 2.2: If a = -2, once again, we encounter a violation of uniqueness as (a+1)^2 = a^2 + 3a + 3 = 1.- Case 3: a^2 + 3a + 3 = 1    Solving this equation gives us two solutions: a = -1 and a = -2.

However, if the body produces too much uric acid that cannot be excreted in time or if the uric acid excretion mechanism degrades, excessive uric acid will accumulate in the body. When the blood uric acid concentration is greater than 7mg/dL, the body fluids become acidic. Prolonged acidity can lead to gout. Low-purine foods have a good therapeutic effect on increasing the relief rate of gout patients and reducing blood uric acid concentration. During the research on a certain type of low-purine food, researchers found that under specific conditions such as daily timing and quantity, the change in blood uric acid concentration U(t) (unit: mg/dL) with the number of days t of intake of low-purine food can be described by the logarithmic model U(t)=-U_{0}ln Kt, where U_{0} is the initial blood uric acid concentration and K is a parameter. Given U_{0}=20, after consuming low-purine food for 50 days as required, the blood uric acid concentration was measured to be 15. To bring the blood uric acid concentration to a normal level, the number of days of intake of low-purine food needs to be increased to at least ({e^{frac{2}{5}}}≈1.49).A: 69B: 71C: 73D: 75","solution":"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the given logarithmic model for the change in blood uric acid concentration, U(t)=-U_{0}ln Kt, where U_{0}=20 is the initial blood uric acid concentration, and K is a parameter. We are given that after consuming low-purine food for 50 days, the blood uric acid concentration is 15mg/dL. First, we substitute the given values into the model when t=50 and U(t)=15:[15 = -20ln(50K).]This equation can be expanded using logarithmic properties:[15 = -20ln 50 - 20ln K. quad text{(1)}]Next, we need to find the number of days, t', required to reduce the blood uric acid concentration to 7mg/dL.

Choose a specific polynomial:   Consider the polynomial ( P(x) = Cx(x-1) ) where ( C geq 4a ) and ( C+2 > 2sqrt{1 + frac{4a}{C}} ). This choice ensures that the polynomial has the desired properties.3. Base case for induction:   For ( n = 1 ), the equation ( P_1(x) = t ) becomes:   [   Cx(x-1) = t   ]   The discriminant of this quadratic equation is:   [   Delta = 1 + frac{4t}{C} = frac{C + 4t}{C}   ]   Since ( C geq 4a ) and ( t in (-a, a) ), we have ( C + 4t > 0 ). Therefore, the equation has two distinct real roots:   [   x_1 = frac{1 - sqrt{1 + frac{4t}{C}}}{2}, quad x_2 = frac{1 + sqrt{1 + frac{4t}{C}}}{2}   ]4. Inductive step:   Assume that for ( P_n(x) = t ), the equation has ( 2^n ) distinct real roots. We need to show that ( P_{n+1}(x) = t ) has ( 2^{n+1} ) distinct real roots.5. Define the sequence ( (u_n) ):   Let ( u_0 = t ) and for each ( 1 leq i leq n-1 ), let ( u_i ) denote the greatest root among the ( 2^{i-1} ) roots of the equation ( P_i(x) = t ). It is trivial that ( u_n > 0 ) for all ( n > 1 ).6. Roots of the equation ( Cx(x-1) = k ):   For some real number ( k > -frac{C}{4} ), the equation ( Cx(x-1) = k ) has two solutions:   [   x = frac{1 + sqrt{1 + frac{4k}{C}}}{2}, quad x = frac{1 - sqrt{1 + frac{4k}{C}}}{2}   ]   When ( k ) increases, the larger root increases and the smaller root decreases.7. Sequence ( (u_n) ) properties:   [   u_{n+1} = frac{1 + sqrt{1 + frac{4u_n}{C}}}{2}   ]   Since ( t < a ) and ( C > 4a ), it follows that:   [   u_1 = frac{1 + sqrt{1 + frac{4t}{C}}}{2} < frac{1 + sqrt{1 + frac{4a}{4a}}}{2} < a   ]   By induction, ( u_n < a ) for all positive integers ( n ).8. Equation ( Cx(x-1) = u_{n-1} ):   The equation has two roots:   [   x_1 = frac{1 + sqrt{1 + frac{4u_{n-1}}{C}}}{2}, quad x_2 = frac{1 - sqrt{1 + frac{4u_{n-1}}{C}}}{2}   ]   Since ( u_{n-1} ) is the largest root among the ( 2^{n-1} ) roots, ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ) are the largest and smallest roots among the ( 2^n ) roots of ( P_n(x) = t ).9.

Therefore, for each of the ( 2^n ) roots ( y ) of ( P_n(x) = t ), the equation ( Cx(x-1) = y ) has two distinct roots, giving a total of ( 2 cdot 2^n = 2^{n+1} ) roots.10.

The formula for the axis of symmetry is x = -frac{b}{2a}, where b is the coefficient of x. In our case, b = -2a, so we have:[x = -frac{-2a}{2a} = 1]This means the axis of symmetry is the vertical line x=1.Now, let's analyze the options given:For option C, we are given two points: (-1,1) and (-5,5).

Since the point (-5,5) is further from the axis of symmetry than (-1,1) and is located on the left side of the axis, and given that the parabola passes through both points, it implies that the parabola opens upwards. This is because for the parabola to include both points and have its axis of symmetry at x=1, it must extend upwards from the vertex, which is located to the left of both points.An upward-opening parabola indicates that the coefficient a in the quadratic function y=ax^{2}-2ax+c is positive.Thus, based on the analysis, option C is correct, as it states that if the graph passes through (-1,1) and (-5,5), then a > 0.Therefore, the correct answer is encapsulated as boxed{C}."},{"problem":"Example 1 Solve the system of congruences left{begin{array}{l}x equiv 1(bmod 7),  x equiv 1(bmod 8),  x equiv 3(bmod 9) .end{array}right.","solution":"Since 7, 8, 9 are pairwise coprime, the system of congruences has a solution.begin{array}{l}M=7 cdot 8 cdot 9=504, M_{1}=frac{504}{7}=72, M_{2}=frac{504}{8}=63, M_{3}=frac{504}{9}=56 . text { Thus } M_{1}^{prime} equiv frac{1}{72} equiv frac{1}{7 cdot 10+2} equiv frac{1}{2} equiv frac{4}{8} equiv frac{4}{7+1} equiv 4(bmod 7), M_{2}^{prime} equiv frac{1}{63} equiv frac{1}{64-1} equiv frac{1}{-1} equiv-1 equiv 7(bmod 8), M_{3}^{prime} equiv frac{1}{56} equiv frac{1}{6 cdot 9+2} equiv frac{1}{2} equiv frac{5}{10} equiv frac{5}{9+1} equiv 5(bmod 9) .end{array}Therefore, x equiv 4 cdot 72 cdot 1+7 cdot 63 cdot 1+5 cdot 56 cdot 3 equiv 57(bmod 504) is the solution."},{"problem":"4.

Let ( p ) be the smallest prime divisor of ( n ). From the given equation, since ( d_2 mid n ), ( d_3 mid n ), and ( d_5 mid n ), it follows that ( d_2 mid d_3d_5 ), ( d_3 mid d_2d_5 ), and ( d_5 mid d_2d_3 ). In particular, ( d_2 = p mid d_3d_5 ).2. Case 1: ( p mid d_3 ). Notice that ( d_3 = pq ) for ( q neq p ) and ( q ) prime immediately yields a contradiction. So, ( d_3 = p^2 ). Moreover, we have that ( d_5 mid d_2d_3 = p^3 ), so ( d_5 = p^3 ). Thus, ( n = d_2d_3 + d_3d_5 + d_5d_2 = p^3(p^2 + p + 1) ).3. Now since for any prime ( p ) the inequality ( p^2 < p^2 + p + 1 < p^3 ) clearly holds and ( p^2 + p + 1 mid n ), ( d_4 ) must be ( p^2 + p + 1 ).4. We have found two divisors ( d_4 ) and ( d_5 ) such that ( d_4d_5 = n ). From here, the list of divisors of ( n ) (in ascending order) is:   [   1, p, p^2, p^2 + p + 1, p^3, p(p^2 + p + 1), p^2(p^2 + p + 1), p^3(p^2 + p + 1)   ]   It can be readily seen that ( p^2 + p + 1 ) must be prime and ( n = p^3(p^2 + p + 1) ) with ( p ) and ( p^2 + p + 1 ) prime satisfies the conditions.5. Case 2: ( p mid d_5 ). Observe that we get a contradiction if ( d_5 ) and ( d_2 ) differ by at least three prime factors. If they differ by two prime factors, we again get a contradiction (just check manually the possible subcases). Since ( p mid d_5 ), ( d_5 = p^2 ) or ( d_5 = pq ) for some prime ( q neq p ). If ( d_5 = p^2 ), ( d_3 mid d_5d_2 = p^3 ), so ( d_3 = p ) or ( d_3 = p^2 ), contradiction. Therefore, ( d_5 = pq ) for a prime ( q neq p ). Now, ( d_3 mid d_5d_2 = p^2q ) and ( d_5 = pq mid pd_3 = d_2d_3 ), ( q mid d_3 ) and ( d_3 = q ). Then, ( n = d_2d_3 + d_2d_5 + d_3d_5 = pq(p + q + 1) ), so ( d_4 = p + q + 1 ) unless ( (p, q) ) is ( (2, 3) ). Note, however, that for ( (p, q) = (2, 3) ), ( n = 36 ) satisfies the condition. For all other prime pairs ( (p, q) ), ( p + q + 1 < pq ). Therefore, as we did in Case 1, there are exactly eight divisors of ( n ) so ( p + q + 1 ) must be prime. Hence, similar to the above case, ( n = pq(p + q + 1) ) with ( p ), ( q ), and ( p + q + 1 ) prime satisfies the conditions.6. In conclusion, all numbers satisfying our condition are ( n = 36 ), ( n = p^3(p^2 + p + 1) ) ( ( p ) and ( p^2 + p + 1 ) are prime) and ( n = pq(p + q + 1) ) ( ( p ), ( q ), and ( p + q + 1 ) are prime).

Set Up the Equation:   The original number can be represented as 10(9-x) + x (since the tens digit contributes ten times its value and the units digit contributes its value). When the digits are swapped, the new number is 10x + (9-x). According to the problem, the new number is 9 less than the original number.

Combining the Inequalities for a:   From 2a-5leqslant 4, we derive:   [   aleqslant dfrac{9}{2}.   ]   This step combines the established inequalities to refine the range for a.6. Determining the Range of a:   Given the above steps, we know aleqslant 5 and aleqslant dfrac{9}{2}, which means the range of values for a that satisfy the given conditions is:   [   boxed{left(-infty ,dfrac{9}{2}right]}.   ]   This step-by-step breakdown adheres closely to the original solution provided, ensuring a thorough understanding of how the solution was derived, culminating in the encapsulated final answer."},{"problem":"6.

Therefore, the heights of the team members in group B are more uniform.","solution":"Let's analyze each statement step by step:- Statement A: \\"It rains a lot during the Qingming Festival\\" is described as a certain event. However, weather events are inherently unpredictable and subject to variability, making them random rather than certain. Therefore, statement A is incorrect because it misclassifies a random event as a certain one.- Statement B: To understand the service life of a batch of light tubes, the suggestion is to conduct a census survey. A census survey implies examining every single unit in the population, which is impractical and unnecessary for understanding the service life of products. Instead, a sampling survey, which involves examining a subset of the population, is more appropriate and efficient for this purpose. Thus, statement B is incorrect because it recommends an impractical approach for the given objective.- Statement C: We are given a set of data 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7. To verify the claim in statement C, we need to calculate the mode, median, and mean of this data set.  - The mode is the most frequently occurring value in the set, which is 5.  - The median is the middle value when the data set is ordered, which for this set is the average of the third and fourth values (since there are an even number of data points), also resulting in 5.  - The mean is calculated as the sum of all values divided by the number of values, which is frac{1}{6}(2 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) = frac{29}{6} neq 5. Therefore, the claim that the mode, median, and mean are all 5 is incorrect because the mean is actually frac{29}{6}.- Statement D: The variances of the heights of the team members in groups A and B are given as S_{A}^{2}=0.02 and S_{B}^{2}=0.01 respectively. Variance is a measure of dispersion, indicating how spread out the data points are from the mean. A smaller variance indicates that the data points are closer to the mean, implying more uniformity. Since S_{A}^{2} > S_{B}^{2}, it means that the heights of team members in group B are more uniformly distributed than those in group A. Therefore, statement D is correct as it accurately interprets the relationship between variance and uniformity of data distribution.Given the analysis above, the correct statement is:boxed{text{D}}"},{"problem":"2.1.

This is the reasoning by recurrence.It should be noted that both parts of the proof are important, even if the first is often quite obvious. One must not forget to initialize the recurrence, that is, to prove that the property is true for n=0. One can start the recurrence at a value other than 0, for example, at 1, 2, cdots or K; it will then be necessary to prove (initialization) that the property is true for n=K, and then (induction) that for n geqslant K, if it is true for n, it is still true for n+1.It should also be noted that induction has some variants. For example, it sometimes happens that one has to prove that if the property is true for all integers k leqslant n, then it is true for n+1."},{"problem":"Let n= int_{ 0 }^{ frac {pi}{2} }6sin xdx, then the coefficient of the x^2 term in the expansion of (x- frac {2}{x})^{n} is _____.","solution":"First, calculate the value of n: n= int_{ 0 }^{ frac {pi}{2} }6sin xdx=-6cos x bigg|_{ 0 }^{ frac {pi}{2} }=-6cos frac {pi}{2} +6cos 0=6.For the term T_{r+1} in the expansion, we have: T_{r+1}= C_{ 6 }^{ r }x^{6-r}(-2)^{r}x^{-r}=(-2)^{r} C_{ 6 }^{ r }x^{6-2r},  when 6-2r=2, then r=2.Thus, T_{3}=(-2)^{2} C_{ 6 }^{ 2 }x^{2}=60x^{2},  Therefore, the answer is: boxed{60}.First, use the rules of definite integration to find the value of n, then study the general term formula of the expansion of (x- frac {2}{x})^{n}, making the exponent of x equal to 2, to find the term of x^2, and obtain the desired result.This problem mainly examines the application of definite integration and the binomial theorem, as well as the ability to perform calculations, and is considered a medium-level question."},{"problem":"12.

Let's analyze each statement to see if it can be true:   - If ( W_1 ) is telling the truth (i.e., exactly one witness is a liar), then the other three witnesses must be telling the truth.

Proof: Given n cdot a_{n+1} = 2(n+1) cdot a_n + n(n+1), we can deduce that   frac{a_{n+1}}{n+1} = frac{2a_n}{n} + 1.
