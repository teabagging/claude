I masturbate with a fabric usually so thinking this might have irritated it in small scales. I used Neosporin on it and it healed. I just heard people can get herpes with mild symptoms or be asymptomatic. The itchiness at first is what worried me. No blisters or lesions just white scaly flat skin. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Scaly itchy rash in your pubic area is fungal infection exacerbated by irritation due to fabric. You have to be gentle with yourself and use ample lubrication like oil and it should not be irritating. As it is going on since 1 year as I can make out from the history you have given and it responded to Neosporin, there may be a secondary bacterial infection. As you worry about herpes, herpes simplex do cause lesions in genital area but lesions are different. They occur recurrently like every month or every two or three months in susceptible individuals. The lesions in you are not suggestive of herpes simplex. They are like blisters. Even if you may be infected with herpes simplex if you do not have lesions, you need not worry you will never have. You are actually immune to herpes but still can transmit to others. For the present lesion, I advise you not to irritate the area, do not use infective things over the area and keep it clean and dry. Do not use any harsh soaps or solutions which may irritate. For fungal infection I advise you tablet Terbinafine 250 mg BD for two weeks with meals. For itching, tablet Loratadine 10 mg OD for 10 days or when itches, Terbinafine cream twice daily for two weeks, Mometasone cream once daily for five days, Mupirocin ointment twice daily for five days. Review after 2 weeks. Fungus. Koh scrapping. Herpes genitalis. Tinea cruris. Antifungal and general measures. Avoid irritants. Use moisturizers, be gentle."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 20 weeks into my pregnancy. I am not sure if what I am feeling is Braxton Hicks contractions or an early sign of labor.","Doctor":"Hi. The Braxton Hicks contractions are mild in intensity and vague in frequency. These contractions hardly cause much discomfort to the pregnant woman.  The labor contractions are dull in nature, to begin with, and go on increasing in intensity. Labor contractions are often associated with a bleeding or discharge from the vagina. This requires attention."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My penis foreskin does not open softly. If I try opening, I feel pain. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. You are suffering from paraphimosis.

After taking medications, my condition got better. So I stopped taking medicines, and I took Pantop-D (Pantoprazole) only for the gas relief. Before a month, I developed a fungal infection in my groin area, and the doctor prescribed me Itraconazole 200 mg. When I started taking medicine, my stools became hard, and I developed constipation. But I have not stopped taking it. Before five days, my problem got worse, and I stopped taking Itraconazole. Now, I have diarrhea with blood in the stool. There is bloating (gas) in the abdomen. Sometimes I have pain on the left side of the lower abdomen. I have a feeling of nausea. I am currently taking Pantop-D (Pantoprazole), Metrogyl (Metronidazole) 400 mg (started taking today only) and high fiber diet. I have a few questions. Does blood in the stool occur due to diverticulitis? Does taking Pantoprazole show any side effects on diverticulitis? Can I take ORS or electoral for rehydration? Please suggest your advice.","Doctor":"Hi. There are two causes for the blood in the stool. The reason can be due to infection and reactivation of inflammatory bowel disease. In such condition, we should treat the infection first. The common infection seen is bacterial, sometimes viral infection may also occur like CMV (cytomegalovirus). It is diagnosed by colonoscopy guided with biopsy examination. If there is no infection, then we have to take a biopsy for IBD activity, and we can increase the immune suppression. I think you are not taking immune suppression medications. Uncontrolled IBD has a poor prognosis, and the risk of complications is very high. I will suggest a course of IV antibiotics in the form of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole. You can take ORS (oral rehydration solution) for rehydration. You can take Pantoprazole. Diarrhea occurs due to infection or due to worsening of IBD. So it needs treatment. You need endoscopy for evaluation. You need to do CBC (complete blood count), LFT (liver function tests), CRP (C-reactive protein), fecal calprotectin. You need to do stool routine and culture examination."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My partner is wearing spectacles. She is going to undergo lasik surgery next week. She suffers from thyroid. Is it comfortable for her to go for lasik surgery for eyes? Will the eyes get swelled after lasik surgery? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Your partner has thyroid disease and has opted for lasik surgery. Usually, the healing and remodeling time for the cornea is three months at maximum. So she can recover soon. Just like other surgical procedures, lasik also have a few shortcomings. I will try to explain it. Thyroid disease, in severe cases, can cause dry eyes. The severity of the problem can vary depending on the pre-operative status of the patient, and most patients require lubricant eyedrops for long periods. It is a normal phenomenon that the power of the eyes can change in women during pregnancy and lactation. So the surgery has a transient action only, and she may need to go back to glasses after childbirth. There is a possibility, and it is not seen in all women. Lasik is currently viewed as an outdated procedure due to flap-related complications. The latest method which has safe and repeatable results is the relex smile. In case, if you have the option to do smile, you can do it. Or in case you do not want to change them at the last minute, go ahead with lasik as it has a good track record for a longer duration than a smile."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

Please provide me some home remedies or methods to cure these problems.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Inadequate water intake can sometimes lead to the occurrence of bumps over the skin and dark circles. I recommend that you increase your fluid intake to at least two liters daily. Sometimes, Vitamin A deficiency can cause similar symptoms. This can be replenished by eating food rich in Vitamin A like carrots, red peppers, spinach, mango, muskmelon, watermelon, papaya, and guava. If you are a non-vegetarian, eggs, lamb liver, salmon and tuna are good sources.  Stress and lack of sleep can also lead to dark circles. So try meditation and regulate the sleep cycle. Sleep and wake up at the same time daily. If there is no change after one month, meet a doctor personally for a clinical examination."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My husband dislocated his ACL. I would like to get his X-rays evaluated for a second opinion. He was diagnosed with grade III dislocation. Is surgery necessary based on the X-rays attached? What are the risks if he does not operate? How does non-operative treatment compare? How long does he have to make a decision on surgery based on the X-rays? The doctors mentioned that if he does surgery, he would need to have two procedures. Could you advise what are the names of the procedures to repair his shoulder? It was also noted that there is haziness in the lower lung. Is immediate treatment needed for this? How severe is this?","Doctor":"Hi. This is clearly acromioclavicular joint injury (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There are two ligaments which basically keep our ACL joint in position. In type 3 injuries, both ligaments are torn. Now, according to literature, treatment of type 1,2 injuries is non-operative and type 4,5,6 is operative. But the treatment of type 3 is controversial. It is basically surgeons choice. I usually try for six weeks conservative and if my conservative treatment fails then I go for operative. Operative treatment depends on the time of injury. If it is acute, then we can apply a hook plate. In old injuries, we can do mini-open endobutton fixation. I am sorry, I cannot guide you for the type of surgery because you have not mentioned the day of injury. Nothing is to be done for chest if it is not symptomatic. I think it is just an incidental finding."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a habit of overthinking simple things, and I make them complicated.

The train of our thoughts goes running continuously, and sometimes it reaches a destination which is so different than the actual goal. You are the driver, but your mind guides you to go. But sometimes guide starts to give wrong guidance even though the driver knows the route or he crosses the reached destination. Then, the guide will provide an emergency brake to the driver for achieving the actual goal. So whenever you think unnecessarily, give a message to your mind that you are giving me a wrong note. Say your brain to stop thinking about it and decide what you want. Try to know what is right and what is wrong.

You have discharge from the left eye. This is a severe problem, and it occurs due to an infection. You can have one of these two things. They can occur due to viral or bacterial conjunctivitis.

Another reason is a corneal ulcer which shows symptoms of eyelids sticking together, more pain and the patient may also experience a sharp pricking pain whenever they blink. There can also be a more severe blurred vision, like seeing through a fog. My advice is clean the discharge away from your eye as soon as you wake up in the morning with warm water. Keep your hands always clean and nails short. Do not rub your eye. This will worsen your condition. Use Refresh tears (Carboxymethylcellulose 0.5 %) eye drops four times a day for two weeks in both the eyes. Use Tobrex (Tobramycin 0.3 %) eye drops for a week. Both these medicines are quite safe to use (unless you have an allergy to either of them previously). Do not apply them over contact lenses. Stop using your contact lens.

You can boost your height by indulging in physical activities like skipping and playing games like basketball. The usual growing period for males is between the age of 13 to 18 years.

T is the tumor size which is less than 2 cm, which is T1. N is the lymph node. N0 means there is no involvement of lymph nodes. M is the metastasis. Mx means it is not yet known. For which she needs to undergo a bone scan and USG (ultrasonography) of the abdomen. NPI (Nottingham prognostic index) is a prognostic score for a long-term outcome. With a score of 3.04, she has 85 to 90 % survival for five years. DCIS is ductal carcinoma in situ which means that the cancer is still limited to the lining of breast glands. But there are foci of invasion which indicate that it has invaded some places of the breast tissue also. There are no lymph nodes involved which mean that there is no need for surgery in the axilla.

CBC seems to be good except for a mild decrease in platelet count. You need to do a dengue serology again but as of now there is nothing to worry about. Please let me know since when you are having the fever."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am an 18-year-old female. I recently had sex that was a bit more rough than normal. Everything seems fine, I have not had cramping, and my IUD seems to still be in place, and the strings are still fine. The IUD is not poking out of my cervix, and, again, it does not hurt or cramp. Though, I have noticed that I have been experiencing urinary urgency for the past week (intercourse happened about a week ago). I have not experienced any burning sensation when I urinate, at all. It is just that I have to urinate more often than normal, and it is much harder to hold it than before. Will this subside, or should I see my gynecologist soon?","Doctor":"Hi. I feel that you are experiencing an early stage of urinary infection. When you have sex, some penile secretions and semen may enter the bladder. It is a good practice to pass urine after sex. This may not need medication. Have lots of water, milk, juice, barley water or cranberry juice. Keep drinking water every now and then even when not thirsty. Keep passing urine even before you have sensation. This will wash out the infection. If you feel that infection is not getting relieved have antibiotics like tablet Norfloxacin 400 mg twice a day for five days."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Can you tell me why I get dizzy or disorientated when my brain expects something to happen but it does not happen? For example, if I try to click somewhere on my computer but my computer freezes before I notice so the click does nothing, it will disorientate me and make me dizzy. It will jolt my vision and make my head pound for a couple of minutes. It happens quite often, usually when I am not fully paying attention. I am 26 and male. I have had this problem for as long as I can remember. Currently, I am taking Thyroxine for Hashimoto's disease.","Doctor":"Hi. Do you have a headache associated with it? Do you have nausea, vomiting? Have you ever lost consciousness? Have you ever had any visual problems? If the answers to these questions are negative then, what you are describing is not a neurological problem in a strict sense. It is probably a mental issue. If you have any associated anxiety, mood disturbances, fearfulness, please talk to a psychiatrist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had an eye infection for over a week. It started in my left eye. Some days seem better than others. Have had constant draining and has spread to both eyes (initial eye worse than the second). I am on Polymyxin B that was prescribed after the first prescription but did not work. It is really frustrating. Is this length of symptoms without improvement a cause for concern or should I be patient with it? When can I expect improvement?","Doctor":"Hello. Please do not worry. Infections take time to resolve."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, The patient had three tympanoplasty surgeries in the past, the most recent being a decade ago. She has 10 % hearing in one ear where surgery was performed. Recently, the patient developed an ear infection. Black and white fungus detected in the air. ENT used a micro-suction device to remove the fungus which was successful, but the suction device caused some bleeding in the ear. ENT prescribed Tobrex for the ear. This caused the patient extreme pain and was discontinued after three days. The ear canal became very inflamed. A yellow discharge started coming out of the ear. The new doctor prescribed Levofloxacin antibiotics, Prednisolone, and Naproxen for pain relief. The patient still continues to suffer from extreme pain in the ear.","Doctor":"Hello. I need some details. Are the CT scan films those are attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity) taken after the development of the latest problem or are those taken during the tympanometry surgery in the perioperative period? Do you have the details of the surgery? Is it just a tympanoplasty or does it include mastoidectomy as well? Can you attach the hearing reports taken most recently? What medicines is the patient currently on? Is the course of Levofloxacin complete and does the patient feel any improvement? What are the complaints faced by the patient? Is the patient a diabetic and what is the age? Any medical condition for which the patient takes any medicines regularly?

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Are they cause for concern?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your question and picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I can understand your concern. No, there is nothing to be worried, it is a normal junction between the tongue and floor of the mouth. In your case, it seems it is a little bit hyperkeratinized may be because of some stress. With age, this line gets some pigmentation and becomes appreciable but there is nothing to worry. Please answer the following: If you are a smoker or taking any other sort of tobacco? Also, if there is any hard swelling below your chin or jaw? Take multivitamins once daily for a month."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 21 year old male. This is the fourth time I am changing my spectacles. But this time, the spectacles are hurting my ears and my right eye. And I also have a headache. What do I do?","Doctor":"Hello. From the history, it seems that you are having a refractive error with frequent change of spectacles. The probable cause for your headache is the change in the refractive error. I advise you to undergo refraction testing and change your spectacles according to the refractive power required. Since you are have been frequently changing your spectacles you need to go for retinoscopy under cycloplegia by using dilating eye drops."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 56 year old male. I have been diagnosed with gingivitis and taking medicines like Metrogyl, Amoxyllin, and Relaxon since two days. But, it is very painful today. What do I do?","Doctor":"Hi. Gingivitis is a condition in which the gums are inflamed, reddish and have the tendency to bleed while brushing. When the gum disease is severe it causes pain. From the details you have given, it is clear that you are already under antibiotics and painkiller regimen. It usually takes about five days for the symptoms to subside gradually. The pain comes down as the inflammation subsides. Pain relief will be complete only after a dental procedure called the scaling (cleaning) which is done by the dentist after the inflammation subsides. I suggest you use Chlorhexidine mouthwash twice daily. Also, apply Rexidin M gel (a combination of Chlorhexidine, Lidocaine, and Metronidazole) on the gums twice daily. If the pain is unbearable, apply Mucopain gel (Benzocaine) on the gums. This is a topical anesthetic gel that temporarily relieves the pain. But, this should not be used regularly. Do warm salt water gargling after every meal. In case you are a diabetic patient, control of blood sugar levels is very important for the healing of gingivitis. If the pain persists even after a week after scaling, then there might be chances of bone loss, abscesses or periodontitis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am facing ear pain since yesterday. My right ear alone is paining. When I tried cleaning with a earbud, the bud came out with a black colored deposit. What do I do?","Doctor":"Hi. After considering the facts of your query, it appears like you are suffering from either of these. Treatment is different in both the above situations. I suggest taking Paracetamol 500 mg for pain relief. The above conditions have to be confirmed to start with the treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a miscarriage at 12 weeks. It has been two months now. Can I plan for the next baby and conceive now?","Doctor":"Hi. It is better if you conceive after two more months. Give a gap of four to five months after the miscarriage. The uterus will return back to its original contour in this time period. Until then, I suggest you practice contraception."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a problem with speaking. I cannot speak fluently without practicing it in my mind. Many a times I use wrong words accidentally, even though I meant to say some other word. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. These problems suggest a condition called aphasia. It happens due to some problems in a particular part of the brain.  Infections in the brain, salt imbalances, liver failure etc., also cause this disorder. I need a detailed history of your problems like the duration of the problem, examples for wrong words used, any associated visual problems, any problems with swallowing and any weakness in hands or legs. I advise you to get these tests done: You may also require an MRI scan, but we will decide that after seeing these reports."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 30 years old and my cholesterol report is showing as LDL 180 mg/dL. My friend says avocado helps in improving HDL and it does not increase LDL, as it has monounsaturated fat. I am confused. Is avocado good for cholesterol?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to icliniq. First, let me tell you some basics of cholesterol. HDL (high-density lipoprotein) is a good cholesterol. The higher the HDL, better the health. Whereas LDL  (low-density lipoprotein) is a bad cholesterol. The lower the LDL, better the health. Avocado, though a high-fat food, reduces LDL and raises HDL. So, it is good for health.  Since your LDL is very high, I would advise you to start medications after consulting a specialist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from yellowish urine from the last three months.

I have also done USG, total bilirubin, LFT, KFT, etc. There is no issue of jaundice but my bilirubin count is high. There is a digestion problem too.","Doctor":"Hi. This is mild unconjugated jaundice. The causes are hemolytic anemia, Gilbert syndrome. There is no harm of these disorders, the liver is fine, no need to take any medication. We just need to confirm the diagnosis. For that, we need to do investigations, a little bit costly but mandatory to be sure about the diagnosis. UGT1A1 mutation (TATA repeat) for Gilbert syndrome. Peripheral smear examination to look for the evidence of hemolytic anemia. Later on, we may need to do HB electrophoresis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I really do not know why I am depressed all the time, I feel sad, angry and anxious.

But after two days, I started to feel depressed, stressed out and angry about small things, I feel sad all the time. I am not under any kind of medication and I never took medication before.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your query carefully and here is my advice. These are temporary adjustment reactions because of recent major events in life. You need to take some break from everything, spend time with family and friends and plan a small trip to cope up this stress. I am sure you will be okay in a week. If still, you feel it is not working, you can contact me again. Life is beautiful, and you did not do any mistake. So keep patience, think positively and stay happy.

My face feels puffy and the pain is throbbing.","Doctor":"Hi. After going through your chief complaint, it seems a case of acute pulpitis due to a carious tooth. Initially,sensitivity was due to the weakening of enamel and dentin and with time it started pinching pulp. Acute pulpitis is characterized by throbbing pain, pain on eating, night pain, and it can radiate to jaws, head, neck, and shoulders.  You are advised to take up following medications.

The enlarged gut will cause swollen stomach and push diaphragm upside and causing breathlessness and restlessness.

Sometimes we relate such symptoms with psychiatric conditions but there are many medical causes that should be ruled out. First are vitamin B12 and D deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency increases the risk of anxiety and obsessive thoughts. This also results in poor focus and problems in sustaining focus.

Bleeding through stool is a serious concern and must be evaluated in detail and treated early. Endoscopy reports (upper and lower GI) show no significant active bleeding in the areas visualized (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Keeping the above in mind, I would recommend an abdomen and pelvis plain and contrast CT scan with CT angiography study. The endoscopy done shows us that there is no bleeding point in the visualized portion of the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and colon. We are unable to evaluate the extra luminal portion of the bowel and if there is any abnormality. The capsule endoscopy can be done later depending on the findings of CT angiography and CT scan contrast of the abdomen."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Due to the use of Skinlite, I have sunburn on my face and now it looks like the dark spot. But I am using Kojivit gel for a dark spot. Is Kojivit gel good for the dark spot?","Doctor":"Hello. You must use a broad spectrum sunscreen throughout the day. Reapply every 2 to 3 hours. Sun protection is important to treat facial pigmentation. At night you may use a Kojic acid cream rather than Skinlite (Hydroquinone, Mometasone, etc). This cream should never be used without the supervision of a dermatologist as it can cause irritation, redness and other side effects like acne. Use it only if your dermatologist says after looking at the skin condition. I would request you to upload a picture so that I can assess the condition visually and therefore guide you better."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My fiancee ate I-pill tablet because, after sexual relation, I touched and wiped off sperm and touched inside the cervix. So, we have doubt that she might get pregnant after touching inside. Please tell what will happen to her after taking the pill.","Doctor":"Hi. If her periods are regular and expecting it in a few days, she will not get pregnant as ovulation is over. But her periods should be regular.

However, both are under normal range since I am taking Thyronorm 112 mg in the morning and Rozat 10 after dinner in the night as advised by the doctor.

I have 68 kg weight and 5 feet 9 inches height. I am a vegetarian and eat fruits and vegetables daily.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your problem and understand your concern. The deranged thyroid and lipid (attachment removed to protect patient identity) itself can cause a problem with erection, as you stated that both these conditions are well controlled, then there is need to get evaluated to find the cause of poor erection. Drugs like Sildenafil or Tadalafil are used to manage erectile dysfunction. The starting dose of Sildenafil is 50 mg. Meanwhile, do regular exercise, take healthy food, avoid any substance (alcohol, smoking, etc.) abuse.  Regular exercise, good food, avoid substance abuse."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am 59 years old. I had a hysterectomy before 20 years. Now, I am having difficulty losing weight. I am afraid of following the strict diet as I suffer from osteoporosis. I do not take medicine but take calcium, vitamin D and magnesium supplement. I am eating clean but not able to lose weight.I did a thyroid test and it is good according to the range. I have also performed a hormone test but the result is very strange maybe you can help me to understand from what I am deficient. Here are my result, E2 66.4 pg/ml, progesterone 0.81 ng/ml and total testosterone 0.25 ng/ml. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. Once you cross 50 years, your body is into menopause. So, even the remaining ovarian female hormones start falling. When you have a hysterectomy, they remove the uterus and blood flow to ovaries also reduced, so ovary which was supposed to work till the 50s may stop at 45 or so. By this time you start putting on weight, and your calcium level starts lowering, as you have lost the protection of estrogen hormone from ovaries. Once lost calcium cannot be regained. Now let us get to what we can do. Active aging is advised. It means to try to be as busy as possible. At least walk for 30-45 minutes per day, if possible longer. Never stop any work which you have usually been doing. You may not be able to restart again. Try to keep your mind and body busy with whatever you like, such as painting, singing, playing, etc. There are certain yogas for elderly and those with osteoarthritis. Never overdo. Try to increase gradually. Before and after the exercise have some heat at the joints of pain like a heating pad or dip in the warm water with two handfuls of salt in it. This will relax the joints, and you can move better. Now about diet, have a well-balanced diet. Avoid junk food, red meat, sweets as far as possible. Have plenty of fruits and vegetables, oats, corn flakes and milk daily after removing the cream. Having anything which is raw is safe. Avoid fried items, chocolates, and snacks between meals. Never do fasting. This will only make you weaker and lose the necessary nutrients. Never try to lose weight with medicines. These medicines also deprive you of many vitamins and proteins and lower your immunity, cause hair fall and unhealthy skin. Do not unnecessarily spoil your head with the hormone tests. You are fine. If you had started weight reduction at a younger age, you could have just maintained it. It is not late; you can still do it. Just tell yourself that you are healthy and just improve health the way I have mentioned. Keep having calcium medications; they will not allow a further fall in calcium. All the best."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 20-year-old female. Yesterday I had my ovulation day. I had unprotected sex with my partner. But we had not done a penetration.

You are at risk of getting pregnant. You need emergency contraception within 72 hours of intercourse to avoid unplanned pregnancy. The most common side effects of I-pill are a headache, nausea, and bloating which can be prevented by increasing the intake of water. You will get a withdrawal bleed within five to seven days after the consumption of I-pill. It indicates the absence of pregnancy."},{"Patient":"My head hurts, but only on the right side--specifically around the area of my temple. Sometimes, the headache spreads to my right eye. The pain in itself is tolerable but every time I lay down to sleep, it becomes more painful. Next to that, my stomach also hurts since the other day. I feel nauseous too. Earlier this morning, I experienced a weird thing. At breakfast, I was feeling nauseous. And then suddenly, my eyesight was blocked by this wall of black and white dots. My ears were ringing. I closed my eyes, thinking it was just an illusion, but when I opened my eyes the wall of black and white dots was still there. I felt really weird all over my body too. There was this tingling feeling on my limbs and when the wall of black and white dots finally cleared up a bit, I looked down and I was surprised when I felt the wetness between my legs. I urinated. I didn't even felt it until I saw the puddle below my feet. I felt like I blacked out. My blood pressure is 90/70. Temperature is 36.2. PR is 85 (resting).

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

In addition, I have begun taking 25 mg of Seroquel three times a day. Could the increase in Zoloft three weeks ago be causing this recent bout of insomnia? If yes, how long after my doctor returns to the old dosage before this side effect diminishes?","Doctor":"Hello. The increase of the dose of Zoloft (Sertraline) can cause sleep problem, as you are facing currently. To manage this, you can change the time from night to morning or afternoon. If you altogether stop night doses of Zoloft (return back to 100 mg per day), then this sleep issue will me resolve within four to five days. Another way to manage sleep is to take Seroquel (Quetiapine) 25 mg in morning and 50 mg at night time. By this, your sleep will be normal as Seroquel has sedative property. Try to manage adequate sleep hygiene, like do not sleep during daytime, no coffee after 5 PM, no alcohol, etc. For more information consult a psychiatrist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I got a kidney transplant done six years back.

The spine fusion means we fuse one mobile segment of the spine. That means we fuse between two vertebral bodies. We put bone graft there and it fuses with time. This is usually done if there is instability at that segment or spinal canal is so narrow that while decompression we are sure that this segment will become unstable. We also put screws because it takes around six months to fuse, till that time those screws will prevent instability at that segment. In spinal fixation surgery, we only put screws and connect them with rods. This is done mainly in trauma cases where natural healing occurs with time and till that time screws are kept in place.

I search about the symptoms and the internet says it's MIGRAINE. But when the doctor have checked me, they said it's just a TENSION HEADACHE. He gave me a 2 medications. Openadrine Citrate Paracetamol for my headache and Benadryl for my night sleeping pattern problem. I have taken these medicines for 3 days now. I can say that these meds aren't enough to deal woth headache and also with my sleeping. Day 1 after the check-up. (Afternoon )I eat food that triggers the migraine, they said its a tension headache so i thought there's no effect for me. I also take the meds they recommended to take those meds every 6 hours or 12 hours. Sadly, it triggers me to the point that i slept with the pain. I end up being awake in the evening around 8:30-9:00pm. (10 pm) I tried to eat but not the foods that triggers migraine because i know that it happens again if i try again. After i eat, i take the my meds. 1 for my headache and 1 Sleeping Pill/Medicne just to feel sleepy. It takes 2 hours when i get to sleep. It's 12 when i fall asleep. But i wake up again at 2am. After that i can't sleep again and i feel the pain in me, i feel fatigue in my whole body and a mild headache that different headache that i feel compare to the previous headaches i felt. I spend the night sad, feeling nervious and confused. All i want to do is to cry and i can't stop myself. DAY 2 It's 6am when i feel better, i tried to eat for my meds. It feels like the pain is like already gone but i still took my med for assurance that i'm okay. so i take my meds around 9am-12nn. After i took my med i feel something a mild mild headache so i end up go to bed and sleep to not feel the pain. When i wake up around 6-7pm, i feel hungry and its different from the days before i checked up by a doctor because before, when i eat more the more the headaches occurs, but that time its different because i feel hungry and that caused the headache. After i eat i took my meds and this time i took my meds earlier to make myself sleepy before 11pm so took my meds 9pm and i sleep around 11pm-1am that caused me stressed and i end up crying again. I feel so hot and outside the body and inside the stomach, i dont know what to do that time. After that i tried to make myself busy to elimiante stress. I tried to watched a drama even though i know that it also triggers me everytime i feel sad or happy or highly emotion in the drama. But that night it was different, i spent the night with that drmaa from 3am to 8am. Day 3 Again, i feel okay. I try to ride a bike to excerise my body to get tired to help my sleep pattern be normal. So i ate breakfast before i ride a bike. It feel like normal and ieat alot compare to the other days. I stop exercise at 10am. And i took a bath because i'm smell bad. After that i watched a drama again from 11pm, i dont know why but i feel that my stomach is still full. So i continue watching until 2:30pm. I took my lunch even i still feel im full cause my tummy says i'm hungry. So i took my lunch and i didnt take my meds cause i know it still gives me headaches. So i dint take it. I don't feel headache but i feel my stomach looks like burning cause its hot inside so i search it on interenet and its say stomach burn.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Bumps are hard and I have lots of pain when swallowing only on that one side (not throat). I have a burning sensation and swelling.","Doctor":"Hello. According to your statement, you have been suffering from a few painful, hard bumps at the back right of the tongue, and in front of the right tonsil and feel uncomfortable during swallowing. Usually inflamed papillae or taste buds are small, painful bumps that appear after an injury from a bite or irritation from the hot foods. Herpes is a common viral infection that can develop blisters on the tongue or gums. Oral herpes is contagious and can spread through saliva, direct contact, sexual exposure, etc. Canker sores may appear on the tongue which are red, white or yellow in appearance and can feel raw and very painful. Some foods seem to trigger cankers sore. Again food intolerances and allergic reactions may cause bumps on the tongue and it may swollen. An infection in the mouth or on the tongue may cause swelling and pain at the site of the infection. People with syphilis sometimes develop tongue sore as an early symptom of the disease and can contract the infection through direct contact during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. People with oral thrush usually notice rough white patches on the tongue and there is often redness and a sour mouth as well. It can result from DM (diabetes mellitus), HIV, nutritional deficiencies, some medications like corticosteroid, etc. Even TB (tuberculosis), carcinoma can develop bumps on the tongue. Treatment depends on the causes of the bumps. You can use antifungal medication, antibiotics, antiviral medication, and maintain good oral hygiene. You should provide some additional history like smoking, substance abuse, previous disease, medications, history of sexual activities, fever. etc."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My teeth are not in order.

So, orthodontic intervention is necessary. Depending upon the severity of the malocclusion, removable or fixed type of orthodontic treatment (braces) might be needed. Removable type can be taken off by yourself while eating alone, whereas fixed one will be attached to the teeth for a minimum of 12 to 18 months."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I recently started getting white spots on my two front teeth.

She suffered from chikungunya in and as chikungunya causes severe pain in joints. So the doctor prescribed painkillers always and when the pain was severe, the doctor also gave injections to decrease pain (one every day). After recovery in one month, I tested her blood sugar level and that came (365) nine months back, after recovering from chikungunya. Does that high level of blood sugar came due to the painkiller that she took and the injections? Followed by that I did her blood sugar test every month sometimes after 15 days then after that up to now, in last more than 1.5 year it never came up. It always came between 90 to 110 in the last 1.5 years or more time. One important point is she did not take any medicine from the date it was diagnosed. Medicine was taken only first day and not after that. She also made changes in her lifestyle as she is not taking sugar much. She is only taking natural sugar in fruits, etc. Some time brown sugar in milk. Does this mean she is not having blood sugar problem and that level came up only due to painkillers and injections she took at the time of chikungunya? Is there any way I can check?","Doctor":"Hi. Temporarily any illness can cause elevated blood sugar levels. It is difficult to say what was the cause in her case. If the painkillers included steroids then yes, that added to the cause. But illness itself could be the reason, since it disturbs the immune system and can affect any organ system. To confirm that if she has diabetes or not, in addition to blood sugar monitoring (early morning and two hours after any meal) she will need HbA1C test specifically, that can confirm if she has diabetes or not. It is very easy to do and is available in most centers. If it is greater than 6.0 level despite diet control, she more likely has diabetes and should be treated. Acute illness.

Any medicine for me?","Doctor":"Hi. There can be several reasons for gum bleeding like calculus due to poor oral hygiene, blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, traumatic ulcer, excessive spitting. These causes often lead to gingival inflammation which causes blood to ooze out on mild stimulation by brushing (hard brush), gargling or taking hot liquids like coffee, tea, etc.  Your chief complaint is incomplete without attachment photo of your oral cavity and any medical history. You can forward that in future but I am sure your problems will solve by following this treatment protocol of medications. Tablet Ordent (Ofloxacin Ornidazole) BD for five days.

A few days I have pain in the chest when I am traveling, then the second day always fall ill.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern.

He sent me to a root canal specialist who found that the tooth is cracked and needs to be removed. Given that the infection was under the tooth in the bone, was it appropriate to do a root canal before checking whether it would solve the problem?","Doctor":"Hi. Your chief complaint in itself suggests tooth was infected so there were two treatment modalities: RCT (root canal treatment) or extraction. As the doctor has done RCT and problem has not solved, it can be due to accessory root canals difficult to negotiate or perforation due to faulty RCT procedure. The endodontist after examination arrived at the conclusion of a cracked tooth. So, he advised extraction. As for your question is concerned the doctor has tried best at first instance to save the tooth and it is a routine which dentists do. But based on the complexity he was not able to solve it. Under such cases we dentists extract tooth particularly in case of third molars which has much complicated anatomy."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 27 years old. I have a problem with vehicle sounds.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

We have not taken him to the doctor. We have not done any tests. But we believe that it is an enteric fever. So I brought Cefpodoxime for him. My concern is to know the exact dose of it. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. As a parent, I am sure you have to do the best for your son. It is not right to give antibiotics to him without proper guidance. If it is not a confirmed case of enteric fever, it can also be a simple viral fever which may not even need antibiotics. Sometimes, urinary tract infections also occur with temperature, and the urinary symptoms are not shown. There is a rising trend of antibiotic resistance among people, which means that the necessary antibiotics do not even work for many infections and a higher level of antibiotics are used. This resistance occurs due to indiscriminate use of antibiotics. If this continues, we may face a problem in the future where the infections will not have the ability to respond to any of the available antibiotics. I am advising this because I want to change the way you look at antibiotics. Kindly meet a qualified doctor and do the necessary clinical examination. He will suggest the relevant tests. Please do not start any medicine based on your intuition. Even an experienced physician needs laboratory tests to confirm typhoid. I hope you understand it. If you still want to go for laboratory tests, I recommend the following tests to rule out the infection. They are complete blood count, blood smear for malarial parasite, urine routine, and Widal test (tube agglutination method) for typhoid. I suggest you meet a doctor for a clinical examination before going ahead with these tests. I am sure you will not give any medication to your son without knowing his clinical condition."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, As I have been suffering from an itchy scrotum and erectile dysfunction for more than two years now, I was wondering if I could receive a consultation for solving my problem. Often it could get painful and very scratchy.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. From the symptoms described, I feel that the itchy scrotum and the erectile dysfunction are most likely not related to each other. Firstly, about the erectile dysfunction, was it sudden in onset or did you notice a gradual decline in the erections? Do you have erections early in the mornings? Are you able to have a penetrative intercourse? Are you a diabetic or have any other medical illness? At 35 years, the erectile dysfunction is unlikely to be anything related to the blood flow to the penis. But a doppler study with erectile drugs will be able to confirm that. If the blood supply is normal you can be prescribed drugs to enhance erections, though I would also advise a psychological evaluation to rule out the stress-induced erectile dysfunction. Secondly, the itchy scrotum will require a clinical examination to see if there are any identifiable lesions. The most likely reason is a fungal infection which can sometimes be persistent or recurrent. Your local dermatologist will be able to take some skin scrapings and confirm that. The chance of STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) causing scrotal itching is less likely. Another possibility could be intestinal parasites which can sometimes cause itching in the perineal region. Again a clinical exam to check the region around your back passage and a stool examination will help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have two moles that seem kind of weird.

One is a flat one whereas the other one is raised. The flat one is usually a junctional nervous (superficial nevus) whereas the raised one is usually a compound nevus (has both epidermal and dermal component).

I cannot bend over either. I have tried deep heat, and warm water bottles, I have not tried Panadol or Nurefon, because I cannot swallow tablets. I do not know why. But the point is, it hurts every moment of every day.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Back pain at your young age could be due to the possible stiffness of muscles on your back especially if you are not doing regular exercise. However, back pain could be related to any possible urogenital problem especially related to periods or the urinary tract infection. I highly advise running a few diagnostic tests to determine the right diagnosis like urine analysis, complete blood count, back X-ray. Apply analgesic cream or patch locally. If you cannot swallow tablets, can take as effervescent analgesic tablets or powder to dissolve in water and drink it. Discuss this further with your caring doctor."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, If TSH range is 18.64, does it mean any problem?","Doctor":"Hi.

Since your value is 18.64, it falls in the higher range. It means you are suffering from a condition known as hypothyroidism. You will need to start medications for the same.

Whatever I eat within one hour I am urged to go to the toilet. My stomach hurts every time I go to the toilet. I cannot eat fish, milk products, some gluten products, or chicken. My sister thinks I may have Crohn's disease. I need to find out what is going on. I have been dealing with it since I had e.coil four years ago.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from abdominal pain followed by defecation one hour after taking your meals. You cannot eat fish, milk, some gluten products, or chicken which can aggravate your sufferings. The most likely cause of needing to pass stool right after eating is the gastrocolic reflex. The reflex is a normal involuntary reaction to the food entering stomach. For some people, it is mild causing no symptom. For others, it may be intense and the urge to poop after eating can be severe like you. Certain health conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome or IBS can cause a person's digestive tract to move food through their system at a much faster rate. Other conditions like food allergies, food intolerances, anxiety, gastritis, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease or IBD, Crohn's disease, etc., all can give rise to digestive symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, increased frequency of defecation, diarrhea, constipation, alternating diarrhea, and constipation, etc. So you should undergo some investigations like CBC (complete blood count), USG (ultrasound) of W/A, stool culture, sigmoidoscopy, and rectal biopsy, colonoscopy, and jejunal biopsy to find out the underlying cause of your present conditions. In the meantime, you can avoid some foods like fatty or greasy foods, foods high in fiber, dairy products, etc. Again if you are suffering from anxiety, stress, or any other psychological distress, then you should take steps to remove them. After getting your investigation reports and knowing some additional history like weight loss, hormonal imbalance, previous diseases, medication history, family history I can help to treat you further. You had an e.coli infection four years back and from then you have been suffering according to your description. I think you took medication for your e.coli and e.coli usually disappears from the body with 7-14 days, but it may aggravate some rare long-lasting complications like IBS, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, etc."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had unprotected sex with my partner during the fourth day of my period.

As there is no ovulation happening during this period, there are no chances of pregnancy. Also, you have taken the emergency pill within 72 hours of intercourse, so there is no chance of pregnancy.

Typhoid fever is a common serious infection that requires specific treatment after diagnosis. The causative organisms are either salmonella typhi or paratyphi. The definitive diagnosis is through isolation of the organism by culture in the first ten days. The drug of choice is Ciprofloxacin for 14 days.  Please let me know when the symptoms started and the name of the medications you have taken. Typhoid fever can be chronic if not treated properly.

If the foreskin does not retract fully, then it is difficult to perform the sexual activity because it can cause pain and can cause rupture of the frenulum.

Blood pressure is not coming under control and high heart rate. Respiratory tract infection, sweating and breathing difficulty. First of all, you did not mention why are you taking Amphetamine salts, because most of your problems like high blood pressure, fast heart rate, ringing sound in ears, sweating could be due to side effects of Amphetamine. So if it could be stopped then most of your problems shall come down. So it is essential for me to know why you are taking Amphetamine. For respiratory tract infection, you need to be tested more with tests like chest X-ray, Throat swab culture sensitivity, sputum culture sensitivity. Uncontrolled respiratory infection can explain your breathing difficulty and loss of stamina. So if properly treated for respiratory infection your breathing issues can also come down. But in addition, I would recommend getting a 2D echo scan done.  Coming to your non-healing sores again it could be because of Amphetamine. But other causes are diabetes, vasculitis, and bacterial infections. But before investigating for these I recommend stopping Amphetamines for 2 to 3 weeks and see what happens."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 18 years old and my penis size is too small due to a lot of masturbation from the age of 14 years. I am in depression due to my penis size. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. Masturbation does not cause a decrease in the size of the penis. It is incorrect to think that or believe that. Most of the young boys are obsessed with the size of the penis. The fact being that size of the penis does not authenticate virility. There is no golden rule that describes or validates the size of the penis as long as you are able to achieve an erection for the purpose of copulation. I suggest you stop obsessing over the size of your penis and if you can please try to divert your mind by indulging in other hobbies."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Currently, she takes HCQs, Methotrexate, pain killer, and Rantac. At present, she has pain, nodules in hand, and turned feet. Please suggest proper medication. Her LFT and KFT are normal.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. But the report images could not reveal anything. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).   I would like to ask you a few more queries before suggesting the medicine as any new DMARD (disease-modifying antirheumatic drug) started has to be taken with caution. You mentioned pain, is it in the joints or the whole body? Is there dryness of eyes or mouth? Is the sleep normal or disturbed? Any forgetfulness? Irritability? When is the pattern of pain more, mornings after waking or constant throughout? Please message me the dose of Folitrax as well which she is taking and the name of the pain killer? Do you have the last ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and CRP (c-reactive protein)? Is she taking calcium and Vitamin D supplement? I understand she has an aggressive disease considering nodules, deformities persisting. But lot of times people with long-standing arthritis develop secondary fibromyalgia and the management is very different. We can only be 100 percent sure after clinical examination but will help you in the best possible way we can.  Try to reattach the reports as well."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have an issue with gum disease. There is a swollen gum present on my back tooth. It hurts when I touch it. It is not seen in front of my tooth. It is present inside my mouth. I have pain in the left jaw. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the image (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It looks like a periodontal abscess (infection of the gums and tissues surrounding the teeth). As you have braces (molar band specifically), it can also cause it. Another possibility is gingivitis. Again the reason is the same. The third reason can be due to dental caries (but your image does not show any evidence of caries or cavities). To confirm it, a clinical examination and intra-oral X-ray is needed. You will need a professional cleaning (scaling). For pain, you can take Aceclofenac 100 mg once in the morning and once in the night after food, take Pantoprazole 40 mg once in the night before taking food (only if you have acidity as it can aggravate the acidity). You can take Amoxicillin CV (Clavulanic acid) for five days one tablet in the morning and one at night. Finish this antibiotic course for five days even if the symptoms subside. If you are allergic to any medicine, stop taking them. Let me know so that I can alter the medication. But, I prefer taking antibiotics only after the clinical examination and X-ray. Do not worry. Consult your dentist. You will be fine. Maintain oral hygiene and since you are wearing braces, be more careful with oral health. Follow the instructions given by your dentist. Do lukewarm saltwater gargling. Is there any other swelling below the angle of your jaw or any pus or blood discharge from the swelling? Or are there any other symptoms present?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 51 years old. I have had six low back surgeries including a fusion with hardware and screws. Today at work I lifted something heavy and had a very sharp pain that brought me to my knees. Now I am losing control of my bladder and bowels, and the pain is very bad. What could this be?","Doctor":"Hi. If you are developing radicular pain and losing your bladder and bowel, then it is an emergency and you need to quickly consult your spine surgeon. It could be due to some problem in the fusion segment or above that segment which is called adjacent segment degeneration. You need urgent surgery to decompress your spinal cord. I know it would be extremely mentally traumatic for you to get yourself again cut after six surgeries but the situation demands that and you need to fight it. Get yourself evaluated from a good spine surgeon and decide accordingly. Are you feeling numbness at your anal region?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 70 but until recently have been very sexually active with my wife. I am in good health overall but have suffered from anxiety and depression my entire life. That usually has not interfered with my sex life. I have had a penile implant several years ago so getting an erection is not an issue. But for the past couple of months, I have not reached orgasm and ejaculated except when my wife tries through hand jobs to complete the orgasm. Even that is very delayed and seems like it takes forever. Sometimes I just give up because my wife gets weary and I feel guilty. My libido seems to be mostly in low gear but sometimes I am desiring but it does not work. I just had my testosterone level checked. It is in the mid 500. For 30 years, I have had to inject Depo-T 5 mil per week because I had low T related. I think of the long-term use of Prednisone to treat Crohn's. It has been in remission for 10 years but I still take 10 mg Prednisone daily because my adrenals no longer function. My penile implant was due to Peyronies disease. For my depression, I am on 450 mg of Bupropion and just 2 mg of Abilify. I exercise one hour a day seven days a week, mostly swimming. But lately, during my sexual efforts, I sweat and get tired fast. I had a stress test and did great. So I am now desperate to be able to ejaculate during intercourse.","Doctor":"Hello. You are in good health and has no serious co-morbid issue. You have main problem of delayed or no ejaculation. This could be occurring due to poor erection or reduced libido or anxiety. You are not on any anti-hypertensive so we can think of adding Sildenafil to your prescription. You can take 25 mg tablet and this should help in hard erection and should help in ejaculation. You should talk to your doctor before starting this drug."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am feeling sick with a blocked nose and a sore throat from yesterday. It may be a viral infection due to cold, or it can be due to smoking for the first time. I am feeling tired and sick. I am taking vitamin C 1000 mg every day for the past three days. I have a feeling that I do not have immunity. Is it right to take vitamin C 1000 mg every day? Can I take them more to boost my immunity? Also, I took Panadol cold and flu. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hi. You are suffering from an upper respiratory viral infection. Vitamin C supplement is right and take them for one week. It is better to stop smoking for at least one week. Panadol cold and flu (Dextromethorphan hydrobromide monohydrate with Paracetamol) is an excellent choice and continue them for one week. You can use Otrivin nose drops (Xylometazoline nasal spray) for nose block. But not for more than a week. Usually, the course of viral infection takes a few days for improving. There is no need for antibiotics at this moment. Drink plenty of warm fluids."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My age is 27 now. When I was in 14 years old, a severe hip joint pain started and the doctor diagnosed it as septic arthritis and operated right hip joint to remove fluid. Then the pain was gone.

Shall I continue it till lifetime or is there any alternative treatment for this?","Doctor":"Hi. This is an autoimmune disorder which actually has no treatment. You need to take medications when there is a flare-up of the disease. In between when you have no symptoms then you can stop the drug. You have not mentioned about your hip pain right now. You need to keep doing regular general conditioning exercises and stretching exercises to keep your body flexible otherwise this disease will affect your flexibility very fast."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 20 years old and I am in a relationship which is draining me emotionally, physically and mentally. But I am still giving it chances because the guy I am with probably loves me a lot, cries at the thought of leaving me and is loyal to me. I cannot decide. I cannot just leave. I am stuck in a vicious circle. He controls me, he does not trust me even if I do not lie or do anything. He thinks I am making a fool of him and doing other things and being disloyal even though I am not. I give explanations every time and he does not believe. Every time I have to answer his investigations. I feel like I am controlled. I cannot wear what I want to. I can not go wherever I want to because he does not trust me even though I am doing nothing wrong or nothing to break his trust. I do not know what is keeping me from leaving. I have been with him for the past six years and I love him but I do not feel the happiness anymore. Maybe I cannot let go because of the fear of leaving or the love or the idea of not being with him. I need help.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand what you are going through right now. People are difficult to understand at times. Currently, I think you are being psychologically or emotionally abused. The guy controls your life, your freedom, your decisions on everything, hurts you, blame you unnecessary (being dishonest) still claim to love you. This is exactly what happens when one is psychologically abused. To stop this, you need to take some bold decisions, do not show your dependency on him, pretend as if you do not care about him being hurt, take your own decisions, take strict actions when he blames about your infidelity. Your self-respect is the most important thing. Further, if you need any help we can discuss the matter."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 18 years old.

If everything is fine, then it can be due to hormonal changes at your young age. So the treatment depends upon the cause. At this age, as you are under growing process, it is better to wait and watch if they resolve on its own.

I know some pain is to be expected post op but is it normal to feel this way almost two weeks later?","Doctor":"Hello. No, it is not common to have pain till now. Go back to your dentist as soon as possible. You may have dry socket condition due to infection of the wound. Use warm salt water gargle twice a day for a week or two. Exercise your jaw to open as much as possible so that dentist can get a look in.

The areas surrounding the bites are much warmer than the rest of his skin. There are no blisters, pus, or discharge at this time. He has had a fever 102.2 F and has had a noticeable decrease in activity.","Doctor":"Hi. It appears like Skeeters syndrome by the look of it (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I suggest you continue antiallergic (antihistaminic s) and use Lactocalamine lotion over the area and see if it subsides. It should in a day or two. Give him Tylenol as per body weight for fever and any pain. Give him plenty of fluids. If he does not improve in 48 hours, it is prudent to take him to the hospital to be checked by a pediatrician or an infectious disease specialist. You would also wanna examine his body to see if there is any insect attached to him, any tick biting him, or to see if there are any other rashes and if any rashes appear in bull's eye form. Warning symptoms and signs to get alerted are drowsiness not improving, slurring of speech, weakness of facial muscles, high grade fever not responding to Tylenol."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am female, 21 years of age and as weird as this sounds, I always feel like I am so overfocused that I cannot really focus. I am very slow when it comes to verbal communication, it is something I have struggled with ever since I was a child. So when someone is verbally giving me instructions, from something as simple as sending an email to someone to passing on a long message to someone else, I just zone out or like I said at the beginning, so focused on what's being said that I forget, like I was not even listening. I always ask for the person to repeat, but it usually takes four more repeats for me to at least get the gist of the conversation, which obviously leads to people getting frustrated. I was screened for any learning or hearing disabilities when I was a child, but the counselors at school could not find anything wrong with me. This is extremely frustrating for me and gets in the way of my social and work life. I would like to know if it could be some kind of attention disorder or something else? I do not know if the following info helps but I have always been a sensitive child. I could not stand going to the theater or concerts until I was 14 years old and very intense smells make me cry, regardless whether it smells good or not. I am also extremely hyperactive. I get so restless that I walk and run around the house, but I know how to control it when I am in public. I was also bullied all throughout middle school, it stopped mid-high school when I finally stood up for myself.","Doctor":"Hi. It seems from the information you have provided that you might be suffering from an adult variant of attention deficit hyperactive disorder, inattention type. Do you also have symptoms like repetitive acts or rituals, urge to repeat words or images, repetitive handwashing or checking repeatedly. If these symptoms are present, you might be suffering from OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder). But still, I think the first provisional diagnosis is an attention deficit hyperactive disorder, inattention type. You may get relief by medicines like Methylphenidate or Methamphetamine."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, The first day of my last period was on the 2nd of March, it lasted till 6th of March. I had unprotected sex on the 10th of March, but he did not ejaculate inside me but there is a chance that pre-cum may have gotten in. So for safety, I took contraceptive pills (Postinor 2) on the 11th. On the 16th, I noticed light bleeding, and it lasted till 19th. I am yet to see my period for this month. Although, I usually experience irregular menstrual cycles, is it possible I am pregnant? Or has it worsened my case of irregular menstrual cycle?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I have gone through the details and the sequence of events you mentioned and totally understand your anxiousness. See, the emergency contraceptive pills are high doses of progesterone hormone, so at times there can be withdrawal and some times there can be a delayed period too. The effects vary from a person to person. As you already had a history of irregular periods, it is difficult to predict just based on the sequence of events whether you could be pregnant or not. So a definitive test would be to check for a urine pregnancy test, preferably with an early morning urine sample. If that is negative, then you can rest assured that you are not pregnant. And you can take the medications mentioned below to get your periods and get yourself evaluated for the cause for your irregular periods. Regarding your irregular periods, I see that you are slightly overweight for your height. So mostly this could be due to PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) too that you have your irregular periods which need to be evaluated or maybe some hormonal changes in thyroid or prolactin hormones. Ultrasound abdomen and pelvis. Complete hemogram. Lipid profile. LFT (liver function test). RFT (renal function test). 75 g glucose tolerance test (fasting/ 1 hour / 2 hour). HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) level. Serum calcium, vitamin D and B12 levels. Serum fasting and post prandial insulin levels. Serum FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), LH (leutenizing hormone), free testosterone, estradiol, prolactin levels, thyroid profile (T3, T4, TSH, Anti TPO) on second or third day of the next menstrual period. PCOS. Tablet Meprate or Deviry 10 mg twice daily for five days and then stop. To wait for withdrawal bleed within next 7-10 days. To get blood tests done on second or third day of periods. Reduce weight. Maintain menstrual diary. Regular exercises at least one hour daily. Lifestyle and dietary modifications."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago.

The current biopsy results are indicative of a lichenoid type of lesion in the buccal mucosa. This type of picture can be seen due to a variety of causes ranging from allergens to systemic drugs, anything causing irritation (like dentures), etc. Though the presence of rash, uveitis and recurrent mouth ulcers would be suspicious of Behcet's disease, the biopsy results are not what would be typically seen in Behcet's disease.

If it still persists, consult a paediatrician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am very sad and anxious most of the time. Lost motivation and most happiness, which has probably been gone for a while. Was on Zoloft for about five months, but it did not do anything. It was only on 50 mg/day so maybe that is why. I do not really want to cope with medicine because in the long run its just a mask for the way I feel. I am 23 years old and have a 10-month-old just some background. I quit my job because I did not feel mentally strong enough and would cry at work every day. I have been out of work for eight months and am scared to go back, which is also contributing to me being completely broke and contributing to me feeling worse about myself.","Doctor":"Hello. At your age, depression is reactive, means that there will be some stress factor. Are you feeling that life is no more useful or interesting, is there any suicidal ideas, have you lost pleasure in previously pleasurable activities? We have to increase the dose of Zoloft (Sertraline) and you should start some psychotherapy sessions. You should take part in social gathering and develop interest. Start talking to friends and relatives about your problem without thinking about what they will think. Start physical activities and keep yourself busy. Do one thing that you think is interesting. Avoid loneliness. Thyroid profile."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Without remembering to take off my contacts, I slept with them on. It was only for three and a half hours. These are yearly lenses, so they are pretty thick. They are FDA approved but doctors normally do not recommend them. I woke up with my vision having a white haze. As the time goes by, it is going away. But I just wanna know if I should schedule an appointment with my doctor.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through what you have mentioned and feel that you do need an ophthalmologist appointment. The causes for such a foggy or hazy vision could be corneal edema. As you might already know the contact lenses do not permit good aeration of the cornea, this can cause accumulation of fluid inside the normally transparent cornea causing foggy vision. You may also experience seeing rainbow colored halos around light and glare. Corneal ulcers. These are also caused by contact lens wear and present with foreign body sensation and pain along with foggy vision. With the above in mind, I feel it is best to visit an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and treatment. Measures to be taken in the meantime are to stop using contact lenses, use glasses. Resume contact lens wear only after your ophthalmologist's advise. Use over the counter lubricants (example-Refresh tears eyedrops 6 to 8 times a day) to soothe the eye. Use sunglasses while outdoors and avoid exposure to dust or wind."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have chest discomfort and upper and lower back discomfort since yesterday.

From last year, I am having a continuous post-nasal drip and a very sore throat. I tried taking over-the-counter antihistamines and mucus thinner, but they did not help. I also have clicking in my ear. My voice kind of muffles in my left ear sometimes and when I lay down, my left ear opens and then closes and then opens and closes again. At the top of my nose, there is something soft ball like thing that moves. What is going on?","Doctor":"Hello. You seem to suffer from chronic rhinosinusitis that is producing constant post-nasal drip from the sinonasal membranes. The post-nasal drip irritates the throat mucosa causing pain and soreness. The mucus trickling down from nose also tends to block the Eustachian tube orifices, which prevents adequate ventilation and drainage of the ears, causing muffled sounds. You need to take a non-contrast CT scan of paranasal sinuses to check the sinuses. You would also benefit from corticosteroid intranasal spray with an antiallergic like Alavert (Loratadine), taken once daily. Metaspray (Mometasone), should be taken twice daily, two puffs in each nostril. Blood investigations mainly to rule out allergy are advised. Complete blood count, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and serum IgE would be useful to make the right diagnosis. Do revert with the reports. I would advise you to desist from smoking, drinking and steam inhalation during the course.

He did an audiogram and balance tests and said my hearing was fine and not affected by the tinnitus, and that the cause was extra-cranial. He suggested taking Betahistine and Loratadine. During the examination, he also looked at my nose and saw a polyp in my left nostril. He then scheduled me for a nasal endoscopy. The endoscopy confirmed the polyp in the left nostril or sinus as well as a deviated septum and enlarged turbinate. I was then referred for an X-ray and CT scan. I will attach the CT scan report. According to the ENT, it is a case of a unilateral polyp and because of its size, it is a surgical case that will not respond to the nasal steroid spray he prescribed after the first visit. He asked if I had any pain or other symptoms and I said no, I have had no snoring, no sleep apnoea, and no pain, only the odd post-nasal drip which I have always had since childhood. Since I have (controlled) hypertension and type 2 diabetes he said the surgery was a risk but he recommended it, but I needed to discuss it with my GP and endocrinologist because of the risks involved. My main worry was that the polyp could be something malignant, but he seems to have ruled this out based on the endoscope and CT imaging. My feeling is that if I am not having any symptoms, and due to the risks of surgery and the likelihood the polyp will return after surgery, it is not a good option for me right now. I am basically looking for a second opinion, taking into account the CT scan results, is surgery definitely indicated now or can a waiting approach be taken? The tinnitus issue sort of fell by the wayside the Betahistine and Loratadine caused headaches. So I have not been taking them. All focus for now seems to be on this polyp issue. Currently, I am taking Nebilet, Dexilant, Glucophage, Victoza, Allopurinol, and Exforge HCT.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen your CT scan reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I will want to see CT scan films myself. The typed report says that there are extensive polyps for which medical management might not be enough but I want to see films myself in all the cuts (axial, coronal). You have mentioned that you do not have any symptoms like a headache, nose block, snoring, sneezing, but tinnitus can also be due to polyps. Extensive polyposis can block eustachian tube and can cause a ringing sensation in ears (left ear). As of now you send me CT scan films and also you start taking steroid nasal spray twice daily (one puff each nostril) for six weeks (local steroid spray does not have any side effects, so you need not bother about that).

The symptoms are usually similar, but during each flare I have a few different ones that seem to take the lead. They almost always start with pain in my legs. First it starts with shin, then calfs, thighs and butt. The pain usually spreads randomly, but this time it started and sets in as a longer crushing pain. The pain spreads to the joints, muscles and the eyes. It seems like organ pain. I also get muscle spasms throughout the body. I get very strong headaches that usually start behind one eye and feel like a tension headache. I also get long and short stabbing pains in my head. During my current episode and two previous ones, I also have very apparent neurological symptoms such as vertigo, brain fog, etc. I have gastro symptoms as well, such as constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pains and upper right quadrant pain. I also have frequent urinary symptoms and sharp random pains in my groin, testicle and penis. I have also had blood in my urine. I have heart palpitations too. This is not happening with this flare for some reason. My random symptoms are hives, especially in one patch on my left rib cage only, rapid weight loss (I have lost 10 lbs in one week and 30 total during the first episode), interrupted sleep, red irritated eyes, occasional sore throat, nasal drip, strong fatigue and occasional mouth sores. I have had MRIs, ultrasounds and CT scans, which were all negative. I am going for another brain MRI and ECG by next week.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I am not sure if it contributed to me getting pregnant as previously I have had two miscarriages and an ectopic pregnancy when I was married (two years ago). I have stopped the Anavar as soon as I found out. What is the best way to come off GH? Shall I just stop or do I need to wean off of it? I am worried if I just stop my body would not produce for a while and it will cause pregnancy at a risk to survive.","Doctor":"Hello. Congratulations on your pregnancy and on having escaped literally in the nick of time from the potential risks of Anavar. Anavar contains Oxandrolone, which is a male hormone derivative, if taken inadvertently during pregnancy, then it causes virilization (masculinization) of the female fetus. It takes a few days to metabolize form the body, so I recommend you to stop both with immediate effect and start on folic acid supplementation sooner. The gestation is only 5 weeks as on date and the fetal pole has not yet arrived. If you do not stop, then there are high chances of you getting an anembryonic pregnancy which is pregnancy without a fetal pole or a chemical pregnancy which can be confirmed only after two weeks with a scan to check if fetal heart rate has arrived or not. It would confirm if the pregnancy is viable or not. If no heartbeat, then there are chances that it may have been affected by the effects of Anavar and HGH (high growth hormones) and hence non-viable. Avoid exposure to any teratogen during the length of the pregnancy."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Last week, I noticed a red spot on my penis skin. It was only visible with an erection.

The treatment depends on symptoms and quality of life. Initially, the patient experiences only pain and range of motion is not limited.

So in this case, core decompression helps in reducing the pressure and in turn pain. But, this surgery does not stop or slow the progression of the disease.  In the later stages when the shape of the head is deformed and there is pain and hence the quality of life is severely affecting, then the only option left will be the hip replacement.

After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have never consulted a doctor about this problem so far, and I have never taken any medication for the same.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your problem. A lot of individuals have social anxiety. The anxiety of being judged, restlessness on speaking in front of people, anticipatory anxiety what others will think about you, reduced confidence and depressive symptoms secondary to social anxiety are commonly seen in individuals. For social anxiety, both medicines and psychosocial treatment is advised. Have the practice to speak in front of the mirror, and this will help to boost your confidence. Try to reassure yourself that nothing is wrong, and no one is judging you. Breathing exercises like deep breathing, and breath for a count of six for two minutes. It will help to control the heightened anxiety. Progressive muscle relaxation exercise can also help to boost confidence. With time and practice, you will learn to control the tone of muscles which increases during anxiety. You can follow this during the events of anxiety. This will keep you calm. Medicines like beta blockers are my first choice for anxiety. Propranolol can be used in anxiety-provoking situations. The drug is safe to use, and there is no need to be taken regularly. If the anxiety persists even after that, then medications like SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) can be used. The drugs should be used periodically, and it will help to treat anxiety. You can visit a psychiatrist for help regarding medicines if there is a need."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a 5-year-old girl that gets severe itching. She has been diagnosed with eczema and scratches until relief. Her skin looks inflammed and pelvic lymph nodes are palpable. Doctors have suggested using the steroid Triamcinolone 0.1 % ointment for two weeks with antibiotic ointment to heal the cuts from scratches along with Aquaphor petrolatum base. We are concerned about using steroid creams. My other son, 18 months, is also getting the same problem. The itching has disturbed sleep habits. It is more pronounced when the kids are not busy. How do we break this itch cycle and what treatments can you suggest both internal and external. My 5 years old was blood tested for allergies and she is negative for dairy, wheat, and rice.","Doctor":"Hi. The kid has atopic dermatitis. It is a type of eczema that usually starts early in life after three months of age, starts over face in babies, then involves forearms, legs in toddlers. It is very itchy, the erosions from scratching can get infected easily. Most children grow out of by the age of 10. The skin becomes very sensitive, they react to minor triggers like woolen clothes, animal dander, a dye in the cloth. IgE levels indicate the intensity of allergy. It is safe to use Triamcinolone as it is a mid potent steroid, it can be used safely up to two weeks, then skin needs a break from the steroid. Moisturizer is the key to break the itch-scratch cycle. Some moisturizers have ceramide in them, they help to protect the skin barrier. Discuss with your dermatologist regarding Eucrisa (Crisaborole) and Tacrolimus, Pimecrolimus. These are a non-steroid anti-inflammatory medicine that can be used once the rash is under control after using Triamcinolone (steroid)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, It was about six years ago, and I was giving oral sex to a guy.

He was my first sexual partner outside being molested as a child. I do have a history of cold sores. He is straight. What are the chances I contracted HIV?","Doctor":"Hi. The chances of transmission of HIV by unprotected oral sex is almost nil in the scenario mentioned. The chances are also almost nil if there is no penetration (skin is an effective barrier). It may be better to go for HIV antibodies tests to be totally relieved of anxiety. The chances of HIV tests coming positive is almost nil.

Some time ago, I had a paid unprotected oral sex encounter but vaginal sex was mostly protected. I say mostly protected because the condom was very loose due to my erectile dysfunction. I received oral sex from her without any protection. Please take into account that prior to this episode I have been experiencing chronic penile sores and burning in urethra supposedly due to my established herpes infection (earlier tested positive for both herpes 1 and 2). I also have a weak immune system because I suffered from malnutrition while growing up. I have four questions that I want to ask. Would my herpes infection affect the window period for HIV 1 and 2? Would the window period for any of these aforementioned diseases be affected in case of pre-existing or simultaneous co-infection with another STI? Also, would my herpes infection increase the likelihood of getting infected with HIV or any other STI? Lastly, please advise when should I get tested for all these STIs in order to have conclusive results.","Doctor":"Hello. No, herpes does not affect the window period for HIV 1 and 2. Yes, it could be if the immune system is compromised. The term window period is used mainly with reference to HIV. Herpes infection per se does not increase the chances of an STI. But the mode of transmission of herpes is similar to the mode of transmission of other STI diseases. So the risk of exposure to all STIs is the same."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Often, I get red cysts of some sort on my face beneath the skin that take a while to heal. I have oily skin, and get whiteheads as well. I have fluid-filled boil-like lesions on my face. I have been to a few dermatologists and one of them said that I have rosacea. I do not believe that I am allergic to any food. I take more than enough of my vitamins and minerals. I eat very healthy and do not mess around with any junk food. I do not smoke or drink. I am a writer, and I tend to sit down a lot, for the majority of the day. I do not have triggers that make me flush. I am beginning to suspect that I do not have rosacea. My skin is not really sensitive. I am not sure if I have the regular acne as other people do. Is it any other skin disorder? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Rosacea is a skin disorder that affects people above 30 years. Other than acne-like lesions, people with rosacea have redness of the face and dry skin associated with burning sensation. They also have redness and irritation in the eyes. The redness of the face is aggravated by triggering factors such as weather changes, stress, alcohol consumption, exercise, and spicy food. Your clinical condition is not rosacea since your history is contradicting with the above-said information. You seem to have acne. The cysts are a part of acne. Acne varies in severity from individual to individual. Some may have mild acne which may come off and on. Others may have an almost incessant eruption of acne, which may leave behind post-acne hyperpigmentation and acne scars. For acne, you need to be constantly taking care of your skin until the tendency for new acne formation dies down. Topical treatment of acne mainly revolves around topical antibacterials (Clindamycin gel or Nadifloxacin gel), Benzoyl peroxide and topical retinoids. Topical retinoids are comedolytic thereby preventing new acne. For inflammatory acne (papules and pustules), I suggest starting with one of the oral antibiotics either Azithromycin, Doxycycline or Minocycline. Cystic acne is an indication for starting oral retinoids. They are the most effective drugs for acne and are usually the first choice in severe acne or cystic acne or moderately severe acne or acne not responding adequately to traditional anti-acne medications or acne significantly affecting the quality of life of patients regardless of severity. Consult a specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. You could also take a few peeling sessions like Salicylic acid peels from a dermatologist. Salicylic acid peels are specific for acne. Acne is a recurrent condition and once your acne is brought under good control with oral and topical anti-acne medicines, you should still continue to use a cream/gel (topical retinoid) for maintenance of improvement. Topical retinoids are ideal for maintenance of improvement because they are comedolytic as well as anti-inflammatory, thereby preventing the formation of new acne.

It may be a calcium deposit, and it is commonly seen in the left ventricle of the heart in the prenatal second and third pregnancy ultrasounds. It is a rare finding, and it does not show any adverse outcomes in the absence of other factors. It will not cause any harm to the heart, and it will not develop any problem with the development of a baby. But in the presence of other risk factors, the doctor performs these screening tests, like Down's syndrome screening. Otherwise, just the presence of an echogenic spot will not raise the chance of getting any chromosomal or genetic disorder."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Can I insert Triamcinolone inside my vagina to clear yeast infection?","Doctor":"Hi. Triamcinolone is not indicated for yeast infection. It is a corticosteroid and rather, a yeast infection can precipitate with this drug.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

You need to consult a psychiatrist to take medications. Antidepressants are required to be taken under a doctor's supervision. There is no fixed dose for any antidepressant medicines. After taking the medication, the psychiatrist will evaluate the patient's response and depending upon the patient's response, the dosage and various antidepressants are adjusted for the patient. You can try nonpharmacological management to reduce your depression. But you need medication if there is no improvement in four to six weeks. Fix your daily schedule. Take seven to eight hours of regular sleep. Try to do exercise for 30 to 45 minutes daily. Do meditation for 15 minutes. Eat healthy foods. Avoid taking junk foods. Take vegetables and fruits more in your diet. Spend time on creative hobbies like reading good books, writing, painting, learn or play some musical instruments, play outdoor sports, spend quality time with friends and family. Try to stay away from social media. Make a goal for your life and work for it. Live your life. If you want to take antidepressants, then you can take tablet Sertraline 50 mg daily after breakfast or lunch (do not take in empty stomach) and tablet Clonazepam 0.5 mg at night if you have any sleep disturbance.

Second, a sore throat is due to infection and may not always be due to HIV. Simply check for any redness (congestion) of tonsils or surrounding area to rule out any infection. A sore throat can occur due to a viral, or a bacterial infection and the causes are numerous. A viral infection may present with body pain, while a bacterial infection will have a high-grade fever. So try to rule out any congestion in the throat. You can start with a prophylactic drug for a sore throat.

Pain in the right testicle, swelling at the top of the right testicle and some redness on the urethra, especially after ejaculation. I had Chlamydia about 18 months ago. I was tested positive and treated with two antibiotic pills, which seemed to cure it. After six months, the test came back all clear. They also checked for syphilis, gonorrhea, and HIV. All came back negative.

Six months ago, I started to experience the symptoms. When I went to the doctors, they gave me a 9-day course of Doxycycline as they suspected epididymitis. It seems to clear it up in about five days, and I was even cycling and running again. A week after the course of Doxycycline, the symptoms came back. I read on the internet that the bacteria, which can find itself in all sorts of places as the tubes in the testicles can be like a network of caves and it can be hard to kill off completely. I visited the sexual health clinic. They gave me a 14-day course of Ofloxacin, which slightly reduced the symptoms. They seemed reluctant to rerun a Doxycycline course as they said it came back after taking it the first time. Do I need a long-term course of Doxycycline to work really? I had an ultrasound scan to reveal that I had an epididymal cyst, but currently, there is no pain. The doctor advised it would cause no harm and I would have to live with it. It is about the size of a pea. Over the last few months, the epididymal cyst and redness remain on the scrotum in that area and slight rash or redness on the penis glad. The urologist put me on six weeks of Cipro, which seem to lower the irritation and symptoms by 60 %, but never really cleared it up. Then, I have had a urine culture test, and it came back with the following. Please note the following antibiotics Augmentin, Cefpodoxime and Ciprofloxacin should not be used as the first choice if alternatives are available. Urine culture more than 100,000 CFU/mL mixed growth of organisms with a predominant growth of an Escherichia coli. I am a bit lost where to go next as after six weeks of Cipro I still have the E.coli culture coming back as positive.","Doctor":"Hi. Please relax and do not worry. I went through all of your case history and reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It seems you are repeatedly suffering from urinary tract infection. It could be prostatitis also. You have taken many antibiotics previously, but any time when you finish the course of antibiotics, you should confirm the absence of infection by repeating the urine culture. So, at present, according to your reports, I suggest you the following. Consult your doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. If possible avoid sexual contact for this three weeks. You should repeat your urine culture after 24 days that is, three days after you finish the antibiotics course."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I just recently suffered a knee injury and had an MRI done I was just hoping the results could be translated to me. An acute anterior cruciate ligament injury is present with lateral compartment bone contusions. A full thickness tear is favored. A high-grade partial tear is possible but felt to be less likely. A very small subtle linear tear is suggested within the posterior horn of the medial meniscus with inferior articular surface extension. Extensive soft tissue swelling and edema from the patientâs injury. Grade II sprain of the fibular collateral ligament, biceps femoris and conjoint tendon portions of the lateral collateral ligament complex. There is grade I to II strain of the distal aspect of the vastus lateralis muscle.","Doctor":"Hi. Sir, all the findings which you have written shows that there is some injury to your knee and in turn body reactions. Usually, it is difficult to assess about ligaments in MRI of fresh trauma because of too much edema. So, basically, we rely on patients symptomatology and our clinical findings. It is advisable to get an MRI after six weeks of injury.  As far as your MRI findings are concerned, everything is fine. Only thing is your ACL (anterior cruciate ligament), which needs to be evaluated clinically. As of now, nothing to be done and take some painkillers and mobilize as per your pain. It would be helpful to me if you could tell about your symptoms like how long back you had an injury, are you able to walk, if yes then is there any instability or giving away sensation of the knee. Also, if you could describe the way you had injuries like twisting injury or direct hit."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am newly married, and we both are first timers. We tried penetration a lot of times, but the moment I come close to her, I lose the erection. Also, I am ejaculating within 20 seconds. I do not have any health issue and morning erection is positive.","Doctor":"Hi. You seem to be reporting of premature ejaculation. It is very common among this age group during the initial part of sex life. I will explain, try to engage more in foreplay during sex like for at least 20 minutes. During intercourse try to go very slow, when you feel that you are about to come, stop and slow down for a minute and then continue. By this way, you can prevent rapid release. You may need medicine temporarily. Use it when required like one hour before sex and maximum once per day. Kindly avoid heavy food before taking a tablet. There are no major side effects except a mild headache rarely. And, you should not be having any cardiac problems. Do a thyroid function test (TSH) to rule out thyroid disorders. I suggest tablet Tadalafil when needed, and the problem will gradually improve."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering from fever for the past three days. I am taking Amoxicillin and Paracetamol as prescribed by the doctor. The temperature reduces for some time. I have other symptoms too. I have a sore throat, pain in both the eyelids and pain in forehead.","Doctor":"Hi. Fever is a sign of infection or an inflammatory reaction taking place in the body. Infections like flu, or any viral infection, tonsillitis, or any bacterial infections can cause a high fever. Take a complete blood examination to rule out the disease. You may have a bacterial infection, viral infection, pyrexia of unknown origin. Take lots of warm oral fluids, and take proper rest. Take antipyretics like Brufen (Ibuprofen). Change antibiotics to a stronger one if the blood test shows bacterial infection or antiviral drugs if the test shows a viral infection. Take lots of fruits such as oranges and vegetables. Take vaccination annually in case of influenza infection."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male. I am 5 feet and 9 inches tall and weigh 255 pounds. When I eat spicyÂ food, I poop blood.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

If the agglutination percentage increases then this could prevent sperms in fertilizing the ovum. If the counts are normal and motility is good then there is no need to get worried. Some laboratories have started using staging for this agglutination. But having positive agglutination does not mean that semen sample has some serious issue."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have an average cycle length of 29 days with the longest being 31 days. I have never missed a period before and always got a brown discharge before my periods. I last had my periods 31 days back, then had protected sex once (with my partner wearing a condom) on the 14th day of the cycle. Today is my cycle and expected to have my periods but all I saw yesterday was a slight brown discharge on toilet paper in the morning and evening time with mild cramps (slight consistent backache from cycle day 30) with tender breasts, feeling a bit dizzy, bloated stomach, (pregnancy-related symptoms). I am on cycle day 31 and no periods yet. Could it be that I conceived after protected sex since it was my ovulation period or 14th day of the cycle? Can I go ahead and test for pregnancy? Kindly help me. I am currently 33 years old.","Doctor":"Hello. As you said that the sex was protected and that there was no condom misadventure, so chances of pregnancy are minimal and the symptoms are more of premenstrual rather than pregnancy. However, considering that both symptoms overlap, the best way to rule out any pregnancy would be to get a serum beta hCG test done as on date where if the hCG levels are less than 3mIU, then you are surely not pregnant and the symptoms are premenstrual."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My husband had an issue of multiple urination and high thirst. I checked his sugar, he is 30 years old. His random sugar was 419. I have gone through the various tests. I need a doctor to check the reports and suggest the instant treatment. His fasting is between 218 to 257.","Doctor":"Hi. I went through your husband's reports, plus from the information you provided. This is my advice. He will need a detailed examination and a few more tests to determine if he is type 1 or type 2 because he is very young. His glucose levels are critically high from my assessment and he needs to start immediate treatment with diet control, a medicine which will include a pill and a short-term insulin once daily until his sugar is under control. He is significantly overweight and will need to lose weight eventually with good diet control and exercise. Until he sees a doctor, the following is my advice. Diet restrictions: He should stop eating any sugar-containing item right away. No cold drinks, no fruit juices, soda, cakes, ice cream or sweets. Cut back on the portion of rice, potato, and bread in food. Medication: He can start medication (Pill)-Glucophage (Metformin) 500 mg, one tablet with breakfast and with dinner right away. When he sees a doctor they can choose to add Insulin or another medication. His cholestrol is very very high. He willl need treatment for that as well. Unless he starts to control his diet no medication can control his blood sugar."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Yesterday, my wife had bleeding for a minute after we had sex for the first time. What would be the reason for this problem?","Doctor":"Hi. I presume that your wife had bleeding through her vagina.If it is the first time that you both had sex, then you need not have to worry at all. This is due to the rupture of a thin membrane which covers the vaginal orifice (opening). This membrane is called the hymen membrane. This membrane is vascular enough to cause bleeding. But it remits on its own. For further clarifications, consult a gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 24 year old female. I am taking medicines for migraine (Sumatriptan).

Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father, age 67, while sleeping has shivers for a couple of seconds. This happens after an interval of 1 to 2 minutes.

It has produced muscular pain in my shin area as well. I assume from not being able to walk properly on that foot. I am flat-footed.","Doctor":"Hi. People with flat foot usually develop such a problem later in life and in addition, there is dysfunction of the posterior tibial tendon which adds to your problem. It would be really helpful if you can tell more details about your symptoms like is it more on walking, if yes then is it more on an even surface or uneven surface. For now, go for conservative management. Do intrinsic foot muscle exercises, hot fomentation, and painkillers on SOS basis. When your problem is increased beyond your tolerance and hampering your daily routine then diagnostic injection can be given in joints of foot one by one to look for the main culprit and then it can be surgically fused."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 11 weeks 2 days pregnant and as per my US report placenta is posterior, low lying, just covering the OS.

It is good that it is posterior placenta with previous two C-section. If it is anterior, then it is difficult to travel upward. Higher chances of an adherent placenta in the anterior placenta. You need serial monitoring by ultrasonography. Do at 19 to 20 weeks for baby anomalies, placental location and to rule out any adherent placenta. Again do ultrasonography at eight months for confirmation. Mostly placenta migrates upward as baby and uterus grow.

I have a pink raised bump on the chest and I have had it for a few months now. The picture makes it look bigger than it is. It is not that big. It used to be bigger and I cut it and it has not grown bigger since. I just wanted to see your opinion. I understand I might have to go see a dermatologist for testing but an opinion would be nice. I hope it is nothing serious. I do not have it anywhere else on my body. Also, I have something under my left breast. It looks like a big pimple or boil. I have had it over a week and it hurts only when I touch it. The skin has come off around the area.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your complaints and reviewed the attached photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The lesion on the chest seems to be either dermatofibroma or fibrous papule. Both are benign lesions that need to be removed surgically. The lesion on your breast looks like a resolving boil.

It shows a WBC count of 40,000, which has been checked twice now. His doctor wants to send him to see a specialist. He has had no recent infections. There is no change in his appetite and no weight loss. He feels fine. He has been on Neurontin for 3-5 months now for neuralgia and in researching it; it says it can cause an increase in WBC count. He had been on Tegretol for neuralgia before. Could this cause it? Of course, our main concern is, could it be leukemia?","Doctor":"Hi. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows: Yes, Neurontin - Gabapentin is known to cause high WBC (white blood cell) count. If there is no infection, then it is common to worry about leukemia when the WBC count is high. At present, the best idea is to get a peripheral blood smear report done. If there is no increased immature form like blasts, then it is a Neurontin side effect. If immature blasts present, then he will require further evaluation.The cause is probably Neurontin; however, get a peripheral smear to calm your mind.

Symptoms of STD depends on the disease a person is suffering from. Most common symptoms with which patients of STD present are: urethral discharge or vaginal discharge, genital ulcer, burning micturition, lymphadenopathy, blisters on the genital area or lips, rash on the skin. These are most commonly encountered symptoms. In case of suspicion, investigations are done depending on the presentation and tentative diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My husband's semen analysis result shows azoospermia. We done it twice and the result remains the same. What shall we do?","Doctor":"Hi. Azoospermia was confirmed by two reports. So, kindly have him examined by an andrologist. He has to be examined for secondary sexual features, testes size and presence of gas. His FSH levels (follicle-stimulating hormone) must be checked too. By doing these we would be able to differentiate whether he has an obstructive or non obstructive azoospermia. If testes size is normal and FSH levels are normal, then obstructive azoospermia is likely. In such a case, needle aspiration from epididymis or testes may have sperms and shall be used for ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been suffering from a fungal infection in the inner thighs for more than a month now. I used Terbinaforce tablets. For a month now, I am using only Sebifin cream. But I cannot see much improvement. Can you please suggest me any better treatment or medicine?","Doctor":"Hello. Fungal infections usually take two months to resolve completely provided you take proper dose of medicine for the prescribed duration. Terbinaforce (Terbinafine) is a good antifungal. Both tablets Terbinaforce and Sebifin (Terbinafine) cream have the same drug inside them. I suggest if you have taken Terbinaforce for one month then it is sufficient. I would suggest you switch to Seriva cream (Sertaconazole Topical), a newer antifungal. Apply this cream twice a day, in the morning after taking bath and in the night before going to bed. You also can use KZ soap (Ketoconazole). Use only for thigh area while taking bath. Use your regular soap for rest of the body. You can also use Abzorb Dusting Powder. Apply it to the thigh area after you apply Seriva cream. This will reduce sweating and friction. Along with that, I need you to follow few do's and don'ts.

Secondly, it improves with Flagyl or Imodium. So the possibilities are water-borne disease which is now in chronic phase or incomplete treatment. Or irritability of bowels which could be because of type A personality-related anxiety. I would suggest the following investigations: CBC (complete blood count), SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase), Widal, stool for routine microscopy and occult blood. Also, following medicines should be given one course. Ofloxacin 200 mg twice a day for five days, Ornidazole 400 mg twice a day for five days, Ivermectin 3 mg and Albendazole 400 mg once a day for three days, Capsule VSL#3 once a day for 10 days.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It is a self-limiting condition, usually seen as a reaction to viral infections, some oral medications can also precipitate Pityriasis rosea. It starts with the mother patch, which is the biggest patch that appears first. It presents with red round rash with scales at the edges; we call it collarette scales which is very classic of Pityriasis rosea. After the mother patch appears, daughter patches follow it. It will be seen on arms, neck, chest, back, and thighs. Each lesion will appear round to oval in shape, with scales at the edge. Sometimes, red bumps are also seen (papular Pityriasis rosea). The peak of rashes (maximum number of rashes) will be around the 4th week, and by the end of 6th to 8th week, rashes start subsiding. Fungal infections (tinea) are very itchy.

In scabies, rashes will be intensely itchy with red bumps over finger spaces, wrist, armpits, around the belly button and groin.

I understand that you had a surgery of the shoulder (I guess it is arthroscopic Bankart repair) recently. In any case, I would not restrict you from going to the occasion. However, I generally advise my patients not to lift the arm or rotate the arm outwards for a minimum of six weeks. These movements are likely to cause harm to your repair. Any activity that does not cause these movements is allowed. So, if you can make sure to avoid these, go ahead with the trip. But if you have a fear that you could move your arm or someone could disturb you, which is likely to happen in a crowded place, I would strongly advise you to use your sling.

Recently, during masturbation, I felt some pain on the back side of my neck and head. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Masturbating two to three times a week is healthy unless you get addicted to the habit. This kind of pain or sprain happens due to increased blood flow to your penile region and vasoconstriction along with it. It resolves spontaneously once the excitation is over.

I understand that everyone is a different case. But I am curious as to if this is something small or potentially something life changing. Following details are from my last draw, WBC count 15 on a 10 scale, MCV 77, MCH 24, RDW 16.2, neutrophils 10.1 and lymphs 3.8.","Doctor":"Hi. Based on your query and report (attachment removed to protect patient identity), my opinion is as follows: A rising WBC (white blood cell) count in the absence of any infection, however mild is sometimes worrisome and that is being at present felt by your doctor. Mild increase in neutrophil is present. I assume there is nothing abnormal in the peripheral smear. Peripheral smear is most important here to confirm the absence of any immature cells. Rising count sometimes signifies leukemia. However, in leukemia, the count is usually more than 100000 or less than 4000 on a 10000 scale. The absence of any immature cells virtually rules out any leukemia. Possible causes here could be stress; lipid abnormalities induced inflammation in blood vessels or liver (over weight) or mild infection somewhere, which is currently asymptomatic. Reduced MCV (mean corpuscular value) and MCH (mean corpuscular hemoglobin) indicate possibly early iron deficiency anemia. Iron studies can confirm or start of treatment with Ferrous Fumarate daily will help. If anemia is present with rising WBC count, a chronic inflammation cause will require evaluation. C-reactive protein levels and ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) can help in the evaluation of chronic inflammation if any.Do get a C-reactive protein, ESR study and iron studies done.

Then the other dentists suggested me these medicine Ordent, Seradic P, Pan-DSR). But also no permanent relief from toothache and headaches. What can be the problem and solution?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your query and understood your concern. Unfortunately, taking medicines is not a permanent solution to dental pain. There are several factors that cause dental pain and associated headache. The most common cause is tooth decay. However, a clear clinical picture or an x-ray will help determine what is causing your pain. When decay reaches the nerve of the tooth, it starts to give out symptoms. The nerve which supplies the tooth also supplies that side of the face. Hence the referred (associated) pain. Taking painkillers will help control the pain to some extent but it does nothing to cure the decay. It can only be manually treated by removing them. You may require an x-ray procedure to determine the extent of the decay and if the nerve of the tooth is involved, a root canal treatment is generally done to remove infections and decay. Since it is the time of the pandemic, dentists are providing emergency care only and some dentists prefer telephonic consultation prior to dental visit and treatment. If the pain is unbearable even after taking medicines, it is best to call up a dentist providing emergency care and get it treated.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

This week I have not enough sleep at night or even day and my arms are in pain. I cannot understand because sometimes my nose are clogged at the right, sometimes at the left and my neck hurts when I do my exercise as recommended by my chiropractor. I had my three adjustments last month which supposedly should be 36. It stopped due to the COVID pandemic and now I am at home but I cannot sleep well. It feels like my body is not straight. By the way, my pelvis is tilted to the right and also my spine but just a little bit. Can I ask some help or tips from you with regard to what can I do to at least ease the pain or sleep way better? Or a few stretches to at least help my body to slowly reposition to normal?","Doctor":"Hello. I read your concern. Yes, the position of cervical lordosis will affect your sleep if it is not properly supported. The tightness and pain could be due to irritated neck muscles. So support them, ice them up so that spasm gets reduced and neck feels better. As of now, I recommend you to maintain good posture and support your neck properly in everything you do like sitting and sleeping. Avoid postures that might aggravate the issue like texting a lot. Watching movies in an upward position, etc. Do not do exercises while in pain. Do icing and relax. Support will help you come out of the issue faster. First, sleep properly and things will automatically fall in place. Keep hydrating properly. Back and other issues could be due to faulty postures and irritable muscles. They will reduce once you do the above-mentioned things. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 4 years 9 months old. He is a healthy kid with normal weight (17 to 18 kg). But, he often gets a mouth ulcer. It is quite often like once in two months mainly in his buccal mucosa and inner corner of the lip which touches the primary canine. This hurts him and so he avoids food. I used to apply Dentogel on his ulcers. My question is, what is the reason for this repeated mouth ulcer? Is he deficient of any vitamin? Initially, I thought it could be a traumatic ulcer. But, it gets repeated once in two months. Sometimes, he gets three or four ulcers together. I am really worried. Please suggest what to do to avoid these ulcers.","Doctor":"Hello. Mouth ulcers in children of this age group are mainly due to vitamin and mineral deficiency. Sometimes worm infestation is also implicated in mouth ulcers. We will need to supplement the child with proper vitamin and minerals. Also, deworming should be done. CBC (complete blood count). 1.Syrup A to Z (multivitamin) 5 ml once daily for one month. 2.Tablet Limcee (chewable) (Vitamin C) one tablet daily for 15 days. 3.Syrup Bandy plus (Albendazole, Ivermectin) 10 ml single stat dose. Give home based nutritious diet. Avoid refined marketed products like the biscuit, chips, chocolates, cakes, etc."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had FET 15 days back. I did a test, and it is positive. I called my clinic, and the nurse was not definitely happy. She told to wait until blood test. I did ClearBlue dig, which shows me 2 to 3 weeks pregnant. Earlier it was 1 to 2 week, so it means hCG level probably is a bit higher by now. Should I worry about chemical pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? After a FET (frozen embryo transfer), blood is checked for pregnancy only after two weeks. Only a healthy embryo will stay on so long with a good beta hCG. Unhealthy pregnancy may give initial positive results but levels start to decline gradually and become negative. That is the reason your nurse is not happy. Also, any administration of hCG injections during these days (given for better implantation) will also give false positive results. I hope this is a healthy ongoing pregnancy and pray for that. Confirmation can be only after two weeks."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, This is my 6 weeks and 4-day pregnancy. My pregnancy is seen on UPT but not on ultrasound. My Hb level reads at 9672.7 miu/l. I have done a transvaginal ultrasound and it reads negative pregnancy. I am panicking now. What can I do?","Doctor":"Hi. Something is missing or not investigated or reported properly. Are you having some pain, bleeding, etc.? If beta hCG is 9672.7 miu/ml and seven weeks scan has no pregnancy-related findings, then it is indicated that there is something missing in the scan or in beta hCG. It is better to repeat beta hCG after 48 hours of above one to check how much it is increasing and have one scan with a senior specialist to check any intrauterine honey-comb appearance (suspected of abnormal conception and need detailed investigations) or any mass outside the uterus (alarming pregnancy outside uterus that needs emergency intervention). Check whether in both described cases, there is no healthy pregnancy seen or any developing pregnancy with irregular periods. In case of bleeding, pain, fainting, or dizziness, immediately rush to gynecology emergency. But still, you need to repeat beta hCG level and transvaginal scan to clear the situation. Do laboratory tests and discuss here or with a local gynecologist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, What can I do for really bad pain from broken teeth, and cavities that need root canals. I am going to a dentist but what can I do in the meantime?","Doctor":"Hi. Your chief complaint suggests broken tooth due to a carious activity which is brought by bacteria. The pain in the tooth is due to caries. 1.Lack of brushing habits. 2.Trying to break hard objects with teeth leading to break down. 3.Lack of mouth rinsing after taking food, drinks, and drugs. IOPAR. 1.Reversible pulpitis. 2.Acute periodontitis.

I am attaching my report along with this mail. Please look into this.","Doctor":"Hi. The sonography report shows mild swelling of both kidneys. This may be due to holding urine for sonography. It may also be due to infection, stone or some block in kidney tubes. You should get a repeat sonography of KUB (kidney, ureter, bladder) done with an empty bladder and also check for residual urine volume. Please also get a urine routine and creatinine test done.

In addition to this, the doctor told me that I had a UTI and gave me pills. Though UTI did not seem like it has gone away, and another thing is that, after I am done with antibiotics (for seven days) I am seeing white lines on my stool (sometimes), and sometimes those stools are giving a green color to the water even if there are no white lines. If I had stomach cancer or colon cancer, would my results improve with Iron supplements and B12 pills? In the last few days, I lost my appetite (for no reason) though I still can eat food, no vomiting, no blood in stools. I do not know if this is because of the stress since I saw my stool like that.","Doctor":"Hello. I have reviewed your query and here is my advise. Your attached report (attachment removed to protect patient identity) showing improvement in iron parameters and hemoglobin level. So your anemia is improving. Read below answers for your questions: In stomach cancer, if bleeding is mild then the result can improve with medicines. If cancer leads to more bleeding in stool then only it is difficult to improve results with supplements. Your attached stool image mostly is showing mucus in stool. Stress also can lead to such a presentation like loss of appetite, pain in the abdomen, etc., which is called functional bowel problem. So with yoga and meditation, you can get relief from stress. If needed, you can consult a psychiatrist for counseling. I suggest you investigate with stool routine micro examination and occult blood test for further work up in your case. You can be prescribed probiotic tablet and Rifaximin for your case. If no improvement, then colonoscopy can be planned."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am urinating too frequently, around 10 to 15 times a day. If I drink a coffee or glass of water I will have to urinate around three times in the following hour. I often feel a sense of urgency before urination, and I often only produce a very small amount of urine when I go. Sometimes during or after sexual intercourse, I experience some pain like a sense of pressure in my lower region. Sometimes during exercise (or if I am jumping), I experience a small amount of urine leakage. I have had these symptoms for around two years. I have recently been visiting a urologist to discuss these symptoms. I have seen the urologist four times. Each time I visit I give a urine specimen. During my first three visits, bacteria and a high count of white blood cells were found in my urine, which was subsequently treated with a number of different antibiotics. The antibiotic that cleared the bacteria is called Levofloxacin. I was told to try daily Kegel exercising to help with urine incontinence, which I am currently doing. When I visited the urologist again yesterday I had an even higher count of white blood cells and bacteria than my previous visits. He has again prescribed Levofloxacin and told me to come back in two weeks. He suggested me taking one of two possible medications to control frequent urination called: an anti-choline or B3 stimula. He explained these medications can be taken long-term for a year or two. I expressed concern that if the persistent infections are causing frequent urination I do not want to try a different medication to control this. I am very confused about what is causing my symptoms, is it a reoccurring UTI or something that needs long-term treatment from the other medications he suggested?","Doctor":"Hi. Recurrent UTI is very common among young and sexually active females. The above symptoms can definitely be caused be it UTI or overactive bladder (the one which you are referring for long-term medicines). If your urine report is showing pus cells as in your case then we need to treat UTI only first. It would be advised to get a urine culture and sensitivity test done to know the type of organism and drug sensitivity. Simultaneously, you should take B3 stimulant or anticholinergic to relieve your symptoms till UTI gets cleared. Once UTI gets cleared, you should reassess to stop anticholinergic."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My period is late by eight days, negative pregnancy test, cramps that lasted for about a week. I have been trying to conceive for the past six months. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Have serum beta hCG, blood pregnancy test immediately to know pregnancy status. If the pregnancy test comes positive then congratulations. If comes negative then it could be due to some hormonal imbalance, illness, sudden weight gain or weight loss, strict diet, strenuous exercise, illness, contraceptive, etc. You can have hormonal induction by having tablet Primolute N 10 mg twice daily for five days and can have a withdrawal bleed, (better to have a blood test on day two of periods, serum progesterone, serum testosterone, serum prolactin, insulin, FSH and LH, thyroid function test, etc.). Fertility issue should be treated in detail after proper unprotected sex for 1 to 2 years and then also if you fail to conceive. Have a healthy lifestyle, physical health, precautions, and try with positivity. Have folic acid daily 0.4 mg if you are not having any chronic health issue. Otherwise, you can have 5 mg daily. Do exercise and walk daily to have normal BMI and weight. Have a healthy, nutritious diet with less salt, sugar, spice,and oil. Have sex in the fertile period of the cycle. In case of irregular cycles, you can regulate cycle by having oral contraceptive pills for three cycles but know that these are contraceptive pills. You can not try in these three months if you are planning to take. It is to support your reproductive system to prepare for pregnancy and soon to have conception. One transvaginal scan as well is needed with blood hormonal tests. Quit recreational drug you and your partner are taking as these reduce fertility and increase chances of congenital anomalies."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I moved into an apartment four months back. Now that it is the end of summer we have had the AC off and the apartment feels very stuffy. To me, it has a smell to it not sure how to explain it. I know I am allergic to pets and dust, previously I know cats have lived here and there is carpet in the apartment and my allergies and the smell is worse in our bedroom. I walk in closet where there is no ventilation. Could it be a mold problem? I have a newborn. All I know is my allergies are horrible when the windows are closed.","Doctor":"Hi. Is there a way you can move the bedroom to a more ventilated area? Or the new born can be raised predominantly in the more ventilated area. In addition to molds and fungi, one should also vary of pollens. Pollens get dispersed with winds and can come inside the house through windows and can cause similar problems like molds. Just that molds and house dust mites (mites are found in carpets, curtains, upholstery, soft toys, etc.) are mostly perennial in causing allergies and pollens can be seasonal as well as perennial in doing so. You are right in suspecting mold in the less ventilated area. You can remove the carpets curtains in the bedroom and wash them in warm water if possible. You also get allergy free material from which curtains carpets and pillow covers can be stitched. If the baby starts showing symptoms of allergy, like sneezing, running nose, skin rashes, watering of eyes, you may need to find out what the baby is allergic to. Do revert back to me and I shall guide you further."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have taken Celebrex 200 mg per day, no help. Lyrica 300mg twice per day, did help with pain initially, now not effective.

And it is not the rule of life that you should get what you want or people with a similar hobby and habit will meet you every time, everywhere. We are the ones who make people alike and the important thing is we accept people with their mistake. Nobody is perfect. Try to make them a friend. If they are uninteresting, then you can make them interesting. It is not their ability, it is yours. The best way to defeat depression is to keep talking. Say everything in your mind so that your mind and heart feels light. You can start other activities also like gym, playing games or the activity you want to do. Keep yourself busy anytime and stop thinking on trivial issues. You say you are introvert. Most of us are introvert. Nobody wants to face anyone thinking that something bad might happen. Come out of that fear. What people will say, what they are thinking. It is your life, you can live it with your own rules. Social phobia is very common. Everyone has hesitation during a presentation. So, do not bother about that as you start presenting in your own way. It will subside. I am not prescribing any treatment because psychiatric medicines are not over the counter drugs.

However, our landlord does not want us to because her son is very allergic to dogs (he gets asthma attacks) and he possibly wants to move into the house one day.

Because of that, I was wondering if there are any things that we could do while living in the house with a dog and also after moving out to get rid of the allergens. We would literally do anything possible. Also, I was wondering how long it takes until the allergens are gone after the dog moves out of the house?","Doctor":"Hi. Animal dander can remain inside the house for long durations even after the animal has gone. It may stick to curtains, carpets, clothes, and furnishings. It may be impossible to completely remove the dander to make it entirely safe for an allergic person to live without issues. You may try asking the landlord if her son is allergic to cat dander or dog dander and in case it is the cat one, you may be able to bring in the dog. Allergy can be quite severe also, so you better take adequate care. While living in the house there are certain precautions you can take to keep allergens to a minimum. You could get all carpets, curtains, pillow covers, furnishings dusted and if possible rinsed in warm water (55 degrees celsius) after soaking for few hours. Wearing a mask by the allergy probe person can be helpful."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from fever since last five days.

I cannot improve my body even after going to a gym.","Doctor":"Hi. Nightfall is a very common phenomenon and almost more than 80 percent of men experience it in their lifetime. It is more common during adolescence period as the hormone level is higher at this point of time. There is nothing abnormal if you have nightfall and do not get disturbed by this. The frequency of your nightfall is a little bit higher but, it will be normal after a few episodes. Nightfall usually occurs during the rapid eye movement phase of sleep. It does not cause any health issues and it will not have negative consequences on your health, so do not get worried about it. Keep doing regular exercise and go to a gym regularly, your body will get improved definitely. Pain all over the body is common after you start going to exercise or gym and it will be there for a week. Take a bath before going to bed, it will reduce the frequency of nightfall.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months).

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

If I simply play or use a toy on my clit I do not feel good but if I grind on a thing and tense up, it does but sometimes gets too intense or the feel goes. I often finish with my clit pulsating and it feels very uncomfortable. Is this normal? What can I do to solve this?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand what you are going through. It is seen in females orgasm through the clitoris is much higher than through vaginal penetration because clitoris (clit) has a number of nerve endings which are very much sensitive just like a penis. There is nothing abnormal if you feel better with masturbation that too with clit rubbing. The lack of proper orgasm at times through clit rubbing may be due to your stress, your apprehension about the act, and your doubts in mind if you will be able to enjoy or not. I would advise you to relax your mind before act or masturbation. Take a few deep breaths. You can also start deep breathing exercises daily. It will definitely help you.

For the bleeding that came, it is because the I-pill can cause menses irregularities and may induce earlier menses. The bloating, nausea and mood swings may also be the side effects of the medication. For me, you are safe and to be sure 100 %, I recommend her a blood test for hCG."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was diagnosed with MGUS earlier this year.

Pre-Seed (Vitamin E, Chloride salts, etc.) lubricant that mimics fertile cervical fluids to support sperm on their journey. Unlike most other lubricants, Pre-Seed fertility-friendly lubricant is pH-balanced and isotonic, so sperm can swim freely. So it can be used. As you have been trying only since last two months, so I would like to comment that the chances of even natural conception with each cycle across the world are 30 to 35 %, so you need to be patient. Thirdly, the TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) levels of 5.2 are high and make you a hypothyroid which easily affects fertility (attachment removed to protect patient identity)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Kindly advise regarding glaucoma.

I have gone through what you have mentioned and through your test reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I can tell you that the appearance of your optic discs is deviated from normal, as per the given photos and image, your eye pressure is 20 mmHg. As per the calculations on your summary sheet (18 + 2 for corneal thickness) and there again are a few deviations from the normal on your visual fields reports. Based on these tests you have shared, it is hard to reach any conclusions or brand you as a glaucoma patient. You see glaucoma is a chronic progressive disease which sometimes needs follow up data of around three visits, around 3 to 6 months apart for an accurate diagnosis to be made and for the patients to be started on treatment. My advice to you is to meet a glaucoma specialist as per your doctors orders and follow up with him. Depending on your test results and progression of visual field defects your treatment will be monitored and titrated. Progression of such glaucoma cases will be quite variable and unpredictable, but I would consider you to be lucky and to have a good outcome as your disease (if diagnosed in the future) has been picked up sooner than after substantial damage."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have a question about gum bleaching. I was just wondering the price range of undergoing this process. My gums cause me no harm whatsoever, by the way, just appearance purposes.","Doctor":"Hello. You are talking about gum bleaching but I feel it is tooth bleaching and you have a problem with the esthetics of teeth. There can be several reasons for esthetics which are mainly due to discoloration due to stains from tea, drinks and syrups, drugs as used in asthma. It can be due to poor oral hygiene leading to calculus formation around teeth. Teeth in a particular region can also discolor to brownish tinge due to trauma in any part of life with teeth. Teeth can be naturally discolored from birth due to various reasons related to developmental disturbances and use of drugs like Tetracyclines. So as for your issue is concerned, you have esthetic concerns and you are interested in bleaching but before going for bleaching it is better to do a general examination with a dentist to find a probable cause. Bleaching is a costly procedure. You may not need that, instead, get scaling and polishing process which is comparatively cheap. You are requested to send an attachment photo of your teeth if possible. Nonvital teeth, stains and developmental disturbances. Stains, calculus, developmental disturbances, fluorosis. 1.Scaling and polishing. 2.Bleaching is the last option using chemicals to whiten teeth like Hydrogen peroxide. 1.Brushing daily. 2.Rinsing mouth after taking fluids like tea, coffee, drugs, and syrups."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, After 21 months since my HIV diagnosis and have been undetectable for 15 of those months, two months back I was switched from the effective Truvada or Tivicay regimen to Triumeq. The sole explanation was that STR was more convenient. I am yet to do labs with Triumeq, but I have three concerns at this point: 1. Was there any possibility of a viral rebound or a significant blip, 5 to 6 weeks into Triumeq use, due to a new combination of drugs? (I have 100 % adherence and take medicines always at the same time, +/- 2 hours) 2. Due to some intensive driving trips, on a few days in the last two months while already on Triumeq, I had a can or two of energy drink shortly (certainly less than two hours) after taking my medicines and without realizing it contained some magnesium (about 7 mg per can). Is this a significant enough amount to interfere with DTG absorption and thus efficacy? (The Triumeq guide instructs avoiding calcium or magnesium-containing antacids, but their quantities usually are much higher. In my case, this was less than in a medium size banana fruit). 3. While maintaining my UD status, how risky to my negative partner was the following episode during a sexual intercourse with me being in the receptive role? He briefly inserted his penis rather deep into my rectum without condom and instantly had a tear at the top of the penis where it connects with foreskin. He pulled out right away, but his wound was already bleeding rather profusely. Was he at high risk of HIV infection, despite my UD status?","Doctor":"Hi. 1. It is not at all advised to substitute regimen with another drug on your own choice based on convenience. The reason is group resistance. The substitute you made are used in vice versa condition, that is used in case of failure to switch to second-line medication. 2. Dolutegravir has interaction with antacids which contain calcium and magnesium salts and these interfere with absorption, but nothing harm in occasional use, as drug remains above therapeutic levels for more than 5 to 7 days.  3. Anal activity has a significantly high risk, as there will be no active defense cells and there is increased chances of mucosal tears which increases chances of HIV transmission. So, he is at risk of transmission."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, About four weeks ago, my right testicle started moving in an uncomfortable (not painful) way. I had a torsion and surgery to stitch down (both) 2.5 years ago. I went to the first doctor and he tried me on muscle relaxants, nothing changed so he referred me to a specialist. The specialist had a quick feel and then told me it was normal, that I should not worry and that I would have to get used to it. He also implied it has been happening since the operation and I just did not notice. There is still no pain, only discomfort (it varies) normally when I walk. I think that my right testicle is a tiny bit swollen and slightly squishier than my left and while I could live with this, I really do not want to. Though I have suffered no injuries to my testicles recently, I actually think that one of my stitches has come loose as I can feel the end on the stitch lump where I could not before. I am 88 kilos and have lost 12 kg over the last nine months. I have have been running more frequently for about eight weeks. I am 24 years old.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. From your symptoms, it could possibly be that you have a case of a repeat of your torsion which is usually not common after surgery or a case of testicular pain syndrome which can happen after surgery. Normally, a detailed clinical exam to identify any other causes like a hernia or varicocele or hydrocele post surgery is necessary. As you have mentioned that a clinical examination has been done and was found to be normal, I would suggest that you have a doppler scan to confirm that it is not a case of torsion or any other vascular problem like varicocele which is causing the pain. If the scan is normal, then you will have to wait and watch and have a good scrotal support in case of chronic orchialgia or testicular pain syndrome."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, What does high risk 1:50 trisomy 21 mean, at an age of 32 and 18 weeks pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hello. I totally understand your anxiety. But please do not panic. The risk for Trisomy 21 (or in other words Down's syndrome) mentioned is 1:50, which is above the general population risk of 1:250. In other words, if we take a general population, and consider any women in general, there is a risk that one in 250 women may have a baby who is affected with Down's syndrome. But in your case, the risk appears to be increased compared to the general population which needs to be evaluated further. This is a test that determines the risk, which means it is only a screening test and not a confirmatory test. Meaning, the baby may or may not be affected by Down's but the risk appears to be high compared to the normal population. It would have been helpful if you had the shared few more details like your period of gestation of your pregnancy, when and at what gestation was the test taken, and any previous scan reports in the first trimester you have done. Kindly share the reports to guide you better. And, also provide details if you had any previous pregnancy, or miscarriages, etc. Now coming to confirming this, for definitive and accurate methods, it includes amniocentesis with karyotyping and FISH test, which are little expensive tests and not done in all individuals except those with high risk for Down's syndrome. For this test to be done, the water around the baby inside the uterus is taken in a small amount which contains the shed cells of the baby and are cultured so as to do the chromosomal analysis of the cells. This is an invasive test as it comes with the risk of 0.2-1% risk of miscarriage as we are putting a needle inside the uterus. Another recently introduced test which almost as closely accurate to this is NIPT (noninvasive prenatal test), which is again a screening test but highly accurate and involves only testing your blood for fetal cell-free DNA and then they are analyzed for the same. You can consult a fetal medicine expert or your gynecologist for further information on these and necessary timely action. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant?

About five months ago, I started doing more things again, mainly little things like going out to hang out with my horses, and going to a therapist for a bit. Then around two or three months ago, I decided to go to a fitness trainer to get myself even more fit for my horse riding. I have been held back quite a bit by an issue, what tends to happen is normally when I do something strenuous (but it also happens when temperature switches or the air just becomes more humid) I will start feeling my heart rate become quite rapid and heavy feeling, then I feel dizzy (my head feels really weird) and I will quite quickly feel sick and have to throw up or at least dry-retch. The doctor thought it might be something to do with my thyroid glands so took a full blood test, everything looked normal, my trainer thought it might be anxiety but it has happened at times where I am at my calmest, and my parents thought it might be because I am unfit, but after doing training and my fitness is pretty much back up to where it was before my break, it is still happening and has not improved at all. I have always done sports for most of my life before the break, the main two being athletics and horse ridings (though I only do horse riding now as well as fitness training).","Doctor":"Hi.

My first sonography was taken during my fourth week of pregnancy which showed that I have a septate uterus. During my eighth week, there was some bleeding observed in my vagina. On my gynecologist suggestion, I had another sonography which showed that everything was normal. Post that my doctor put me on bedrest for four weeks. I also had NT scan and dual marker blood test during my 12th week whose reports were normal. The doctor has recommended me to have a uterus stitched at 14 to 16 weeks. Please guide me as to what precautions should I take with respect to food and lifestyle? Since I have a successful architectural practice, I am under stress to complete the work on the given deadline. There has been a month backlog in work which may cause me severe financial issues. Is it advisable to return back to work with all the above complications? If yes, what precautions can I take?","Doctor":"Hello. With working job and pregnancy, it is a difficult task. First being pregnant you need to relax. Do not stress out. Stress even mental stress has ill effects on pregnancy. Also, your weight is on the higher side.

I have been spending time on my laptop or phone for more than 10 hours a day and sometimes, I watch the screens in the dark. I slept for 12 hours and still seem to have the shadow area. It disappears if I look directly at it. Please tell me what to do.","Doctor":"Hello. Using a computer for a long time causes dry eye syndrome due to decreased blink rate. Take frequent breaks and look at far objects as the eyes are strained looking at close object for a long time. Keep the brightness of the system to minimal. Use tear drops twice a day along with antiglare glasses. About the peripheral shadows, there is a jelly-like substance in the eye called vitreous and as age progresses it starts to liquify and you start seeing floaters. You should go to an ophthalmologist immediately in case if there is an increase in the number of these floaters or if you are seeing flashes of light. Because these are the signs of retinal detachment. Get your retina checked once the lockdown is over."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, A brown color dot along with a white color substance is floating in my left eye. What to do?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through what you have mentioned, these dots are called floaters in medical terminology. I can tell you that such a problem arises due to a cause mostly in the back portion of the eye (vitreous or retina). This requires a dilated retinal examination by an ophthalmologist. A single floater which has been present for at least 6 months to a year has no major implications and is nothing to be worried about. I advise you to see the ophthalmologist urgently in case of the following:  Multiple floaters or sensation of flashing lights or blurred vision in either eye. Floaters appeared after being hit in the eye, pain, redness in either eye. If you are a diabetic or on anticoagulant treatment or suffer from blood clotting or blood vessel or autoimmune diseases."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have a low fever with a weakness for past one month. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, I would like to assure you that you do not have to worry about the issue. Having a low fever for a long duration with weakness is a sign of viral fever which is typical during seasonal changes and monsoon. As for the report (attachment removed to protect patient identity), since your blood report is normal you do not have to worry at all.  As of now, you need to make sure you eat a healthy diet and do not skip meals, as it is very essential to have adequate immunity. Take tablet Dolo 650 (Paracetamol) only in case you feel a rise in fever, otherwise, you can skip it. Have a lot of water at least 10 glasses per day. Take Vitamin C chewable tablets 500 mg twice daily for a month. Do follow the above advice and you will be good to go. Be happy, healthy, and have a nice day."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had LASIK eye surgery one week ago. After stopping my prescribed eye drops, I noticed my vision in my right eye is blurry.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand that you had LASIK done a week ago. The drops prescribed after the surgery usually include a tear supplement or lubricant along with antibiotics and steroids. The antibiotics and steroids help with the healing process. The tear supplements are to maintain the normal level of tear secretion found in the eye, this is because, during the surgery, the nerves helping natural tear production would have been severed resulting in dry eye. Hence, in most countries, the tear supplements are continued for around a month or two. The cornea also takes around 2 to 3 months for complete healing and remodeling after surgery, so do not worry about temporary changes in vision. My advice to you is please go through your post operative drugs chart again and see if you still need to continue your postoperative medication. Given that you have only around two days until the review, you can safely use your drops with the recommended dosage without the risk of any major side effects. You should consider meeting your ophthalmologist sooner in case of redness or severe foreign body sensation or discharge which makes your eye stick together in the morning or frank pain in the eye."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am a 31-year-old male (165 cm height and 101 kg weight). I had panic attacks and permanent tension headache for the past six years (pressure on the head), unbalance, dizziness, anxiety, worrying about the future, mood swings, and chest pressure. Then my psychiatrist diagnosed me with OCD and panic attack. So, he put me on Seroxat and Lexotanil for seven years which made a huge positive impact (all the symptoms were gone approximately, but the only side effects were that I became less energetic and gained weight). Now my new doctor is telling me it is too much to take high doses (Lexotanil 3 mg three times a day) and Seroxat (20 mg three times a day) and it has been too long on them. So he wants to cut off Seroxat and Lexotanil and put me on Wellbutrin XL.So I have decreased the dosage of Seroxat gradually for 10 mg a day which caused withdrawal symptoms but now (after two weeks), it is better but I did not decrease the Lexotanil because I felt I cannot. But now the doctor said to start with Wellbutrin. He wants me to take Wellbutrin XL 150 mg the first day without Seroxat, the next day Seroxat 10 mg without Wellbutrin, (a day on day off) like that for two weeks. Then to stop Seroxat permanently and stay on Wellbutrin 150 mg daily. He preferred to decrease Lexotanil as much as I can but he wrote on the prescription 1.5 mg three times a day with the Wellbutrin XL.My questions are is there any interaction or any problem between Wellbutrin XL and Lexotanil if I take 3 mg Lexotanil three times a day with the Wellbutrin XL 150 mg? Is there any interaction between Seroxat and Wellbutrin if I took them a day on day off (as I described before)? Is the Wellbutrin XL effective for my case as my previous medication (Seroxat and Lexotanil) or not? I have started the first day of Wellbutrin XL 150 mg and I took with it, in the morning, 3 mg Lexotanil, then at the noon and night I took 1.5 mg Lexotanil, but I was surprised before sleeping at night I had a laughter attack with no reason. Is it normal?","Doctor":"Hello. You only want to change the drug because of feeling less energetic and for weight gain. The more important thing is that if your symptoms are under control with Seroxat (Paroxetine) 20 mg thrice daily and you have no problem other than these two symptoms as you have described, then you can continue Seroxat. For weight gain, you should start physical activity and lifestyle modification. Seroxat increases the toxicity of Wellbutrin XL (Bupropion) and can precipitate the seizure. So, if you want to switch, discontinue the drug or one day drug free method is also useful. Laxotanil is a drug of sedative category so you feel lethargic. If you stop abruptly, it creates rebound anxiety symptoms and withdrawal effects. So, reduce the dose gradually to discontinue it or set onto minimum dose. It has no as such interaction with Wellbutrin XL. Wellbutrin XL also has an effect on panic disorder but data is less than Seroxat and it also has good anti anxiety property. And for your laughter attacks, Benzodiazepines like Laxotanil may be responsible because they produce a euphoric effect."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was diagnosed with diabetes at age 22. When I was first diagnosed, I was taking pills which never worked. So, after a while, I started taking Insulin and have been since. I am taking five shots a day including rapid and long-acting Insulin. I was wondering if I would be type 1 or type 2 diabetic.","Doctor":"Hi. You can be either type 1 diabetic or LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes of the adult) which behaves exactly like type 1. That is why pills worked for you first and then you ended up on Insulin. Either way, you will surely need Insulin to survive. I can recommend some tests to confirm your type and I can help plan your treatment according to your weight and some nutrition counseling that will help control your blood sugar nicely."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I stayed in the hospital for three days where I was given intravenous iron treatment, three bottles. I had regular periods after that for a year or less.

I will be very grateful if you suggest me something to get better. My ultrasound results do not have any problem.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand you are deeply troubled by your menstrual cycles. Heavy and frequent bleeding as you suggested will cause anemia and weakness and needs to be treated. On the other hand, if periods are infrequent and less flow, you can treat it without medications too. In your case, your BMI (body mass index) is very low which is not healthy at all. First, you need to eat healthily. Include lots of proteins and lots of iron-rich foods in your diet. Secondly, the cause of this bleeding is a hormonal imbalance which usually gets better as you move on to your 20s. Meanwhile, you will have to take hormonal tablets regularly for at least one to two years at a go without changing the medications.

Treatment modalities are cryotherapy which you are undergoing, electrocautery removal procedure depends on the size of wart and depth. If the wart is big, it will leave a big open wound that may take months to heal. Topical application of Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) 100 %, needs more session similar to cryotherapy.

As your chief complaint suggests that you started slight pain or tingling after two days of extraction, it can be due to trauma during extraction, exposure of bone by not suturing it, if needed, psychological feeling of pain due to fear of getting dry socket, may be presence of small root tip or bony spicule behind.

And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

As a result of taking the pills, I have noticed a huge change in my body, I have gained weight particularly around my knees and thighs and stomach which I am unable to lose. I have also noticed the veins in my legs appear much bigger and closer to my skin, and feel some pressure in the bottom of my legs. I stopped taking Yasminelle about two months ago and there is still absolutely no improvement in these symptoms. What should I do? Is this normal? Will I lose the weight and will my symptoms go and if so how long will it take? I am extremely worried.","Doctor":"Hi. It is better to have a concern about newly appeared symptoms and better to search solution as well. Contraceptives are hormones and give side effects short and long term. That is why it is better to discuss one's personal health history and contraceptive suitability with your treating Gynecologist and will be able to avoid the side effects. Although you need one physician consultation as well, you also need to discuss your medical history in detail. Combined oral contraceptive can give you or increases risk of venous thromboembolism. Weight gain could be the result of progesterone intake as well but if body tends to become fat also, there it complicates drugs or hormonal side effects as well as attract complications. Normal BMI and weight help to have better life quality. Try to have daily exercise, walk, and yoga. Have a healthy diet, less salt, sugar, oil, and spice. Take plenty of water daily.

If the lesion is white and painful, it can be the aphthous ulcer or canker sore. If there is no visible lesion as you said, the pain may be because of any dental infection. If the pain will be tooth related, your tooth may be tender if you press on it.  As your question is not clear about the area, whether it is swollen or not, how many days you feel it, I am unable to guide you in detail. Please reframe your query so that I may provide you better opinion. If you think the pain has infectious symptoms like swelling, interference with sleep cycle, fever, you need to take antibiotics like Augmentin 625 (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) twice daily for five days.

There is little to no hearing loss after a full night. However, I often have to swallow to pop my ear.

The common reason being the clots in the leg called as deep venous thrombosis. It can be due to long-term immobility, and prolonged surgery. When there are no clots in the body, we have to check for any deficiency in blood clotting factors. When doing all the investigations, we cannot be able to find the cause for 40 % of patients.

I called her all the night and tried to calm her down and tell her that I am okay and everything is fine but she could not stop herself from crying and she told me that she feels guilty because she was not able to do a thing while we were in the hospital.

I thought it is just a matter of days till she forgets the whole thing but yesterday they called me and told me that she has lost consciousness while working. I went to her and she told me she felt like choking and her heart beats rate were so high and she felt cold. The doctor told her that she is fine and she may be so stressed and would have had a panic attack and this could have lead to such behavior. I told her that we need to go to a psychologist but as expected she refused and she told me that she can handle but I need to be around all the time whenever she calls or looks for me.

No new exposure, same partner for over a year and neither have strayed. 20 days ago I got up with some redness and uncomfortable feeling on left side of vulva. I have an anxiety disorder and super high stress level right now. For some reason, I decided this was herpes and started looking at myself with a mirror and flashlight. Never really saw anything. I have been obsessed ever since. Tingling and numbness in buttocks and down backs of thighs off and on for 20 days. Uncomfortable but not red in vulva area. No signs of herpes. Went to a gynecologist, she did a pelvic scan and said no signs of herpes in or out. I still cannot stop thinking about whether they missed something. I also went to my chiropractor who did an adjustment and said lower back can cause tingling and numbness even in the genital region. Yesterday a little red pimple looking bump popped out on my inner thigh. I decided it must be the sore that never came out before. It does not hurt or itch but I am obsessed with it now. It is smaller today. Question is that does prodrome last 20 days (tingling numb butt area) and can one sore pop out after 19 days? The gynecologist I saw said I need to be treating my anxiety again and to get back on the Zoloft I took for two years for that.","Doctor":"Hi. Herpes has many myths asssociated with it. No, it is unusual to get a blister after 19 to 20 days like this. Blister may be due to some other skin disease or any other reason. It does not seem to be the prodrome symptoms which you felt for so many days and I am pretty much sure about that. Still worried, you may go for a PCR for herpes blood test and you may consult me back with the reports of the test. Secondly, if this blister or sore does not heal up in a couple of days, increases in size or number, you should go to a physician for taking a sample of this sore (few cells will be taken on a swab) and send it to the laboratory for herpes testing. The final suggestion is that relax and do not worry much."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

It was not more than 10 seconds before I found out, no ejaculation happened and I had no open sores on my penis or any other cuts, yet still I found a tiny amount of blood on the condom, I cannot think of any reason for the blood except that it could have been her menstrual blood (just the beginning of it). I am of a good general health, smoker and have never been diagnosed with any STD or any serious disease. I have asked her if this was the first time for her to have a condom failure incident and she answered yes, she even had a general blood test for a full checkup and she was in good health as well as the HIV blood test two years ago. My questions are as follows:1. I have read somewhere on the internet that the risk of transmission from a single encounter of unprotected vaginal sex is 0.065 %, meaning that 99.935 % do not get HIV, is that true?2. Do you recommend I get tested for HIV? I am thinking of getting a PCR test to check myself, how long should I wait before getting tested (PCR) and how accurate and reliable is that test?3. Do you recommend that I go for the PCR test or should I go for the fourth generation test and how long should I wait as well before the result is conclusive?4.

Yes, the chances of HIV transmission by single unprotected intercourse is much less than 1 % (1/200 to 1/1000). The chances of HIV transmission is slightly higher during menstruation.

You can go for this test to allay your anxiety."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My fiance and I were fooling around yesterday and I had semen smeared all over my vagina. He was not wearing a condom. We did not have penetrative sex. However, after the encounter, I got nervous and got emergency pills. All this happened about 14 days after my last period. I assumed I was highly fertile and was at risk for pregnancy. P2, I took one about three hours after my vagina was smeared with semen. I took the next pill 12 hours after the first. Here are my questions: 1. I really do not want a pregnancy right now. Is it wise if I take a second dose of the pill to completely reduce chances of implantation? Is it safe to take a higher dose of pills to completely eradicate any possibility of pregnancy? 2. What else can I do to make sure I am completely out of the woods? 3. Also, after seven days, is it okay for me to start taking antibiotics to eradicate any infections passed? Can general antibiotics like Amoxil treat the treatable STI? 4. When is the most prudent time to take an HIV test? 5. How effective is P2 when taken during ovulation? I did a little research and some said that P2 will not help if it is taken during ovulation. 6. How can I (in case I get pregnant) make the uterus inhospitable for the growth of the embryo? 7. When should I take a pregnancy test? 8. What is the safest mode of getting rid of a fertilised egg within the first few weeks? 9. My period should be in two weeks or 15 days from now. Is it guarantee that if it delays I am pregnant? Is it also possible for me to have my period yet still be pregnant? 10. Lastly, what are the chances in terms of percentage that I might be pregnant without necessarily having penetrative intercourse?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? That is a lot of questions, but all leading to the same answer. An emergency pill is high dose Progesterone, best taken within three days of sex. Best results if taken within 24 hours of sex. Being a high dose Progesterone, the uterine lining becomes very unfavorable for a possible embryo implantation. The lining suddenly becomes very thick. As it is a single dose, the lining cannot stand on its own and it falls off. But you rightly said success depends on which phase of the cycle you took it. If ovulation had just occurred that day, still there are equal chances of pregnancy and miscarriage. About the questions: 1. You should have the second dose. It will improve chance of embryo not getting implanted. 2. Only after you reach the other end you can confirm that you are out of the woods. You will have to wait for the period. 3. You can have antibiotics anyday, Azithromycin, Doxycycline would be a better choice. 4. HIV can be tested any time now and after six months repeated. 5 and 6 already answered. 7. The pregnancy test can be done earliest one day after the expected period. 8. If positive, you will need a scan to confirm intrauterine pregnancy after two weeks, then MTP (medical termination of pregnancy) can be used. 9. Emergency pill disturbs the hormones, so only the pregnancy test will give you some information. 10. Sperms can swim up even from your thighs into the vagina, so the chance of pregnancy is still there."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have itching, red scars, acne-prone, oily skin.

I recently came across a study that stated the AUC and half-life of Valium are increased by 130 % with a dose of 40 mg Omeprazole. As I am taking double the dose of Omeprazole, I am afraid that it has raised my plasma level. I am concerned about the concurrent use of other drugs (opioids) that can help me. I need to talk to an anesthesiologist before my surgery. Is this dangerous, or are there any other alternative sedatives to opiates that would interact less with my Valium dose? Is there any increased concentration in my body? This is my first major surgery, and I am terrified. I am taking Aspirin 81 mg and Crestor 10 mg.

Some surgeons while operating on the pilonidal sinus, keep the surgical area open in order to heal with granulation tissue. Some surgeons decide to close the wound. In your case, it seems like the wound has been left open. If there has been mild bleeding, you can just clean the area with Betadine solution two to three times daily, and apply T-Bact ointment. This will help in faster healing. If there has been severe bleeding you can take tablet Tranostat (Tranexamic acid) twice daily for three days. This will control the bleeding.

I took medicine for stone then USG came normal. Then for an intestinal infection, the doctor said I have a psychiatric problem. No tests needed. Then I took too much stress that from where I will buy food or get water fee and electric fee. Then after abdomen, I felt the problem with my one side of the brain. I feel in my brain two wires are connecting, just like covers in my one side of the brain just like rounding something. Then I went to the psychiatrist. I took medicine for two years, rounding like covers like go away but today I feel something in my one side of the brain and in abdomen 24 hours though.Please give me suggestion if medicines are right for me and how long I have to take it. My father also took medicine for psychiatric issues, but his problem was different and he died 6 years ago. He used to talk lonely and also loudly and sometimes in anger. Aunt also takes medicines. She goes away from home, talks more and different. Grandmother also takes but for short time.","Doctor":"Hello. As you have described, no doubt your problem is psychiatric and family history related to psychiatric illness are also there. So, there is a possibility of that. Your mind is continuously sending a message to your body that you have a problem in the brain or in the abdomen. These continuous thought is causing troubles in your daily life. This is the body-mind relationship that helps us to understand our body. If you willtry to stop the wrong message sending by your mind, it will be helpful. You are young and if you do not take measure for it now, it will create a problem for you life-long. It is simple but takes time but it is good that you understand the problem so that you can easily handle the situation. To stop these thoughts, you have to try stop technique in which if your mind continuously sending these wrong messages, you have to stop them by telling that no, these are wrong. I do not have any problems and my brain and body are healthy. Continue Clomipramine as Clonil 50 and follow as advised. You will feel better. Preoccupied with the body. Somatoform disorder. It is useful to make urself busy and increase recreational activities. Start regular exercises."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 21 year old male, and I have pain in the ear from today afternoon.

He applied fluoride varnish paste on my teeth saying that the cavities are very small. But my teeth are still paining. What to do?","Doctor":"Hello. Dental varnish contains fluoride which is anticarious and hence prevents the progression of tooth decay. Pit caries are very minute and very minimal cavities that are superficially present on the teeth. Pit caries does not require fillings because to do the filling, a little bit of normal tooth structure has to be drilled. So, varnish is preferable in very small cavities like yours. Rarely, small pit caries seen clinically might have progressed deeply (in a triangular pattern with apex seen outside but broad base deep inside the tooth). Yours might be of this type and hence causing pain."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My eye had a viral infection but the doctor gave me Vigadexa, Flur, and Ara drops and infection has been under control after 10 days of medications.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Your cholesterol level is slightly on the high side and part of your cholesterol panel triglycerides is high 214. Advise: Diet control and starch control is very important.

Your lead level is high. Avoid cooking in pots and pans that can contain lead or avoid using any utensils that have lead in it. This has an impact on your blood cells. 4.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

After that, I had a very bad bitter or metallic taste in my mouth when I eat or drink along with a stinging sensation on my tongue. I also had sensitivity in my teeth.

The scaling was extremely uncomfortable. I had a bad taste in my mouth after scaling. But, it got worsened later in the evening when I tried to eat. Could this procedure have caused some nerve damage? Please help me. The next day, I also had a headache and felt nauseous after scaling. The bad taste, stinging sensation of the tongue and tooth sensitivity has got worsened badly. I have never experienced these problems after a scaling and a dental examination. I do not have any amalgam fillings. I have a history of sinus infections and TMJ pain.","Doctor":"Hi. Because of the irritation and vibrations of the ultrasonic scalers, sometimes, the salivary glands become hyperactive and secrete bicarbonate to counteract any acidic ion present in the mouth. Till now, you will be apprehensive. You can feel it. Do not get panic. Nerve damages never happen with scaling. In case, if you are taking fruits or drinks during the night, avoid it for two to three days.

Answering the questions. Bleach is a disinfectant. So it kills the germs. So germs will not usually spread. But be careful of spores. Next while cleaning the toilet, I suggest you clean your hands after completing the entire process of cleaning. Not required between each step. Thoroughly cleaning your hands will help. Before sex, shower keeps you clean and helps your partner to avoid infection as some commensals can be present in your skin and genital tract.

The main cause can be the one you mentioned, your half-erupted tooth. I suggest you get it removed and make sure you eat from both the sides.

It can be a migraine headache as throbbing in nature and one side with nausea. You can be prescribed Naproxen or Ibuprofen for relief from an acute headache. If it cannot relieve a headache, then Rizatriptan can be prescribed. If a recurrent headache occurs, then prophylactic treatment with Amitryptiline might be needed.  Avoid aggravating factors for a headache like stress, smoking, lack of sleep, hypoglycemia, loud noise, bright light, etc. It is advisable to check your blood pressure as well. I suggest you consult a physician for examination and get prescription accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 22 years old female, currently preparing for some competitive exam. I am having a feeling of like nothing is good and this sometimes leads me to not study for the whole day and moreover, I am lacking the feeling of complete happiness, joy, or to feel sadness completely, and also I now have stopped going to meet my old friends much. Also, these behavioral problems were observed when I was giving my premedical entrance exam five years back. Then also I used to stop studying for days and even after having the guilt of not studying could not study for long. So, I just want to know that am I having any problem or is everything fine. And am I bothering too much? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. You are overworked or overstressed. Take some vacation. I can understand about exam preparation but sometimes we need some break in our life. Due to continuous exposure, we get bored and then it is difficult to concentrate on work or study. Make a schedule. Do not just keep reading. Take daily enough sleep, at least 7 to 8 hours, eat healthy good home cooked food, avoid junk foods, do daily exercise for 30 to 45 minutes, do daily meditation, eat fruits and vegetables, spend time with friends and family, spend time for your creative hobbies like writing, painting, learn some new like musical instruments or language, etc. Laugh as much as you can.

When I breathe in, it feels cold like the air went in my tooth. It just does not seem or feel normal. Also, on my upper front tooth, I have some kind of deep line. Example like when you make a line in the sand and it flows into the line but it still stays. It is hard to explain. Is there any way I can fix this without going to the dentist? And yes, I do brush my teeth daily.","Doctor":"Hi. As per your history, you are having class 5 dental cavity in the lower tooth. You need to do filling (restoration) of the tooth as soon as possible. If you do not take measures at this time you may need RCT (root canal treatment) which will be 10 to 20 expensive and not as successful as filling. On your upper tooth, the line I understand is the gingival recession with abrasion, if you are right handed it must be on the left side or the side you keep your teeth brushing continuously. For this, you only need to use an ultrasoft toothbrush and check the video for modified Bass technique for tooth brushing. Also brush your teeth twice daily and keep the brush time of two to three minutes only.

A little bit more information will help in making the right diagnosis. May I know when you had your first periods? Have you lost or gained weight recently? Any change in lifestyle or stress recently? Are you having any pimples, hair growth in face, chin, etc? All the above reasons can contribute to irregular periods.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The heart works on electrical signals/impulses that are sent through a pathway. This finally reaches the side/part of the heart that produces the heartbeat. This pathway is complicated. And when there is any abnormality along this pathway, it can result in a condition called bundle branch block. In this condition, there is a delay in the delivery of this impulse to that region of the heart (right or left), thus resulting in a delayed heartbeat. Bundle branch block (BBB) is not treated directly as it usually does not require treatment. But once observed, an elaborate evaluation has to be conducted to find the exact cause. This cause has to be treated once found."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 19 years old and all of my teeth are baby/milk teeth.

I am currently using Benzoyl peroxide.","Doctor":"Hi. I went through your photograph and found that you are suffering from nodular cystic acne with scarring. It is a severe type of acne. Acne is common at a young age. It occurs due to blockage and inflammation of sebaceous glands under the influence of androgen hormone. They also occur due to cosmetics. Diet has a little role and generally, they subside in mid-twenties. They need treatment to avoid scarring which may be permanent. If you have increased hair growth and menses irregularity you have to rule out PCOD (polycystic ovary disease). You can take capsule Isotretinoin 20 mg once daily with meals for four weeks, Clindamycin gel twice daily over the pimples, Salicylic acid face wash once daily, only for 30seconds, and tablet Azithromycin 500 mg once daily on empty stomach for one week and three on consecutive days per week for three weeks. If you want to use sunscreen. Review after four weeks. Scarring or pores left after healing can be treated surgically by needling, microderma abrasion, or by laser only after remission. Hormonal. Lipid profile if history of cholesterol disorder in the family. Acne nodulocystic. For three to four months as per the response. Do not touch the face too often. Do not use oil or greasy cream over the face or scalp. Take ample amount of fluids. If there is intolerant dryness with this, use Petrolatum or Vaseline on lips. Dryness generally subside within one week."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 50 years old male. I have middle back pain for the past eight years. It is usually in the middle right back between the shoulder blades. I have this pain when I stand for an extended period. Recently, I felt the pain radiating from my back into my chest. I think that I have a knot between my shoulder blades. It seems to get worse as the day progresses with stress and anxiety. After a recent treadmill run, I noticed a knot like a pain in my upper right back. It is accompanied by an urge to cough. Other new symptoms include throat clearing and occasional breathlessness on humid days. But all the pain gets relieved with rest and sleep. But it is worse throughout the day. My recent blood report showed WBC with 3800 per microliter, RBC with 5.06 million mcL, my hemoglobin is 154 g/dL, hematocrit showing 45 %, platelets with 145,000 platelets per microliter of blood. My EKG, echocardiogram, stress test and abdominal ultrasound were all normal. Ultrasound showed a fatty liver. My doctor advised me to do a chest X-ray. They found a small lesion on my left lung at the rib one area. He said it is nothing and recommended for a CT scan. I am living with full of anxiety. I read somewhere that 60 percent of lesions in men are cancer. Surely, I am not asking for a diagnosis. Can a small lesion have such ability to cause so much pain and discomfort? Is it possible to have advanced lung cancer? But my lungs look clear on the rest of the X-ray image. Is there anything else in the blood work or any other tests showing the possibility of cancer? I have no cough, wheezing, fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, and unexplained sweats.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your symptoms are not suggestive of cancer. It is a spinal cause which is causing the symptoms (spondylosis). The points which favor for the spinal cause is the long duration of symptoms, your sitting job, worsening as the day progresses, knot-like feeling and radiation to the chest (due to nerve compression). Malignancy will not stay for an extended period without causing any symptoms, and prolonged survival is not possible. With the absence of symptoms, it is too premature to consider it as malignancy. Usually, most of the lesions found incidentally on the chest X-ray are benign as they may indicate a fibrotic lesion of the old healed infection either clinical or subclinical. Also, your doctor has already seen it, and it reduces the chances of having a malignancy in you as they will have some features. So overall, the possibilities for malignancy are very less, and these symptoms are not correlating to it."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have big issues with getting cavities.

Brush your teeth twice daily using an ultrasoft toothbrush. You also need to get your blood pressure checked twice daily for three days. Most of the times the bleeding is because of blood pressure or diabetes which dentists miss some time. If it is intermittent and occurs every three to four months, it can be infection related.

While feeling my scrotum, I noticed that the left testicle has grown and is hard since the operation. Maybe two inches long by 1.5 inches wide. It is not painful to touch. I have had no fever or vomiting. I am on anti-inflammatory, antibiotics, and Endone. I am not sure about testicle whether it is edema, orchitis or something else. I am wondering what my next step should be?","Doctor":"Hello. Considering the absence of symptoms like fever, tenderness, and pain on touching, we can be certain that there is no inflammatory process going on. Likely cause for your pain can be altered anatomical orientation of structures which are causing stretch of skin and compression of testicles. This is probably the cause of pain. This should settle with time as you gradually resume your activities. However, next appropriate step is to get it examined by a doctor and confirm the cause of pain. If something is there on examination, then you may need an ultrasound. You should try to start gradually mobilizing yourself, initially just stand for some time, then walk for some time then stop and this should resolve progressively. So just get it examined once by the doctor to be assured. If the testicle is hard as you mentioned, then you need an ultrasound of the testes.

If the X-ray shows that the filling or cavity is approximating or involving pulp, you will definitely need a root canal as just a filling will cause pain and infection in future. Maybe the doctor would have given a temporary filling just in case if the cavity was approximating pulp so that if you are asymptomatic for minimum one month, you can go for permanent filling. Since you have symptoms, it is better to go for a root canal. Do not worry, you will be fine. Make sure you get a cap (crown) after root canal and maintain it properly.

Is the diagnosis correct and can I try with Lioresal? I am afraid of side effects and full urine retention. This is my last medical report showing on palpation, the prostate was not suspicious. The prostate was soft and not sore. On ultrasound, the upper urinary tract was normal, the renal outflow down to the bladder on both sides free. No sign of stones or tumor in the area of the kidneys or urethra.On transrectal ultrasound, the prostate was found with minor calcifications as remainings of former inflammatory processes. Otherwise, the tissue was homogeneous. The prostate volume about 28 cc. The transrectal longitudinal section of the prostate showed a suspicion of anarrow bladder outlet. There also just in the outlet the calcification was seen. Residual urine was about 120 cc. The bladder wall showed a hypertrophy of the muscular fibers.On urethrocystoscopy, a normal exterior urethra was found. The passage to the prostatic urethra showed in the bladder outlet some inflammation processes of the mucosa. The mucosa started to bleed even on soft touching. The bladder outlet was stiff and narrowed. The bladder itself showed some hypertrophic muscle fibers. Otherwise, the bladder was uneventful.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query and would like to know a few more details about your symptoms. 1. Is your predominant complaint that of increased frequency or weak urinary stream? 2. Do you have any discomfort in the region between your scrotum and anal opening? From your doctor's report, his findings on examination, scans, and cystoscopy, it appears that you have sequelae of prostatitis where the prostate gland becomes fibrotic and hard not relaxing to allow normal urine flow. It is common that in patients with obstructed flow especially due to prostate inflammation, the symptoms of urgency and frequency usually resolve. However, in your case, since you have had the symptoms for more than two years, I would like to do a urodynamic study to identify the overactive bladder and also if there is a definite obstruction. As you are already on Silodosin, I do not think that adding Lioresal (Baclofen) will help in the improvement of your symptoms significantly. If Silodosin does not give you any relief, based on the cystoscopy findings, I would rather recommend surgery after a urodynamic examination."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My daughter is 11 months old and started having her upper teeth when she was 9 months old. And I noticed she has white spots along the gumline and some on the middle. I took a photo and showed it to a dentist here and she said its hypocalcified enamel. My question is, is it reversible? What do I do to not make it worse and what causes it? I only give fruits and vegetables as food and water. And, I also breastfeed. What can I do to prevent worsening of her teeth condition? I brush her teeth two times a day with fluoride-free toothpaste. Is there anything I can do or let her take?","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The spots cannot be reversed. They form during fetal development inside the womb and first three months after birth. Any dietary deficiency for you or baby may cause or sometimes even genetic predisposition is found. There is nothing to do other than maintaining the teeth through brushing. Such hypocalcified enamel can break down fast if proper brushing is not done and the cavity may form soon. So, please be sure to brush every day till she can do so on her own.

I have always noticed some irregular things with my heart but none have ever been detected on a monitor. However, it is much worse since becoming pregnant. I have noticed after eating any food, drinking caffeine, or feeling anxious my heart flutters and I feel dizzy and short of breath. Sometimes, I get a sudden wave of extreme fatigue. I am concerned I have atrial fibrillation or some other heart rhythm problem that my doctors are not finding. This triggers my anxiety and makes the symptoms worse. How would I know if it is just anxiety that seems to come at certain times, or if it is a problem with my heart? I have had a few EKGs and one 24 hour Holter monitor but did not experience symptoms during the tests.","Doctor":"Hello. All these symptoms may just indicate anxiety. However, we should make some attempt to rule out arrhythmias. Now, your symptoms which occurs including fluttering and dizziness can occur with anxiety or caffeine. Caffeine itself can produce palpitations and various symptoms. So overall, I would keep anxiety as the first possibility. But, whenever you get symptoms, you should try to feel pulse for pulse rate in one minute if possible for you. Or else if you have electronic BP apparatus then it may show your pulse rate. So it may indicate the possibility of atrial fibrillation. Next, ectopics are quite a common arrhythmia in the young patient, and it can be there in you. May get aggravated by pregnancy. It can give you the feeling of a skipped beat. Now, we should confirm it objectively. So the best way other than Holter is, you order Alivecor Kardia monitor, which is a mobile-based system, which is portable and you can attach yourself at home and it will record your rhythm and can be analyzed. Alternatively, various watches are available which can record your pulse rate throughout the day and we can at least analyze the heart to consider the possibility of atrial fibrillation. Overall, it does not appear anything serious to me at the moment. I guess you must have had an echo done, right?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My baby is one year old. She has soft teeth in the front and she is not able to bite anything with the upper teeth. If she bites, the teeth start chipping. What am I to do?","Doctor":"Hi. If the enamel matrix formation is deficient, it will result in soft teeth that chips and/or decays easily. It may also result in an atypical or abnormal tooth shape. This is called enamel hypoplasia. Treatment for this dental condition includes removal of the very soft enamel and placement of a white tooth-colored filling in that area. Occasionally, the aberration or deviation from normal growth in the enamel is extensive enough that we recommend a white stainless steel cap as a temporary crown during the growing years. Maintain proper oral hygiene of the child by wiping the teeth with a soft cloth or a very soft brush.

I can understand whatever my teacher teaches. But after some time, I forget everything. I can understand my theoretical questions. But I am unable to express them in words.","Doctor":"Hi. You lack confidence and self-esteem. Do not get stressed. It is one of the exams you are going to approach. You should make a schedule for your reading. You need frequent revision to remember. Do lots of practice that will help you to build confidence. Spend time for some extracurricular activities like playing outdoor sports, and do daily exercise for 30 minutes. Do meditation for 15 minutes. It will help to reduce your stress. Go for a walk. Eat healthy home cooked food, and avoid junk foods. Take at least seven hours of sleep, and eat fruits like a banana which is a natural mood stabilizer. Drink warm milk before sleep which is a natural sleep inducer. Take a cold shower in the morning to reduce stress. To remember titles, make some pneumonic for it, and some tricks for it. Visualize all the diagrams, make some flowchart, sticky notes and stick them on your doors, cupboard, and mirror. When you read, make some pattern to remember the reading material during the exam. You need the practice to express words. Practice 100 times. Do not be afraid. Do smart work. Do lots of paper practice before your actual exams. You may get a low score, but it will help you to know your weakness. If you want to succeed, you need to fail many times. When you fail, you need to make a lot of attempts (practice). Be confident. Talk to yourself. Make eye to eye contact by looking into the mirror and talk to your self. Make daily goals and achieve it."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My son's appendix burst about four weeks ago. On the day they burst, his urine was a thick dark red color. His appendix was gangrenous and the infection had spread to all four quadrants of his abdomen. He had a catheter after surgery which became blocked with the thick urine so was removed. Last few days his urine has turned this dark red color again. Looks like blood but is not every time he wees. It happens about once a day. Is this a medical emergency? Is it related to the appendix or is it a different problem? What could it be?","Doctor":"Hello. Dark red colored urine means blood mixed with urine and is generally arising from the urinary tract. That means either from urinary bladder (common) ureter (less common) and kidney rarely but cannot be due to appendix unless it has locally affected the above-mentioned organs.

I tried two times brushing but no improvement till now. Anyone help me.","Doctor":"Hello. Gum bleeding is a common problem faced by many people. Mainly it is due to improper tooth brushing, bad oral health, food lodgement, and poor gum health. All you can do is visit a dentist soon and get it checked properly. After the checking, go for cleaning of teeth. It is not a costly process. After cleaning just maintain your oral health. Brush twice every day, once in morning and then in the night just before sleep. Use dental floss or interdental toothbrush according to your teeth alignment. If your teeth are aligned well and no zigzag pattern is there then use dental floss. Eat fibrous food more, avoid sweet food and sticky food. Rinse mouth after every meal or every drink you take. Avoid smoking, drinking alcohol, etc.  For more information consult a dentist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 29-year-old female, 250 lbs. I do not smoke or drink. Tonight while looking at my throat, I discovered my right tonsil is swollen, lumpy, and covered in a thick, white layer of skin. Upon initial inspection, I mistook these white patches for tonsil stones, but they are not. They seem to be stuck to the surface of my tonsil. I managed to scrape some off with a bit of effort. The tissue underneath began to bleed. The white layer appears to be skin. I do not feel sick, apart from allergies (the pollen count is quite high here right now). Any thoughts as to what could be causing this? I am currently on HCTZ, Metoprolol, Lexapro.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, your right tonsil is swollen, lumpy and covered in a white, thick layer of skin. White spots on the tonsils usually indicate an infection. Infections may be due to bacteria, fungus or viruses. Strep throat is a bacterial infection caused by Streptococcus. Complications include rheumatic fever and ear and sinus infections if infection spread to other parts of the body. Additional symptoms that may indicate strep throat include sore throat, fever, swollen glands in the neck, and headache. Oral thrush is a fungal infection in the mouth. It can occur in people with a weakened immune system or oral steroid ingestion. White spots may the only symptom of oral thrush but when additional symptoms develop they may include sore throat, pain when swallowing, loss of taste, etc. Tonsillitis can develop due to viral infections such as rhinovirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus. Symptoms may include swollen tonsils, painful swallowing, fever, earache, nasal congestion. Infectious mononucleosis is a viral infection caused by Epstein Barr virus. Along with white spots on the back of the throat symptoms may include fever, sore throat, and fatigue. You should undergo throat culture, and blood tests indicate if certain antibodies are present which helps identify specific infections. So treatment depends on finding the causative agent which are responsible for your present sufferings and treat them accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

The signs and symptoms which further suggests the injection site infections are the presence of swelling, reddish discoloration around the site, any pus point visible, the site is little warm compared to the nearby area, pain on pressing the area which was not there one to two days back. Is this swelling new? I meant was it there a day or two before? So look for these signs. It is not serious but gets to be treated early. It is better, once you get examined by her treating doctor. And also she will need antibiotics for it and on confirming the infection, capsule Moxiclav (Amoxicillin plus Clavulanate combination) 625 mg three times a for five days along with some antacids. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. Avoid pain killers till we confirm. If she needs one, she can have Paracetamol 500 mg up to four times a day. Do hot water fomentation over the swelling. Another possibility is the presence of blood clot there which can also cause fever and it will be resolved with time. Is uterine bleeding still continued, any pus discharge through the vagina?

What you are describing is a urethral discharge (yellow/ white milky material) with dysuria (painful urination). If a male patient presents with these two symptoms and a doctor confirms that there is a discharge as shown on your photo (attachment removed to protect patient identity), then it can usually be diagnosed and treated according to a specific schedule. The two most common causes of acute urethral discharge are both sexually transmitted infections (STI's) caused by chlamydia or gonorrhea bacteria. These infections are contracted from a sexual partner during sexual intercourse and it is therefore very important for the sexual partners also to be treated and to test for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). A doctor will also usually make sure there is no ulcer (open sore) on your genitals. A sample of the discharge can be sent away for testing, but if it is the first episode (time) this usually is not necessary and one can be treated immediately without sending the discharge to the laboratory. From your symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis would be a sexually transmitted infection (gonorrhea/ chlamydia) or a urinary tract infection if there is no sexual activity. According to that, you would have to be treated as follows: Hope this helps you.

We are unable to find the exact reason. We have gone through some tests for her, which I am uploading here. Please go through that, and let me know what may be the reason? And also let me know what remedy should be taken. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query as well as the reports (attachments removed to protect patient identity) and can understand your concern for her health. Repeated attacks of fever, cold and headache can be due to repeated infections of the body which could be viral or bacterial. Low resistance to infections or low immunity of the body can cause repeated infections. The values are within normal limits except erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). A high ESR indicates chronic infection in the body like tuberculosis or autoimmune disease or granulomatous diseases or connective tissue disorders. These conditions also lower the body immunity. In my opinion you should consult a physician and she needs proper work up to rule out these diseases. I am not saying that she has tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is the commonest disease causing high ESR. She should undergo proper investigations for that such as chest x-ray and Mantoux test. Another reason for repeated attacks of fever, cold and headache can be allergy also. So, if she develops these symptoms after exposure to certain allergens or allergy causing substances, ask her to avoid them. For low immunity, she can take high protein diet like pulses, sprouts, egg white, etc. Citrus fruits like lemon, gooseberries, oranges also boosts immunity as they contain vitamin C which makes the immune system strong. Proper nutritious diet also helps. Along with all these, she can take vitamin C tablets also daily once.

ESR is an acute phase reactant (erythrocyte sedimentation reaction). It suggests that there is something is going on inside body, but it does not localize the problem. Any infection, inflammation or low hemoglobin can cause raised ESR. I can have a look as some subtle variations you may not be aware of.

Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I really never cared much about brushing my teeth, and it's been awhile since I haven't brushed them.

I kept brushing because I figured I got something. This gum or tooth pain, I don't know which one, has been going on since a month.","Doctor":"Hi! Greetings for the day! As you said you are 14 years old and at this age it is very common to have bleeding gums. There could be two reasons as you are getting new teeth and another one you are attaining puberty. When you attain puberty there will be harmonal imbalance which is happening inside body which leads to swelling in gums and further bleeding whenever you touch it. If it is painful you can take paracetamol tablet whenever it pains otherwise just use mouthwash and keep ice on the area where there is swelling. It would be of help if you would send me a picture of the area concerned. Don't worry it happens during this age and you will fine.

I used Onabet cream but to cure. Scrotum and upper thighs are rough and sore and dark. Please advise me to get cured.","Doctor":"Hello. This is again a fungal infection. You should use Terbinafine ointment twice a day for 2 to 3 weeks. Apply well to the involved area. Also, have Fluconazole 150 mg bedtime once and repeat after one week, if symptoms persist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My age is 40. Currently, I am having less erection when trying to have sex. Sometimes, not able to get an erection at all. It is a very embarrassing situation. I am married for the last 11 years. We were having great sex before our marriage. After marriage and with our kid, sex has become boring. Now when I am trying to have sex, I am not getting enough erection. Sometimes, it is zero. In between, I tried Manforce 50 and after that DT Manforce 100. Sometimes, it works and sometimes not. I do not have diabetes or hypertension. I do not have any bad habits. I do not smoke and I drink once in six months. My doctor has advised me to take Nano Leo capsules twice daily after food and tablet Duroplus twice a week 30 minutes before sex and go for sex after two hours. I am taking these pills for last 25 days. Duroplus I had only taken twice. My problem is previously my erection was less but when erected, it used to last long. Now I am getting erection immediately and it is hard erection but not able to maintain it. Now I am able to get my morning eraction sometimes. I have checked my testosterone level. It is 501. Please suggest medication and let me know whether I need to stop Nano Leo tabelt or not which I am taking right now. I am doing some regular workout 45 minutes to 1 hour per day. Eating healthy diets, avidoing junk food, spicy food. Taking almonds, wall nuts, lemon, honey, banana, resins, cummins, ginger, onion, garlic, pomegranate, apple, carrort, spinach in more quantity in my food. What else life style modifaication and diet I can follow? Please advise accordingly.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. Nano Leo consists of L-arginine and is a good supplement. But with the drugs, you are not maintaining the erection. This could be due to a short duration of action of drugs. Dura plus consists of Dapoxetine and Tadalafil 30/10 and helps to increase the duration of action. If with these drugs the problem is persisting then we can think of changing the prescription. If I was your doctor I would have stopped Nano Leo and would have started tablet Tadalafil 5 mg per day (5 mg is difficult to find and in that case 10 mg every alternate day or half per day). On SOS basis Dura Plus can be used. This will help to solve your problem. Your testosterone levels are normal so no need to get worried."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, How to deal with depression? I feel constantly that my life is ruined. I have dealt with two years of failure in my professional studies and some family issues. And life seems to go nowhere. I experience palpitations and ache in my chest many times a week now. What would you suggest in such a case?","Doctor":"Hello. In the current scenario, the ongoing stress is the cause of depression that ruined the life. It is impossible to remain stress-free but we can try to handle this. Stress creates more problems for a single person than when we are in a group. Do not feel lonely because it creates more stress and become a part of the vicious cycle. So to remove stress, it is necessary to remain in a group and start talking about problems. Have you heard the proverb sorrow goes down by sharing and happiness increase by sharing? So my advice to you is to start talking about your problems with your friends, colleague or loved ones. Start physical activities, try to make yourself busy anytime. Do one pleasurable activity daily that you want, sleep properly and feel the pleasure. You should try medicine initially and relaxation techniques for chest discomfort, palpitations, and other symptoms."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 30-year-old female with normal menstrual cycles. I began taking Vitex a month back and stopped after 20 days. I took way too much. The bottle said to take two pills a day but the pills are 400 mg a piece. I now realize that this is way too much. I am concerned because I got my period two days late and it is very heavy. I know this is a normal response to how much Vitex I took. I am just worried that my body will not be able to go back to normal on its own. I am worried that I will need to go on birth control pills to correct this issue. I am looking for guidance on what I should do. Should I wait to see how long my period is? Should I go get birth control pills? Is there anything natural I can do to fix this?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See two to four days late or early periods are considered normal if you get menstruation every month and do not skip any cycle. As far as heavy bleeding is concerned, it can be due to the herb. But wait for another cycle. I will not recommend you to take birth control pills right now. The herb contents will wash away from the body very soon as you have stopped taking it. So take your normal diet and drink plenty of water daily. Wait for your next menstrual cycle and watch for the bleeding and other things. Hopefully, it will be corrected automatically."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had a cold and sore throat about four months ago. For some stupid reason, I decided to shine a torch to look at the back of my throat and I saw a yellow colored circular spot or cyst or ulcer. I went to a doctor who could not see it, so then I went to another doctor who said there is nothing to worry about. It is a cyst and it will take a while but it should go. Three months past and it was still there. So, I went back to the doctors who gave me antibiotics. Being so frustrated, I decided to use a cotton bud to mess with it and it kind of just turned red. The doctor thought that it was the antibiotics doing its job (I never told him I had messed with it ) so he said that there is nothing to worry about and sent me on my way, and told me to get more rest, but now it has returned again and it is worrying. My throat does not hurt at all.","Doctor":"Hi. You have encircled a granule in the posterior pharyngeal wall, the back of your throat (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You do not have to worry about it. The back of the throat has lymphoid follicles in the form of granules. They along with lateral pharyngeal bands, palatine tonsils, lingual tonsils and adenoids form the Waldeyers ring which have protective function against pathogens. When you have a throat infection, these granules swell up, turn yellow. When you have post nasal drip due to cold or sinusitis or allergy then also these granules get stimulated to become big. When there are no symptoms you can forget about those. But if you are symptomatic we address the granules by doing silver nitrate cauterization using a tip of a small probe under a local anesthetic spray in our office and the granule goes away in a few days time."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During my travel I had a sore throat, 102 degree fever and back aches. I did not have a stuffy nose or congestion. I previously had bladder infection three weeks ago and the doctor whom I visited in that place prescribed me Levofloxacin. I think he was treating me for a kidney infection, but due to language barrier I was not sure. I took the five day course of antibiotics and felt better. Three days later the sore throat came back, but no fever. As I came back to my town, I visited my regular GP. She did a throat culture and prescribed Amoxicillin. Before starting Amox, the sore throat went away and a cough developed with green mucus. Not sure whether it comes from the lungs or sinuses. I got my strep results today and it is positive. So, I am trying to figure out what is going on. Instead of strep, my symptoms are like a viral infection. Should I need the second round of antibiotics? As a biologist, I tend to overanalyze my sicknesses, some times, but I am trying to understand this better. Due to the studies of the irreparable damage to the GI tract of antibiotics, I do not like the idea of being on my second round of antibiotics if this could be viral. And if it was a viral case, is it bad to stop the antibiotics? Please explain.","Doctor":"Hello. Strep pharyngitis is usually graded by modified center criteria. I do not have all the elements to plug in the numbers. Classically, you should have fever, exudates on the tonsils and posterior pharynx, cervical lymph node enlargement and absence of cough. Your positive culture might be representing that you harbor Strep in your pharynx. Now that the symptoms of sore throat are gone and I would not suggest getting treatment for that reason. Now, the productive cough with green phlegm does not always mean that you have a bacterial infection. By the book when you have symptoms of sinus pressure, congestion and or fever for a week not improving with conservative treatment that is when we treat with Amoxicillin. If you have any of the mentioned symptoms, then you would benefit from treatment. If you are having chest congestion, which is not improving with conservative treatment getting a chest x-ray and CBC (complete blood count) would be a reasonable option.

It is a recurrent swelling of the lids which subsides on its own. But in some cases, it may cause drooping of the eyelid along with another eyelid. However, there are no trusted tests to confirm the diagnosis or any other effective treatment for the disease. Consult an Ophthalmologist to be on the safer side. It can be done at your convenience, and it is not an emergency.

Is it possible for the type 2 ligament to get cured by itself without operation and if so, how many days does it take to heal?","Doctor":"Hi. ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) tears will not heal on its own as they are inside the joint. To bring the ends together, you need surgery, but even that too is not successful. It is the reason for doing ACL reconstruction. It is not recommended for everyone. Only if your knee is giving way or if it is unstable or when you are unable to lead an athletic life, then you need an ACL reconstruction."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, There is a low level of MCV, MCHC, MCH.

Currently, I am taking antibiotics. What doctor should I need to see and what tests can I do?","Doctor":"Hi. In acute infection, the headache and joint pain can occur as a constitutional symptom. Paracetamol 500 mg can be taken until you consult a doctor for examination. Serum TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) estimation, SGPT (alanine aminotransferase), SGOT (aspartate transferase), calcium estimation, serum B12 estimation, random blood sugar, knee X-ray and EKG (electrocardiogram) like investigations can be done if there is no improvement after completing the antibiotic course. The investigations list can be shortened after the physical examination. I suggest you consult a physician for examination.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I am finding it very difficult to maintain an erection and reach completion during sexual intercourse, even though I am able to do so consistently during masturbation. I am worried that my masturbation and pornography habits are causing me to have these issues. I masturbate almost daily, often for long periods of time (typically to cure my boredom) with consistent use of pornography. I am concerned that I am training myself to only be able to ejaculate through masturbation. On top of this, my issue often makes me anxious about sexual intercourse which I feel can make it even more difficult to have sex. Ideally, I would love to hear if there are any suggestions that could help me overcome my issue.","Doctor":"Hello. Sex is completely different from masturbation where two partners with their mutual agreement start it. Sex and pleasure are also important. You get pleasure with masturbation and I think you never get pleasure during sexual intercourse. It is not because of your masturbatory habit, so many people masturbate daily even twice, thrice or more. Erection is related to excitement and it shows your interest in a particular area. So as your interest will develop in the partner, you will maintain the erection. Besides indulging in pornography and masturbation, start giving time to your partner. Her needs are what you desire.

It started with severe giddiness and nausea. I have consulted many neuro physicians and they prescribed me medicines for migraine along with antidepressants. But, I did not get any relief. A neurosurgeon told me to take Dolo for three weeks and Stalopam 10 mg. That too, did not help me. I got my MRI scan done and was diagnosed to have a small cyst (subependymoma) in my head, which doctors said as non-cancerous and not related to these headaches. I lifted heavy weights in my fourth month after my delivery and I had upper shoulder pain. Later, my neck and head pain started. I guess, pain in my upper shoulder muscle leads to neck pain and headache. Doctors say it as a migraine, but I am not sensitive to light.

Last month, we noticed that she had pain in her right ear and the thing continued for three to four days. On 5th, we noticed lots of wax in her right ear. It seemed to be pus. So, we took her to an ear specialist. After diagnosis, the doctor told us that her ear is infected. But he could not investigate the ear well as my daughter was scared and she did not let the doctor investigate the ear properly. Then the doctor advised the following medicines for her:  Syrup Fimoxyclav 100 ml 1.5 teaspoon (1+1+1) for seven days. Syrup Telfast 1 teaspoon (1+0+1) for seven days. Candibiotic ear drops three to four drops in right ear three times daily for seven days. Rynex nasal drop 0.025 % two to three drops in both nose holes three times for seven days.  As per the doctor's prescription, we started the medicine. But we cannot use the Rynex because my daughter did not let us use it in her nose. But her ear condition was improving and after ten days, we went to the doctor again. The doctor investigated her (this time also my doctor did not let the doctor to check properly) ear and told us that she is now fine. After several days, my daughter again told us that she is feeling pain in her ear. But this time, not in the right ear but in the left ear. We took her to her regular pediatric doctor. Actually, she went to visit her grandma on summer vacation and that is why we took her to this doctor. Doctor investigated her and he could check her both ears well. My daughter knows this doctor very well, so she let him check the ear well. As per the doctor, her right ear is fully alright but left ear is infected. So, he suggested the following medicines:  Syrup Renova two teaspoons two times daily, if there is any fever more than 100 F. But till now, we did not observe any. Syrup Cefim 3DS one teaspoon every 12 hours for 10 days. Syrup Brodil 1.5 teaspoon every 8 hours for 10 days. Tablet Ritch 60 for 15 days. Rynex nasal drop 0.025 %.  Then, the doctor asked us to visit him again after 10 days. In this period, her ear was improving but it seems to us that her ear has not recovered properly and also we noticed that when we give nasal drop both her ears were getting wet. After 10 days, we visited the doctor again. He told us that her punctured right ear has not yet fully recovered. So, he extended the medicine Cefim 3DS for another for four days. And also asked us if again infection occur to do the following tests.  Ear swab C/S. Urine R/M/E.  However, after that, we did not see any visible infection yet, but her both ear seem wet to us. So, we did his recommended tests. Please find the test report from the attachment. Her test report shows that her ear is infected by Staphylococcus aureus. And I came to know that this bacteria is very much dangerous as this has resistivity for most of the antibiotics. So, I am very scared of now. Could you please let us know her real status?","Doctor":"Hello. Ear infections in children are very common. Children have a straight and wide eustachian tube that helps throat microbes to reach the ear easily and cause infection. So whenever she has a chest infection or throat pain or cold or flu, there are chances that her ears will also get infected. Once the ears get infected, then subsequently more chances that throat and nose infections will go up to the ear. Once ear gets infected, it is very painful and pus is produced inside. The pus breaks open the eardrum and come outside. Thereafter with medicines and the body's immunity, the ear condition resolves. But the hole in the eardrum does not close very soon. It takes a few weeks. During this time, water should not go into the ear while bathing or swimming, etc. You should take care that your daughter does not insert any cotton or match stick or anything inside the ear. Talking about the medicines given by ENT doctor and the pediatrician, both are almost the same. They both have given a different set of antibiotics and the pediatrician has added Salbutamol, which is mostly because your daughter might have been having chest problem or wheezing while going to him. Talking about staphylococcus, it is a dangerous organism when it becomes resistant to common antibiotics. Many times, it is a commensal in our body, commensal meaning routine organism. In the C/S report that you have attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity), the organism is sensitive to Ciprofloxacin. I suggest you instill two drops of Ciplox (Ciprofloxacin) in either ear thrice daily for a week and continue the medicines that the doctor has asked you to. Continue Antihistaminic medicine (Telfast) for two weeks. Go back to your ENT after that time and ask him to put an otoscope and check both ears. Tell your daughter to be bold and friendly and bribe her with chocolates so that the doctor is able to look into the ear and tell you clearly what it is. If possible ask the doctor to show the findings using an oto-endoscope which can be connected to the TV screen and shown to all including your daughter. Till then the precautions you take are: 1. No water inside the ear. 2. Can apply the drops I suggested. 3. Do not continue nasal drops (ENT drops or pediatrician drops) for more than four days in continuity (it can cause other nasal problems) 4. If she develops throat or nose problem, immediately show her to ENT and take adequate treatment. 5. Avoid cold foods and juices, give homemade juices and home cooked food. 6. Avoid excessive sun, dust, and dehydration. Talking about the reasons for frequent nose and throat infections, she could be having tonsillar enlargement and frequent inflammations. With your next query, please take a picture of your daughter's open mouth showing details of tonsils and back of the throat so that we can assess if there is a tonsillar problem which may need some other treatment.

After 15 days, I got tested for HSV, and the results were negative. But I had a greenish discharge for one day and white discharge for two days from my penis during the medication. After that, I never had any discharge till now. I got tested again after a month for chlamydia and gonorrhea using PCR where chlamydia came positive. When I consulted a urologist, he treated me with Doxycycline 100 mg for ten days, and 15 days after the treatment, again I got tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea using PCR where chlamydia came as negative, and gonorrhea came as positive.

I had a breast MRI three months back and the report (which I do not have) stated that the contrast seemed to 'pool' in one place. The doctor said he was not overly concerned but to repeat MRI in six months rather than in usual 12 months. Three days ago, I woke in the night with intense nipple pain in the left breast. It has not really subsided since. I have found a small scab on my areola under the nipple and my left nipple appears much larger and a bit darker than my right. I do not know if I am just noticing the difference now or if it has always been like that. My question is can a small scab form on the areola and not the nipple, but the nipple is swollen with Paget's disease? Maybe I just scratched it without knowing but would my nipple be swollen from a scratch as well even though scratch is not touching nipple? Thanks for your time.","Doctor":"Hello. Paget's disease mostly involves nipple and later spread to areola, but it can also involve areola only. It is possible that areola is involved and the nipple is swollen. Many cases of Paget's disease do have lump below the nipple or some cancerous lesion. Is this lesion progressing, stable or regressing, is there any itching, burning also with pain, does it appear like eczema or just reddish scab? Regarding your scratch possibility, I do not really think that some unnoticed scratch has caused has lesion, scab and nipple swelling which is persistent from three days. So, considering you have a predisposing condition and unexplained lesion, I think it should be evaluated on priority. You also palpate your both breast especially below the nipple for any lump. So I think you should get this examined, and also biopsied. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any other doubts or information to share. All the best.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I passed black stools this morning. Is this black color because of the protein powder?","Doctor":"Hi. Protein supplements do not cause black stools. Black stools, also known as melena, occur if there is bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. There are chances of black stools if you take medications like Pepto-Bismol or Iron supplements. So, if you are not on Pepto-Bismol or Iron supplements and if there are persistent black stools which is sticky, bulky and offensive, then it requires immediate attention. Get an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and share your reports."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My second molar in the left side of upper jaw was extracted two months back. I thought of placing an implant. So, bone grafting was done. Now, I got few opinions that implant is not required in that region. Are there any future implications due to gap being there like displacement of adjacent teeth, etc.?","Doctor":"Hi. Because you have done a bone graft, that means there would have been bone loss. The prognosis of the tooth will be poor after implant in that region. If your adjacent teeth are not having or showing any bone loss, you may opt for a fixed partial denture (bridge). Yes, there are chances of tooth displacement or tooth migration in this region. If the implant is not possible because of underlying bone resorption or too much vertical or horizontal bone loss, you must not opt for a bridge too.

Yes, you have developed nodulocystic acne. What did you mean by it has popped last night? Is this same lesion present for one week or it has subsided now since yesterday?

Lumbar puncture or spinal tap causes a headache and back pain in almost all kids. If the spinal tap was done due to a headache then it is to rule out meningitis. You can just give any painkiller for relief until the investigations are done.

For bone pain at two spots, investigate with serum 25 (OH-hydroxy) vitamin D estimation and serum-free ionized calcium estimation. You can provide that reports once done.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

WBC count was high in the first report - 11,300, lymphocytes 4,500, and RDW 16 which was indicated as high in the report.

The diagnosis in your case is lymphocytosis. The underlying cause for the lymphocytosis should be searched for. For that, a detailed physical examination should be done and liver, spleen and lymph nodes should be palpated. Infectious mononucleosis, viral influenza, hepatitis, lymphoproliferative disorders, syphilis, etc., are some of the causes. If any specific clinical complaint is present than provide history regarding that for further discussion. You investigate further according to need like influenza antibody testing, SGPT and SGOT, HIV testing, etc. Your peripheral smear examination reports are normal and are not showing any specific abnormal cells. You have to repeat CBC (complete blood count) again after a week. If lymphocytosis persists for more than three to four weeks then flow cytometry investigation should be done to rule out monoclonal nature of lesion.

Whenever she drinks anything hot or a little cold. Please advise us on the treatment.","Doctor":"Hi. I had gone through your question. I can understand your concern about your mother. The history started after ten days that means there will be something wrong with the prosthesis (bridge). I think there must be chipping off of the sealant (the material that fixes the crown or bridge with tooth) or the gingival recession because of the altered occlusion. You need to get a desensitizing toothpaste like Sensodyne and use it for two weeks. In case you feel there is a gap between sensitive tooth and bridge you need to visit the dentist again and get it recemented.

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had unprotected sex two days ago. After sex, I took the morning-after-pill straight away after two hours.

Emergency contraceptive affects the menstrual cycle, prevent ovulation, fertilization, and implantation differ in different types of contraceptives. If taken within 72 hours in proper advised dosage, you will get the withdrawal bleed within 1 to 2 weeks maximum instead of your regular menstrual period bleeding. Scheduled menstrual bleeding could be disturbed due to externally induced hormones. As body get rid of hormonal effect, gradually periods take a previous pace for menstrual bleeding or period bleeding as was before taking I-pill, depends on the body's response. Less chances of pregnancy if taken properly in proper dose within 72 hours with no history of vomitings of medication or I-pill."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My issue is related to skin color.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I took a pregnancy test four days back and it came out negative but still, I have not got my periods. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi.

Mostly your partner might be right and if you believe him then do not worry about HIV. But if you have a doubt regarding any form of exposure, then again after six weeks, a repeat test is needed. As per my opinion, although a chance of HIV is less, you should get investigated with HIV after six weeks of exposure to effectively rule out HIV.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Recently, I consulted a psychiatrist for a health issue and the doctor prescribed tablet Flunil 20, an antidepressant. After about two to three weeks, I noticed that I was becoming more and more asexual. My sexual desire and interest started to diminish. I can masturbate but it is not pleasurable and I end up extremely dissatisfied and tired at the end. My overall sexual desire has gone down and sexual feelings are kind of lost. Are these the side effects of the antidepressant drug? Should I stop taking this drug?","Doctor":"Hi. Fluoxetine (Flunil 20) belongs to the SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) class of antidepressants. Fluoxetine is one of the notorious antidepressants in relation to sexual side effects. The available data indicate that about 30 to 40 % of those taking Fluoxetine develop some sexual side effects. In regard to the reversal of side effects, it is said that once you stop the drug, the side effects recover almost completely. There is no need to worry if you are recovering from the ailment for which Flunil was prescribed. But, if you do not see any improvement even after four weeks of treatment, then it is advisable to stop Flunil and use a better alternative."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My teeth are black.

For healthier teeth and to prevent tooth decay try to follow these suggestions: If there is any food lodgement in the tooth associated with the color change, it should be treated as early as possible because decay might spread deeper leading to a toothache."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a circumcision done at an earlier age. I am facing a problem of premature ejaculation whenever I try to have sex. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Circumcision is just the surgical method of removing the foreskin from the human penis.

Sometimes, decreased well being, as in poor health and general weakness also cause premature ejaculation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My wife and I have high arsenic levels, greater than 10.

My condition is not disturbing my life, but for the sake of clarity, it would be nice to consult for a primary opinion on whether it is necessary to physically visit a urologist. I had a minor yeast infection a few months back. While clearing them off, I just found out for the first time in my life that I had a partial phimosis. For the past few weeks, I tried doing retraction exercise and now I can easily retract my foreskin, to view the whole glans and clear off the excessive smegma. The smegma softens after a period of time and gets lesser every time I shower for the past few weeks. However, I am a bit troubled by the fact that the bottom end of my urethral opening appears swollen. Previously, when I was not able to retract my foreskin, the appearance is like a small red bump. Upon revealing the whole glans, I see that it is a red part of the penile opening and it is like a straight line of red skin from the bottom end of the urethra opening until the end of the glans. When I raised this issue with my GP, who treated my fungal infection, he said it was probably a birth variation or minor inflammation. I told him (from what I recall), I had always had this since probably teenage or even younger. It does not concern me, but I just want to be more informed of my own well being. I have not been sexually active and just very recently solved my phimosis. Could it have been caused by the residual urine on my penile tip, since I am uncircumcised? Does this condition require serious medical attention?","Doctor":"Hi, I think the red line you are referring to is nothing but frenulum. It is a normal structure and since you do not have any symptoms attributable to it, I really do not think that you need to see a urologist in person. It would add better clarity, if you can attach a photo of your penis showing the lesion.

Cavities might not be symptomatic in many cases apart from mild to moderate sensitivity. The same cavities if left in place for a longer duration without treatment, then it would go deeper or wider causing trouble. You can expect pain on a particular tooth or generalized pain. In addition ,you can also expect swelling of gums with pus discharge or swelling of face in worst case scenarios. The tooth with any sort of pain has to be looked upon for a root canal therapy initially. Upper back teeth might give you pain simulating sinusitis whereas lower back teeth come along with ear pain.

It indicates that there is no chance of fracture. If there is a fracture, your movement will be restricted. So, it might be a sprain in tendons or in ligaments. The healing of sprain will take two to three months. Take rest and wrap crepe bandage around the knee joint or wear a kneecap during movement. Take Lakshadi Guggulu two tablets twice a day with warm water after meals and apply lukewarm Nirgundi oil externally with a gentle hand. It will get healed soon.

Now, I have a boyfriend who is still afraid of it, mainly because of me and about this cold sore.","Doctor":"Hi. Herpes simplex virus type 1 causes cold sores. It recurs often, but the frequency of recurrence decrease with time. The infection is transmitted through direct contacts like deep kissing and oral sex. It does not spread through dry kissing. The virus can pass through silent phases as it can shed from time to time. But the chances of transmission are very less when compared to the possibilities of an outbreak. So it is better to avoid any physical contact during an outbreak. At other times, there is a very low risk of transmission."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Recently, I have taken Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin along with my usual medicine like topical corticosteroid, Sertraline, Montelukast and Rosuvastatin. Is taking these medicine like Hydroxychloroquine do any harm? Or do I need any adjustments with my regular medicine?","Doctor":"Hello. I am sure some healthcare providers must have advised you to take these drugs and he would be aware of these interactions before starting. If you are self-medicating yourselves I would strongly advise you against that. Using Hydroxychloroquine together with Sertraline can increase the risk of an irregular heart rhythm that may be serious and potentially life-threatening, although it is a rare side effect. You may be more susceptible if you have a heart condition called congenital long QT syndrome, other cardiac diseases, conduction abnormalities, or electrolyte disturbances (for example, magnesium or potassium loss due to severe or prolonged diarrhea). Your doctor may already be aware of the risks but has determined that this is the best course of treatment for you and has taken appropriate precautions and is monitoring you closely for any potential complications. You should seek immediate medical attention if you develop sudden dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting, shortness of breath, or heart palpitations during treatment with these medications, whether together or alone. With Rosuvastatin, the risk of peripheral neuropathy may be increased during concurrent use of two or more agents that are associated with this adverse effect. Patient risk factors include diabetes and age older than 60 years. In some cases, the neuropathy may progress or become irreversible despite discontinuation of the medications.

It is advisable to visit his pediatrician or hematologist for an examination. Your child's hemoglobin level remains persistently low as per history. So, chronic hemolysis or intermittent hemolysis might be there. Clinical severity can be correlated with estimation of serum LDH and serum bilirubin. Iron and Folic acid can be prescribed by his doctor for that. If no improvement and Hb deficiency is more, a blood transfusion might be given.

Hence contraction of this muscle helps to delay ejaculation by compressing urethra. The exercises for the PC muscles includes sitting with a straight back, both hands on lap. Squeeze in the anus as if trying to hold bowel while defecating. Hold and count to 10 and then slowly release the muscle. Do this for 6 to 10 times per sitting. Every day you can have 4 to 5 such sittings. While passing urine, what you can do is hold urine for 1 to 2 seconds, then, pass it, then again hold. This hold-pass can be done 3 to 4 times every time you go for a pee. Both these measures help in strengthening the PC muscle. All you need is to have patience. It will need time to show results."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 42-year-old female, in good health aside from anxiety (currently taking 5 mg Citalopram). A month ago, I suddenly experienced muscle twitching all over both legs and this went on for two weeks. I took magnesium and it subsided and has not really returned except for an occasional twitch here or there. I am extremely concerned because over the course of the month, I have had three episodes where I forgot how to swallow for a second. It was scary and now I am afraid I have the onset of ALS. I do also have a long time habit of throat clearing. Although I have not experienced any muscle weakness, are those symptoms indicative of ALS?","Doctor":"Hi. Twitching of muscles can be due to anxiety as well as Citalopram. What is important is that you mention having them before initiating Citalopram. So it is unlikely to be due to the drug. If it is occasional then you should rather not bother yourself because twitching intermittently is there even in an otherwise healthy individuals. What is important is your sensation of forgetting to swallow. This is drug-induced akathisia or abnormal movement. Citalopram is known to have abnormal sensation restricted to tongue also. Hence, if you feel that this is bothersome and progressing then you may change the medicine. But my experience is that 5 mg is a very small dose to be causing side effects. These symptoms are due to your anxiety. As twitching was there before too and improved with magnesium. Your habit of throat clearing along with anxiety may be the cause of your feeling of forgetting how to swallow. I have personally seen people having this because of acidity with reflux, people with a habit of gulping food, etc., in many simple life situations. I would rather like you to assure and to get relaxed with behavioral techniques and meditation if possible. If it still persists then change of medications may be considered. As far as ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is considered I can only say that it requires NCV (nerve conduction test), EMG (electromyography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) for definitive diagnosis. About 5% have a family history. But one should get thyroid function, parathormone and Vitamin B1 tested. Because these are common and mimics ALS. Twitching if reduced should be a reassurance against ALS. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Since then, I am feeling an uncomfortable heartbeat. I am diabetic type 2. I took ECG two times and the heart rate was 88 one time and 108 the second time. ECG I took in a span of two days. Please suggest me what should I do or suggest me the medicine.","Doctor":"Hello. It does not seem to be anything worrisome. Increase in the heart rate and feeling it does not mean you have anything abnormal. Heart rate may rise with anxiety, stress, walking on the ground or stairs, and this is entirely normal. So at present nothing needs to be done for your pulse rate. Anyways, if you feel too much uncomfortable then you may take tablet Ciplar LA 20 mg (Propranolol) once a day for two weeks. Otherwise, nothing needs to be done. Next thing, it is very important that you keep your sugar levels well controlled as deranged sugar is a high-risk factor for the future cardiovascular disease. Also, focus on a healthy lifestyle, diet, and regular exercises. Also, should get screening lipid profile done if not had recently.  From the cardiac perspective, you should get one screening echo and TMT (treadmill test) done to know the current status of the heart, which most probably must be normal only. TMT will identify if any minor abnormalities are going in the heart. So overall, you need to focus on prevention."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 28 years old. I am planning to get married to a girl who is known to me. We have a very good understanding and we love each other. But, we have the same blood group that is B positive.

My brother-in-law told me that if husband and wife have the same blood group, future generation (babies) will have to face problems like a disabled child, died baby born, etc. He told me it could create a problem and he does not want me to marry this girl.

If yes, then what basically create problems? And how to overcome this problem I mean the solution to this problem? Are there any precautions that need to be considered for having a baby after getting married to the same blood group?","Doctor":"Hello. The same blood group people can marry and can produce a normal child. The same blood group is not at all contraindication for marriage and to produce the child. So do not worry about that. But if you both are relative, then genetic counseling before conception is necessary. If you really want to investigate, then rule out thalassemia minor report before marriage, that is of utmost importance."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have many deep acne scars on my face.

Meanwhile, you can start tablet Zenflox Oz (Ofloxacin and Ornidazole) twice a day for five days for foul smell and infection which can help you in PID and UTI both. Drink more water, and for heavy and regular periods you can start tablet Regestrone (Progestin) 5 mg once a day for 30 days, but this is a hormonal tablet.

They didn't give the report of first test but simply told first test was abnormal so we sending for second time. I am confused. Please tell me whether second time test shows normal result. If it is abnormal is there is any early treatment to protect the baby from down syndrome.","Doctor":"Hello, First of all congrats on your pregnancy. Let me clarify that double marker is only a screening test .It's not a confirmatory test. Double markers are not repeated if they r showing high risk.Sonif the lab has asked for a second sample ,it may be due to some other reason. It means even if we say ,ur second test shows a high risk (chances of which r less) ,it only means that this baby for some reason has a higher risk for a genetic problem.you still need to do an amniocentesis and do a karyotyping to confirm the genetic problem. We see many double markers which r abnormal,but very few if those have an abnormal Karyotype on confirmation. So rest assured and enjoy your pregnancy .let the results come .Nothing is decided by a double marker test. Taking folic acid 3 months prior to pregnancy is onevway of preventing a downs syndrome.

My advice to you is drink plenty of fluids. It helps break up your congestion, makes your throat moist and will keep you away from getting dehydrated. Gargle with warm salt water. It moistens your sore or scratchy throat and brings temporary relief. Try half teaspoon of salt dissolved in a glass of warm water four times a day.  You can try OTC (over the counter) drugs like Chlorpheniramine maleate, Dextromethorphan and Cetirizine.

Today I found a whitish sore on my nipple that hurts when anything touches it. I have no idea what it is. It is on the top of my areola and is white. It feels like there is some tissue underneath and very painful. I thought it was a pimple, but it is not. Previously, I used to get large pimples in between my breasts which hurt extremely bad. This time it is directly on my nipple. I do not know if they are related. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome back to icliniq.com. Thanks for your question. The areola and the areolar border is filled with modified sebaceous glands, called glands of Montgomery. They produce sebum, like those that form part of all your hair follicles. Thus they are prone to keratotic plug formation and then the build-up of debris and subsequent inflammation or infection just like other pimples on the rest of the body, especially the face, upper chest, and back. Treat it like another pimple by applying an anti-inflammatory or anti-microbial spot-treatment like Benzac AC (Benzoyl peroxide) and warm compresses with a warm cloth to help relieve duct obstruction and pain. Rarely it can lead to inflammation and infection of lactiferous ducts, causing mastitis. It would present as a swollen, warm and painful entire breast and requires oral antibiotics. But this is not what you currently have and the risk if it developing is low. The upper chest (in between breasts) is a common area for acne and cystic acne (large inflamed pimples) and what you describe fits well. It is best treated and followed up long term by your specialist dermatologist.

The loosing of your teeth can be because of biting on hard object or fruit. You need to restrict yourself from eating things that may loosen them more. If the loosing happen on its own it can be because of bone loss. Mostly the bone loss may be due to deep bite (malocclusion), that may need orthodontic treatment (braces). If you can upload some pictures of your teeth in open as well as in closed position I will provide you with the better treatment options available for the dentist.  Deep bite or overbite, trauma.

A heightened sense of smell plus a lot of bloating constantly. Prior to these symptoms beginning, the last date I had sexual intercourse was two weeks roughly. No sex in between at all.  In order to simply rule out pregnancy, I did several home pregnancy tests and received very faint but blue and visible lines within the instructions time frame given. The last four days of testing there was some progression made in terms of how dark the positive lines were and how rapidly they appeared on the test. Naturally, I assume I am pregnant though how I do not know. Worth noting that since just after my last sexual intercourse and still ongoing, I have been suffering from a urinary tract infection and am on antibiotics but have had to extend their duration as it does not seem to be resolving well nor getting worse, however. I began spotting pink blood four days ago which two days later progressed to a period red type bleeding with small clots. This is still ongoing to date but has a tendency to wax and wane. There was an awful amount accompanied by severe cramping and pain for a few hours. The cramps are much milder now and bearable. I am not filling much of a sanitary pad but it is rather when I wipe (aside from the large amount earlier). I assumed a miscarriage, but obviously, I cannot be sure. Now, I still have the same pregnancy-related symptoms. They have not subsided in the slightest since the bleeding began. I am also beginning since yesterday to feel bouts of nausea on and off. Basically, my query is really three things: 1. Is pregnancy possible? 2. If so, does it seem like an early miscarriage is occurring? 3. Could the urinary tract infection be causing the vaginal bleeding at all? Notes: I have experienced one previous confirmed miscarriage two years ago. Medications I am currently taking are Dexamphetamine 5 mg, Clonazepam 2 mg as required and antibiotic for UTI.","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to icliniq.com. Since you are on Nexplanon (hormonal contraceptive implant), the chances of pregnancy are very remote. Still, it has a failure rate of 0.5 %. So, the most important thing is to rule out pregnancy. As you have mentioned that the test line was faint and you are having slight bleeding along with cramps, an ectopic pregnancy needs to be ruled out. Get a serum beta hCG levels. The test can diagnose pregnancy within three weeks of intercourse. If the level is more than 5, then it means that there is pregnancy. To know if it is an early pregnancy or an abortion we will have to repeat the levels in 48 hours. UTI (urinary tract information) does not cause vaginal bleeding.

I feel hard to hear now. I have attached my recent audiogram result details for your reference.","Doctor":"Hi. From the available information, it seems to me that you might have a condition called otosclerosis. Otosclerosis is a condition in which there is abnormal bone growth in the ear which prevents the sound vibrations from being conducted adequately from the external ear to the inner ear.  This can be confirmed with a test known as a tympanogram. Once it is confirmed, you might have to undergo a revision surgery which is done by a surgeon. In most cases, it improves the hearing considerably. If it does not improve with this, you might have to opt for a hearing aid.

For the past two weeks I have only felt flutters on the left side of my uterus. I also mostly feel a bulge on the left side of my uterus. Is that normal or is there something wrong?","Doctor":"Hi. Twin pregnancy is itself more tiring physically as compared to a singleton pregnancy. It is your early second trimester. Have a check on cramps, any vaginal discharge or pain from back to move on to the front, at lower back. If these cramps severe with or without any discharge or bleeding it should be reported to tertiary care hospital. Have you had any cyst, fibroid or any GI disturbance or any other issue? You can have these feelings more frequently as compared to ladies having a singleton pregnancy. It might be possible that developing fetuses move on the left side at present, as still placenta is very small and in the early developmental phase. To be on the safe side, you can have one scan to check any abnormality which is I think less likely. In the scan, it is better to check cervical length as well. You can see the heartbeat, breathing movements in the scan as well. If it is not your first pregnancy, then you can match this feeling with your first pregnancy as well. But as it is a twin, so feeling more early and more in intensity. Have one urinalysis as well to exclude urine infection. Have plenty of water, fruits, and vegetables. Cranberry juice intake for reducing the risk of urinary tract infection. Discuss scan and urine reports here. Observe closely for any unusual symptoms and report if present."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My echocardiogram reveals borderline LVH. My cholesterol is 212 mg/dL and triglyceride is 283 mg/dL.

You can have a healthy lifestyle by avoiding fatty, oily, and high-calorie diet. Have a low salt diet and monitor your blood pressure regularly thrice a day for one week. Follow them once or twice a week. If the BP (blood pressure) is persistently more than 140/90 mmHg, then the medicines are needed to get hiked up. Do regular exercises like brisk walking, and jogging according to your capacity for at least 30 minutes a day and five days a week. Take lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, and fish once or twice a week, and avoid taking meat. Avoid smoking and alcohol. Repeat your lipid profile after eight weeks of a healthy lifestyle and see the response of the healthy lifestyle or else get yourself started with medicines like Rosuvastatin and Fenofibrate combination."},{"Patient":"I cannot rotate my left shoulder from 5 days and continues sever pain which dont let me sleep","Doctor":"Hi. The main shoulder joint is a ball-and-socket joint, which allows a very wide range of movement. The joint is surrounded by a tough fibrous sleeve called the capsule, which helps to hold the joint together. A group of four muscles and their tendons make up the rotator cuff, which controls movement and also helps to hold the joint together. Thereâs another smaller joint where the top of the shoulder blade meets the collarbone, the acromioclavicular joint. You can take ACCELOFRNAC+PARACETAMOL tab for severe pain once a day for two days. Following exercise will help reduce pain and increase range of motion. Reducing the strain When raising your arm or lifting objects, reduce the strain or pull on your shoulder by: keeping your elbow bent and in front of your body keeping your palm facing the ceiling.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Cooked oatmeal will help in soothing the stomach. Curd can be included in the diet. Heavy fatty foods should be restricted for a few days. Avoid excess spicy foods. If no improvement, then antibiotic course prescribed and endoscopy planned if needed. 2. For nose bleeding, if one episode then it can be neglected.

My age is 19 years old. Can I use cod liver oil?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand that you are suffering from myopia of - 3.5D in your right eye and - 4D in your left eye. In case you want to use cod liver oil for reducing your glass power, I can tell you that it will not help. Myopia is a disease involving the refractive index, the curvature of the components of the eye and the length of the eyeball in the disease-free eyes. Consuming cod liver oil will not prevent or reverse any of the above-mentioned problems. Measures to reduce myopia progression include: 1. Avoid holding objects very close to your eye. The more the near work, the more will be myopia. 2. Visit your ophthalmologist for a yearly check of the power of your glasses. There are various options for refractive correction such as ReLex Smile, LASIK, etc., after your power stabilizes or you have completed your education. But for a 19-year-old, glasses are the best option, with occasional contact lens wear of less than six hours a day. In case you still want to consider consuming cod liver oil, please do so under a physicians guidance as excessive intake of vitamin A can damage your liver."},{"Patient":"Hi Doc,  My wife recently got pregnant.

It is a urinary tract infection, mostly cystitis. It occurs due to unhygienic peri genital condition. In order to prevent UTI keep your perineal area clean like cleaning after intercourse and daily cleaning of the area during bathing. For the cure, you will need an antibiotic for a week. First, you should get urine routine and microscopy test done to confirm the infection. You should also get an ultrasound done to confirm cystitis and rule out other causes of bleeding. Then you will need antibiotic like tablet Nitrofurantoin 100 mg twice a day for a week along with antacid like tablet Pantoprazole before breakfast once a day for a week. I suggest you syrup Cital or Alkasol (Disodium hydrogen citrate) two teaspoon in half glass of water thrice a day for pain.

I have been suffering from pimples, acne, and scar since two years. I have many black spots on my face. Please help me. What can I do now?","Doctor":"Hi. Acne in this age is a result of overactivity of your oil glands due to hormonal changes. Additionally, manipulating with fingers, application of non-tested home remedies and dandruff can cause bigger acne with infection. You could apply Clindamycin gel twice a day to acne. A face wash like D-acne would also help if used one to two times a day. You may also require oral medications depending on the severity of acne. Scars occur due to manual picking of acne and pus-filled acne that are not treated on time. These scars are not effectively treated with creams alone. You could undergo microneedling, chemical peels or lasers from your dermatologist. Timely control of acne can prevent permanent acne scars."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Please help me in understanding a few things. I had one sexual incidence with an unknown HIV status lady.

Is CMIA better than Rapid kit test?","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for your query and I will try to clear your doubts. CMIA tests done at 24.5 and 25.5 weeks are nonreactive. It implies that you are not infected. CMIA TEST is only 4th generation tests, and Elisa tests are 3rd generation. The only test which is better than CMIA duo is RNA PCR TEST, and however, it is not required in your case. CMIA detects both p24 and antibodies. It is to find out infection at earliest possible days like say three weeks after exposure. And, this test is conclusive after 12 weeks so as in your case. It is 99.9% accurate and false negative chances are low, and after 12 weeks those are negligible.

I had a screening test for Down's syndrome which came positive with a risk of 1:69. Should we need to do a diagnostic test which is amniocentesis? What will be the percentage after birth if the amniocentesis test is negative (It means that there is no Down's syndrome)? Please see the attached report. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Usually, quadruple test is done at 16 to 18 weeks. Sensitivity at 19 weeks is doubtful. Amniocentesis is a good diagnostic test. It will be a confirmatory test, and you can be relieved for the rest of pregnancy. This is the most reliable test. Also, you can do a good anomaly scan by a fetomaternal specialist. They can diagnose any abnormalities if present. Each test has a specific time, and if it is taken at a different date, the result may vary. But amniocentesis is the most diagnostic test. I do not think there are abnormalities."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Do I need to visit a doctor for small sunburn blisters?","Doctor":"Hi. To help you better, I need to know a few more details.

I have an earthworm image in front of eyes. Please help me to clear this issue.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand that you have two questions, one concerning occasional irritation and the second is regarding a linear worm like image floating in front of your eye. My advice to you is: For irritation, use over the counter lubricant eyedrops 4 to 6 times a day. These will help reduce the irritation and are free of side effects. For the image of the worm, please visit an ophthalmologist to get your retina examined. A problem like this is usually associated with problems in the vitreous and retina. This process usually needs dilating drops to be instilled into your eye after which you will be made to wait for about an hour. This also will make your vision blurred for around 3 to 4 hours so it will be good if can have someone accompany you. Please see an ophthalmologist urgently in case you develop redness or pain or blurred vision or discharge from your eyes and if you are seeing multiple worm or raindrop like images with a sensation of seeing flashes of light in front of your eye."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had unprotected sex about 12 hours ago. No ejaculation occurred but I knew there was still a risk of getting pregnant. I am thinking of using the Yasmin pills as a form of emergency contraception. Note that I have never taken the pill before and this would be the first time. I have read that I should take four tablets of Yasmin at a time and another four tablets after 12 hours. Would this still be the same if I had never taken the pill before? What will be the possible side effects of the high amount of dosage for the first time? Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, as you have read, Yasmin (Drospirenone) can be used as an emergency pill. Even if he has not ejaculated, you still stand a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact. This regimen is called yuzpe regimen where it is suggested to take four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. You shall get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Some women who use this method experience mild nausea and maybe even some vomiting. If you throw up within one hour of taking your pills (either the first dose or the second dose), you have got to call your health care provider. There is a chance you could have thrown up the pills which would make this method ineffective. If that happens, you may need another dose and/or some anti-nausea medicine. To help prevent you from feeling nauseous, take your pills with food. It also helps if you time your second pill so that you take it just before bed. That way, you will sleep through nausea. There is also the potential for spotting, breast tenderness, and headaches. This is true with birth control pills in general and it is usually nothing to worry about. That said, if you experience more severe side effects, please call your doctor. It is always better to follow up with a health care professional when you have a reaction that concerns you."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My period is due sometime this week and I am seeing a white/ yellow discharge odorless.

It was likely alopecia areata. Saw my dermatologist last week, she said it was likely folliculitis. I have had folliculitis before in the same area and it was much different. She is the doctor. So I accepted and moved on. One small spot that has some hair growing back, small thin white hair. Yesterday, I noticed what appeared to be a bald spot in my pubic hair above the penis. When I trimmed the hair back, it revealed a quarter sized bald spot and a smaller dime sized spot. I am not sure how long they may have been there as they were somewhat masked by a longer pubic hair. So, now I have what I believe to be three spots, two below abdomen and one on beard. My concern is more of them spreading than the current spots. I am now thinking back about the annual checkup that I had with my GP six months back. I advised him that in the past year the amount of semen I produce has gone down drastically. I thought it may be a testosterone issue. He advised it was likely a result of my vasectomy the year before. Also as a part of my visit, my WBC was lower than normal, outside of the range by a couple. He was not concerned about that either. My question is whether any of these things are related: decrease in semen, low WBC, and alopecia in pubic area or all separate issues? I see no reason to go back to the dermatologist as my new spots are hidden. Based on these separate facts, is there any likelihood they are related and is there any reason to see a doctor?","Doctor":"Hello. Alopecia areata is an immune disorder and is separated from folliculitis and it has nothing to do with your semen count and low WBC. Nevertheless, please send me a few good quality photographs taken in a natural light."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a bad infection from an abscess. Due to the broken tooth infection going to my ear, there is a severe pain on the whole right side and can barely open my mouth.","Doctor":"Hello. The tooth is not in good condition (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Maybe it will go for root canal treatment or will be removed. These are only two options for the tooth. For now, I would suggest you maintain oral hygiene properly and use mouthwash after brushing twice a day. Take any antibiotic twice a day after the meal and for pain take Zerodol SP (Aceclofenac and Serratiopeptidase) tablet twice for three days. But, dental treatment is needed.  Food lodgement and chewing habits, improper oral hygiene. Needs X-ray of the tooth to know better. Grossly decayed tooth. Apical periodontitis. As per dental X-ray. Maintain oral hygiene properly, rinse mouth with salt water and turmeric mixture twice a day."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My daughter had braces for four years but her midline is off and she has a gummy smile. Her bite is fine but her teeth are not properly aligned and she does not have bone on her left side. Her orthodontist referred her to a maxillofacial surgeon who says she needs her upper jaw broken and rotated clockwise and slightly up to compensate for the lack of bone and her bottom jaw also has to be broken and rotated clockwise. It would all then be held by plates and screws. My biggest concern is that she is a beautiful girl and he says that her face will not change at all. Is that true with this kind of procedure?","Doctor":"Hi. The procedure which you mentioned is called as orthognathic surgery which is done if there is a skeletal malrelation between the two jaws which cannot be corrected by orthodontics alone. The procedure usually improves the aesthetics of the face and is predictable. The expected outcome can be seen by preparing mock up models before undergoing the procedure. In this procedure, the portion of the jaw is fractured to rotate in the desired direction and fixed using using plates and screws."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I just got my braces removed today and have been getting some heavy bleeding when brushing my teeth, should I continue to brush my teeth while it bleeds or just stop?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern regarding the dental health. Bleeding gums after removal of braces is a very common problem among all. So first of all, consult your dentist for scaling to remove local inflammatory factors. Till the time do gargles with mouthwash after every meal to maintain oral hygiene and avoid brushing to not allow bleeding."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a stent in the ureter for past three months due to possible shrinkage of a tube at one point.

I have gone through your query. I will need further details regarding what treatment you have had till now to understand your situation better. From the details available, it appears that you are on a ureteric stent due to obstruction with renal failure. The symptoms that you mentioned are the side effects of having a stent inside the ureter for a long time. The symptoms reduce with time but in some may persist. Mild blood in urine and calcium crystals in urine are also normal in patients with a stent inside. I would advise you to consult with your treating urologist regarding the next stage of treatment now that your renal function has improved to normal."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 22-year-old female who often suffers constipation to the point where I feel like I get minor external hemorrhoids that often bleed.

Sometimes I feel like it is on my back, sometimes the lateral side, and sometimes the front. It usually happens after I eat or pass a stool but I have a minor sensation of discomfort even when I am just sitting. All of this has been getting a lot worse the past couple of days. I often feel nauseated too. I think I may have diverticulitis, however, I am not sure how common it is for my age. I also feel like I have a small localized swelling on the LUQ that hurts when I press on it. I am not sure what is wrong and I really want to go get some tests done but I do not feel safe going to a hospital with certain circumstances.","Doctor":"Hello. I think you are overthinking about your symptoms. To be conscious is good but to be over conscious may fall in the category of anxiety and is not good. I will advise you to be relaxed. Based on your symptoms, I do not feel anything to be worried of. Considering your age and symptoms of constipation and feeling something more probably pointing towards hemorrhoids or some local pathology. But physical examination and maybe flexible sigmoidoscopy would be appropriate to confirm underlying pathology or maybe online video consultation with gastroenterologist if you are worried about going to the hospital. I will advise you following general measures to follow that will help you. 1) Try to relax. Do not overthink. There is nothing serious we are thinking of. 2) Take fibers. Increase it in the diet in the form of vegetables. Add Ispagol in your diet. 3) Avoid constipation. 4) Take plenty of water. 5) Do regular walk, exercise inside your home if you can not go outside. 6) Do not strain in the restroom. 7) Take a sitz bath daily.

I know it is a bit hard for you at this stage after wisdom tooth surgery. Some of the times the wisdom tooth surgery is a little aggressive because the tooth is lying deep into the bone and to remove it a lot of work has to be done. And some of the bone has to be removed to achieve this. But do not worry this is a temporary phase and you have been through most of the hard time. Hot and cold application in the beginning may help to reduce the pain and swelling. You can still apply the cold application. You can buy a cold pack in the drug store, put it in the freezer and then apply on the area for at least 10-15 minutes. Also, take the pain killer your doctor gave you. In case you do not have any prescription medicine left, try over the counter painkiller like Ibuprofen 400 mg at least three times a day. Use Listerine mouthwash and clean the area with a soft brush. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

For that, further workup can be done in form of serum iron, TIBC (total iron binding capacity), and ferritin estimation. I need to know her hematocrit and RBC value as well to guide you further. You need to correct anemia with Iron or B12 supplement according to the need. Tiredness and dyspnea are because of low Hb level.  High lymphocytes and low platelet can present in a viral infection.

After reviewing my x-rays, the doctors informed me that I have pulmonary fibrosis. Is this indeed something that can be diagnosed by x-ray? I am taking Topamax 200 mg, Ambien 10 mg one tablet at night, Pro-Air inhaler, and Medrol dosepak.","Doctor":"Hi. Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic, and progressive disease of lungs with unknown etiology. Clinical, physiological and radiological criteria diagnose it. When there is a suspicion of pulmonary fibrosis, a chest x-ray is the first investigation. To confirm the diagnosis, a high-resolution CT scan is done, which can show the abnormalities found in the airways of the lungs. An open lung biopsy is one of the useful methods. However, there may be variations in the histology, and this can make it difficult to diagnose it. In your case, the history of illness, physical findings of late wheezing after a productive cough, combined with specific findings on x-ray and CT scan have pointed to the diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis. Kindly consult the pulmonologist before the worsening of the condition."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 21 years old. Before two years, I went to a dermatologist for my acne problem.

Since your acne is not getting controlled by the topical application, I recommend you go for oral treatment. You can start with a course of tablet Azithromycin 500 mg on three consecutive days in a week for four to six weeks. It will help you by keeping your face dry. Avoid applying cream or moisturizer.

Is this normal to have this much discharge so close to my past period?","Doctor":"Hello. The presence of smell and bleeding with discharge after your menses have stopped, indicates a possibility of cervicitis with bacterial vaginosis (infection).

This type of viral diarrhea usually does not require antibiotics and settles within three to five days."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I was going through follicle stimulation. My doctor started with Siphene 100 mg for five days, moved to FSH injections 75 for five days and when there was not enough growth in follicles she asked me to inject Humog 75 for two days. However, I got my periods the day I took the first Humog injection. Is it normal to get the period mid follicle stimulation cycle?","Doctor":"Hi. Getting periods in between only means that the follicles were not healthy enough. This is usually triggered by poor ovulation induction. Endometrial growth depends on the estradiol release from the follicles. So if follicles are not good, estrogen levels are not correct, so, the endometrial lining will not be healthy enough. In short, I would suggest, if I may, just forget this cycle. During the next cycle, it is better not to have injections as the ovarian response will be poor if stimulation is given every month. Month next to that, have CCQ (Clomiphene citrate) 100 mg from the third day of periods and at the same time start on HMG (Menotropin) or Humog (human menopausal gonadotropin) 75 or 112.5 IU. Further dose depending on follicles response."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was in working abroad until five years ago, where I was infected with fever. Since then, there are a lot of changes in my body.  Severe body aches, that too the joints. Acid reflux. Hairy type skin peeling on mouth inner side. Burning sensation under my foot. That too on the back end of the foot. The food when I am sharing with others causes severe viral fever with severe cough to those who are taking that food or using the same utensils uncleaned used by me. When I am near someone they are also getting cough and throat congestion. But I am not having any fever continuously, occasionally in a span of three or four months I am infected with fever.  I have taken all the tests including TB but all the results show negative, even the ESR shows normal value.The liver only shows slight enlargement. I am suffering from this since five years and whoever I meet or share my utensils or food with are definitely affected. My liver function test shows slightly increased values.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, do not worry about it. I do not think you are suffering from any major disease. Regarding transmitting the infection to others, I think it is just a coincidence since your ESR and other parameters are normal ruling out active infection and also sharing utensils will not cause coughing and all. It mainly occurs due to airborne transmission, and these viruses are always present in the air which can cause such infection to susceptibles. For body ache and joint pain, you should get vitamin D tested and we shall start supplements after confirming the deficiency. Your other complaints like burning and peeling of skin are likely due to other vitamins deficiency. So, at present, you should have: Tablet Zevit (Zinc and Vitamin B complex) once a day for two weeks. You should measure the body temperature whenever you feel feverish if it is normal then rules out a fever. For your reflux problem, you should avoid fatty, oily and spicy diet. Have a walk after having food instead of taking rest. Have multiple small meals instead of heavy meals. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Lots of green leafy vegetables, and fruits. Avoid smoking and alcohol, if any. You should get prescribed:Tablet Pan DSR 40 mg (Pantoprazole and Domperidone) or Esomeprazole and domperidone combination before breakfast once a day for two weeks. If not adequately relieved, then you should add syrup Sucral O or Gelusil two teaspoons three times a day for a week. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.

But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

He is a diabetic patient. He has a frequent low-grade fever associated with pain in the right side of the front abdomen starting just below the lungs. He also had significant weight loss in the past two months. He has also developed a breathing issue suddenly while talking and gets tired easily after performing minimal tasks. He was recently admitted in a hospital where he underwent all the necessary tests and the USG of the whole abdomen which reported a SOL of size 42 Ã 35 mm in the right upper lobe of the liver and no other complexities. Further, he has taken a CECT scan where the report came as mild pleural thickening and minimal effusion seen on the right posterior costal wall of lower thorax and a SOL of size 10 Ã 9 Ã 11 cm which is hypodense in nature having a rim and a centripetal enhancement seen in right lobe of liver devoid of calcification or cystic or necrotic degeneration in the right lobe and the radiologist commented as the nature of the SOL suggestive of hemangioma. He has undergone an AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) test which gave a reading of 1.28 ng/mL. Also, he had a serum ferritin reading of 864.5 ng/mL. He has also undergone colonoscopy due to occult blood in stool and was found alright. He is discharged from the hospital with some medication. Please guide me with the further procedures as he is still facing issues with his health.","Doctor":"Hi. Sorry to hear about your father's symptoms. I have checked the attached photos thoroughly (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I agree that his symptoms are due to SOL (space occupying lesion) in the liver which is most likely a hemangioma. I will reassure you that the lesion is not malignant. However, a ruptured hemangioma is a severe condition. Most of the cases, there is conservative therapy for treating the symptoms. It is followed by repeating the ultrasound after one month, three months and then every six months to identify any increase in size. Usually, lesions less than 6 cm are treated conservatively. Surgery is the treatment for the lesions more than 6 cm, rapidly growing lesion, ruptured hemangioma or severe uncontrolled symptoms. I recommend Paracetamol for the pain and fever. Please send me the CBC (complete blood count) report to exclude the ongoing infection."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 7 years old with -7 power myopia. Can it be corrected naturally?","Doctor":"Hi. Myopia is a progressive condition, and the progression depends on the pattern of eye growth and development, which is not predicted accurately. Avoid keeping books, and mobile phones very close to the eyes while reading. Sitting very close to the TV or computer must be stopped. It is a well-known fact that near work increases the myopia progression. Keep the glasses on throughout the day except while sleeping. Young children will be susceptible to a weakness in the nerve of vision called as amblyopia. It can be easily prevented by wearing glasses and treated with patching. A low dose Atropine eye drops (0.01 %) can be used. It is recommended in high myopia and in children who seem to progress in myopia. This drug has minimal side effects, with the most important one being tachycardia and the other common one being an allergy to the medication. In case of any other doubts, please send me a picture of the glass prescription, any other investigations, and the doctor's records."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have just received results back from a blood test that says my red blood cell count is quite high.

My doctor just said to quit smoking and come back in 12 weeks for another test.","Doctor":"Hello. High RBC (red blood cells) count can be due to the smoking habit. In smoking, oxygen delivery to tissue is decreased. So RBC is elevated by increase erythropoietin. A headache and dizziness in your case also seem to be due to smoking. So, it is advisable to stop smoking immediately.

I brush my teeth twice daily, morning and before sleep. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. I would like you to go to your nearby dentist and get it confirmed if it is decay or stains. If it is decay, then your dentist might suggest you get some dental fillings done. If it is just stains that you are noticing, then the stains could be removed by dental scaling, that is, professional cleaning. Decay can be formed due to lots of food impaction in the back tooth regions which is a very common complaint. Sometimes, even though we are regular with brushing, there are areas where the brush cannot reach. So, it is advisable for you to consult your dentist at the earliest.

By going through your query, I could understand that you are experiencing flashes of light and blurring of vision. Most of the patients visiting our clinic with a single episode of flashes do not have any abnormality, although we advise them to undergo a detailed retinal examination as soon as possible to rule out retinal detachment. Kindly let me know if the blurring of vision is gradual or sudden and also associated with any pain around the eye, watering, redness of the eye. Are you using any glasses, do you experience any headache? Are you experiencing black spots in the eye or experiencing a sudden drop of vision like a curtain falling down in front of your eye?

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time.

I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Please answer my questions. What is your BP (blood pressure) usually? What is your daily routine? Do you have the habit of smoking and alcohol? From the above reports, I can find out a few abnormalities like insufficient vitamin D, low vitamin B12, prediabetic status, mildly increased cholesterol, mild renal dysfunction, slight hypothyroidism, and BMI (body mass index) in obesity range. These come under a broad category of metabolic syndrome. Now, it is not of immediate concern, and it will not cause an immediate problem. But if neglected, this can lead to a future cardiac and renal problem, diabetes and stroke. Most of these conditions are related to lifestyle. Lifestyle modification includes quitting the habit of smoking (if you are) and limiting the practice of alcohol intake. Do the daily exercise for half an hour. Follow a diet modification with low salt and high fiber with little fat. Have a high fruit intake. Also, take vitamin B12 and vitamin supplements. Try to do anti-TPO (antithyroid peroxidase) levels to see whether there is a need for thyroid medication or not. Try to do 24-hour urine protein levels.

Your urine culture report shows that it will be sensitive to Norfloxacin. Klebsiella is a very resistant bacteria. You will need a prolonged treatment with Norfloxacin.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

Can you suggest me what should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through what you have mentioned and understand your anxiety about your son's eyesight. - 11D and - 8D are high myopic powers and the chances are that the power may progress as your son is still young. My advice to you is: 1. Avoid reading or holding objects very near to the eye. This will cause myopia to progress faster and will worsen the condition. 2. Every six monthly visits or follow up visits as per doctors advise. Since the myopia is of a high degree, there will be excessive stretching and degeneration of the structures of the eyeball. This can cause problems such as retinal detachment. Regular follow-ups help us in picking up changes faster and in preventing such complications as retinal detachment. 3. Ask your son to regularly self-check his vision. This is done by closing each eye one at a time and observing how a particular object or letter looks. In case he is able to pick up any change or drop in vision, please bring it to the notice of your ophthalmologist. 4. Urgently visit your doctor in case of a sudden drop in vision or multiple raindrops like images in front of the eye or experiences of light flashes in front of the eye. The main concern now is to observe and ensure that his maximum vision potential with glasses is as close to 6/6 or 20/20 as possible. After his power has stabilized, there are multiple options to remain glasses-free. For example, he can undergo implantable contact lenses (ICL) procedure and be rid of glasses."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son had granules of the pituitary gland, and it was removed through the nose by surgery around a month ago.

Now, he is on Hydrocortisone 5 mg mane, Vespar 10 mg nocte, Thyroxine 100 ug mane and KCL one tablet twice daily. What should we do now?","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query and understand your concerns. Although headaches are common after pituitary gland tumor, the presence of on and off headaches after one month of surgery indicates more possibility of continuing migraine rather than surgery. This is evidenced by triggering of headaches following sun exposure and delay in meals. Above all the positive history, migraine for years indicates that a migraine is continuing and pituitary adenoma was just a coincidental finding which was revealed on MRI scan. Regarding management of a migraine, I feel the same treatment which was effective in the past for migraines should be continued. In case no such progress achieved till date, then we need to look for alternative options to control migraine headaches.

Is it possible for you to upload a picture of your neck or for the fact any picture from the internet highlighting that area? It seems like it might be a swollen gland, which can happen even with common cold or flu. But, it is hard to confirm without a picture and exact location."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 25-year-old male. Recently, I went for a trip and ended up in engaging in sexual activity with a female sex worker. I first did a vaginal intercourse with a condom and then oral sex using the same condom (with the vaginal fluids). After 15 minutes, I got an unprotected oral sex from the worker. Could this lead to HIV transmission because the initial vaginal fluids may be present in her mouth? Before the act, both had a shower and mouthwash. Should I start the PEP medication?","Doctor":"Hi. First, protected sexual activity carries negligible risk. Protected or unprotected oral sex carries no risk as HIV transmission through oral sex is none considering she has no oral bleeding or ulcers and you have no ulcer on the penis. Shower bath will not protect from HIV and vaginal fluids in the mouth during oral sex carries no risk as these fluids will be neutralized by lipases in saliva.  PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) is indicated only within 72 hours of the act and not effective after that period. You have a very negligible risk (0.01 %) of transmission considering she might be reactive."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have some irregularly textured skin on my face that are not even visible if you are not trying to find them. Are they scars or damaged pores? Also, I have been using Dapsone for a month now and have applied BP 205 and Adapalene 0.1 in the past. Can these cause such texture damage? And what is the red part (encircled), is it PIH or something else? Also does Adapalene 0.1 alond with Clindamycin 1 improves skin texture?","Doctor":"Hi. You have post inflammatory hyperpigmentation with minute acne scars that are very few (attachment removed to protect patient identity). For PIH (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation) you can use Aziderm (Azelaic acid) 20 % gel in the morning. For acne scars, you can continue Adapalene 0.1 % gel at night. If you want you can go for chemical peeling and derma roller."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have a complaint of severe headache migraine like when a headache starts, there is swelling around the eye. What can this asymmetry be due to? Can this be glaucoma?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through what you have mentioned. There are several causes which cause an asymmetry of optic cup to disc ratio, but glaucoma is the main disease that we try to rule out as it sometimes manifests without any pain and hence can go undetected. Migraine headaches are due to blood flow abnormalities in the region of the face and inside the cranium (skull bone). Hence, there is a chance that this eyelid swelling could be due to a migraine. My advice to you is: 1. Since you have been detected to have optic disc asymmetry, kindly follow up with your ophthalmologist every six months or as instructed by him or her. You may also be offered additional testing to confirm if your disc asymmetry needs to be treated or if it should just be monitored. 2. Continue with your anti-migraine medication and watch for any changes in your eyelid puffiness. In case there are changes such as longer duration or if you have an itchy sensation or feel like rubbing your eyelid, then please bring it to the notice of your ophthalmologist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am having persistence cough for over four weeks and high ESR of 66 and X-ray result show swollen lymph nodes as well but just finished using antibiotics and cough syrup.

Your mentioned symptoms could be from a bronchitis-like inflammatory condition and so, enlarged lymph nodes can be present. Your symptoms have improved and so, now no further medication is advised and close clinical monitoring is advisable. Take one teaspoon turmeric powder with milk daily. Drink lots of water. Steam inhalation done three times a day with warm water. Enlarged reactive nodes will be returned to normal in size in few days. So repeat your X-ray after a few days.

Help me. I am really worried.","Doctor":"Hi. The emergency pill, I-pill can be used only once in a cycle. If the I-pill is used more than once in a cycle, it not only does not work, it also upsets the body hormones and can cause irregular bleeding. It is best to consult a doctor and check for pregnancy first. At the same time, you can also get advice to correct her menstrual cycle. It is also advisable to follow a reliable form of birth control to avoid this situation in the future. Taking birth control pills is a safe and easy method both for regularizing menstrual cycles and having protection against pregnancy.

It looks like an upper urinary tract infection. Get your urine test done in a place where they check whether it is E.Coli (Escherichia Coli) or ESBL (Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases).

I got my blood test done for an overall health checkup. I am attaching my reports. I can see my heart and cardiology reports are not good. Can you please tell me whether there is anything abnormal?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your urine examination is normal. Your uric acid level is high, for that you are advised to take more vegetables and fruits and less meat (take low proteins in diet). Liver enzymes are high that can be due to certain medications or liver infection due to some viruses such as hepatitis B, or hepatitis C. Thyroid profile looks normal. The lipid profile is also high and deranged. It can be managed through lifestyle changes (more physical activity and weight loss). Persistently elevated lipid levels are harmful to the heart and blood vessels. Low iron levels may lead to anemia, and it is also harmful to the heart and its pumping function. Other markers look fine. I would suggest you go for lifestyle changes and that too on an urgent basis. Persistence is the key to success here. It may or may not be an overnight change, but it is mandatory."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My back tooth has developed a deep cavity within a few months.

I can understand your concern. As per your history and symptoms, it seems to be acute apical periodontitis, that means that you have an infection in that tooth and the associated area. For immediate management and recovery take the following medications. Take tablet Augmentin 625 mg (Amoxycillin with Clavulanic acid) twice daily for five days and tablet Lyser D (Diclofenac with Serratiopeptidase) twice daily for three days. In case, if you are taking any medication for some other reason, and if you are allergic to these drugs too, avoid this medication."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My ophthalmologist had detected a suspicion of glaucoma more in my right eye compared to the left eye and have optical nerve cupping of 0.4 in left and 0.6 cupping in the right. I had undergone LASIK surgery before six months. In tonometry, I had IOP around 17 (puff test). My report for RNFL analysis has shown borderline changes.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). As you have already said, there are few variations in your OCT (optical coherence tomography) RNFL (retinal nerve fiber layer) test more on the right eye compared to the left. So, you are advised for visual field tests and diurnal variation test. As you have done a suspicious disc with 0.6 and 0.4 CDR (cup to disc ratio) but had normal pressures, so your doctor has asked you to do RNFL test as he suspected an entity in you called normotension glaucoma. The results were shown to be in borderline. Hence, your doctor has advised you to do more tests to know the functional status of your optic nerve. One of them is the visual field test. It detects the amount of the word that is perceived by you at a given instance. The second test is done to identify variations in your intraocular pressure overnight. These are more specific tests for glaucoma and can help to monitor your condition better. There are chances to show few abnormalities in these two tests apart from RNFL. You still need six more months to monitor and repeat testing before you get started with eyedrops for your condition. Normotension glaucoma is a chronic and progressive disease. Its diagnosis and monitoring need accurate documentation of your optic nerve function over a prolonged period. Hence, repeat testing every six months."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had unprotected sexual intercourse on the day 1 of my period, and the penis was rubbed against my vagina.

When should I expect my next period since I took the pill on day 2 of my period? I have my cycle for 24 to 26 days. Should I expect withdrawal bleeding in this case? And what can I do to get my regular periods? Are there any chances of getting pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi. As you have taken I-pill early on the day 2 of your cycle, you may or may not get a withdrawal bleed. The chances of pregnancy are minimal as you are in your safer period with regular cycles. If you do not have a withdrawal bleed, then get a serum beta hCG test done after eight days, to rule out pregnancy. If it is negative, wait for your menses, which may be delayed this time."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is suffering from left kidney inflation. The doctor instructed us to have a follow up with abdomen and pelvic ultrasonography. When my son was 9 months old, his left kidney got enlarged measuring 6.8 cm. We visited another doctor who instructed us to keep following up with an abdomen and pelvis ultrasonography for six months. When my son was 1.5 years old, the report showed ballooned left renal pelvis with 30 mm in the maximum dimension, associated with mild calyceal dilatation and a 3.5 mm in the left lower calyceal stone was detected, an average caliber of the left ureter suggestive of left PUJ obstruction. But clinically, both the kidneys were of average size and shape. When my son was 1 year and 8 months old, we took a renal isotopic scan. I have attached the report. My son is not having pain. I do not think that this is a severe condition to undergo a surgical operation. Now my question is whether my son is still suffering from inflation of the left kidney or not? If yes, is it possible to get cured by medicine or it needs surgery? What is the calyceal stone, and is it harmful to my son? Is there any treatment by medicine or it must be cured by surgery? The doctor whom I follow told that my son needs to undergo a surgical operation to widen the ureter. Is it true? Should he need surgery?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your son has an obstruction in the left kidney which has led them to become inflated. It is a birth defect, and it usually does not show symptoms. It has been detected early in your son before it gets started affecting the functions of the kidney. I would suggest you consult your urologist. Your son needs surgery on the left kidney to widen the ureter. When it is done earlier, less will be the damage to the kidney. The calyceal stone is also a result of the obstructed urine flow and should be taken care of during surgery. There is no medical treatment for this condition. It has to be corrected by the operation only."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, We have a 9-month-old baby girl. She has five brown marks, two of them are 2 cm size and the other three of 0.5 cm.

Have a low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly thrice a day for a week or twice a week. If the BP (blood pressure) is persistently more than 140/90 mmHg, then you should be on medicines for it.

Do you have any history of sinusitis or use of glasses for near vision?"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 34 years old male. I am married. My weight is 85 kilograms, and the height is 5 feet. My resting BP is 130/80 mmHg, and pulse is 80 beats per minute. I do not have any tension at my home or the office, and I am very relaxed. I am suffering from left side chest pain along with upper back pain (left side only) with left shoulder and sometimes with left-hand pain. When I bend my head forwards, I feel tightness and pain in the upper body and left shoulder backside. I have light-headedness, fatigue, and feel drowsy all over the day while sitting or standing. I have the pain on the left side for about three years. I underwent almost all tests, and all are normal. But the pain persists. I underwent heart tests including CT angiography and MRI brain. All are normal. I am attaching my X-ray of cervical spine and ECG which I underwent two days back. Kindly suggest how to reduce my pain.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your ECG is fine, and from the description of pain and test you underwent, it is a cervical pain. In the cervical X-ray, there is a straightening of the spine which is the cause for your pain. You should undergo further test like MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the cervical spine for the confirmation of diagnosis and the extent of disease. Also, vitamin D test should be done. You need neck physiotherapy, including traction and cervical belt which is better starting after MRI. Also, you should use local Diclofenac gel for the pain relief. Hot water fomentation can be done. Also, you need to take tablet Pregaba M 75 mg (Pregabalin with Mecobalamin) at bedtime, which is a nerve stabilizer and they help in symptoms control. Also, take tablet Flexon MR (Chlorzoxazone with Ibuprofen and Paracetamol) whenever needed up to two times a day for the pain relief. You should visit an Orthopedician to get relieved."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have taken a pregnancy test a few days ago and it turned out to be positive. I took two tests, just to make sure and they both were positive. I was supposed to have my period on March 29, but conception happened on March 14 and the first day of my last period was February 29. I do not feel any changes at all, is it possible that that may not be true at all? Or the tests I took were not accurate? If I got my period this April 29, what does it even mean since I already missed my supposedly period on March 29? I am currently taking Myra e and Poten cee.","Doctor":"Hello. As you checked twice for urine pregnancy test and it turned out positive, it implies you have been pregnant. It is not necessary that everyone experiences nausea and vomitings or early signs of pregnancy similarly, some may not feel any symptoms, or some have mild symptoms. The urine HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) tests are definitely an accurate way for testing pregnancy, rather than just relying on symptoms and they cannot be wrong as you had missed your periods too, and it tested positive twice. And if you are pregnant, you would not be even getting your periods again this April too. It would be advisable to get an ultrasound to confirm the pregnancy if in doubt, the site (intra or extra uterine), the gestational age, and the fetal viability. Also, you can start using Folic acid tablets. Routine antenatal investigation. Tablet Folic Acid 5 mg daily. Avoid sexual intercourse in the first three months."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, The climate is hot here. I lost my skin color. I got a lot of acne. My skin is oily and sensitive. Now, what can I do? I am using Adapalene with Clindamycin phosphate gel. Is it right for me? I always use a night cream to get my color. I am using sandalwood powder with rosewater now for my skin.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have moderate acne. I suggest you use your current topical medications and add, Vibramycin tablet (Doxycycline) 100 mg for every 12 hours, after meals. Avoid eating chillies, nuts, drinking soft drinks as well as full cream milk. There is no decrease in your skin color. Kindly give more details with a photo to this complaint."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have severe depression following a bereavement. I started to drink, and it has been a couple of days now. I am terrified of stopping it. I am taking Maxitram and Fluoxetine 60 mg. I took Librium and Omeprazole before few days.","Doctor":"Hi. The symptoms associated with alcohol withdrawal are managed by Benzodiazepines such as Librium (Chlordiazepoxide) or Clonazepam or Lorazepam. Depending upon the severity of withdrawal symptoms, the doses can be adjusted, so that you will not have the feel of withdrawal symptoms and can safely stop taking alcohol. Usually, Thiamine is advised because alcohol causes thiamine deficiency. So it is advisable to take Thiamine 100 mg three times a day. As you have recently started taking alcohol, so the withdrawal symptoms will not be too severe. Benzodiazepines reduce anxiety symptoms and help you to feel relaxed. Continue taking Fluoxetine for depression. Have an adequate sleep."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I underwent carotid endarterectomy before four months on my right carotid artery. After a doppler test, it showed 90 % stenosis. A patch was used during surgery. It seemed to be fine after surgery. On follow up, I consulted a vascular surgeon. He told me that I have a right and better recovery. But I have a pulling or a tight sensation coming from the artery or patch. The feeling is not pain, but it is a pulling or an uncomfortable feeling. Do I need to be concerned about it? Should I need to contact the surgeon? I am taking Clopidogrel 75 mg and Pravastatin 20 mg.","Doctor":"Hi. It is perfectly normal to have stretching sensation in any surgical area. You may have less sensation in the neck and lower cheek. It is advised to be careful when you shave as you might accidentally cut it."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I do not have a UTI. A test was done to check my kidney function and diabetes. I have the urge to urinate for the past one month. I urinate more in the morning, and it gets decreased during the day and at night time. I have muscle aches on the thighs, arms, and back. I have bloating and constipation for the past two months. I am taking Culturelle and Metamucil.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). If your tests have ruled out urinary infection, you may have an overactive bladder. Take a moderate amount of fluids throughout the day. Do not take a large amount of liquid at a time. Avoid taking tea, coffee, alcohol, and soft drinks if possible. Try holding your urine for five minutes longer than usual, and increase to 10 and then 15 minutes every week. For example, if you go for every 15 minutes, now try holding for 20 minutes. You can start a beta-adrenergic called Mirabegron if your doctor advises. Try to reduce weight. Avoiding constipation will help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am five days delayed now and feel light to moderate cramping for almost one week and sometimes nausea. I took the pregnancy test, the cheapest one and the result is weird because instead of a pink or red line, it shows a white line. And also I have a UTI. Is it possible that I am pregnant? And pregnancy test kit could not detect it?","Doctor":"Hi. You are right. Urine pregnancy test and transvaginal scan are unable to detect very early pregnancy. So, for that, we can use a blood pregnancy test (serum beta hCG). It is clearly detecting pregnancy status. For urine infection, you can have a urinalysis and urine culture, lots of water and cranberry juice.  If infection positive then discuss here or with a local Gynecologist. In case of bleeding with abdominal pain and positive pregnancy test, you need to report to tertiary care hospital's emergency. So do not delay. Do serum beta hCG (blood pregnancy test) now as urgent and then discuss it with your presenting symptoms."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

(My hemoglobin is 18.4 and hematocrit 55). I checked my past results and found I have had high platelets (400 to 715) for the past four years. I am very concerned about the side effects of this medication (liver and kidney since I have a history of kidney stones) and how it changes the size of the red cells. I am a 62-years-old male. Current medications I am taking are Amlodipine 5 mg, Metoprolol Succinate ER 25 mg twice daily, Aspirin 82 mg, Coq 10 and Omega 3, and Simvastatin 20 mg.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and here is my advise. In last two reports, particularly your Hb (hemoglobin), hematocrit, and platelet counts are high. So, it is suggestive of polycythemia or myeloproliferative like condition. Polycythemia can be secondary or primary. Secondary causes include cardiac disease or respiratory disease or smoking. So, it can be ruled out before moving on further. The primary cause of polycythemia includes polycythemia vera which is a malignant condition. So to be on safer side you can investigate with Jak2 and exon 12 mutation study by a molecular method to rule out polycythemia vera. The second investigation should be erythropoietin estimation. Hydroxyurea is having side effects in some patients but it is the best drug in case of essential thrombocythemia like a myeloproliferative disease."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My mother got her tooth pulled out. It has been a few hours now. But still, it is bleeding a lot. She uses a new gauze continuously, but it gets soaked in blood. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hi. No, it is not normal if the blood comes out in the same quantity after extraction. Bite down a gauze very hard at the wound for about 45 minutes. If she feels, that the blood is filling her mouth, then she needs to go back to the dentist as soon as possible. Applying ice over the area from outside can also help. Do not touch the wound. Some blood mixed with a lot of salivae is very common for a day or two, so you should be able to differentiate it."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been taking cocaine once a week for 20 years and on the 1st of last month, I started getting a cough and breathless. It was getting worse when the cocaine wore off. Anyway, I had an ECG which was clear and a 24-hour tape also clear. CT scan on lungs clear. Then I had an ultrasound and came back with mild apical anterior hypokinesis RWMA. The cardiologist said he will see me next month and did not seem bothered. Anyway, I still was doing cocaine and drinking weekends because it is the only time I do not feel breathless but on a Wednesday, when everything is out of my system, I get breathless again and heavy chest. Can you please tell me if I do not do cocaine again, will I get better or am I mucked up for life now?","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, cocaine has got a wide range of effects on the heart. So, hypokinesia means there is some damage to the heart which may be due to cocaine or may be due to coexistent coronary artery disease. So, you will need coronary angiography preferably, conventional and CT angiography is the alternative. Also, since hypokinesia is observer dependent, sometimes reported milder hypokinesia may not be actually present and false positive findings are possible. But, we should get it confirmed by further investigations. This much hypokinesia should not cause breathlessness in you, rather it appears to be related to cocaine withdrawal only. Also, I guess you do not have gastric/reflux symptoms. Cocaine withdrawal symptoms usually settle in a few weeks without treatment. It is better you reduce consumption gradually over the next few weeks, then stop, rather than abruptly stopping. So, once we rule out heart disease, then you can get back to normal life after quitting its consumption."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a swollen pocket behind the molar. I have green pus and blood pouring out of it during sleeping.","Doctor":"Hi. You have an abscess, and the cause could be either a cavity or gum problem or even impacted tooth or some other reason. It would be better if you send me the image to guide you properly. You can take Aceclofenac 100 mg twice daily after food (morning and night) for pain. Take Pantoprazole 40 mg once daily half an hour before food if you have acidity as other medicines can aggravate it. You can take Ornof (Ofloxacin with Ornidazole) twice daily for five days (finish the antibiotic course). Stop taking painkiller once the pain stops. If you are allergic to any medicine, please consult your dentist or here and then take it. Do lukewarm salt water gargling. Consult your dentist as soon as possible."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a burn on the roof of my mouth which created a blister.

Previously, I got a third-degree burn on the roof of the mouth which got healed. I am taking medicines for epilepsy.","Doctor":"Hi. Did you consume anything hot that caused it? Since you had a blister which turned into an ulcer, it can be an aphthous ulcer which is recurrent or some other lesion. I would like to see the image of that area to guide you properly. For the time being, if you have pain, you can apply Dentogel (Choline salicylate and Lidocaine) before consuming food. It will give you relief. Avoid acidic foods and drinks like tomatoes, orange juice, and coffee. Avoid spicy foods. Avoid alcohol and tobacco products.

When I raise my hands up and throwing anything overhead, I have the pain. The pain is at the front of my shoulder, and I can put the finger on the spot that is sore. I am taking Paracetamol for the shoulder pain.","Doctor":"Hi. Keep icing the painful area frequently. The pain in the shoulder could be a muscle strain or a spasm after a prolonged period of compression possibly due to lying over that shoulder. It can be an AC joint (acromioclavicular joint) strain. Massage the area gently. Gentle stretching of the shoulder will help you feel comfortable."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I get pain in my joints like ankle and wrist occasionally.

Does this pain occur due to increased uric acid or it is some kind of arthritis like rheumatoid?","Doctor":"Hi. You have arthralgia, and it is not arthritis. This condition will have pain along with swelling. It is unlikely to occur due to uric acid. You need to do a few tests which include RF (rheumatoid factor), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), CRP (C-reactive protein), anti-CCP (anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide), vitamin D levels and TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone). There is a possibility of early inflammatory arthritis which can be confirmed by the tests mentioned above."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I need an advice and an opinion about a chest pain I have been having for the past four days. About four days back, I was at the family farm doing some cleaning. It was dusty everywhere and so when I finished, I coughed and felt the dust went inside my chest. Since then, I have been having a chest pain, right above my right nipple, the pain is kind of in the bone. So, when I press on my chest bone beneath or above my right nipple, I feel some pain. The pain sometimes comes to my neck or my side, and today it came to the left side of my chest which got me worried. The pain usually happens when I take a deep breath. It is not continuous. A month back, early morning while I was at work, it was a dusty day. Shortly after work started, I felt a pressure on my chest and a shortness of breath. So, I went to the ER, and they transferred me to the cardiology unit because my troponin was elevated. It was at 0.7. They did EKG, and it was normal. Later on that day, my troponin was elevated to 4.3. So, they did an ECO, and it was normal. The following day, my troponin was down to 3.4. They thought I had some kind of blockage and so they did a cardiac catheterization and found everything was normal. there was no blockage. I have no diabetes or blood pressure. I follow a low carbohydrate diet with intermittent fasting. My blood pressure and EKG during my stay at the hospital was normal. So, I was diagnosed with pericarditis, an inflammation of the outer part of the heart.","Doctor":"Hello. There are two possibilities in you, first is of musculoskeletal pain, which is originating from muscles and bones resulted due to coughing and stretch over the bones and muscles. And another possibility is of viral infection which commonly follows such exposures. This leads to inflammation of pleura and pericardium (lining of lungs) called as pleuritis or pericarditis. Both the pain will increase on deep breathing. I guess you do not have any fever, cough, rhinitis, etc., which may or may not be associated. Was there any history of heavy weight lifting or trauma to the chest? This is unlikely to be caused by heart blockages and does not appear worrisome. But, considering the history of pericarditis in last month, you should get one hemogram with ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), ECG, chest X-ray and troponin done especially if symptoms persist. Also, vitamin D levels, of which deficiency is very common and predispose to such musculoskeletal pain. We also need to rule out other infections of the lungs because such exposures frequently lead to infections and above investigations will help in deciding the cause. You may use Diclofenac gel or spray for local application for symptoms relief. So, overall the first possibility is of musculoskeletal pain, which I guess should settle in another 3 to 4 days and does not appear worrisome, but should be evaluated. You may need vitamin D supplements after its testing."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a keloid I guess at the center of my chest from past one year and a new one developed since a few months back.

One major problem I face with them is they rub against the shirt and irritate especially the new one. Is there a tape or something I can apply to them while exercising and going out because I also have hair on that area.","Doctor":"Hi. Keloids are a type of scars which itches or irritates when something touches it. Do not apply any tapes or plaster because if you try to remove the tape you will pluck your hair which in turn induce keloid formation. You can plan for intralesional Triamcinolone injection along with cryotherapy.this will help in reducing keloid."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Ten days back I checked my report. All reports are normal. Only platelets are 590000. I have no symptoms and no fever about that.","Doctor":"Hello. The increase in platelet count can be because of a primary cause like myeloproliferative neoplasm or secondary reactive cause. Secondary cause includes some inflammation, infection, hemorrhage or anemia-like condition. You can take a healthy diet with more vegetable and fruits for a few days. Maintain hydration with lots of water. If you have a secondary cause, then platelet count will decrease and will fall within a normal range in a few days. But if platelet count does not decrease in a few days, then you have to consult a hematologist for examination to rule out the primary cause. He will suggest you investigate with Jak-2 mutation and bone marrow aspiration study according to need. So repeat your CBC (complete blood count) after a few days."},{"Patient":"I'm 28 years old ,i got married before 2.5 years but no child, i'm trying for conceive but still i'm suffering from pcos & irregular periods.

Taking gestin will in no harm ur chances for pregnancy.But gestin is a synthetic progesterone.We prefer natural progesterones like duphaston wen u r trying for pregnancy as they r much safer.So it would be wiser to substitute gestin with a natural progesterone. U have not mentioned your thyroid band sugar profiles in the history.If not done in the last three months,it would be advisable to do those. A reduction in your weight by about 2-3 kg will also increase your chances for pregnancy.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering from runner's knee. I am wondering about taking a break from training. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. You are suffering from runner's knee for which you should get investigated with knee joint digital X-ray. Take rest. Avoid actions that aggravate pain like running, prolonged standing, and sitting. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like Ibuprofen can be taken for pain and inflammation relief. Ice can be applied to get relieved from pain. A Physiotherapist can guide you with stretching exercise. I suggest you consult an Orthopedic surgeon for an examination."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I recently went to an ophthalmologist to have a foreign body removed from my cornea. I have been applying the overnight cream and drops during the day but on day four, my vision appears to be more blurry. Is this a normal part of healing?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through what you have mentioned, new onset of blurring on the day four is not a thing we normally expect. It could be due to a variety of reasons, the most common being increased tearing in your eyes due to inflammation, and the most important being a progression of ulceration of the cornea or corneal edema. My advice to you is to continue using your current medication. and re-visit your ophthalmologist as soon as possible to enable them to have a review.  Measures you can take in the meantime are to wear good quality polarised glasses or atleast your work site safety gear while you are working so as to not let any dirt and debris get into your eye, further worsening the situation. In case you are experiencing difficulties opening your eyes in the morning because they get stuck together, use warm water to clean away all the discharge. Also, always keep your hands clean. Do not rub or touch or do any meddling with your eyes. This can incite a very powerful inflammation once again worsening the situation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, The patient is my mother, age 58, with chronic psoriasis which is under control. She has been having right foot swelling for the past two months. Her left feet is normal. Initial diagnosis at local clinics was an infection and severe arthritis. She was put on anti-inflammatory, antibiotics and antifungal cream. There was some symptomatic relief but the swelling did not resolve. X-ray of her feet was reported mild bone degeneration. Otherwise no other significant pathology. She was admitted to the hospital two weeks ago. FBS, ESR and uric acid were reported as normal. She was put on cryotherapy and physiotherapy. She has been discharged to home now. Her condition is slightly better but the pain and swelling did not resolve completely. She has a few more cycles of physiotherapy to follow. She remembers spraining her right feet two weeks before the entire episode of the swelling started. As she did not feel any pain or discomfort immediately after the incident, she just ignored the sprain incident. She also had a hysterectomy done two years ago due to calcified fibroids which caused occasional leg swelling at that time. Please advise what has to be done.","Doctor":"Hi. I have reviewed your health query and can understand how worried you are about your mother. This seems to be due to the foot sprain she inflicted in the recent past (attachment removed to protect patient identity). She might have caused a damage to the soft tissues of the right foot. She has got swelling of the foot due to local inflammation of the soft tissues of the foot. She should keep up with the physical therapy and cryotherapy as this would assist her to relieve this inflammation. She should also keep taking medications as these medications not only relieve the pain but also inflammation. She should keep the right leg up while laying down and should not hang the leg down while sitting. This change in leg position would help a lot as this avoids pooling of blood down due to gravity. Pooling of blood leads to more swelling in feet. There is nothing more you need to do in this situation. Just keep up with the cryotherapy and physical therapy. It would take her back to normal life very soon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 21 years old female and interested in starting birth control pills. I have done all my checkups and everything was okay for me to start them when I get a period. But my periods became light and irregular and I could never predict when I am going to have one, so it has been a conflict when I should start the pills. Also, I want to become sexually active, but I do not know whether the pills will protect me from pregnancy if I take them on any day of the cycle. I want to protect myself this coming month but I do not know will and how much would they be effective if I did not start them on my period? And is it okay to stop birth control after the first pack, due to the fact I have a long distance relationship and do not need to be constantly protected?","Doctor":"Hello. Ideally, birth control should be started from day 3 of your cycle regularly to stay protected. It is mandatory to start the pack in the proliferative phase. However, if started by seventh or eighth day, then an additional barrier contraceptive is advised to allow the effect of the pill to ensure thereby preventing pregnancy."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 28 years old, and I am suffering from blood pressure and high cholesterol. I am taking Telvas H 40 and Rozustat daily. I am taking two garlic cloves with warm water. Yesterday, when I checked my BP, it was 140/70 mmHg. Is it normal or high?","Doctor":"Hi. It is a borderline reading, and you need to check it frequently. Have a low salt diet and monitor your blood pressure regularly thrice a day for one week. Then follow it once or twice a week. If the BP (blood pressure) is persistently more than 140/90 mmHg, then the medicines have to be hiked.

My doctor hasn't mentioned anything about becoming addicted and I didn't ask when I was in hospital. However, because of the pandemic, I can't go and ask my doctor if there is a risk and I wanted to make sure that I don't suffer from craving steroids after I've come off my prescription.","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to icliniq. The dosage of prednisolone prescribed to you must be according to your body weight which is usually 1 Mg per kg or in same cases the physician may prescribe an even higher dosage depending on the underlying disease. The body definitely gets used to (addicted) long term steroids like prednisolone and therefore we cannot stop these drugs suddenly and abruptly. So your doctor will slowly taper down the drugs depending upon the disease response like he will bring down the 60 to 50 mg followed by 40 mg and so on. Iâd gradually decreased to low doses the body gets used to it. Although steroids have short and long term side effects they are usually helpful for the disease they have been prescribed for as your doctor would have explained it to you before starting them."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I stopped drinking for a few days. Yesterday, I drank three drinks with a margarita and a couple of glasses of wine. I have not eaten dinner and went to bed. I woke up at 5 AM with a feeling of nausea. I vomited a few times, and I noticed a few small pink streaks. I think it might be blood with the vomiting. Do I need to go to urgent care?","Doctor":"Hi. It is likely gastritis caused by irritation due to alcohol. These pink streaks are less likely to occur as blood in vomiting. It is usually mixed well and dark colored due to acid. Even if it is blood, it may be a minor erosion in the GI (gastrointestinal) tract. It is usually not worrisome, and it will settle with antacids. However, there is no harm in getting yourself examined in ER (emergency care) especially if you are having recurrent vomiting or if the blood reappears, with severe abdominal pain. Get your BP (blood pressure) checked once if you have electronic BP apparatus at home. Have plenty of water, avoid spicy food, and soft drinks. Have some antacids like tablet Pantoprazole or Lansoprazole twice a day for three to four days and syrup Gelusil (Aluminium hydroxide with Magnesium hydroxide) three times a day."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 8 weeks pregnant.

You can take Paracetamol 500 mg up to three tablets maximum for the pain relief. But you need to consult your Gynecologist first for the advice. High dosage of Codeine is harmful during pregnancy at early stages. The best way is to visit a dentist and get an access opening done. My opinion is to go with Paracetamol 500 mg."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had this on my stomach for about two months now. I am wondering what it is.","Doctor":"Hi.

Is there any fever or weight loss? How is the appetite?"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My baby is 6 days old and he is suffering from loose motion since today.","Doctor":"Hi. Basically, if it is watery loose motion, either it is viral induced or milk intolerance. In a 6-day-old baby, if mother's milk is exclusively given, not to worry about it as it can simulate like a loose motion in breastmilk-fed infants. Only you have to worry when the baby becomes weak, dehydrated and starts vomiting."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My child is 15 days old and is a premature baby boy. The current weight is 2.010 kg.

It seems that he has loose motion. As a home remedy, we have given him Nutmeg in mother milk. Please suggest what we have to do and is there any medication for it.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. Your baby is absolutely normal. Baby's gut is in a transition phase of maturation, where motions from 0 to 8 times a day are normal. Continue breastfeeding, giving other than breastfeeding can be disastrous. Any home remedy is not recommended for six months. Mother's milk is sufficient for the baby, and he does not need anything other than that for six months."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Based on your obstetric history , it is necessary to evaluate the cause for your recurrent miscarriages. But please don't be disheartened if sometimes no cause is found which happens quite a lot of times. Dear, Progesterone injection will never cause miscarriages as progesterone is the hormone that is required for the continuation of pregnancy and act as a support for pregnancy. So the most common causes for recurrent miscarriages can be either Thyroid hormonal abnormalities or impaired blood glucose levels, or sometimes immune causes like APLA syndrome. As per your LMP, you are exactly 6wks pregnant today, so try to get a scan to check if this is a viable pregnancy and also for dating and localisation of pregnancy, so that if viable we can start with progesterone support in the form of oral progesterone supplements to sustain this pregancy. Also I have mentioned the blood test that you need to undertake apart from the routine Antenatal investigations to look for any abnormalities I mentioned above. Please do get them done.  Please feel free to contact me in case you have any queries. - Blood group and Rh Typing, - Complete hemogram, - Hb Electrophoresis, - Urine routine and microscopy, - LFT/ RFT - 75 g Oral Glucose tolerance test ( in each Trimester). - HbA1c level, - HIV, VDRL, HBSAg, Anti HCV. - APLA work up that includes 1) Lupus Anticoagulant, 2) Beta 2 Glycoprotein IgG & IgM, 3) Anti cardiolipin antibodies IgG & IgM. - NT scan (11-13weeks), - Dual marker test ( 11-13weeks). - Level 2 Scan (18-20weeks) - to look for any structural or developmental anomalies in the fetus. - To consider progesterone supplements (either oral, vaginal or injectables) after checking viability. - Low dose aspirin or Heparin may be considered after Ultrasound for viability & the blood tests evaluation. - Avoid intercourse in the first trimester. - Small meals at frequent intervals to avoid nausea or bloating."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have what looks like to me a broken eye vessel in my left eye but I want to be sure that what it is. I have had it for about 8 to 10 days now. It is annoying. I need it to be gone. There is some pressure behind the eye that is more of an annoyance than pain. The past few nights, I have been using an eye patch when I sleep to protect it in case I rub it during my sleep. I also have used over the counter artificial tears as needed but not every day. Please, what do you think it is?","Doctor":"Hello. I have looked at the pictures uploaded by you (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You should not worry. It is not a serious condition. You have developed a sub-conjunctival hemorrhage. It can be caused due to many factors, but a mild injury to the eye during sleep is the most common cause. Also if you have high blood pressure, then it is more common. It should resolve on its own after 10 to 15 days. You can continue using lubricant drops. Regarding the pressure behind the eye. I would suggest you get checked for glasses by an optician and wear them regularly if required.

Currently, he is taking Glyciphage 500 tablets.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. I would like to know if your father has any difficulty in passing urine like straining, thin stream or whether he has had any fever with burning sensation while urination. It is likely that being a diabetic he has a urinary tract infection which needs to be tested. Also, considering his age he will need a clinical examination by a urologist for his prostate gland to look for any enlargement or infection. If it is a UTI, it can be treated with a short course of antibiotics and he should be fine.

If you are not improving with 50 mg of Sertraline then you can increase dose of medication. You can take 100 mg of Sertraline.

You can try some nonpharmacological management like take daily 7 to 8 hours sleep, do daily exercise for 30 to 45 minutes, do meditation for 15 to 20 minutes, take healthy home cooked foods, avoid junk foods, take cold shower, spend quality time with friends and family, spend time for your hobbies like reading good books, write journal, painting, play outdoor sports, etc. Drink warm milk before sleep.

The throat is always filled with a cough and no energy. I diagnosed earlier and the doctor said that I have lower levels of vitamin D. What should I do? Height 175 cm and weight 65 to 68 kg.","Doctor":"Hello. It sounds like you have several things going on at once. First off, I do not believe that any of your symptoms are due to low vitamin D, probably 1/3 of the entire population has a low vitamin D level.  The most common cause of lower abdominal pain, especially if it is crampy in nature, is constipation. If you have had an issue in that area I would consider using a Fleet's enema or Dulcolax (Bisacodyl) suppository, as well as taking a daily fiber supplement such as Metamucil. Drinking at least six glasses of water a day, taking a walk for at least 20 minutes a day, and cutting back on milk and meat products.  The next most common cause of lower abdominal pain is irritable bowel syndrome. People with irritable bowel syndrome are usually sensitive to certain foods, usually ones that are greasy or high in fat content. Other causes of lower abdominal pain include prostate infection, diverticulitis, appendicitis, and muscle strain. If you are noticing that it hurts in your abdomen to move, cough, or go over bumps in the road in a vehicle, or if you are having a fever, or if you are feeling dizzy when you stand up, I would recommend seeing a doctor immediately. As far as your throat symptoms and cough, most common cause is allergic rhinitis, which causes postnasal drip to irritate your throat and cause a cough; treatment is an antihistamine and using an air filter machine with a HEPA filter, as well as hypoallergenic (plastic) mattress and pillowcase covers to protect against exposure to dust mites. In general, any products containing lactose have been found to make phlegm and mucus thicker, so you may wish to pay attention to that element of your diet. There are hundreds of causes for \\"no energy\\", including a low thyroid, poor sleep or diet, stress, depression, anxiety, a low blood count, a heart condition, a lung condition, or any physical or emotional stress on the body."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have some growth on my genitals.

I have been drinking heavily for a couple years, but quit about three weeks ago (the week prior to the blood test). How long would it reasonably take to get my enzyme levels back to normal ranges, and allow the liver to repair itself? Obviously, abstaining from alcohol is in my new life plan, and also eating well and trying to exercise more regularly. Should I currently be worried and seek additional help or medication or should the life changes above allow for my liver to get back to normal?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, this is alcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatitis. You need to worry. Once you stop alcohol, the levels should come down to normal in 6 to 8 weeks of complete abstinence. You should discuss with your doctor to prescribe you tablet Udiliv that contains Ursodeoxycholic acid for three months. I would recommend you an ultrasound and a check-up for hepatitis B and C via blood tests.

I have difficulty in emptying my bladder.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query and the picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It looks like a urinary tract infection which has resulted in some inflammation around the meatus. I would like to know whether you had tenderness in your prostate during an examination. It is necessary to do a urinalysis and urine culture and to start with antibiotics if there is any infection. Also, ultrasound can also help to identify any prostate enlargement.

If you wish for emergency contraception then you can opt for an emergency contraceptive pill like I-pill or Unwanted 72 (single dose), which is to be taken within 72 hours post intercourse to prevent any unplanned pregnancy. Post intake, the withdrawal bleeding usually starts in next 5 to 7 days and it indicates that she is pregnancy safe. The most common side effect which this pill has is delayed next 1 to 2 cycles and often mild headache and lower abdominal pain due to its progesterone effects. However, this can be controlled by increasing water intake.

It occurs only while he goes for a walk otherwise he is completely normal. Please help. He is currently on Concor (beta-blocker), Ascard, Lipiget, and Brilanta.","Doctor":"Hello. One of the reasons for breathlessness can be a side effect of tablet Brilinta (Ticagrelor). It happens quite frequently in patients taking it (about 13 percent of the patients to be precise). But I would suggest you not to stop the drug until the breathlessness is quite severe because it is very important to keep the blood thin and the stent open. So he should continue taking Brilinta. Another reason for breathlessness can be decreased ejection fraction, pumping of his heart, water getting accumulated in the chest and hence the breathlessness. And to make sure that this is not the cause I want you to answer my few questions. Is he having any swelling in the feet? Is he having difficulty breathing when he lies down? Does he have a cough? If the answers to any of these questions are yes and to prevent the water from accumulating in the lungs you can add a diuretic which will make him do more urine and get the water out of the lungs. But to confirm it as soon as the COVID situation settles down, you can get an appointment with your doctor for a echocardiography and get it done.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

This happened after I recovered from a cough and fever. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. It can be posterior pharyngitis or especially tonsillitis like infection. Your posterior pharynx examination has to be done. If congestion is more, then it is better to investigate with CBC (complete blood count), ASO (anti-streptolysin O titer) like further investigation. Your doctor might put you on antibiotic and decongestant course for five days. Drink lots of water. Avoid excess spicy foods. Vitamin C lozenges can be chewed frequently. Salt water gargle can be done with warm water three times a day. You can consult an otorhinolaryngologist for examination."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My 16 years old daughter is suffering from tonsillitis on a regular basis. She was prescribed antibiotics recently. After a few weeks, it became sore and swollen again. For the past few years, my daughter has ragged tonsils with continuous tonsil stones, bad breath, and sore throat. She is struggling each time, and I am worried about her future health as it is a chronic condition. She is taking Ibuprofen and Paracetamol currently.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The tonsils are congested. The crypts are deep, and it is natural for her to get tonsil stones. If it is causing recurrent symptoms, you need to get the tonsils removed. They do not serve any purpose after 10 years, and it is safe to get removed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Can you read my ECG and tell me why it says abnormal?","Doctor":"Hello.  I have thoroughly reviewed your query and can well understand your concerns. In such an EKG where not much abnormality is apparent, physical examination and clinical correlation become more valuable. It may be normal or near normal EKG. At some points in some leads it shows little deviation from normal patterns but at the same time, it does not fit into typical abnormalities. In simple words, your physician should have gone for a physical examination in order to establish a clinical evaluation of the heart. Based on that evaluation, we can say if there is anything wrong or not. Merely looking at this part of EKG (attachment removed to protect patient identity) nothing much can be said with surety. Also, the EKG machine can say it is abnormal EKG even with a slight artifact or error (even on a normal heart). That is why clinical correlation is mandatory here."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Below is the results of some of the tests and few results are highlighted. Can you please let me know why these are highlighted and what do they mean?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your reports (attachments removed to protect patient identity). In the first image, your lipid profile is absolutely fine and need not worry about the bold figure which is a ratio of two. Next, your vitamin D is low, so need to have supplements for it. You should sit in an early morning sunlight and have tablet Uprise D3 60,000 units once a week for eight weeks, then once a month for next six months. This will correct your vitamin D deficiency. In the third image, your eosinophils are mildly elevated, and RBC count is fine. Eosinophils may be elevated if you are having any allergies or if not then it may be due to worm infestations in intestines. Then it is better to deworm yourself once with tablet Albendazole once bedtime and repeat it after two weeks. Repeat eosinophils count after 2 to 3 weeks."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My husband is suffering from heredomacular degeneration. And I am pregnant and have one daughter. Will this problem also affect my unborn and daughter? Kindly suggest me. Someone told me it is a genetic disease.","Doctor":"Hello. Heredomacular degeneration refers to a broad collection of diseases which affect vision by causing problems in the macular region of the retina. Some of these diseases are known to have a hereditary predisposition. The pattern of the precise inheritance can be known if you can provide details of the eye examination and the exact diagnosis made. Coming to the question of your daughters, I am afraid they too are at risk. The best way to deal with the situation is to have regular visits to your ophthalmologist, preferably a retina specialist with a decent setup of retinal diagnostic equipment. Home monitoring: The best time to do this would be while they are watching TV or doing some work requiring visual attention, attention is required if they may object to closing one eye/ go very close to the TV/ hold books or mobiles very close to their eyes. Children need at least one ophthalmologist visit a year to screen for and pick up problems at the earliest. The earlier the problem gets detected the better is the position we will be in to prevent irreversible problems."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 61-year-old male. I have a mole on the thigh and is slightly itchy. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Moles or melanocytic nevus are genetic collections of melanocytes (the dark color producing cells). They go through a cycle of evolution with disappearance in the middle age. Increased number, size, and genetic history of cancer are the risk factors for the development of cancer called melanoma. Moles are dangerous if there is sudden change size, color, shape, border or become symptomatic. In this condition, they should be immediately removed surgically and sent for histopathological examination. Here, I see a darker mole (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I wanted to know when this mole changed its color. Though it is not large, the border is irregular. There is also some reddish area with crusts below it. When it appeared? Is it symptomatic?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was given Medroxyprogesterone. Today is my last day but I have not got my period. My doctor suggested PCOS. What shall I do next?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read and understood your problem. After taking Medroxyprogesterone, it may take up to 7 to 10 days for the period to occur after stopping it. So, you wait for a week. Oral contraceptives are a good choice for PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) if you are not trying to conceive."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My two and a half month old son is having a cold and I am giving him T-minic medicine.

No need of giving Crocin since temperature is below 100 F. If you need to give Crocin, please give Crocin syrup (100 mg/ml) 0.5 ml SOS if the temperature is above 100 F.

Because I heard many people saying that it is not good. Wearing lenses for long hours in a dusty area is also not suggested. So please help me. It is the first time for me to wear lenses.","Doctor":"Hi. From the information provided it seems that your doctor has prescribed extended wear lenses. This kind of lenses can be worn for days together. It can be removed and cleaned after a few days. You can wear it again. You have not mentioned your power prescription. Hence, I do not know whether the lenses or spectacles are better for you. There must be a reason for your doctor to prescribe lenses. If you are not comfortable with lenses, I would suggest you stick with glasses. Maintaining lenses is very important, and it requires diligence on your part. For aesthetic purposes, there are other options too to avoid wearing glasses which you can discuss with your Ophthalmologist.

When I take my car, I wear my earplugs. When someone speaks a bit loudly, I wear earplugs. When I am going to a commercial center or supermarket, I wear it too. Can these kinds of sounds hurt my hearing? I stopped hearing loud noises like a music festival. Is it enough? Can I live my life as everyone without losing my hearing? How should I manage my life without making my hearing worst?","Doctor":"Hi. It is a combination of intensity and duration that causes acoustic trauma or noise-induced hearing loss. If you subject your ears to high-intensity sounds for long durations, then, you are hurting them more. Ideally, you should not submit the ears to more than 90 dB for eight hours continuously. With every 5 dB increase in intensity, the time gets halved. In the case of impulse noises, you should limit the number of times you expose yourself to such sounds like blasts, fireworks, and thuds. You need not wear plugs everywhere you go out or talk to someone. Just keep away from loud noises. Eat a healthy diet. Listen to calm music if you can. The super high-frequency hearing deficit that you have will not affect your day to day life. It is picked up by the audiometry. Tinnitus is a different entity. It requires habituation. You will need to train your ears to accept it and mask it gradually. There are techniques for it. You can listen to white band noise. Listening to calming music and reducing your worries also help a lot in achieving relief from tinnitus."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have missed my periods for four days and last 20 days I have taken Ovares plus tablet.

Medical companies claim it has wonders, but trust me it is an innocent medicine with no much effect or side effect. The doctors advice that it increases the number of active eggs from ovaries. But in my own experience, eggs are God given in a specific number, no one can increase it. Unfortunately, you have not mentioned your age. Good age for lady to conceive is 19 to 35 years. After this, eggs reduce in health and number, that is when doctors claim this medicine will help. I mean to say whether you take Ovares plus or not nothing will change the periods. It is costly too. About your periods, you can wait for a maximum of seven days after periods, check your urine pregnancy, if still negative, have any of the oral combined contraceptive pills (Novelone or Dear 21 or Duoluton-L or Ovarel -G or Intimacy plus 3 ) twice a day for 10 days, throw away the 21st tablet. You will get periods within 10 days of stopping the tablet. Do not worry about any side effect. These hormones are the same produced by the body. If not checked have thyroid profile and serum prolactin checked early morning, empty stomach. These hormones can interfere with normal ovulation. If it is the doubt that you have adequate eggs in ovaries, check serum AMH (anti-mullerian hormone)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was having spotting most of the month, then heavy bleeding for two days.

The doctor thought it was my liver and did blood work, everything was fine. Then six months back I got to a point where every time I ate I was in extreme pain. I have lost around 60 lbs since then. I went and saw a different doctor, they did blood work which came back abnormal (amylase 24 IU/L, lipase 8 IU/L, narrative current ADA criteria for glucose: normal: 70-99 mg/dL, impaired fasting glucose: 100-125 mg/dL, diabetes mellitus: at or above 126 mg/dL). The diagnosis of diabetes must be confirmed on a subsequent day by measuring fasting plasma glucose, two hour PG or random plasma glucose (if symptoms are present). Sodium 139 mEq/L, potassium 3.5 mEq/L, chloride 106 mEq/L, carbon dioxide 26 mEq/L, anion gap 7.0 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 4 mg/dL, creatinine 0.70 mg/dL, glomerular filtration rate greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m*2. A persistently reduced GFR is a specific indication of chronic kidney disease. The eGFR calculation has not been validated in patients greater than 70 years. Calcium 9.1 mg/dL (8.4 - 10.5 mg/dL), glucose 88 mg/dL (70 - 100 mg/dL), protein total 6.5 g/dL (6.0 - 8.0 g/dL), albumin 3.9 g/dL (3.5 - 5.0 g/dL), alkaline phosphatase 68 IU/L (40 - 150 IU/L), aspartate aminotransferase 21 IU/L (10 - 40 IU/L), alanine aminotransferase 42 IU/L (6 - 31 IU/L), bilirubin total 0.6 mg/dL (0.2 - 1.2 mg/dL). Ultrasound impression showed probable cavernous hemangiomas in the left hepatic lobe although the ultrasound appearance is nonspecific. Recommend CT of the abdomen with IV contrast utilizing triphasic hepatic protocol. Then sent for CT and the impression is previous cholecystectomy. The focus of abnormal echotexture on recent ultrasound through the liver is felt to correlate to an area of low attenuation on CT. CT findings are nonspecific. This may represent an atypical hemangioma. Neoplasm is felt less likely. This is well visualized with ultrasound. Short-term follow-up ultrasound in 2 to 3 months recommended to ensure stability. If this is unchanged it can be followed at larger interval increments. Right renal cyst. It states I was given oral contrast, I was not. The doctor had also told me these are something I was born with. I had an ultrasound of liver and they seem nothing on my liver. So is this something I should keep worrying about and get another opinion?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, it is likely to be hemangiomas only. I think your treating doctor is right. Ultrasound is a good investigation for hemangiomas and it definitely shows its presence and also suggested by CT scan. Now, regarding your doubts, firstly ultrasound is a very observer dependent investigation. So, the findings seen by one may be missed by other. And another important thing is, hemangiomas grow with time and hormonal changes, so it might be possible that it was present but of a small size to be detected and has grown over a period of time. Next thing, if you are worried too much about it then you may get another ultrasound of the abdomen done by an independent radiologist. Also, you should get your CT scan reviewed by another radiologist for his opinion. You may ask for a CD having ct images, and get it reported so as to confirm the findings. No need to repeat CT done now. Also, follow up ultrasound should be done after three months to look for a change in size."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was diagnosed with 10 mm stone in the left ureter four years back. I started to taking following medicine: Berberis Vulg Q 10 drops three times, Hapro Xpel drops 20 drops three times (composition: Berberis Vulg 10x, Sarsaparilla 10x, Terebinthinae OL, 8x Cantharis 8x, Lycopodium 12x, and Hydrangea Arb Ã). After medicine, I got relief but I got piles. Last month I did an ultrasound and no stone was detected.

Also is taking Cystone syrup safe with these homeopathy medicines?","Doctor":"Hello. According to your query, the stone was not there in ultrasound but only pain in the kidney area. The reason for pain may be the light gravel of stones which might be in the urinary bladder or urinary tract which is not visible in the ultrasound. Do the following: Diet should be restricted with avoidance of any cold drinks, hard substances, pulses, etc. Take three doses of LYCO 200 (Lycopodium) potency for three days. Dose to be taken: One dose every day early morning without eating anything. Take three doses for three days. Do not take anything like syrup or antibiotics in between. You can take a painkiller.

However, this was usually associated with certain alcohol or foods and it has never been a problem. Then, I was a bit sick and I noticed I had developed an itchy throat and cough in the next few days which turned into quite a swollen feeling in my throat, right up inside my ears and also sometimes on the chest. It has stopped now. At first, I thought it was viral or bacterial and took apple cider vinegar, lots of vitamin C and was prescribed antibiotics, all of which made my stomach very sensitive and the acid reflux worse to the point I was also having a low-grade fever every day. I changed my diet to low acid foods, and have been using Gaviscon double and it feels somewhat better. But laryngitis has not healed. My voice is cracky and has been for a month. Another doctor has prescribed Lansoprazole. I took it one day and my tummy was quite sore. I am unsure if I should continue it? My stomach has been very sensitive since taking the antibiotics. I am at a bit of a loss of how to fix all this. Though I take soft foods and Gaviscon my throat is not healed yet. I am a 40-year-old female. The only other issue I have is the gallstone issue.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It feels like someone is crushing my spine and I have a migraine, it feels like a heartbeat. I cannot eat or drink without getting sick. I do not know what to do.","Doctor":"Hello. Both the conditions are treatable. For back pain, have you done any investigation? In obese patients, back pain is common and called lumbago. Analgesic medication and physiotherapy are beneficial for that. You have to investigate with an X-ray of the lumbar spine to rule out arthritis or degenerative lesion if present. Investigate with serum calcium and vitamin D3 level also. Low level of it also can lead to osteoporosis and so spinal pain occurs. You have mentioned that you are having a severe migraine. For relieving acute attack, if a nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug like Naproxen is not effective, then Rizatriptan 5 mg tablet can be prescribed to relieve the acute attack of migraine (although migraine has to confirmed before). To prevent repeated migraine a prophylactic like Amitryptiline can be taken. Consult a specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent.

The permanent teeth which you have now are always slight yellowish to greyish in color by nature. I saw the picture you have attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity). And your teeth seem to be perfectly alright. There are no evidences of any problem of milk bottle decay with your current teeth. With the home bleaching tray given to you, it can only bring one or two shades lighter than the original. You cannot expect miracles to happen.

First of all, we have to objectively find out whether breast milk is really less than what is required for the baby as I find this to be uncommon. If the baby is active, wetting nappy at least four to six times in a day and gaining weight adequately, these are the indications of adequate breastfeeding. If this is not the case, then we can do the following. Taking a balanced diet including fresh fruits, vegetables and plenty of fluids will help your body produce enough milk. You do not have to actually drink milk to produce milk. Spending more time with your baby will help to bond and make it easy for your body to be in tune with the process of breastmilk production and feeding as well. Demand feeding, that is, feeding as and when the baby feels hungry is a universally accepted method of feeding. This is much better than regimental, that is, scheduled feeding. There are some herbal preparations in the form of tablets or powder which can be taken after consulting your doctor. In spite of all this, if the milk secretion is not sufficient, there are certain medications which we can prescribe for you. If still there is a problem, we have to explore alternate ways of feeding the baby.

The urine is cloudy with leukocytes and nitrates positive. Do you want me to try Augmentin and Macrobid now? I would prefer to use a narrow scope or spectrum Cloxacillin versus Augmentin. I have some a little pain in the urethra and no other symptoms than the cloudy urine.","Doctor":"Hi. You are having recurrent or persistent urinary infection. It could be due to incorrect antibiotic or inadequate duration or due to prostatitis. You need to repeat a urine culture after retracting the foreskin and taking midstream sample. If your doctor can do a prostatic examination and massage, then a post-prostatic massage urine culture is the best. You also may have an enlarged private, which needs a sonography and a uroflow study. Streptococcus are usually skin contaminants. Prostatitis needs 1.5 months course of antibiotics preferably Levo or Ofloxacin. Enlarged prostate needs alpha blocker tablets. And rarely, Chlamydia can be a culprit.

Actually, it was not continuous but I recollect the durations once every five years for three months. I was taking Sebilium every night prescribed by the doctor. Again the headache is starting now. Please suggest me any preventive measures for it. Every day I get out of bed with the fear of pain.","Doctor":"Hello. I have reviewed your query. Drugs like Sibelium (containing drug named Flunarizine) is used to prevent the occurrence of migraine attacks. Drugs like Naproxen are used to relieve the pain during attacks of a migraine or a few other kinds of headaches. You need to be checked with a physician or neurologist. Depending on the severity of symptoms after examining you, he or she may advise you to continue Sibelium night time 5 mg or 10 mg dosage or any of the other drugs like Propanolol, Amitriptyline used to prevent attacks of a migraine. Sibelium (Flunarizine) has few side effects like increased sleep or drowsiness, weight gain, memory deficits, and dry mouth. Meanwhile, you may continue taking Naproxen 250 mg or Paracetamol during attacks of a headache. There are few other instructions or lifestyle changes to reduce the frequency of migraine attacks like: Take care.

What are the medicines I can use? And what are the health tips I can follow?","Doctor":"Hello. I will surely help you out. From the symptoms, you have described you most probably have food poisoning. So for vomiting and nausea you need Ondansetron or Domperidone. For fever, Paracetamol will suffice and for body ache, you should have Diclofenac with Ranitidine. Also, antibiotics need to be started. Empirical antibiotics are Ofloxacin and Ornidazole but for definite antibiotic stool culture and sensitivity is required. If you get repeated infection then some serology testing and anti-parasite drugs are required. There is no specific type of fever in food poisoning but for details, you can visit a nearby hospital and get your work up done and attending doctor will help you out with more details.

As per my knowledge, there was no ejaculation of sperm and to be on the safer side, she took an I-pill six hours prior to sex. But, she has not got the period for this month yet. Is this due to pregnancy? Or should we wait some more days? Is the delay in her periods because of the I-pill?","Doctor":"Hi. You can wait for another two days for the menses to come. Many times a fluctuation of two to three days is seen even in the normal cycle. In case they are further delayed, then get a urine pregnancy test at home. If it is positive, then consult a gynecologist immediately. If negative, get a USG (ultrasound scan) done just to be sure as it will show gestational sac if there is pregnancy.

I had a dipstick urinalysis a month ago and was cultured. All came back negative. But, I have low back pain.Â Also, my SG was 1.008. Is that low?

Yesterday morning I started feeling sharp stabbing pain inside my breast near the nipple every hour or so. Yesterday night I started to feel the pain 10 times worse and more frequently. I also noticed that my nipple started to turn red. The pain goes away and then comes back. I would like to add in that my mother was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma about 5 months ago in her left breast and she has had it removed and has now started chemotherapy. This obviously makes me more worried about my symptoms. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello. Invasive ductal carcinoma at 18 years of age is unlikely even though you have a history in family recently. The pain in the left nipple area which had a sudden onset in last few days and have been decreasing with a localised redness around nipple goes more in favour of an abscess rather a carcinoma. As there has been no blood discharge from the nipple which is classical in cancer, it would be too early to comment. But it is suggested that an ultrasound breast may be undertaken to look for an organised lump if present and if required an FNAC may be done to sample the local tissue and send for histopathological examination. This is unlikely to be a premenstrual syndrome (PMS) as it should be bilateral in that case. Consult your physician for a local examination.

Last month, my period came 13 days late and this month it is 15 days over the date. My period lasts two days mostly which I think is not really healthy. What do you recommend doing?","Doctor":"Hi. Considering your age, your BMI (body mass index) is high. It means you are overweight. Sometimes, due to obesity, you have hormonal imbalance leading to irregular periods and decreased flow.

I am having menstrual pain and headache. I am more tired with back pain. Can I be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi. As you already had two menstrual bleeding episodes after your last intercourse, so pregnancy due to that episode is unlikely to occur. If you have not been sexually active in this cycle, then pregnancy is unlikely to happen. The delay can be stress induced. The symptoms that you are experiencing are more likely of PMS (premenstrual syndrome) indicating that you are going to get your menses soon."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Kindly advise me the needful.","Doctor":"Hello. Probably the infection got resolved, but the enlargement and hypertrophy of tonsils remain. You need to take a picture of the open throat showing both tonsils and send to us. If the enlargement is very big and causes significant symptoms recurrently, we can remove the tonsils by tonsillectomy operation. In some individuals after infection, the tonsils remain slightly big giving a feeling of something stuck down the throat. You will need some decongestants and anti-inflammatory drugs in that case.

TT (tetanus toxoid) injection can cause mild side effect, like swelling in the injection site, pain, redness. However, the side effect can last from four days to seven days.

And the second one shows low WBC (white blood cells) and borderline hemoglobin, and platelets. This is suggestive of viral infection and another possibility is of typhoid infection. Since your cells are low, it is very important that you get yourself examined by a local doctor in person for any other abnormalities. In my opinion, you will also need some more tests, like dengue NS1Ag (antigen) and dengue IgM, typhi dot IgM, to find the cause for it. Get liver and renal function test done as well. Also, repeat complete hemogram day after tomorrow.  You should only have tablet Paracetamol 500 mg up to three to four times a day for fever, avoid other painkillers, have rest and avoid the possibility of injury, avoid outside, unhygienic or even raw foods till your count recovers.

I suggest you investigate your CBC (complete blood count) and spirometry to assess the severity and to look for eosinophilia if present. You can be prescribed Montelukast with Fexofenadine combination drug for a week. If wheezing is present in auscultation, then use a bronchodilator drug in the form of nebulization if required.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Otherwise, there is no meaning of a relationship. Do not get stuck in a toxic relationship if you cannot handle. Life is beautiful if you are in love. But if you cannot enjoy it, then think over it. Live your life. For more information consult a psychiatrist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My mother is suffering from a left femoral neck fracture. Is there any other treatment other than surgery? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The age of the patient is 72 years. At this age and with this fracture, there is more harm in not doing surgery as compared to doing surgery. Such patients can develop respiratory difficulties, bed sore, and infection due to immobilization. Hemiarthroplasty is a good option at this age, but in some conditions, a total hip replacement would be ideal. But it is decided after seeing the patient.

So the next step would be to get a quadruple marker at 14 to 16 weeks and if positive then amniocentesis for fetal cell karyotyping can be done to get a conclusive result to rule out Down's syndrome.

I cannot contact him as he blocked me. I feel so ashamed to see my family. Until now, I never told them that I am pregnant. I want to die. I am mentally disturbed.

If you are not enough ready to take responsibility of your child, then go for medical abortion. You do not need to ask anyone for it. Take an appointment with your gynecologist.

I just wanted to know what kind of operation is done for this cystic structure and after removal will I be able to get pregnant and the doctors told me that my baby bag is twisted (facing the other side) and the chance of getting pregnant is 15 % lower than the normal ladies. Is it correct? And how it can be corrected?","Doctor":"Hello. As the CA 125 (coelomic epithelial antigen) levels are normal, the cyst is likely to be a simple ovarian cyst. A cyst of size more than 4 cm if symptomatic can be removed with laparoscopy. But if asymptomatic then a trial of low dose oc (oral contraceptive) pills can be given for two cycles to allow natural resolution of the cyst. Secondly, retroverted uterus as in your case has reduced chances of conception, but with the change of position during intercourse that can be overcome.

Now it is on its normal levels but hematocrit was increased too yet it is still low (35.0 %) at this point, am I anemic? The more I use Iron supplements, will my results become better gradually? I really need to know.","Doctor":"Hello. Serum ferritin reflects the iron store. Whenever an Iron supplement is started, the iron store is replenished in last. So gradually your ferritin and iron level will come back to normal. Your RBC and PCV (packed cell volume) are not much altered. So do not worry about that.  So you are having mild anemia. You can investigate with stool routine micro examination and occult blood test to exclude any parasitic infestation which can lead to a small amount of bleeding from the intestine and so anemia can worsen.

I have a flying travel planed on 25th this month and I fly back on the 9th. Is it safe to travel?","Doctor":"Hello. You are in your 19th week of gestation with a low lying placenta (just 1.9 cm from the os - placental margin). Ideally, 2.5 cm from os is considered safe. So, travel with flight or any other mode is not recommended in your case presently. Also, an absolute no to intercourse as well as this may cause threatened miscarriage/antepartum hemorrhage due to jerks or exertion while traveling. Usually, the placenta naturally climbs up by 32 weeks of gestation when the lower segment of the uterus starts forming. So, presently you have to be careful and if the trip is avoidable, it should be avoided.

Certainly, you fall into hig-risk category and prevention is very important in your case, so ideally you should avoid going to bank or outside as much as possible. But this may not be possible for essential service providers like you, doctors. If you could not manage to stay home then take full precautions like using mask all the time, keeping distance from all the individuals, using sanitizer frequently, etc. If your BP is remaining above 140/90 mmHg for most of the times then you need to get some more medications added like tablet Cilinidipine 10 mg once or twice daily depending upon the requirement. Also, LDL cholesterol of 181 is too much elevated and you need to be on medication for it as well along with healthy lifestyle like tablet Rosuvastatin 10 mg bedtime for eight weeks.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months).

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

In case, if you see well, you are eligible for prisms. These are particular types of lenses which are embedded into glasses. They can be used, but this needs training to the people for straightening their eyes. In some instances, they produce useful singular vision.

When I have sex with my partner, I have an erection coming too quickly, or I lose the erection within seconds of leaving my partner pretty disappointed. I know that it is due to severe performance anxiety, that I am unable to control it. When I am relaxed, I can hold it for at least five to ten minutes. After a lot of hesitation, I started taking Viagra 50 mg. I do not think that I have an ED problem. I have taken it thrice till date having beautiful results each time. My partner is very happy. Is it safe to take Viagra for persons not suffering from ED? When the sex was irregular, the need for Viagra is also limited. It is used three to four times a month. Does regular usage mean that I cannot get an erection? Should I have to reduce the dosage or should I need to stop taking it completely? I do not have any side effects. I have moderately high BP, and I am taking medication for it in a low dosage.","Doctor":"Hi. You should check with your doctor about the medicines taken for blood pressure. It should not be a Nitrate. There is no harm in taking Viagra (Sildenafil) when you are not regular on sex. You can consult an andrologist and try to rule out the cause for ED (erectile dysfunction) other than performing with anxiety. Sometimes, it can be due to other medical conditions. As you have not given your family details, it is difficult to comment more. It is the premature ejaculation causing the loss of erection. It has to be differentiated from the ED.

According to your statement and picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity), you have been suffering from bumps around your penile part with pus-filled blisters which are red and white color. According to your picture, it may be genital herpes which is caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV). It is a sexually transmitted disease, but you have mentioned that you have abstained from sexual intercourse for two months. Many people often do not know that they have the virus because many people who are infected with HSV have no symptoms or their symptoms are very mild. First genital herpes outbreak may cause multiple outbreaks later. Again it can spread from oral sex if your partner is infected. Again your symptoms can occur from other skin conditions like pimples or ingrowing hairs and contact dermatitis also can show the same scenario. Contact dermatitis is a skin condition that can cause red, itchy, cracked, dry or scaly skin, blisters or a rash. It usually occurs within minutes to hours after touching an irritant or something you are allergic to. Common causes include reaction to medications, detergents, cosmetics, and jewelry. So we should find out the exact cause for your sufferings and then treat them accordingly. In case of herpes infection, you can take antiviral medications like cream and tablets.

I never got my periods and it hurts too much to have sex.","Doctor":"Hi. From the history that you have posted, I believe that you are suffering from a dry vagina due to some reasons. You should get evaluated because you are 20 years old and it is high time that you should start menstruating. Maybe ovaries are not optimally working and hormones like estrogen is deficient and other glands that should act on local genital areas to lubricate it are not working. Sometimes dryness may be due to allergy and anti-allergic medications may help in this. It is necessary to involve in enough foreplay before actual penetration. It helps in stimulating your genital glands to provide proper lubrication for penetration. Normally, the walls of the vagina stay lubricated with a thin layer of clear fluid. The hormone estrogen helps to maintain that fluid and keeps the lining of your vagina healthy, thick, and elastic. A drop in estrogen levels reduces the amount of moisture available. It can happen at any age from a number of different causes. It may seem like a minor irritation. But the lack of vaginal moisture can have a huge impact on your sex life. Fortunately, several treatments are available to relieve vaginal dryness. You can use KY jelly locally in and around the vagina before attempting intercourse. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am a newly married groom. While having sex I ejaculate too quickly. I want to stay long. I have tried doing the Kegel exercise and start-stop method but that too does not help me stay longer. Please help. I am 27 years old.","Doctor":"Hello. I do understand the problem that you are going through. But you need to understand this. Normal intravaginal ejaculation latency is 1 to 2 minutes. If someone ejaculates within 60 seconds of vaginal penetration, that also persistently over last six months, then he can be said to have premature ejaculation. Besides, yes Kegel exercises do help in improving the timings but gradually. Also, try changing your position while having sex (cowboy or reverse cowboy is helpful).

I have pain and discomfort when I am moving the eye. I have a slight change in color sight with slightly reduced red color vision in left eye. I have attached an MRI Axial T2 Propeller image from a brain scan. The image shows a hyperintensity (white sheath) surrounding the optical nerve. Could you please identify what is the white sheath that indicates on this type of MRI image and the possible cause for the difference of appearance between the two optical nerves?","Doctor":"Hi. The MRI shows features suggestive of left-sided optic nerve sheath meningioma with possibly both sided Inflammatory orbitopathy (muscle enlargement is quite apparent). But these needs be correlated clinically. Although meningioma is recognized to be a benign tumor, it can cause pressure effects on the optic nerve and can cause compressive optic neuropathy. Inflammatory orbitopathy also shows a similar picture. A drop or alteration in color vision, reducing visual acuity, pain on eye movements especially inwards towards the nose or upwards are the features suggestive of optic neuropathy secondary to compression. Hence this needs immediate treatment by an ophthalmologist and radiation oncologist. There are no home remedies or preventive measures. The best treatment for optic nerve meningioma is fractionated radiation therapy, and for inflammatory orbitopathy, it is immunosuppressives like steroids.

It started as a little spot and later degenerated into a small hole in the cartilage. Now it started spreading to another ear. I have gone to many ENT specialist and dermatologist, and they could not be able to figure out what it is. It began as a small dot or spot 17 months ago in the left ear and started becoming a hole. We noticed it in the right ear around seven months ago. The same way it started as a dot as seen in the right ear before it turned into a small hole as seen in the left ear. The one on the left ear is 17 months now. We have been to many ENT specialist and dermatologist, and they said they had not seen such thing before. They conducted a blood test on him and said everything is fine. It is disturbing me a lot and looking for a solution for it as I am scared, that it should not get bigger. I am using Fusibact ointment on the affected area.","Doctor":"Hi. With your description and after reviewing the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I can think of a condition called angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE). It is a benign harmless condition that presents with bumps in the ears. ALHE is common in adults, but there are few cases of ALHE reported in children as well. This is an idiopathic condition, meaning the cause is not yet known. This condition has to be confirmed by skin biopsy. I understand it is difficult to do a biopsy in kids, but I feel biopsy is essential because this problem is present since 17months as you have mentioned. In about 20 % of cases, there will be elevated eosinophils in the blood. You have told that the blood tests are fine. I am not sure if the eosinophils were tested.

I am healthy, no medications, regular periods of 28 to 30 days. My partner and I have been together for seven years and we have been TTC for five years with no luck. I have given up hope for a long time. End last year, I started seeing a chiropractor because of lower back pain. Early this year, my period was a week late and I felt different. So, I decided to take a pregnancy test. I had two positive digital tests and another positive on the first response with two lines that appeared. I was definitely pregnant. I could not believe it! The only thing I had done differently was to see a chiropractor and it was instant that I conceived. Unfortunately, I had a very early miscarriage. Just two days after my positive tests, I began to bleed and confirmed with a doctor it had been miscarried. To this day, I still see a chiropractor and we keep on trying to get pregnant but it is not happening. I am back to feeling hopeless. I still cannot believe I saw three positive tests.

Why is this happening to me? What might help me?","Doctor":"Hello. There are multiple factors which need to be evaluated in a secondary infertility case, the male and the female. Considering that you became pregnant, the male factor is healthy with motile and healthy sperms. It is now important to get your hormonal profile done along with an ultrasound pelvis to rule out PCOD (polycystic ovaries disease), hypothyroidism or hyperprolactinemia which can cause delayed follicular development or immature follicles which do not ovulate. You may be experiencing anovulatory cycles. Hence follicular monitoring should be done for a natural dummy cycle to check for follicular growth.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

My question is, Are irregular periods normal after what she has been through, or is it more common for her cycle to be regular?","Doctor":"Hello. Loss of ovarian function can happen temporarily or permanently depending on the dosage of the chemotherapy. This happens due to the damage to the immature ovarian follicles containing the immature eggs by the chemotherapeutic agents. So the chances of resumption depend on the ovarian reserve left undamaged. So usually post chemotherapy, a woman may resume her cycles anywhere from a few months to more than a year. Some women may even develop premature ovarian failure. As per your query, irregular cycles are quite common post-chemotherapy once the periods are resumed. But I need to know one more important thing that is the hormone receptor status of the biopsy and whether your wife is on any medication called Tamoxifen. If she is on such medication, then bleeding needs to be monitored by an ultrasound scan to look for the uterine lining thickness. I hope this helps.

But, due to a shortage of this medicine, I am not able to get it. Can I give her Oxidon plus instead of Ocugold?  Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Both Oxidon (Beta-carotene and Vitamin E) and Ocugold (Beta-carotene, Lutein, with Mixed carotene) are based on the AREDS (age-related eye disease study) formulation. Both are used in the treatment of AMD (age-related macular degeneration) of moderate severity. But in case if your mother is a smoker, she should be cautious when using Ocugold or Oxidon, as both Oxidon and Ocugold are based on the AREDS 1 formulation and not on AREDS 2. AREDS 2 has xanthins, whereas Oxidon and Ocugold (AREDS 1) have beta-carotene. Beta-carotene has been shown to cause harmful side effects in smokers, apart from this, both have the same actions. So in my opinion, if your mother is a smoker, it is advisable to use a drug having an AREDS 2 formulation. In case if she does not have the habit of smoking, you can use either of the two, Ocugold or Oxidon.

For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

This has been ongoing for years, despite being to several doctors. I am currently on Levothyroxine for hypothyroidism along with Bisoprolol for IST. I have had an MRI and CT scan done on my head, both of which came back abnormal. My doctor has sent in a referral to a neurologist, but he has yet to look at any of my information. I just want an opinion to begin with.","Doctor":"Hello. Regarding your concern, I would explain that these CT scan and MRI findings are not related to the headache and dizziness. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  I would like to know more about headaches. Is it throbbing or like pressure? Do you feel nausea during the headaches? How long do they last? Do you tolerate the light during the headaches? In my opinion, considering the location of the headache in half of the head, it could indicate migraine. I would recommend starting therapy with Sertraline coupled with Verapamil. Regarding the MRI findings, in my opinion, they could indicate a normal variation of the brain structures. Anyway, a brain MRI after a year would be necessary. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 22 weeks pregnant, and I have a 20 cm cyst on the right ovary.  It has become big during pregnancy. Before pregnancy, it was 6 cm. I do not have any problem till now. I have done the tumor marker tests. Please advise. What can be done?","Doctor":"Hi. Does it got increased from 6 cm to 20 cm in a few months? What does the tumor marker test report? Was the measurement appropriately done? Is this is a single cyst size? Is it a solid or fluid-filled cyst? A Dermoid cyst with multiple solid tissues could show torsion. Some fluid-filled cyst could rupture and spill inside the pelvis and can initiate infection too. You send me your complete scan report and your CA 125 (cancer antigen) report. Your family history, your gynecology, and obstetrics history are also needed. Mostly corpus luteal cyst occurs in patients having a history of a polycystic ovary which is a common finding. But mostly it is found to be small and resolves by itself. Occasionally, big cysts can trigger miscarriage, infection, torsion or preterm labor. Investigations are also needed for large cysts. But it can cause preterm labor and perinatal death. Send me the scan report and the tumor marker report. So I can give you a treatment suggestion. In case of any pain, report immediately to a tertiary care hospital for an emergency.

He has an abscess on his gums above his front tooth. X-rays are taken, and the dentist wants to pull out the tooth. He says that the roots are gone. So there is no need to keep it. The tooth appears perfect when you look. Is it possible to give him antibiotics to save this tooth? Because I know, as it will be around three years for his permanent tooth to come.","Doctor":"Hi. Since your child is only three years old, so the chances of root resorption are low which means that his roots must be intact. If the root is intact, then you can go for the procedure called pulpectomy, which can save the tooth. Even the antibiotics can help him for the time being as it is going to take three more years for him to get his new tooth. So you can consult another dentist to get the second opinion about saving his tooth. For more information consult a dentist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I bought Yarsagumba from my friend.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

This past month, I had a very light period for a day and a half which could probably be considered spotting. I have no pregnancy symptoms, but should I be concerned? Is it likely the change in period could be due to stress of thinking I am pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern. I presume that you have not missed your birth control pill and I presume that your cycles are regular. In that case, your egg release would happen around 12 to 16 th day of your period if you count the first day of period as day 1. You had intercourse on the eighth day of your period. So you are protected from pregnancy by three things. 1. You are on pill. 2. You had sex before egg release. 3. You used withdrawal method during sex. I need to know if you are having delayed cycles? Also please give me certain details. Are you having weight gain? Is there excessive facial or body hair? How much delayed are your periods? Any dark pigmentation around neck or armpits? Cycles can range anywhere from 21 to 35 days in adults. But if any of the above is developing then it is probable that you are developing hormonal imbalances. During the lockdown period the physical activity of most of us is a bit restricted and also there looms a lot of stress regarding COVID 19. These are factors that may lead to hormonal imbalance and hence delayed cycles. It is important to engage in some exercises that can be done at home and it is advisable to eat green vegetables and fruits and drink milk regularly. Meditation, diet, and exercise forms the primary regime to avoid irregular cycles. It is better to avoid excessive cheese, fat, butter, ice cream, fast, and junk foods.

Consult your doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. You need to be careful regarding cold weather and food items, because whenever one consumes cold item or cold air goes inside there is multiplication or growth of microorganisms leading to infection and symptoms. So, avoid this thing. Also, smoking hampers local immunity so that must be stopped. You must be getting some symptoms like throat congestion and irritation.

I have sore shins eleven eye orbits photophobia, grittiness, lid lag during attaches and lid retraction reflex with sudden upgaze. It became worse a few months back with a flare after influenza leading me to the hospital with 110 beats/min heart rate at rest, fever, dehydration, and exhaustion. My eyes have proptosis when flaring especially the right eye. You can see sclera above the iris.

The diagnosis is correct viz hyperthyroid Graves' disease. You certainly need Methimazole for this as well as a thyroid surgery. You should not take Lithium for prolonged use. However, bearing in mind the side effects it has. But I understand you also need it for your grittiness and mood behaviour. You should speak to an endocrinologist regarding the surgery for the same and hopefully, you can go off both Lithium and Methimazole. The other medications do not matter here.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I was a smoker and occasional tobacco user. I quitted this four years back. I have no pain or irritation and I am in touch with a local dentist and taking vitamin D supplements. I need an advice for further treatment.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. The long term habit of smoking and tobacco chewing has caused this on the inside of your cheek. Good to hear that you stopped the habit. The vitamin D supplement you mentioned is also nice. But it takes time to heal. For years together, the inside of your cheek has been exposed to heat and tobacco which are responsible for such a change. It will heal, no doubt, but it takes time. Be patient, have your dentist consultation regularly and avoid hot foods. Use a medicated mouthwash. The time taken to heal is generally more than the time taken for those spots to appear."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter, 21 years old, has a fever (100 degF to 101 degF) and nausea for the last five days. She has very low appetite and abdominal pain. Among all other tests, the CBC test worries me. The test result reveals that her WBC count is 3300, neutrophils 83 % and lymphocytes 11 %, platelet count 101000. Her RBC is 3.66 million, Hb 10.7 %. All other parameters including kidney and liver functions are normal. Doctors say that it is a viral infection, dengue. She has been advised to take Paracetamol, Omeprazole, B12 Vitamins and Fefol tablets and also to take plenty of water. Fever does not get subsided completely. Do you think giving antibiotics would help her at this stage? Could it be a bacterial infection too? The doctor did not prescribe any antibiotics. I need a second opinion from you.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below: Your daughter has slightly low hemoglobin and platelets (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The normal hemoglobin is considered above 12 and platelets more than 150000. RBC count is less and 4.5 million is normal. The total count is also less showing leucopenia, normally more than 4000 and the neutrophil percentage is more and lymphocytes percentage is less. There is NS1Ag (antigen) test showing positive which indicates the possibility of dengue infection. Rapid test and dengue ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) might appear negative now but will become positive after some time. Right now antibiotics are not required because there is no sign of bacterial infection. Fever will take time to respond and please give her Paracetamol after food every six hours for fever. Supportive care is important for dengue fever and that is the reason your doctor has prescribed Paracetamol for fever and pain and Omeprazole to prevent gastritis. Daily water and fresh juices should be two liters and diet should be 1800 kcal daily. It is still in a mild stage and regular platelet test is required for monitoring. The doctor might also tell to get ultrasound scan abdomen done to look for any water collection in the abdomen."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I went to a doctor because I had symptoms of vaginal thrush, itchiness, and sometimes white discharge. My fiance also had an itchy dick so I thought he had thrush as well. I got prescribed Fluconazole for it and he used a cream for it. Both our symptoms went away so we had sex four days after I took the Fluconazole pill. When we had sex though it was painful and urinating afterward was painful. I also noticed a tiny amount of blood after it. Is this normal with thrush and do I have to be treated again or will it go away? I am 18 years old.","Doctor":"Hello. A single Fluconazole pill does not treat the thrush completely. As you had painful sex and blood thereafter accompanied with painful urine, indicates that you have developed thrush associated vaginitis, which needs to be treated with both antifungals and antibiotics together in form of vaginal pessaries and oral medications for at least five days."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Before two days, I had sex with a sex worker for the first time. I used a condom for the sex. But my condom got broken. I did not see it for a few minutes. Now I am afraid of any sexual problem that can come in the future like HIV. I am totally upset, and I lost my hope. Please advice what should I do?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, there is a chance of HIV transmission with unprotected sex. But the risk is just one in 300. In other terms, it is only 0.3 %. The risk could be less if there were no mucosal lesions for you and your sexual partner. Regarding other infections, the risk is there. But most of them are treatable. I will request you to see a Dermatologist for investigation and treatment. For most diseases, it takes time to get confirmed by blood reports. You need to go for tests after three months of a sexual encounter to make sure that you are not infected. It is not a time to get panic. Try to see your doctor without any delay."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have tested for STD, and so far I have no signs of it. I had E-coli in the urine and trichomoniasis in the past. I was treated for both. Since then I did not have sex with my partner for four years because I get a burning sensation or itching that creates discomfort in the chest close to the heart. I also get a urinary tract infection. Sometimes, I can only feel it inside the clitoris. It seems like skin should not touch skin, or it will get infected easily every single time. Even condoms are irritants. What could be causing an infected condition of the urinary tract and vagina every single time I have sex? It must be a bacteria or the saliva used for lubrication might contain herpes virus. My partner and I are clean. We bathe daily. I think that because I take antibiotics (Bactrim and water pill) to kill bacteria, it causes yeast infections and we both are infected by yeast. How can we control the bacteria that initially created all this trouble? The urine test shows bacteria, but not much to start medication.","Doctor":"Hi.

She said it was a sinus infection and prescribed Z-pak and steroids. I have taken all the medicines, but my throat still hurts. It has been like this for two weeks. I thought it as dry mouth and drank around 10 bottles of water a day. I have no other symptoms. Sometimes, my throat burns after I eat. I have tried taking antacids, but it did not help. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, sinus infection can cause constant throat irritation due to post nasal drip formed by the sinus secretions. The constant drip can irritate and cause pain. Also, it can act as a source of throat infection. If indeed sinus infection is the cause for the throat problem, then in addition to the Z-pak (Azithromycin, which is an antibiotic) you need some anti-inflammatory drugs and nasal decongestant drops too. Anti-inflammatory drugs come by the name Inf-zyme forte, which has to be taken twice daily in an empty stomach and nasal decongestants come by the name Otrivin (Xylometazoline). Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. You must instill 2 drops of Otrivin in each nostril and lie supine with head low position. The drops decongest the sinus ostia and help remove pent up secretions from the sinuses. For a complete evaluation, we must take a throat swab culture and sensitivity and institute the right antibiotics as per the report. A non-contrast CT scan of paranasal sinuses can confirm if there is any sinus inflammation. A diagnostic nasendoscopy can help confirm the same. Also, laryngoscopy can help establish any laryngopharyngeal reflux that is causing the throat pain and burning sensation. Meanwhile, an anesthetic gel like Mucaine gel can help relieve the burning sensation in the throat after meals.

I had throat infections in the past and was smoking back then. Now, I do not smoke and it has been more than two and half months that I had a smoke. Could this be because of Nicotex 2 mg that I have been chewing to keep the cravings away? Also, my friend, who is a doctor, suggested me to take Azithral 250 mg three times a day after meals. Please suggest if I should.","Doctor":"Hi. For one event of little blood, you need not have to panic. In my opinion, I do not think it is due to Nicotex (Nicotine) and hence you can continue using Nicotex. Most likely you are having throat infection and most of the times it is due to viral infection and it does not require antibiotic such as Azithral (Azithromycin). My recommendation is as follows: Wait and observe for three days. If still the soarness persists or you experience fever or too much of cough, then in that case you can start antibiotic Azithral (Azithromycin) 250 mg two times a day for five days as per your friend's advice.

But the result is very poor. No sugar or blood pressure problem yet. Any injection is available for its treatment or surgery?","Doctor":"Hello. Premature ejaculation is defined as ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation, before the patient desires and before or within one minute of penetration. There are two major reasons for premature ejaculation. Frequently, performance anxiety could be a cause of premature ejaculation. In that case, you can take deep breaths for two minutes before sex. It will relax you enough. If you still feel anxious, you can take tab Alprazolam 0.5 mg half an hour before sexual activity. Remind yourself that you are having sex for mutual pleasure and relaxation. It is not an ordeal or duty where you are supposed to be the performer. If it is due to excess sensitivity of the glans penis (front portion of the penis). The first technique is known as squeeze technique. In it, when you reach close to orgasm, you or your partner should squeeze on the ridge between the glans and the shaft of the penis till the erection subsides. Then begin with your sexual activity once again. Repeat this a few times before you finally ejaculate. This will increase your time to ejaculation and also give you some voluntary control. The second option is you can use Lignocaine spray. Spray once on the glans penis 15 minutes before sexual activity. It will reduce the extra sensitivity of the glans to the normal level. You can also use 4% Lignox jelly instead of spray. If these techniques are not working for you, you can consult a sexologist who will examine you physically to find the cause and advise accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

After that, she got a fever with high temperature. So, she went to a hospital. They gave an injection and a tablet for three days. Her fever was gone. But after that, she cannot get milk for feeding. What is the problem?","Doctor":"Hi. Delivery is more stressful. There is a lot of physical work. During pregnancy, the requirement for food and blood is double. The chances of anemia, weakness during delivery and after delivery is more. Milk production also depends on many factors like genetically few mothers can produce less milk without any health issue. Illness or medications can reduce the milk production. They can have weakness and poor nutrition. They can also have less milk intake and multiple pregnancies too which can reduce the milk production. It depends because few ladies do breastfeeding till three months or more and they will use formula milk whenever needed as per their convenience as well. Better feed is the breastfeed actually. Was fever associated with an infection? What medications were given to her? Any other health issue? Taking foods and multivitamins has to be doubled as she had a twin pregnancy. There may be weakness due to more blood loss during delivery. It can also reduce the milk production. Have a healthy diet, with multivitamins, plenty of fruits, vegetables, milk can also help to increase the milk production. Some drugs can also increase the milk production as certain drugs increase the action of prolactin hormone, which can increase the milk production. I think illness, medications, and weakness are the reasons for the reduced production of milk. It is better to have a natural increase in milk production by food, health, and better positioning of babies for sucking. As she has two babies, she can go for better formula milk along with breastfeeding to fulfill the babies requirement.

There is a possibility that you may get pregnant with pre-ejaculate fluid itself if you were in a fertile period, as precum also contains sperms. It is better advised, that you should opt for an emergency contraceptive pill like an i-pill within next 72 hours to avoid the chances for unplanned pregnancy.

His age is seven months. I have given ORS to him.","Doctor":"Hi. The most common causes of diarrhea below one year age of a baby are viral diarrhea. Rotavirus diarrhea is very common and frequent. Rotavirus is a virus that spreads through the contamination of food, improperly cleaned utensils and poor hygiene. Please specify whether your baby is having watery (resembling rice water) diarrhea. In rotavirus infection, diarrhea is watery, frequent, and it is of considerable volume. You have done the right thing by giving ORS (oral rehydration solution). Give it plenty, every time after your baby passes stool, also give ORS for every 15 minutes. If he vomits, wait for 10 minutes and give ORS. You should also continue breastfeeding and give semi-solid and solid foods according to her diet schedule. Do not stop solid foods. Maintaining water and electrolyte balance (by starting ORS early and frequently) is the primary treatment. You should count the number of urine output of your baby. If it remains normal, it is fine, but if the urine output number falls, then it means that there is dehydration which is alarming and needs more frequent ORS. You can also give him probiotics like Econorm (Saccharomyces Bouraldii) or Enteroplus sachet (Lactobacilus rhamnosus) dissolved in water or milk twice a day. For abdominal pain (crying) you can provide Colpep (Dimethicone with Fennel oil) or Decolic drops (Dicyclomine with Simethicone) 10 to 12 drops when needed. If the condition worsens or dehydration persists (baby will be irritable at first, then there will be drowsiness with sunken eyes, less urine output, and rapid pulse), immediately consult with a doctor or take him to a hospital without any delay. Stool analysis and culture sensitivity can be done. Preventive measures are: For more information consult a paediatrician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having prolonged backache, especially after driving. I face pain when I stretch and I get a relief when I do it. And when I push my hands on the back towards the front I can hear bone cracking, like when we stretch.","Doctor":"Hello. In my opinion, with the limited narration that you have provided to me in your query, I feel you have less stability in your core muscles. You should maintain posture while driving which can be achieved by placing a pillow behind your low back (in case you drive the car) or staying erect in case of a two-wheeler. A couple of back strengthening and core stability glute stability exercises will help you fix your back. Kindly provide me with additional details of your problem like how the pain started, what movements are limited, what aggravates the pain, what relieves it, etc. How is your pain at night and early morning, is there any pain radiating down the leg? As of now, I advise you to ice your low back frequently. Back arching will help you feel better too, it can be done as 15 reps of three sets in lying face down position.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months).

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out.

You did a very good job of washing with soap and water. It is important to apply a soap that foams well to wash off local viruses. An antitetanus vaccine will only protect you against wound infections. It will not prevent rabies infection. If the dog is infected, you may be at risk of having rabies infection. You need to take a course of anti-rabies vaccination. It comprises five doses - Day 0 (on the day of exposure), and then days 3, 7, 14, 28.

I was on top and used a condom and then I started giving him unprotected oral sex for about 20 seconds before I realized it was a bad idea. Three days after I was tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia and syphilis. The doctor treated me with two different antibiotics and a shot in my hip. Not sure if syphilis was treated but I know the other two were. All tests came back negative. Two weeks after I went to a testing facility and did a 10-panel STD test with four blood samples and a urine sample. Everything can back negative. I am still stressing out about this and keep thinking I feel pain in my testicles and the tip of my penis and also side aches. The pains are infrequent and come and go but seem to disappear when I am able to relax for the most part. Three weeks after I went and did the early detection HIV test with blood taken from my finger and that came back negative. I just cannot seem to stop worrying about this and it is mostly because I got back with an old girlfriend and had sex one and a half weeks after the encounter and am scared I could have passed something on to her. My biggest question I have is from this encounter what do I need to test for and when should I go get tested again so I can clear my mind of this?","Doctor":"Hello. Only concern is such cases is of HIV, and rarely of hepatitis B and hepatitis C, as other STDs (sexually transmitted diseases) are treatable and easily manageable, not life-threatening. So having antibiotics will cover a majority of STDs and the shot was probably Penicillin which will cover syphilis as well. As you are already tested negative for HIV although early after the encounter, the chances are less. However, to reliably tell that one is negative, test at 12 weeks should be negative. So you should get your HIV combo test (antibody plus P24 antigen, RNA test) at 12 weeks after the encounter. Also, you should get anti HCV antibodies and HBsAg antigen test to rule out other viral infections. So overall, chances appear to be less of any infections as of now (other than herpes), but the negative test at 12 weeks will give additional assurance.

I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There is an irregular rhythm called atrial fibrillation, which is usually not life-threatening but needs evaluation for the cause. Also, there are Q waves in the inferior leads which suggest the possibility of heart damage and blockages in some patients. So you should get an echo (echocardiography) and TMT (treadmill test) done to look for a cause. Also, get your thyroid test done, if there is any snoring, interrupted sleep, and morning headaches. If yes, I suggest the possibility of sleep apnea. For more information consult a cardiologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 50 years old. I had an MRI of my brain.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been having goosebumps like rash on my neck but less dense and a bit bigger than a goosebump for almost a year now.

Left choroid plexus is enlarged and filled with a hypoechoic central part. Corpus callosum is thin and irregular, the pericallosal artery is normal. These features are strongly suggestive of late second or early third-trimester vascular insult or hemorrhage. The doctor advised for a postnatal MRI brain evaluation and pediatric neurological consultation.","Doctor":"Hi. All these suggest that there is a problem on the left side of the baby's brain. To ascertain the cause and extent of the problem, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) brain is definitely required. Based on the MRI, further investigations can be planned. At this point, it is difficult to predict the outcomes of this problem. For more information consult a neurologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have lots of anxiety issues.

According to your history, it seems that you are having generalized anxiety. Yes, you can take Valium (Diazepam) for symptomatic relief. It will help you to get proper sleep in long duration.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I started getting muscle twitches all over my body about six months ago. It started after I stopped taking Valium 10 mg daily for seven months (in suppository form). However, they still occur. I have discontinued Benzodiazepines (Valium and Xanax) for about seven months. I am very focused on my every movement. I have done two neurology exams (one by a psychiatrist and one by a neurologist). Both were normal. I also did two EMG on the same day. The psychiatrist did an EMG, a paraspinal EMG and tested 28 muscles altogether. His impression was healthy except for isolated fasciculation potentials in the right medial gastrocnemius. However, the above muscle was silent at rest with standard motor unit configuration and usual recruitment pattern. He said the study was healthy and did not suggest any motor neuron disease. The neurologist tested again because I made him do it. He did the nerve study and EMG directly on my right hand and arm where I am complaining as well as left hand, left arm, and left leg. He did not find any fasciculations and said it is all normal. The doctor told I do not have ALS. Both the doctors said there is no need to repeat the test. My questions are:  Would the EMG directly pick up on the right hand if ALS were present? Should I be concerned about these fasciculations which can turn into something? If the fasciculation is due to ALS, will they show any other issues on the EMG? Can anxiety make fasciculation worse? Is it possible to focus on a body part so much?","Doctor":"Hi. Your symptoms could be related to benign fasciculation syndrome, which is associated with multiple muscle fasciculations in the absence of any neurological disorders. Of course, anxiety can trigger this clinical situation. As your EMG (electromyography) was normal, we can exclude any possible ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). ALS patients also have an abnormal physical exam (neurological signs). So, I do not think that you suffer from ALS. I would just recommend performing further tests: If all these tests results are normal, I would recommend discussing with your doctor on the possibility of starting Clonazepam, which is a Benzodiazepine which can help reduce anxiety and fasciculations. It is better tolerated when compared to Diazepam when used for a long time (it does not lead to addiction and tolerance).

I also have checked my blood pressure consistently over the past five years and came back normal. Is there something I should worry about?","Doctor":"Hello. The arteriovenous nicking or AV crossing changes you mentioned, although present, seem quite harmless in the fundus photos you have sent me. Please do not worry about these, as they are not associated with other precursor changes of hypertensive retinopathy. I am also happy with the fact that your blood pressure and heart tests are normal. This matter of AV nicking would need nothing but periodic monitoring per se, probably once a year. I also have a responsibility as a doctor to tell you that in the photos that you have attached, the disc is asymmetric. What I mean to say is, in your photos (attachment removed to protect patient identity), there is a green computer generated circle in the center of each eye. Inside of this green circle is the dark circular optic disc and inside the optic disc is a grey or white color optic cup. The size of the optic cup is different in your eyes indicating asymmetry (also mentioned in your photo and the top center of the photo). This could be due to a variety of reasons including your refractive error, optic nerve disease or glaucoma.

You only had some episode of Streptococcal throat infection in the past. So first I wish to explain you that Rifaximin is a newer drug and can be used to treat it. However many other antibiotics like Cephalosporins, Tetracyclines, Macrolides etc. can be used to treat it. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines. You also need to take a rich fibrous diet with vegetables and fruits to balance your gut flora.

Another query, is anything alarming visible in the picture? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. In the attached picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity), there is no indication of candidiasis anywhere including tonsillar area. There is a lot of nicotine staining of teeth as well as the mucosal membrane. There is slightest whitish tinge near the tonsillar area, and also the abnormal sensation in the area could point to the development of future leukoplakia. So this could be the precursor of leukoplakia. Leukoplakia is a whitish lesion which occurs due to chronic irritation like smoking, etc., which has a risk of cancer development. So, at present, there is nothing alarming, but it could become in due time. So, this is the perfect time to take action and reduce smoking gradually.

Kindly assist me.","Doctor":"Hi. Confirm it whether it is candidiasis. When have you done your last vaginal swab? Do you have your two swabs reporting the same infection? (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Normal vaginal secretions increase during excitement, at ovulation, before menstruation, at fertilization, and genetically. Healthy vaginal flora maintains the pH of the vagina. Overtreating of any infection can harm the healthy flora of the vagina as well as it can weaken the local immune system and you can have abnormal flora more in proportion than a healthy flora. Sit in warm water frequently to reduce pain and irritation. Have strict hygiene. Use soft and comfortable cotton undergarments. Try to have condoms to reduce sexually transmitted infections for some time till you have a reduction in symptoms. Collect HVS (high vaginal swab) report and discuss here or with local Gynecologist. Do not take over treatment as it can cause different symptoms to you. You can have a Canestan thrush pessary (Clotrimazole) per vaginal at bedtime for two to three alternate nights.

Today my surgeon took the cast off, and I saw my nose with a lot of swelling, I have a concern that I will not get the shape as I want a thinner dorsum. I am uploading the pre-surgical and post-surgical pictures. Is it possible for my dorsum to get thinner after the resolution of the swelling? Or will it remain the same?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Many of my patients will have trouble, so I do not assure them before surgery as the actual results take time to show due to swelling. I hope your surgeon must have convinced you and so you are looking for the second opinion. It takes up to three to six months for the swelling to subside completely. But you will be expecting a decrease in swelling after seven to ten days. Do not get worried and enjoy your holidays. Wait, and you will get an excellent result.

Last night I decided to clean my ears using cotton buds, after hours I felt like my left ear did not function as how my right ear does. It has the same feeling when you got out of the water from the swimming pool as if there is a stucked water inside. Days pass (two days to be exact) I started to feel pain whenever I touch my ear. And also I observe that there are times wherein there is a liquid (just a bit, but not too much) that comes out of my ear, but it has no odor and color. I feel scared and bothered.

What are the medications I can take to ease the pain and cure this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your situation. Your symptoms are suggestive of an acute ear infection. Nothing to worry. Since you say your ear is discharging, follow these suggestions. 1. Visit an ENT doctor near you so that your ear can be visualized endoscopically and treated accordingly. 2. If you do not have the chance to visit an ENT consultant start yourself on the following medication. Tablet Amoxicillin 500 mg twice daily for five days, tablet Levocetirizine once daily before sleep for five days. Ciprofloxacin ear drops three drops thrice daily. 3. Try to keep your ear dry at all times. 4. Regarding your hearing, in most cases, it will be back to normal after the underlying infection subsides. But, nothing can be confirmed without examining your ear. 5. Get out of the habit of using earbuds to clean your ear. It is designed to only clean the outer ear lobe not to clean inside your ear. This habit will only worsen things for you. Infection of the external or middle ear. Endoscopic examination of the ear, pure tone audiometry, impudence audiometry. Keep the ear dry at all times. Follow up regarding the symptoms in three days."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 21 years old. Does tablet Megalis 10 mg give priapism? Will it show any harsh side effects?","Doctor":"Hi.

I also have sharp and dull pains along my backbone. I have been deferring a visit to the doctor as I had dismissed it earlier thinking that it was due to my frequent dance practices (three times a week).

I have one tooth grown a previous year, and another tooth has started growing today.","Doctor":"Hi. Anything other than usual is never good. First, we need to know whether it is extra teeth or natural teeth growing in a different place. Why do you have these extra teeth? Is it interrupting the other teeth and disturbing the mouth position or no issues with it? We need to know the answers to these questions, and if they are not causing any trouble, you can leave them.

I did many time ultrasound and cystoscopy. I have inflammation in bladder and prostate. I feel the inflammation and a burning sensation in the urethra. My bladder is overactive. I took many antibiotics, prostrate and overactive medicine for the past eight years. But there is no improvement. One time the doctor injected botox injection into my bladder. But there is also no improvement. The doctor is giving medicine for one week to one month. But my infection is recurrent. At night, I am urinating for every 30 minutes to one hour while sleeping. During the day I urinate every one and a half to two hours. Every time I feel the discomfort and burning sensation in the bladder and urethra. When I have a prostate infection, I have pain and discomfort from rectum to penis. Last week, I checked my PSA value it was 0.36 ng/mL. I am taking tablets Vesicare, Ditropan, Omnic, Unoflox, Spasmic, Cipram, Levocin, and Urispas.","Doctor":"Hi. You are having a severe case of overactive bladder. From your history, it appears that you have tried out almost all the available treatments for overactive bladder. At present, botox therapy is the least invasive and most efficient in the management of OAB (overactive bladder). It is essential that you should continue conservative approaches like fluid restrictions and medication. If the symptoms are bothersome, you can consult your local urologist regarding the availability of neuromodulation in your area. It is the current recommendation for patients not responding to any other measures. It involves sending nerve impulses through your pelvic nerves with an implant which will regulate your bladder contraction.

About six weeks ago, I had chest pain and went to a hospital. I was admitted after having three blocked arteries, at 99, 93 and 88 percent, and successfully had three stents put in. Since released, I have turned to a vegan diet and eat fish, chicken, and greens. Would it be alright to have one cheat meal per week, aka steak, burger, Italian or would that do damage?

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Last time, I visited my dentist and did a filling. Please help me if possible.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. The time taken for the eruption of the wisdom tooth is not guaranteed. A clinical examination with an OPG X-ray is required to check the status and position of teeth. If it is found with enough space and aligned correctly, it will come out. Or else, it is better to have removal of the teeth. Since you have pain in gums, I would suggest doing lukewarm salt water gargling. You can take Aceclofenac 100 mg after food twice a day only if you have severe pain. If you have acidity, then take Pantoprazole 40 mg once daily half an hour before a meal. If you are taking pain medication continuously, it can cause or aggravate acidity. Antibiotics can be taken if you have lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes below jaw) or difficulty in mouth opening or severe pain at night or some other severe symptom. In that case, you can take Amoxicillin 500 mg thrice daily for five days after food. These medicines will give you symptomatic relief. If you have an allergy to any of the medications mentioned above, do not take them. Consult back here or with your local dentist for the medicines. You might require operculectomy (removal of gums covering the erupting tooth) if the tooth is favorable for the eruption but you have recurrent inflammation of the gums covering that tooth, to guide and provide space for the tooth to erupt. It is done after the examination or picture and X-ray assessment.

Vaccination is required in cases of exposure to rabid wild dogs, not pet dogs. Now, considering the fact that this puppy is your pet, I assume you would have got it vaccinated earlier.

Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

This has been happening daily for a month. Prior I had been exercising an hour a day five days a week, no issue. Currently still aiming for five but symptoms will start out on my bike or on the treadmill.I had a gastric bypass 11 years back. I rarely get the hypoglycemia episode when I would eat sugar. History of insulin resistance. Glucose is always under 100. Insulin was 9 six months back. It was 6 two weeks ago, glucose was 88. Ferritin 15, d-20. Currently, I am having Neurontin 800 four times a day, Vyvanse 50 once daily.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned it appears that you have hypoglycemic symptoms. First of all I would suggest that instead of doing finger prick testing of blood sugar it is preferable to do laboratory test for blood sugar. Secondly, there is an inpatient (after admission to the hospital) test to check your blood sugar after fasting for a required number of hours under observation.  C-peptide and proinsulin need to be measured as well. All these are inpatient tests to rule out any cause of hypoglycemia. Also, if you exercise it is expected that your blood sugar levels fall even though it is recent probably because you have improved in losing stored fat which was initially preventing this from happening. This can be improved if you eat complex carbohydrates like oatmeal, yogurt and fibrous fruits and nuts (if not allergic) before working out.

I had spotting to a very light flow for five days. My periods are normally light for 1 to 2 days increasing to a heavy flow for two days and tapers off for another two days. I normally have dark red blood with clots and painful cramps. This month when I had the spotting bit was light pink to light red, no cramps and never became heavy. My cycle is normally 35 days. I am currently on Vasceppa 4 g per day, Metformin 2000 mg per day, Fenofibrate 160 mg per day, Prenatal Vitamin.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through all the pictures of ultrasound sent by you (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There is endometrial thickening evident but there is no apparent evidence of any early gestational sac in situ which would indicate any pregnancy. Even if you are suspecting so or expecting as on date, the best way to rule out or confirm pregnancy in such early cases (if it is so) is to get a serum beta hCG test done, which is a blood-based test. It has a sensitivity of detecting pregnancy after seven days post intercourse. If the hCG levels are more than 5 mIU then you are pregnant for sure, else you are not.

I am certain this problem is mental as I feel like I suffer from anxiety and performance anxiety whether it be sex or sports. I am good looking and good with people and girls but do not know how to fix this problem. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. It is most likely that you are suffering from performance anxiety. You need to be confident about yourself. Forget about your last performance failure, or it will start a vicious cycle of performance anxiety and erection failure. Be bold. Spend enough time on foreplay and after play. Take help from your sex partner. Tell her about your anxiety so she does not demotivate and insult you for your failure. When you are going to have sex, actually play at that time and forget everything. Just concentrate on you and your partner. Do not think about the duration of your play but concentrate on the quality of the act. Ask your partner about satisfaction. Her satisfaction is important and not how long you do. Ask her about her likes and dislikes related to sex position, places to touch, places to kiss, etc. It will take some time but you have to be confident in yourself. Spend time on exercise daily for 30 to 40 minutes. Spend time for meditation for 15 minutes, take good sleep for seven hours daily, avoid junk food and eat healthy food, home cooked. Spend quality time with your friends and family. Avoid any type of substance abuse like alcohol, tobacco or any recreational drugs, spend time for your hobbies but active hobbies like reading books, writing, painting, learn to play musical instruments, play outdoor sports, etc. You have a high BMI seems to be obese, you need to lose weight.

What is that brown discharge?","Doctor":"Hi. If you are getting brown discharge regularly before getting periods, it is harmless. This is a normal phenomenon, which occurs due to hormonal changes. Similar hormone changes may occur during early pregnancy, and one may get such brown discharge, but there will be no periods.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days).

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"I was driving bike suddenly the weight of the entire bike shifted to my right hand. Itâs been more than a month.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Should I need to change my method of contraception? Or is it safe to keep this one? Currently, I am taking Claritin.","Doctor":"Hi. You have mentioned two medicines. Claritin (Loratadine and Pseudoephedrine) is used for allergy, and it is safe. Since your maternal grandmother had breast cancer, you are at high risk of getting breast cancer, but your mother is not having it now. You should do breast cancer screening tests BRCA 1 (breast cancer gene) and BRCA 2 to see if you carry the genetic markers. If it is positive, you are at very high risk of getting breast cancer than the average population. Hormonal contraceptives taken orally or by any route are contraindicated in people with a personal history of breast cancer as it can cause breast cancer with prolonged use. We do not advise it if you have a family history of breast cancer also. So you can stop TriNessa (Norgestimate with Ethinyl Estradiol tablets) which is a hormonal contraceptive with some risk. You can use an intrauterine nonhormonal contraceptive device like ParaGard which releases copper, which is safe. You can also use barrier methods like condom or diaphragm with spermicide.

At the time of ECG, my blood pressure was 168/100 and heart beat 46.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your ECG (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The reports mentioned on ECG are machine generated and are frequently inaccurate. There is no clear-cut evidence of myocardial infarction on ECG. As you also do not have any history of chest pain, it is unlikely for you to have any heart attack. And yes, heart rate is low and it is sinus bradycardia. Do you have any symptoms of dizziness, syncope, etc? If not then it needs no action at the moment. However, you should undergo thyroid test to rule out hypothyroidism as a cause for low heart rate. Also, should undergo echo, which will additionally provide the assurance to rule out MI. Also, if echo is normal then should have TMT (treadmill test), which will help in ruling out minor blockages, subclinical ischemic heart disease and to look for maximum heart rate you achieve during exercise, which will help in determining the benign nature of sinus bradycardia if the adequate heart rate is achieved. Also, high bp can also cause low heart rate by a reflex mechanism. So you should have medicine for it. I guess you are not receiving any medicines like beta blockers which can reduce heart rate. You should have tablet Telma CTD (Telmisartan and Chlorthalidone) 40/12.5 mg once a day in the morning for hypertension so get it prescribed by a local doctor.

With heart block, the heart rate does not increase with exercise correct? My heart rate is low at rest but increases as expected with exercise. Does this rule out a problem? If I had clinical bradycardia would not I feel bad as well?","Doctor":"Hello. Normal heart rate should be between 60 to 100 beats per minute. You are having bradycardia. It can be idiopathic without any cause. But it is better to get physically examined and if needed accordingly investigation can be planned.

This is still happening. I visited my GP four weeks ago who immediately prescribed anti-depressants. I have suffered from health anxiety for the last seven years. It comes in waves. The GP did not even check me over and told me not to worry as he had no concern. I am worrying about motor neuron disease. However, deep down this is unlikely because someone with this illness could not go to the gym (run and push weights). I would like an opinion from an expert.","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that your symptoms are not typical of motor neuron disease. You are right to say that this disorder is associated with other symptoms besides muscle twitching. From the other hand it does not cause sensibility problems or tingling. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing some tests to investigate for possible causes: Nerve conduction studies may be needed. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests.

On Thursday, I noticed that the floor of my mouth on the bottom right side felt sore. When I looked with a light, I noticed a couple of cuts that were kind of like paper cuts. They bleed when I brush. The pain can be managed somewhat with teeth pain relief gel. I do not recall these being there before my cleaning. Or if they were, they certainly did not cause any pain. Could they be caused by the cleaning? What do you recommend for healing, pain management, and preventing wound infection?","Doctor":"Hi. You mentioned about the bleeding of the gums after scaling. Usually, you can see bleeding gums and cut-like appearance near the border of the gingiva due to one of the following reasons. White appearance on the floor of the mouth suggests ulcers. It may be due to: Prevention: For more information consult a dentist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 27 year old unmarried male and my penis size is too small and thin. In the normal position, it is 3 inches, when it gets strong it is 4 inches. Are there any medicines or surgeries for the growth of penis? Also, my penis is not getting strong even when I am in sex mood. When I shake it with my hand, it slowly gets strong. Due to this problem, I am feeling tensed about how I am going to move with my wife after marriage. My marriage date is getting close.","Doctor":"Hello. Kindly investigate your serum testosterone and serum luteinizing hormone level, length and girth can only be increased if these levels are low. But, in those individuals in whom the testosterone level is normal, let me tell you one thing that, there is no medically proven treatment for increasing the length and girth the of penis. On erection, the normal size varies from 3.5 inches to 5.5 inches, and normal vaginal size is also between 3 to 4 inches. So, any erected penis of size more than 2.5 inches is able to satisfy both the partners. Orgasm in both the partners is independent of size, girth, and length of the penis. Thinking about penis size is a common feature of Dhat syndrome which is very prevalent in your subcontinent and is due to widespread prevalent myths regarding sex, semen, and sexual organs. So, my advice is to decrease your weight, do regular exercise, drink lots of water and do regular meditation. This can do wonders for your sexual life. For increasing the stamina, you can take herbal supplements like tablet Tentex Royal or tablets Staminex once daily.

Prior to this, she has a fever and sore on her tongue and somewhere near the tonsil. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern when it is a kid's matter. First of all, I would suggest you look in her oral cavity properly if she has caused any toothbrush injury or any source of bleeding if available. For bleeding gums, you apply a cold compress or ice packs right now at the affected site. Next, make her do salt warm water rinse if possible. One home remedy with honey is effective, you can take honey at your fingertip and apply all over her gumlines properly. Kindly make sure she does not brush in upward downward motions rather in a circular motion. Brush her teeth twice daily and bristles of her brush should be soft. Apply a bit of toothpaste two to three minutes before brushing all over her gumlines and then brush after one to two minutes, but make sure she should not swallow it. Give her gums smooth finger massage after she has done brushing. Make her rinse her mouth properly after every meal. Kindly post me about the updates."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My clitoris is itchy and has a slight burning sensation. The pain has not returned with the same intensity but has been somewhat present as an uncomfortable feeling of rubbing even when nothing is touching the region. I use water only to wash this area and I shower twice daily. Today I gently pulled back the clitoral hood and noticed that the clitoris is the same color as my body skin and not pink like the rest of my vulva. What could have caused this?","Doctor":"Hi. Itching on clitoris can be due to fungal infections. Do you have any white vaginal discharge which is itching and foul smelling? Do you have burning sensation or pain while passing urine? Clitoral pain could be due to trauma. If you have rubbed it hard while washing it will be painful because it is a very sensitive organ.  Do FBS (fasting blood sugar), PPBS (postprandial blood sugar) blood test on empty stomach tomorrow morning. Nerve-related pain can be seen in diabetes. Do you have diabetes or hypertension, since they can cause such problems? Since you are saying that it appears and feels normal, unlikely to be a tumor.

The problem is that it is causing me a lot of dry skin and wrinkles. I found an eye massage pen online. It gives heat also to the area. Can I use this instead of the warm compress?","Doctor":"Hello. The main purpose of the massager pen is to remove wrinkles and not to provide heat. So, it will not help with your Meibomian gland disease. The rationale behind advising warm compresses is to force out pent up secretions inside the Meibomian gland. Giving this heat and later massaging in a way as to force secretions out would be the best way to get rid of your problems. In case you are not fine with water, you can use a warm cup of coffee or any other beverage to warm your hand with or you could use palming where you rub your hands together until they become warm and give the heat to your eyelids.

You should use sunscreens with SPF 50 or more daily. Try to avoid sun exposure as possible. The creams used to increase skin color will do more harm than good. Melanin is the pigment which causes darkening. Its production increases on exposure to the sun. So protection from the sun by using sunscreen will definitely help to prevent darkening.

He suffered from a mild stroke yesterday and we would like to seek the second opinion on the proper treatment for his case.

Regarding your concern, I would like to explain that his blood pressure values are normal. I would like to know his symptoms. Did he perform a brain CT scan?

But when doing the center split, I get a stopping pain in my outer hip with no stretch in my inner thigh. If I rotate my knees back and hips forward, I can do more stretch, but there is also a slight stop. What is this and can it be worked? Will stretching help to release that stopping pain or am I anatomically incapable of doing a middle split? There is pain only when I am doing a center split. How to fix it? I do a lot of kicking, and I do not want to injure myself.","Doctor":"Hi. There are many factors, other than tight inner thigh muscles that limit the split especially center split. Bony restriction in the hip joint, as the hip joint bone gets jammed into socket because of extreme coxa vara angle (angulation between the neck and shaft of the thigh bone) leading to restrictions in movement. These jams will not happen when you do a side split as there is slight rotation occurring in the joint and allows the action to happen.  Other reason could be ligamentous (pubofemoral ligament) limitation as the ligament tightens and it limits the further movement. This ligament realigns and will relax while doing forward and side split. So, it will not restrict your movement other than center split. You can try tilting your pelvis forward so that there can be some relief with limitation in both the cases.

I have gone through your query. What is the age of your sister? From your statement, I assume that most of the tooth structure of the same affected teeth fell on its own and the other teeth are good. To guide you better, I would like to see the image of the teeth. If the adjacent teeth are healthy, you can also go for a bridge, which is also a fixed prosthesis, but there should be teeth on both sides of the missing teeth, and the adjacent teeth will also be prepared and capped. As far as the implant is considered, there is nothing to worry. The procedure will be carried out under local anesthesia, so there will not be any pain in 99.99 % cases, though she might feel pressure and any pain or discomfort during or after the procedure which will be managed with medications for comforting the patient. It will take time for the implant to get attached to the bone and the following procedures to complete. But it has a reasonable success rate and your adjacent teeth will not be affected. Make sure that the doctor knows her medical history if she has any. Regarding anxiety, you can guide her positively at home. The doctor will also give early morning appointment if possible and manage her anxiety and if required (for severe anxiety), medicines will be given. Tell her that everything will be done with her consent and only if she is comfortable. We are there to help you.

I started a new job a couple of months ago, I am going through a divorce, and I have health issues pertaining to a brain surgery I had two years ago. I had a normal pap smear last year. My periods were normal until three months ago. I was late by over a week for the past two months. I got my period between 18-24 of last month. I stopped and then again bled for a week from 1st to 6th of this month. (This is the normal time I would have gotten it months ago) now again a week later I am bleeding. It started with dark brown blood that had tissue like small pieces in it and is now dark red going on day three. My periods are always very heavy, I always have ovary pain and bad cramps. I had a c-section with my daughter and was told I have scar tissue during an exam. I suffer from very painful periods. When I sneeze or move or cough or stretch during ovulation and the beginning of my period I have a feeling like my right side is ripping apart. Why am I bleeding like this? It has never happened to me before and I am scared it could be cancer. I just had bloodwork I went to the hospital for an unrelated issue this week before the bleeding started and my red and white blood cells and normal CBC workup was normal. Please help I am trying not to stress.","Doctor":"Hell. First of all stop worrying. We can take care of this. Stress can also play a vital role in hormonal functions. So try to calm and relax yourself first. See in general, an average length of the menstrual cycle that is considered normal is 28 plus minus 7 days, so any deviation either before or after is abnormal. Coming to your present menstrual history, you got early bleeding this time. This mostly suggests some hormonal disturbance which needs to be evaluated. It could be related to your thyroid hormone or even a lifestyle related problem called PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome).  But however any structural causes like polyps or fibroids also need to be ruled out for which ultrasound is required along with an examination by your gynecologist. Based on the past history, it appears probably you must have had an entity called endometriosis or scar endometriosis (in your cesarean scar). This usually happens under the influence of the hormones that occurs in natural menstrual cycles when you are ovulating. Right now probably you did not ovulate either because of stress or due to the hormonal changes (we need to evaluate). I am suggesting a few tests that you need to take so that we can have a look into this. Meanwhile, try to work on your lifestyle changes, do regular exercises and take adequate dietary precautions (avoid fatty or sugary or high carb junk foods). All these measures will have beneficial effects on you. Try to meditate or do yoga for relaxation. I would also like to know if you had any recent weight gain or weight loss, any excess acne development or excess facial hair growth, or scalp hair loss. Also, if you have any headaches or visual changes. It would be good if you could share the details of your recent ultrasound reports, your scar tissue biopsy report if any done, and the details of your previous issue which I am suspecting it to be endometriosis to guide you on the present problem.

My period cycle is 27 to 28 days. But, I was getting my period from 30 to 32 days. Is it normal? This time, I got my periods after 37 days. Is this normal after taking Dronis or is it irregular? I am also trying for pregnancy.","Doctor":"Hi. Dronis is a contraceptive used to prevent pregnancy. You will not become pregnant if you take it. You should stop it if you want to become pregnant. The cycle is normal when it is from 21 to 35 days. Nothing to worry. If you have irregular periods, do serum TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) and serum prolactin on empty stomach tomorrow morning and let me know your report. If you have any hormonal imbalance, it can be corrected with medicine and your periods will be regular and you will become pregnant. Also, do USG pelvis by transvaginal scan to see if you have PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome). Take tablet Folic Acid 5 mg once daily after food since you are planning a pregnancy.

I am taking tablets for it.","Doctor":"Hi. The floaters in the front of the eye indicate disease in the posterior segment of the eye that is retina or vitreous. As you have raised blood pressure, though you are taking medication, you have an increased chance of having retina and vitreous problems. You can get your dilated examination to check the posterior segment. There may be bleeding or swelling in your eye or a degenerative process called posterior vitreous detachment which is common in your age.

The soreness in the area of the tear has increased and I have noticed a freqeuent amount of vibrations in my leg muscles as well as soreness in my muscles too.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your concern. As you tried with conservative management and still have not much of improvement, I suggest you try an orthopedic surgeon opinion on reattachment of rectus femoris surgically. Keep working on your glute and hamstring strength and core stability exercises. I would recommend you to not to indulge in any activity like kicking and running (I know you will not do as pain limits the movements). Do not do any kind of activity that requires you to exert your quadriceps too much as this may worsen the situation. This includes a certain position of the leg as well. Fix up an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon as soon as possible and get evaluated and surgically fixed. Until then keep icing it to avoid pain and spasm which will help you to maintain your current situation and prevents from worsening.

It does not feel impacted but it is digging into my cheek which resulted in a cut, and the tooth agitates the cut whenever I move my jaw. The pain is not bad but still, I was wondering if it is necessary to remove it.","Doctor":"Hi. Since it is causing trouble to your cheek and cuts as well, my suggestion would be to get that wisdom tooth removed. If at all you do not want tooth removal, that tooth can be checked and any sharp margins if present can be rounded off. That decreases the trouble, but it is temporary relief. Not a permanent solution. So better visit a dentist and his clinical evaluation can suggest you a better treatment plan.

But I also did my RNA PCR test which came below detection range. The range was 20 to 100000 copies per ml but mine is below detection limit. Please guide me. I am freaking out right now. Is it possible to get negative after 75 days by fourth generation antigen-antibody test and have a below detection limit? I also took PEP after eight days of exposure but due to its side effect, I stopped it after 20 days. I tested 11 times in 75 days and all the test came negative except PCR test which came below the detection limit?","Doctor":"Hello. I went through your post. If a fourth generation test comes negative after three weeks of exposure, then the possibility of having an infection is less than 1 %. So I can assure you that you are HIV negative. You can repeat another test preferably CMIA (chemiluminescent immunoassay) HIV after three weeks again. So that we exclude HIV 100 %. So, relax and do not panic. You are HIV negative.

There are ongoing painful back muscle aches apparently from months. I used SARM for workouts. I had poor hydration habits, with too much caffeine and not taken enough water. I stopped taking SARM supplement one week ago. But painful back muscle issue continues, with getting relief only from ingestion of entire bottles of sports drinks. I am having several bottles throughout the day and night. I have difficulty sleeping. I read in a book that SARM has a synthetic steroid properties. I think it has got accumulated in my muscles. How long will I have this? What can I do to get relief?","Doctor":"Hi. It may or may not be directly related to SARM (selective androgen receptor modulator) use. As a backache is a prevalent problem in this age group and BMI (body mass index) is 39 (attachment removed to protect patient identity) which predisposes to spine problems leading to nerve compressions and muscle aches.  Doing heavy exercises like lifting heavy weights may also be a reason. The cause is multifactorial, and it is aggravated by SARM depending upon its additional contents. Is there any tingling, numbness or burning sensation over back or chest? So you should get yourself evaluated with some investigations like X-ray spine anteroposterior or lateral and may need CT scan further depending upon the X-Ray findings (gap because of vertebrae, bony density for osteoporosis, and bony spurs). You should also get vitamin D level done which is usually low in elders. It will settle in a week or two. Also, use topical anti-inflammatory medicines like Diclofenac spray or gel two times a day. You can try hot water fomentation. You need to have Calcium supplements once a day like Shelcal (Calcium carbonate with Vitamin D3).  Use muscle relaxants like Myoril 4 mg (Calcium carbonate with Vitamin D3) or Flexon MR (Ibuprofen, Paracetamol with Chlorzoxazone). Avoid heavy activities for a few days at least. So it needs to be evaluated especially at this age group and to rule out the other causes.

I have to get another colonoscopy between 3-6 months from the first colonoscopy.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I did these two days ago. All was fine until now when the tooth gave me one minute of pure pain when I drank cold milk. Please tell me what to do. Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello. I think the cavity was very deep and so the filling was placed close to the nerve area. This could have given you severe sensitivity with cold items. My suggestion is to just wait for a few more days. If you experience sudden, severe, shooting pain, you need to visit your dentist and get that tooth either root canal treated or extracted. If the filling is too close to the nerve, it causes irritation and thereby pain. You could avoid very hot and very cold food for a few days to just observe the condition of the tooth.

I have viewed your X-rays (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and there is no feature to suggest a stress fracture in the calcaneum bone and bones in the heel area. It is possible that you have a soft tissue or tendon abnormality which can cause you the pain in the heel area.

In short I would like to get a sense the scope and steps of this radiotherapy treatment to reduce pain. Is this a very costly treatment? How effective is this treatment to reduce pain? How long the effectiveness of the five sessions last?","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. It looks like a stage 4 lung cancer (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The pain in the back and limbs is possibly due to bone metastasis (cancer spread to the bone). You have not attached any report to know the details of cancer (type of cancer, treatment received and involvement of other parts of the body due to lung cancer). Does your father have any associated diseases like diabetes, hypertension, cardiac or thyroid disorder, any smoking history? Is he walking without support and what about eating habits? The radiotherapy will be given daily for five days. It will take at least one to two weeks to act. So he must continue pain medications. They will not give any injection with radiotherapy. It will take just five minutes daily for radiotherapy to complete one session. Yes, the first day it may take more time because they have to plan the radiotherapy.  The effect of radiotherapy may last for 1 to 3 months. Sometimes because of a resistant tumor or huge mass, radiotherapy fails to bring any relief to the patient.

Before a month, she felt pain in one breast and went to GP. He did an X-ray, which showed a tear in one of the implants. Yesterday she visited a surgeon. He informed her that there is no chance for any replacement surgery until the inflammation clears up entirely. He said he could take out the implants, but will not replace it until the swelling gets clear completely. She is advised to take Ibuprofen for the reduction of inflammation. She was advised to visit the surgeon after a week. My concern is whether the leakage from the silicon breast implant is going in her body? How dangerous is this leakage? Is it safe to take these implants out and inserting new ones at a later date after healing?","Doctor":"Hi. I can assure that silicon from the ruptured implant will stay there only and it will not go anywhere in her body. Your surgeon is correct in telling you that the replacement can be done just after the inflammatory response settles down. It is better to remove the ruptured implant and wait for a replacement with a new one until the active inflammatory response gets resolved.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Why am I having pain on my left side when the cyst is on the right? Could this pain be due to theÂ cyst?","Doctor":"Hi. The pain that you are experiencing is not due to the ovarian cyst, as the cyst is on the right side and pain is on the left side. This pain might be caused by an infection or any other pathology. So, I suggest you repeat an ultrasound of the pelvis if the pain is severe. PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) will cause irregularity in the menstrual cycle but will not cause such a pain.

I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Do not try Cannabis oil as a remedy for your lesion. Your report is suggestive of ductal carcinoma in situ.

However, the best way to rule out pregnancy anyways would be to get a urine pregnancy test done at home with a home pregnancy kit. If the test is negative then you can be sure that you are pregnancy safe and the delay is likely to be stress induced during this cycle. In that case, you may then opt for a withdrawal bleed with Progesterone tablets.

Medicine taking other than above are Telma-CT (80 12.5) one time per day and Embeta-XR 50 one time per day.","Doctor":"Hello. Sudden stopping of the above drug may cause withdrawal symptoms. So you can start with slow withdrawal like take above tablet half every day or full tablet alternate day for three months. Then dose may be reduced to weekly 2 to 3 times for two months, then weekly 1 to 2 times next three months then withdraw the drug. Discontinued rapidly (over one to seven days) were more likely to relapse within a few months than those who reduced the dose gradually over two or more weeks. You can use a mild dose of anxiolytics like Alprazolam or long-acting Chlordiazepoxide in between withdrawal if you feel withdrawal symptoms. Best to withdraw under the guidance of your doctor. The antidepressant effect may be continued up to 2 to 3 weeks after discontinuation of the drug. You can use yoga and regular exercise during withdrawal time. Avoid caffeine and caffeinated drinks.

For example, it dried on a surface and you touch it with another dry object or with dry hands.

I was told it is not transferable once dried if it is touched or brushed against by other objects.

I would be concerned about touching the blood after it has dried without knowing it is there.","Doctor":"Hello. No, once it has dried, virus is not transmitted and cannot spread the disease when it comes in contact with intact skin. Also, with drying, virus gets inactivated.

It does not lead to the elevation of B12. So, you can continue with this medication. For high B12 level, you have already ruled out liver and kidney disease by their subsequent reports. So, I suggest you investigate with CBC (complete blood count) and peripheral smear examination blood report for further work up. B12 is a water-soluble vitamin and it can readily be excreted through the kidneys. So, do not worry about that and investigate with CBC and peripheral smear examination report as suggested.

Apply hemorrhoid cream (Prep H: Phenylephrine) locally several times a day, especially after having a bowel movement.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Which tablet should I take and how? I was thinking of Ovral G. But, will the medicines work as the date is unpredictable?","Doctor":"Hello. In breastfeeding, serum prolactin increases. That helps in milk production. Even for increasing breast milk production, sometimes prolactin has been given. Prolactin depresses/reduces/disturbs the menstrual cycle. Before six months of age, breastfeeding mothers better avoid hormonal intake as through breast milk can transfer to the baby and in the very early days after birth, it is difficult to digest. It is better to have weaning and early food for your baby as now he/she can have fresh juices, banana, cereals, etc. I suggest you have tablet Primolut N (Norethisterone) 10 mg twice daily from now and continue for two to three days before you want to have periods as you have irregular periods.

Primolut N will give you withdrawal bleed within one to two days at the maximum after stopping the medication.

Her last period cycle was of 29 days and after that, till the 35th day we did not have sex but on the 36th day, we had unprotected sex. So we were worried that is this a case of pregnancy and she did a pregnancy test with the kit (I-pill kit) in the home after five days with the first urine in the morning. The test was negative. She is also suffering from PCOD. What should we do?","Doctor":"Hello. Did she have irregular periods previously as well? The delayed period is unlikely due to pregnancy because you did not have sex before the 36th day. So, there is no chance of pregnancy. However, for the sex which was unprotected, we cannot predict regarding the chances of pregnancy especially if I-pill was not taken. However, in this case as well chances of pregnancy are less as sex occurred in delayed phase near the expected period date. Now, the cause for her period is likely a PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease) which can very well cause delayed and irregular periods. Before going ahead, are you sure that there was absolutely no sexual contact before that? If yes, then she was unlikely to be pregnant before. Now, in that case, we can wait and watch for periods to come for another week. Usually one will get a period within 6 to 7 weeks. If you are not sure regarding sexual contact before that then you should get her urine pregnancy test repeated now and if negative then blood pregnancy test to be sure. Next thing, she will need hormonal pills and other medicines for period regulation for PCOD. So for this, she will need an in-person visit to the gynecologist.

There is no relation between family history and Down's syndrome in the baby. If the nuchal translucency measurement is healthy, with less than 2.99 mm, then there is a fewer chance of having a fetal anomaly. You can have other blood tests in the early and late second trimester like double marker tests, amniocentesis, and chorionic villi sampling to diagnose it.

So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have been a strict vegetarian for 12 years now and for a lot of that time, my diet was poor and mostly carbohydrate based. I have suspected an iron deficiency for a very long time. I had a test for it a few years ago and my hemoglobin was normal but my ferritin was only 39. My doctor said it was fine. I recently had a terrible experience with several methods of birth control and for a few months was having 10 day periods twice a month, and at its worst, I was bleeding for a month straight. I started taking a food-based iron for 2 to 3 months (27 mg) and had my iron checked twice within six months. Both times my ferritin was up to around 80. However, I still feel increasingly tired and other conditions are being ruled out. I just realized that before both of those tests with normal results, I had taken an iron pill within two days of the test. My question is could that have given me a false reading on the ferritin test? If I would have had iron the day before? Is a couple months of food based on iron enough to have raised my levels that fast? And lastly, given the heavy bleeding and relative lack of dietary iron in my life, how could I not be iron deficient? Currently, I am taking Clonazepam PRN, Lamictal 50 mg.","Doctor":"Hello. Ferritin is an acute phase reactant. This means that apart from reflecting iron stores, it also reflects the inflammatory condition in the body. Taking Iron supplements just a few days before the blood test is not sufficient to raise your serum ferritin levels so quickly. But if there is any inflammation going on in your body, your serum ferritin levels will be raised. It is thus very important to rule out any inflammatory condition before interpretation of serum ferritin levels. Have you checked your vitamin D and vitamin B12 levels?  Deficiency in vitamin B12 & Vitamin D can also produce fatigue, weakness and neural disorders. You should get your blood levels of these two vitamins checked and continue taking your Iron and Folic acid supplements. I would suggest that you take the regular Iron and Folic acid supplements available in the form of pills along with a glass of orange juice or lemon water for better absorption.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely.

Initially, when I got my first panic attack, I just suffered without taking medical help since I am frightened to take medicine. This made matters worse and I started to have almost regular panic attacks followed by mild depression a month later. I am a 37-year-old healthy male with no diseases. I used to regularly jog or workout in the gym. I eat a healthy mostly homemade vegetarian diet in limits. I never drank alcohol or smoked. I was happy with my life and had no regrets. But after I got my first panic attack I got so scared that I started to research internet furiously and overthink a lot. This made matters even worse for me and finally, I consulted my local GP. He prescribed me with Stalopam 10 mg at night and 0.5 mg Clonafit twice a day. I was afraid to take them and finally after my panic was getting bad enough to cause insomnia, reluctantly with GPs persuasion I started to take the medicines. I took Stalopam daily but disregarding my GP I took only 0.5 mg Clonafit at night as I heard it can cause addiction. Initially for two to three weeks, I felt a little depressed every now and then but the panic attacks intensity decreased immediately. Though I got the attacks they were not scary. After the first month the depression too became better. Then I halved the Clonafit and started to take only 0.25 mg at night. It has been now two and a half months and I am feeling a lot better. Though some days I get anxiety episodes, it is not disturbing and depression too has gone. So I requested my GP to stop it. Accordingly, he asked to me take 5 mg Stalopam with 0.25 Clonafit for 30 days and stop completely. Do you think it is right on my part or would it be advisable to continue the standard dose 10 mg for a few more months until anxiety completely disappears?","Doctor":"Hello. It is good to know that you are feeling better and the medication have been helpful. Regarding your query about medication, it is advisable to continue Stalopam 10 mg (Escitalopram) for at least six months even if you are feeling better. Stalopam is an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) which is effective in treating anxiety disorders, panic symptoms and depression. If you are not experiencing any side effects, Stalopam is safe to continue for a longer term. Clonafit (Clonazepam) is meant for short term use. I agree with your plan to take 0.25 mg at night only. Cut down to half the dose again for four weeks and then stop it. It can be used sparingly as needed if you feel anxiety is high. You also need to consider managing any underlying issues which precipitated this panic attacks. Was there anything stressful happening in your life during this period? Share any difficult feelings with a trusted family member or friend. If needed, consider counseling. Develop self-help interventions to manage stress and prevent relapse of anxiety. Regular exercise helps. Cut down on coffee, tea, and alcoholic drinks. Take up yoga if feasible. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 28-year-old female.

I suggest you apply a topical antibiotic either Neosporin ointment or Mupirocin 2 % ointment, twice daily for a few days. Regards.

I am having itching on my body since I reached home. I took Allegra, but no benefit.Â This itching is happening every 15 seconds in different parts of the body like legs,Â arms, face, back and goes away if I itch. What can I do to stop it immediately?

Later, two sores or ulcers appeared. One on the clitoral hood and another one on the right labia minora. It burns when I urinate. I am HPV positive, and I recently got treatment for CIN before three months. I have attached the pictures. I am concerned that my HPV is out of control and now I have a VIN. It may be a vulva precancer. Also, I have not ruled out herpes.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is better to have full investigations as you already have a history of HPV (human papillomavirus) and treated for CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia). When did you have your last cervical smear or visit to colposcopy clinic? It is better to have both. Have one high vaginal swab, one local hysteroscopic examination of the lesions as you might need biopsy or pus or discharge collection from the sores to check in a laboratory. It is better to have it in a infections control center by a specialist. Have a urine analysis and urine culture as well. Collect all laboratory results and discuss here. Have strict local hygiene. Use soft, and comfortable cotton undergarments. For some time it is better to use condoms to reduce sexually transmitted disease, and it is better to avoid forceful penetrative sex. Use only water for cleaning the affected area. Avoid using cosmetics or any other products. After the collection of all investigations and examinations, you can have tablet Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily and tablet Metronidazole 400 mg eight hourly for 14 days.

I have given cancellation of my PG course. For that, I passed out the bank loan, and everything is done. For the past few days, I think that I can do business well because I have got an experience of three years and I can get profit from it a lot. I was so happy when I told this to my parents. They told me to do a PG course. But I do not feel well here. I do not know what to do in PG course due to an overload of work, and I am scared of it. I think about dying. If I go to business, everyone will ask a question why you left your course? If I fail in business, what will I do? I am worried.","Doctor":"Hi. First, you need to relax. Just calm down. Take deep breaths. Do not get panic. Ask yourself what you want to do. Do not think about what others will think. If you think about what others will think about you, then you are allowing them to do their work of thinking. People will point out even though you do good or bad. Also, people are not happy with god. So stop thinking about others. You need to be confident in yourself. It does not matter whatever you do either business or PG course. So stay relaxed. Write down what you can do. Go with your profession and concentrate on it. Face each consequence except what others will think. Be firm in your decision. Take help from your close one or parents. Talk to them. Do not be afraid. Take advice from seniors if you do further studies or even you want to drop it, talk with them. Do not panic. Suicide is not a solution. Fight with your situation.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have two fibroids 9 cm total size and was advised to take 2 x 500 mg three times a day but it completely stops the bleeding but the bleeding starts after three days again. I have had on and off bleeding for two weeks now. Is this a common problem with the medication? I am extremely worried and cannot be normal. Please help and advise.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. It would have been helpful if you could attach the report of your ultrasound for me to have a look. Based on what you mentioned about the total size of two fibroids to be ~9 cm, I am assuming each one must be less than 5 cm and not so huge. Fibroids would not cause irregular bleeding unless they are lying close to the uterine cavity. Usually, in the perimenopausal age group of women, like you are already 48, we prefer to give medical management so as to control the bleeding in those who have excess bleeding. As with age, your menopause may set in and menses will eventually stop and then you will not have any problems because of the fibroids. This is done to avoid unnecessary surgery when the bleeding would anyways stop after menopause. In your case, I would like to know if the fibroids are close to the uterine cavity on ultrasound which may cause irregular bleeding. Also, in your query, the drug name has not come, but I guess it is Tranexamic acid (or Trapic or Pause) which just controls the excessive bleeding means will reduce the bleeding. But will neither stop the bleeding pattern due to hormonal disturbance in the perimenopausal abnormal bleeding nor due to the fibroids which bleed due to the close situation to the uterine cavity. Other causes if irregular bleeding apart from fibroids need to be evaluated like hormonal changes, thyroid issues, or uterine lining (endometrial) thickening, etc. If it is due to fibroid position that is causing off and on bleeding, it may not stop with Trapic (but only will reduce in amount) and may stop only after menopause or after the surgical removal of the uterus. But if it is due to the hormonal disturbance or due to the perimenopausal phase, it needs to be controlled with some hormonal medications. It would be good if you could connect with me through chat and share the reports of yours so that we can have a close look if any further evaluation needs to be done regarding the abnormal bleeding pattern. Ultrasound report needs to be reviewed. ? Thyroid abnormalities, ? perimenopausal AUB (abnormal uterine bleeding), ? Ca (cancer) endometrium, ? EIN (endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia). please revert back with reports."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have been nauseous for nine days. I am traveling to a different state.

If he is wanking most of the days, in front of you, I do not think this is a healthy child behavior. Abnormal behavior of a child should be addressed at the right time. Your son may or may not understand that it is unusual behavior for his age. A lot of stressors can be a cause for the abnormal action of a child. Try to find out the cause. Yes, you should talk to him more positively. So you will be aware of what is going on in his mind.

Low blood sugar level needs attention quickly. I suggest you go to the nearest healthcare facility as soon as possible. Low blood sugar can be due to many different reasons. It could vary with the time of the day when you check your blood sugar level.  Blood sugar level keeps changing, and it is not constant. Hence, it cannot be 30 mg/dL throughout the day. Since you have not given any other history, it is difficult to understand your condition better. People who are on treatment for diabetes may experience low blood sugar levels if the dosage of the medicine is not correct and it needs to be changed. Sometimes an inadvertent extra dose of medication could be a reason for low blood sugar level. If you are on any drug that lowers the blood sugar level, then you need to report to your doctor as soon as possible so that the doctor can make suitable adjustments to your medication.  If you are a healthy individual with no clinical condition or treatment, then you may need to regulate your eating habits and eat smaller meals more frequently. If your blood sugar level goes down often, you might also need to undergo a hormonal evaluation to see why it is happening.

Behavioral addiction is a form of addiction that involves a compulsion to engage in a rewarding non-drug-related behavior. Sometimes it is called as a natural reward as it does not cause any adverse consequences to the persons physical, mental, social or financial well-being. Behavior addiction needs to be cured or controlled using your self-willpower. Diverting your mind and body away from the circumstances with the help of physical exercises, games, and entertainment can help you. Never sleep alone.

I am expecting menstrual cycle for two weeks. My color is generally brown before and after my period. My PAP test was fine.  I always use condoms on and off with my partner. There is no pain, cramping or smell.","Doctor":"Hi. Since you have the discharge for three weeks, it has to be evaluated. It is good to hear that your PAP smear (papanicolaou test) is normal. You may have spotting due to some hormonal imbalance or uterine pathology. Do serum TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone), serum beta hCG (Human chorionic gonadotrophin) and serum prolactin blood test on an empty stomach in the morning to see if you have any hormonal imbalance. Do USG (ultrasonography) pelvis by transvaginal scan to look for polyp in uterine cavity or cervix, thickened endometrium. Let me know your report after getting them.

If I can give you a ratio of how many time he urinates in an hour, is usually twice which is not normal. On consulting a nephrologist, we were advised for an ultrasound scan. I have the report and I need to know more on this current condition.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query and reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your father is having obstruction to drainage of the urinary bladder, leading to very high bladder pressure which has damaged the ureter and kidney. The reason for this is not apparent on USG and needs further evaluation. At present, he requires urgent drainage of the bladder with a urinary catheter. I would like to know if your father is a diabetic and whether any blood tests to assess his renal function has been done?

They last for hours and nothing helps them. Last night we were watching TV and suddenly he had a severe headache above his left eye. He said it was the worst he ever had but was the same as the other ones, it was severe pain and it felt like when your hand is going to sleep too. It took hours to go away.","Doctor":"Hi. The condition of having severe headache could be due to various reasons. But based on the limited information which I could gather from your query, if I have to provide a diagnosis, then I would doubt that this headache which your son is getting, could be due to strain in his eyes. Because constant exposure to the sun during play hours may lead to a headache in some people (assuming that he plays basketball in an open ground under sunlight) and watching television for long hours could aggravate it further. It would be great if you could provide details on past medical history of your son such as, So that I could give or suggest a complete diagnosis and treatment for your son's condition. For time being, for instant relief of his headache, you can give him the following tablet Paracetamol (500 mg) one tablet once in six hours for two days. Advice him to: I strongly recommend coming for a review after two days with the detailed history for a complete diagnosis and treatment.

Are the spots related to diabetes or some serious problem? Please guide.","Doctor":"Hello. Before commenting anything about diabetes and its relationship with oral problems, I would like to see images of your gums having a white spot so that we can discuss appropriately."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Currently, I am 17 weeks pregnant. I had spotting which started during 13 weeks and lasted for about a week. I was put on bed rest and advised to take Susten 400 mg. Everything was fine in 16 weeks ultrasound. The doctor said no need of bedrest hereafter. But did not say anything abt sex. Can I have sex with my husband? Is it safe now?","Doctor":"Hi. It would be better if you could send me your detailed history and scan report that you had recently. Mild bleeding at 13 weeks could be due to local pathology like cervical erosion, polyp, threatened miscarriage or just low lying developing placental at a very initial stage, etc. You got a Progesterone supporting form of a tablet that helped you and now you are asymptomatic.  If you have not had any previous miscarriage or cervical incompetence history or recently not had any diagnosis of threatened miscarriage or cervical incompetence or low lying placenta or any polyp or cervical erosion, can have sex but very gentle with lubricant. (Talking about penetrative vaginal sex). Try to have a valid exclusion of all the above with proper history and examination like a prepregnancy normal cervical smear or outpatient hysteroscopic normal examination and recent normal scan and normal cervical length measurement recently can make things easy for you. (That is why I needed your complete history and investigation reports). In case of any symptoms, you report treating obstetrician or nearest tertiary care center to exclude any emergency.

The last week I have had constant headaches and periodic blurry vision. I am wondering if this could be a result of not wearing my glasses. How often should I be wearing my glasses? The periodic blurry vision started two weeks ago and one week ago the constant headache started (4 to 6 out of 10). I have seen a few different doctors about it but they are not sure.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, since how long time you put your glasses? However, there are many points I would like to explain to you: For this, my answer is yes, your problem which you complain maybe caused because you do not put your glasses. I advise you to use them as I told you and then if the problem is still there it is another speech.

I have had no trouble with it since then up until now. I have started getting pain which has lasted a few days and does not seem to go away. The dentist who performed the root canal on me had mentioned to me at the time after the procedure that she was not able to remove the last nerve as it was in an awkward position. So my worry is that could that nerve have become infected, hence the pain, or could it be some other cause? Could you please help me as I am in a lot of pain due to it?","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, you need to start antibiotics like Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid 625 mg twice daily for a week along with a painkiller three times a day. Mostly, it is due to the infected leftover root canal. You need to see an Endodontist to determine whether he can do retreatment for the tooth. If it is not possible, then you may well have to get the tooth extracted. Else, you can also go directly for extraction.

She also had a spinal tap test and diagnosed with a high infection. Suggest me the best specialist doctor for this. Is there any serious problem now or in the future?","Doctor":"Hello. The reports you sent me do not show normal values beside the observed values (attachment removed to protect patient identity). From what I can understand, this would have been a case of viral meningitis. If the child did not have any serious life-threatening episode during this infection, it is less likely that there would be any damage done. As regards the future, since there were no convulsions, I feel not much damage has been done, so things should be fine. Continue other medications as going on. Consult a neurologist for the same.
