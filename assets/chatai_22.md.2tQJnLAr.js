Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Thanks for the query. I can understand your concern. According to your history, there is a possibility that the lesion you described could be a Bartholin,s cyst. But as you mentioned by direct examination only we can make the exact diagnosis. Now at this situation what you can do is, if it is painful please go for some analgesic drugs. You can take a sitz bath with lukewarm water and with few ml of disinfectant liquid like Dettol. With this the symptoms of inflammation can be relieved and size of the lesion can be decreased. You can do this twice a day for three days. If the lesion persists or recurs you may need to consult a local gynecologist for examination and treatment.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I am afraid of going to the doctor because I am embarrassed and ashamed. I have bad anxiety and social anxiety and depression. I pick at my skin constantly and I do it unknowingly and also when I am aware. I feel like I cannot help but I do it. And I do it mostly when I am having an anxiety attack. I also do it because I feel as if I need to pop everything on my body. And I am creating scars on my body and try to avoid looking in the mirror as much as I can because I do not want to do it to my face. What is wrong with me and how can I help myself? Is there anything I can get myself over the counter that I can take or put on my skin to help so maybe I would not have anything to constantly pick at?","Doctor":"Hi. I am so sorry to hear about your problem, I can understand it must be really difficult for you. Anxiety has to be managed in two ways: 1. Medical management, you will require some medications if the problem is severe. I cannot prescribe them online because it needs complete evaluation and some blood test might also be required. So for that, you will have to see a local psychiatrist. 2. Therapy, psychotherapy is one of the most effective ways of controlling anxiety and depression. You need to understand the negative thought pattern which is causing the anxiety in the first place so that you can either stop them or at least not get affected by them. Cognitive behavioral therapy is one such tool. As you have mentioned, that you are not comfortable with going to a doctor which is completely understandable, I would suggest to opt for online counseling sessions which are equally effective and works well for people who either have social anxiety or have difficulty traveling. The counseling sessions are done online once a week via video consultation. Therapy and medication combined are the gold standards for the treatment of anxiety and depression. Apart from that take out some time every day and engage in some relaxing activities like deep breathing, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, etc. I can understand it is overwhelming when you have kids around and so much to do but it is important that you also take care of yourself and make yourself a priority too. Only if you are healthy you will be able to provide a healthy environment for the family. If you want to start with therapy sessions you can let me know."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am doing research on diagnosis and treatment of mental illnesses. I have already interviewed couple of psychiatrists and now would like to focus on asking some questions to endocrinologists. My questions are: 1) “In thyroid disorders mainly in hyperthyroidism a paranoid syndrome may occur” Why is this happening? 2) What is the connection between low ferritin level and thyroid? 3) What does an elevated level of homocysteine mean to an endocrinologist? Thank you for your help and time.","Doctor":"Hi. 1) Yes, paranoid syndrome is frequently seen in association with patients having hyperthyroidism, reason being distractive over activity, anxiety, emotional instability, exaggerated insensitivity to noise, fluctuating depression and other unexplained medical symptoms. All these things can lead to paranoid symptoms. 2) Low ferritin or iron level decreases de-iodination activity which slows down conversion of T4 to T3. Low ferritin decreases the activity of enzyme thyroid peroxidase which is dependent on iron. Hence, it causes increase in concentration of circulating TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone). 3) Raise in homocysteine level is not considered to be good. It could be genetic and due to other causes. In genetic cause it can cause short life span of the person as it causes atherosclerosis and more effect is seen on cardiovascular system. High level causes damage to arterial wall and plaque formation, may also cause aggregation of platelets, clot formation and blockage of an artery. It is more dangerous in case when coronary artery supplying the heart gets affected as this can cause myocardial infarction (commonly known as heart attack). Hope this answer helps you.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have been taking the pill regularly, but I missed a day. I have been sexually active. I have now been bleeding for three weeks without a stop. My doctor told me to stop taking the pill until the bleeding stops. Even though I did, to this day, it has not stopped. In addition to the bleeding, I have nausea, bloating, fatigue and cramps. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. How are you doing? Please do not get stressed out. You are fine. All this while, you have been trying to control the symptoms of the cyst, when the real cause of this cyst, which is anovulation is still present. Let me explain. You are not pregnant. I say this because, just by missing a single pill, you cannot get pregnant. These pills suppress the hormones from the body and thereby the ovulation. So, for these hormones to be released, you have to miss at least two pills, that is, 48 hours of no pills. Also, you are continuously bleeding, and this rules out pregnancy. The problem here is your weight. You are trying to stop the cysts with the pills. But, they can only prevent further cyst formation and not those which are already there. From your history, I presume you to have PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease). This is a congenital condition, by which I mean, it is genetically programmed, and you get it from your parents. When you suddenly put on a lot of weight, this cholesterol is converted to the estrogen hormone. This is similar to how obese men develop breasts, and young obese girls get their periods at a younger age. In both the cases, they have high levels of estrogen, the female hormone. In your body too, when fat, which is a store for future use, is more than normal, this is converted to estrogen, which tips the balance between FSH from the brain and the ovarian hormone. FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), as the name suggests, stimulates the follicle from the ovary. Once the follicle is big enough to ovulate, the FSH is suppressed by the same estrogen hormone from the ovary. But, when the same estrogen hormone is coming from fat, the brain is confused, and the follicle growth stops early, at a smaller follicle size and thus, will not rupture. In the next scan, you will see these follicles as polycystic ovaries. This is usually associated with obesity, irregular cycles, no periods for few months and later, heavy periods with clots and fleshy masses, or spotting on and off, thyroid abnormality and prolactin problem indirectly. You will develop an extra pad of fat around the mid segment of the body, especially the waist, thighs and breast, no fat beyond elbows and knees, excessive body hair growth, hair fall , dark shade over lower half of the face, acne ,oily face, darkening of the skin over the back of the neck, inner thighs and undersurface of the breast. PCOD will not allow ovulation to occur on schedule and hence, you cannot get pregnant, until you are treated. It also increases your chances of early pregnancy abortions. But this has a solution, namely weight reduction. Your weight has to be weight (in kg) = height (in cm) - 100. In your case, your target weight is 52 to 55 kg. Once you get your weight to the normal range, you will not need any medication to get your periods or to get pregnant, and your pregnancy will be healthy. To reduce weight, I suggest the following: Bloating is due to the side effect of the hormonal imbalance. It will get rectified automatically. Now, to control bleeding and have everything corrected, this is what we can do: Hope I have clarified your query. Do write back. All the best.

But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

For about a month, my tonsil (left side) has looked enlarged and irregular. If I press on it I will sometimes see a little pus (or white fluid) coming out from behind it. It occasionally feels just a tiny bit scratchy. I did see our urgent care and they prescribed Amoxicillin. Finishing the script (875 mg for 10 days) did not rectify. I have an in-person ENT appointment within two weeks. However, with everything going on, I am nervous that I would not get in. I would also just love some reassurance if this is not wildly abnormal.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the pictures. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Tonsillar surfaces are irregular normally due to the presence of crypts. The tonsil does not appear to be grossly enlarged, however, a better picture showing both tonsils would be of help. Pus discharge from tonsils can happen in both acute and chronic tonsillitis. However, in acute, there will be fever, sore throat, dysphagia, etc., and in chronic, there will be vague irritation in the throat, recurrent sore throat, and bad breath, or halitosis. In either case, since it is exuding pus you need a systemic antibiotic as you have already taken. You also need topical antiseptics like Chlorhexidine or Betadine gargles, plenty of fluids and analgesics for pain."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 26 year old cousin is suffering from viral hepatitis since the last two years.

I am 18 years old and the foreskin still does not go back. Please suggest some solutions for the above problem.","Doctor":"Hi. The most common cause of the condition is poor genital hygiene. You see a lot of dead cells and bacteria get collected in the space between the head of the penis and foreskin, making foul smelling grayish white substances, known as smegma, to come out. If you do not clean it daily by retracting your foreskin, it may lead to chronic infection and inflammation. Such chronic inflammation causes the foreskin to get adhered to the head of the penis. This condition is called phimosis. Try to retract the foreskin while under the shower using mild soap as a lubricant. If it does not get retracted and cause severe pain, then you will have to visit a surgeon to cut of the extra foreskin and expose the glans of the penis. It is a minor procedure and will have an extra benefit of having clean genital.

I can understand your concern. According to your description, the possibilities are hormonal imbalance leading to thickened endometrium and menstrual irregularities. If there is any possibility of pregnancy, please go for a urine pregnancy test once to rule out missed abortion. If the bleeding with passage of possible endometrial tissue persists better to go for dilatation and curettage once. With this, the possible cause your problem can be identified and sometimes curettage by removing abnormal endometriotic tissue may cure the problem and may regularize next menstrual cycles.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density.

The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My platelet count is 210000 and in range but my MPV (mean platelet volume) is 12.8. Is it anything to really worry about?","Doctor":"Hello. You need not to worry about your platelet count and MPV. In your attached report, total WBC (white blood cells) count is borderline low and lymphocyte count is borderline high. So it could be a temporary viral infection. You can repeat your CBC (complete blood count) after a few days to check the count again. Do not worry and repeat CBC after a few days.

I started having sores in my anus. I was prescribed Acyclovir. But, unfortunately, it did not work for me. Four months ago, I had what I believed was ARS with chills, rashes, nausea, and peripheral neuropathy. I then took an HIV fourth generation test which came out negative. However, my symptoms got worse. The sores in my anus did not heal up, and I suddenly developed psoriasis with psoriatic arthritis. I had pain in my joints including fingers, knees, and elbows. My finger nails have also been affected. There was a change in the color of fingernails, and my nails had thickened. More recently, I took a comprehensive STD panel test. It tested for syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, HIV, Hepatitis B and C, and Herpes 1 and 2. The only positive one was HSV 1 and 2. Now, I am so worried. I strongly feel that I am infected with HIV, but the fourth generation tests are not picking up the p24 antigen or antibodies for a reason. My last sexual exposure was seven months ago. What other tests can I do to rule out an HIV infection? Since psoriatic arthritis is an immune disorder, could it delay the production of antibodies, hence giving a false negative HIV result? Has my body not produced enough antibodies yet for the test to pick up an HIV infection? How long does the p24 antigen stay detectable in the body following exposure to HIV infection? What are the reasons behind a false negative HIV result? I tested past the three month window period. I tested at five months and seven months post-exposure. Could I have an immunodeficiency that has not been diagnosed and is not making antibodies show up? If antibodies have not been produced by now, will not the p24 antigen still be in the body? How long does the p24 antigen stay in the body? Is there ever a time of HIV infection where both the p24 antigen and antibodies will be missing or too low for the fourth generation tests to pick up? I have read articles online that says there are a few people who do not produce antibodies to HIV at all and they will always have a negative antibody test. How true is that?

After 25 months of unprotected sex, I went for an HIV test called comb AIDS test, and the result came negative for both HIV-1 and HIV-2. At the same time, I also took a test on HBsAg, HVC, scrub typhus, Widal test, and blood sugar, but all the results were negative. I again retested comb AIDS test after three months, but the result came negative again. Not satisfied, I went for HIV ELISA test, but even this time, the result came negative. But presently, I am suffering from many problems such as, extreme tiredness, ulcers in mouth and tongue, weakness, reddish spots at the back, frequent thirst, frequent urination, pungent smell of urine, occasional itchy and spot eruption in private parts, occasional and pain in ears, itchy and reddish eyes, no energy to talk, easy catching cold, and uncontrollable sneezing. I recently got malaria, and I recovered after medication. Is there any possibility that my immune system was too weak to detect antibody after 25 months of unprotected sex? What is the period fo HIV to become AIDS? Is it possible that I am already into the last stage for which the HIV tests gave a false negative result? Is there any further HIV test, which will give 100 % result about my HIV status? Some people suggest me to go for a CD4 count and PCR RNA. So, do I need to go for those test?

I went to a doctor and was given ear drops and medicines, the ear infection went away but the right ear still felt blocked. I was told to take a tympanogram and they said that I had fluid behind my ear, I was given a medicine for it. After a few days, my left ear started getting blocked too and it started ringing too. My nose also started getting blocked every morning and I had a popping sound in both my ears when I swallow and sometimes it randomly pops. I was told to use Otrivin and have Alaspan AM tablet for five days. The next week the issue was still there and I also started having a cough, I was told to have Alex SF cough syrup for a week, Avamys nasal spray for two weeks two puffs in each nostril morning and night and Relent tablet. After two weeks the cough went away but I still had the issue with my ears but my ears started feeling less blocked, I did another tympanogram and they said I still had fluid behind my eardrums, I was told to continue the Avamys nasal spray and the Relent tablet and was also given Predmet 8 mg tablet for five days. A month passed and my ears still had the popping sound when I swallow and randomly. I went to the doctor again and took another tympanogram and he said the fluid is almost completely gone and I should continue the Avamys nasal spray and Relent tablet. I also had a pure tone audiometry test which he said was normal. I have been using the Avamys nasal spray and Relent tablet for the past two months throughout and I was told I did not have to take the Relent tablets anymore and the fluid was completely gone. I still had popping/clicking sounds when I swallow and my ears still feel a bit blocked so I was told to keep using the Avamys nasal spray. At the end of last month I could not get the Avamys nasal spray so I was told to use Fluticone-FT instead. I have been using it ever since. And I was also told to do the Valsalva maneuver 10 times every morning and night which I have been doing. My right ear pop with no issues but my left ear usually does not pop and it has only popped three times last month. I found something online called the eustachi that says it helps with popping ears, is it safe to use? I still have popping/crackling in my ear when I swallow. I feel like the ringing sound has reduced but I am not sure. I have not been able to go to the hospital because of the Coronavirus warnings and would like to ask what exactly is wrong with me and how long will it take to heal. It is already been three months, should I keep using the nasal spray?","Doctor":"Hello. The whole problem is due to malfunction of eustachian tubes. We call it eustachian tube catarrh. Initially, it was an infection that resulted in blocked tubes causing fluid accumulation inside the ear. Otitis media with effusion. Subsequently, the fluid has gradually drained but the tube is still not functioning to its fullest. You seem to have undergone a decent treatment. You have taken decongestant drops, antihistaminics, antibiotics, steroid tablets and sprays. You have also religiously tried Valsalva maneuver. Now what you need to understand is, when the tube gets blocked it takes some time for it to become fully functional. You need to continue the steroid nasal sprays. If you are using Fluticone FT then that is good. It is better than Avamys. Do you know how you should use the spray and what it is meant for? You also should note if you have any nasal allergies, any nose block, sneeze or runny nose. Even if not you are supposed to avoid all allergens. You should wear a mask. Avoid smoke, dust, pollution, pollens, molds, etc. You should be very careful. You may continue Valsalva for another month. You need an antihistamine medicine for another two to three weeks till your problems get resolved completely. Drink plenty of warm water and fluids. Keep yourself well hydrated.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

But, I wish to get rid of tablet support and live natural way. I consulted urologist today and he prescribed me Nano-Leo capsules and Modula 5 mg for 10 days. I wish to have your second opinion on this.

They developed suddenly and became quite large over three months. I additionally have lost 35% body weight in a year. I feel incredibly fatigued, unable to eat, developed an enlarged spleen and even showed a sharp drop in my blood counts. The surgeon, who performed the biopsy, indicated that the pathology report was normal. But, after learning that he caused debilitating damage to my spinal accessory nerve, I would like to get a second opinion of the report. Here is what it says. Diagnosis: Skeletal muscle, fibroconnective and fibroadipose tissue with somewhat effaced, but lymphoid tissue with extensive crush artifact. Note: Impacted foreign material is also identified. The process appears to be reactive in nature; however extensive crush artifact is present thereby limiting interpretation. Please correlate with clinical findings. Was there an antecedent procedure at the site? Gross description - Specimen consists of two irregular fragments of tan tissue measuring 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.5 and 1.0 x 0.4 x 0.3. The largest piece has white sutures attached, which are removed. The specimen is entirely submitted in one cassette. The surgeon assured me two months ago that everything looked great and allowed me to read the report. Can you clarify the terms effaced lymphoid tissue, impacted foreign material and irregular fragments? Also, in what condition they are commonly seen? What process appears to be reactive in nature? Does the gross description indicate two pieces of lymphoid tissue or two complete lymph nodes? I was told that he removed four complete nodes. Should he have submitted all four? The measurements do not indicate which unit of measurement was used, but do the numbers seem normal? Is there any reason for sutures have been attached to the largest piece of tissue? Please explain.","Doctor":"Hi.

I have had very few seizures, maybe one every 4 or 5 years. The last one was four months ago. After I had that one, I recovered and was fine, but about a month ago, I started having what seem like auras. They are different than the auras that I have had in the past. There are two types, from which one was not so severe. I will be working on something or thinking of something, and it seems like my brain just turns off for a second. These are distracting, but not very disturbing. I have several of these during the day, up to 15. The second type is more severe and disturbing. It usually causes me to jump with fright. For a few seconds, I can hear what is being said to me, but I cannot understand the words. Sometimes I can, but I must really focus. Sometimes, I can still speak, but I also have to focus hard. I might have two or three of these each day. Afterward, I have a headache that might last an hour or two, and NSAIDs do not help much. I take Tegretol, 200 mg three times a day. I was also taking Klonopin after the seizure four months ago. This has been going on for a month now with little change. It just started one day, and it has been the same ever since. I did not have any head trauma or seizure activity since the one four months ago. The access to healthcare here is good, but doctors get patients in and out as quickly as possible, so I do not feel like the doctor is going to do anything if I am not in danger. I have already had an MRI and EEG, and everything seems normal. It is just very upsetting because I cannot enjoy my normal life. Every time it happens, my head hurts, and I am scared and nervous that something is wrong. I am continuing to see the doctor, but I do not have much hope that it is going to help.","Doctor":"Hi. I have analyzed the symptoms you described in the query. The appearance and pattern of aura are actually suggestive of the fact that the electrical activity of your brain is out of control. Though it is not a full blown seizure, it is surely an early phase of seizures. I suggest you increase the dose of Tegretol (Carbamazepine) to 200-200-400. It would be best if you can repeat the MRI brain whenever the pattern of seizures changes. There is a possibility that something might have changed in brain structure also. When you go for MRI, please get an MRI brain epilepsy protocol. This protocol studies the medial temporal lobe region of the brain in detail. The way your seizures are; most likely they are coming from the medial temporal lobes. I hope my answer helps you.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I would like to understand the risks to the fetus of being exposed to the herpes zoster virus in the first month of pregnancy, and the risks of the medication (including steroids) that I am on at this stage in pregnancy. Here are the details of the timings and medications.I had my last period on the 26th two months back, and I ovulated on the 13th of last month. 20th of last month, I had Ramsay Hunt Syndrome (inner ear pain and right side facial paralysis), and on 21st, I was diagnosed with Bell's palsy, for which I was prescribed Prednisolone. I took 30 mg, 25 mg, and 20 mg Prednisolone respectively on 22nd, 23rd, and 24th. The symptoms got worse, including outer ear pain and rash, and I was diagnosed with herpes zoster virus, and I was given Vitamin B12 injection. From 24th to 31st, I took Famciclovir (6x250 mg) tablets per day. From 25th to 27th, I took Dexamethasone injections 10 mg (2 ml) per day for three days.From 28th to 31st, I took Prednisolone 30 mg per day. On 29th of last month, pregnancy was confirmed. On the First to fourth of this month, I had Prednisolone 20 mg per day, and 10 mg for the next four days. From 26th of last month, I took daily injections of vitamin B1 and B12, and I used Acyclovir 3 % topical cream on the ear.","Doctor":"Hello. The increased exposure to corticosteroid can cross the placental barrier and cause adrenal suppression in the fetus. This can lead to salt wasting, electrolyte imbalances, and even poor development of the fetus. The organs can also have improper developed and anomalies can be possible. It can also lead to sexual organ development disorders in case of a male fetus. It would be safer to go in for a termination, as it is still in the early months of pregnancy. Also, exposure to herpes zoster can cause scarring of the face, limb, and organ deformities in the fetus.

The pain is especially in the area between the frontal lobe and parietal lobe, probably in the area of the motor strip and sensory strip. The pain is in the form of vibrations of low frequency. The painful vibrations extend through the part mentioned in the brain to the right side of tongue in the path of a straight line. The pain reduces as I press at temples, and I feel relief at the problematic area, and the pain starts again as I remove pressure from the temples. The pain starts if I work, think, listen, or write, and if I keep working during the pain, it increases and compels me to stop working. Loud sounds become unbearable during the pain. Simple relaxation or sleep relieves me from pain. It has become a major obstruction during my studies, and it makes me uncomfortable at times. I had my MRI checked, and it showed no problem.","Doctor":"Hi.

It is mostly at the upper back, at the center and slightly towards the right. At times, it occurs in the middle and lower back, at the sides, behind the right upper arm, and occasionally around the chest and right collarbone. Mostly it is in the upper back at the center and slightly towards the right. The pain is mild and not at all severe or crippling. The feeling is sometimes of little stiffness, and sometimes a throbbing or pounding. I do not feel any trouble in doing my usual chores. I have a habit of examining my body, pressing here and there to feel anything unusual and on one such occasion, I had found a couple of places on my chest which was painful when pressed deeply, but I do not feel anything unusual under the skin. In fact, several months ago, I had found a couple of other places on the sides which were painful when pressed deeply. I have a desk job, though I get up and move around quite regularly. I do not remember having any injury. I have never had any major accident. My queries are, what may be the possible causes and could they be serious? And, is there any chance this has any connection with lungs? I do not have any breathing difficulty and do not feel any pain or anything unusual while deep breathing. In fact, I have a habit of walking, and only a couple of days ago, I had walked 4 km at a stretch without any extra effort or discomfort. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello, I went through your detailed post. The predominant complaint is a mild pain in the upper back and around the arm.

After that, we again got an MRI done last year, which was an MRI of the brain with neck vessels and intracranial circulation.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

The test which I took one year ago showed the PSV after 20 minutes as 38 cm/s, the EDV as 0 and the inner caversonal diameter was .15 mm and after the injection it was .70 mm. After the doctor had seen the reports, he advised me to take Tadalafil 10 mg and to masturbate after taking it. While masturbating, on the third day, I got pain in my penis, and it was in the middle of the shaft of the penis at the thumb point. I visited the doctor again, and he prescribed Polycovit, Mynubin-P, Zanocin 300, Trental 400 mg and I also masturbated four times a week. But still, the pain continued. So, I went through the test again eight months back. The value of PSV was 25 cm/s and EDV was 0, but the inner caversonal diameter changed to .44 mm pre-injection and after. The third time I underwent the test again. The values were normal at 25 cm/s, and EDV at 0, and the inner diameter was .6 mm and after injection at 1.2 mm. I still have the pain in the penis at the same point. It has now been a year since the pain has started. There is no bending during erection, but there is a deformation in the penis like an hourglass shape and hard flaccid. Now, I masturbate only once a week. Is the 25 cm/s good or does it mean an arterial insufficiency? Does Peyronie's disease obstruct the blood flow in the penile doppler? I have no diabetes, no cholesterol, and I am not a smoker. I want to know why the flow is less.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. If we consider the results of the Doppler: So please discuss with your doctor about these drugs.

For skin tags, no creams or tablet will help resolve the issue because a skin tag is an extension of the normal skin. The treatment option would be an excision by a dermatologist under local anesthesia. No down time is required to recover after the session.

If not decreasing then she will require an ultrasound scan for further diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been suffering from anxiety, panic disorder, and perhaps OCD as well (but I have not been diagnosed with that yet) since I was 11. However, I had been completely anxiety-free for about four or five years until three months back, when I got a horrible panic attack that started it all. Technically, I had some weed muffins last year, and I got a panic attack from which it took me over a week to recover, but I was fine again afterward. Anyway, first I was obsessively worried about my physical health, but that has now shifted to mental health. I have also been suffering from derealization on and off. Anyway, just a couple of days I got this horrible intrusive thought like 'what if I got psychotic and heard voices that would tell me to hurt my family or my dog or myself' (note that I love my family, I love my dog, I love myself, and I hate and despise violence of any kind. I have never acted violently in my life) and basically, since then, I have been feeling worse and worse. I read a lot about schizophrenia, mainly real life stories and experience of people, which at first made me go 'okay, now I certainly do not have this,' but as time progressed, I started getting more and more intrusive thoughts. Like 'what if I start being paranoid, what if I start believing that the posters in my room are real people, etc.' Occasionally, I ask myself 'what if these people are not real, what if I am not real?' I have also had a blank mind, pretty much unable to think of anything else, since I got this bad last week. I get this constant picture of myself, confined to the bed and crying somewhere in a white room, all by myself. I have also been feeling this kind of gut-fear since then. On the outside, with other people, I behave normally, much kinder, actually, I think. I am a bit slower and find it a bit harder to concentrate on two things at once, which had never been a problem before, but that could as well be due to anxiety. Anyway, my question is, could this be indicative of actual psychosis or prodromal stage of schizophrenia? Or is it more likely just anxiety and OCD? Thank you very much for your response.","Doctor":"Hi. Remember every problem has a solution you just need to try solving it and help is just a step away.

But after the treatment for enlarged prostate, the irritation has come down. I have enclosed my entire medical records for your opinion. Is surgery required now?

You had episodes of Urinary tract infection (UTI), which was fairly severe with WBC (white blood cell) count of 28,000. The ultrasound shows prostate to be 57 g.

I have reviewed your history and it seems on top of the acute tonsillopharyngitis, you also have GERD (gastric esophageal reflux disease). This may explain the persistent throat discomfort in spite of taking the antibiotic for six days. I recommend you continue your current regimen and finish the course of Pantoprazole as prescribed. For the headache, you may take Ibuprofen as needed on a full stomach. I also recommend that you avoid eating spicy, oily, fatty, dairy foods, and avoid drinking alcoholic, carbonated and caffeinated drinks. If you are a smoker, you should stop smoking and also avoid lying down within one hour after eating. If symptoms persist, worsen, or new onset of symptoms such as difficulty swallowing or voice changes, further consult is advised."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It started back in high school and I would wake up and not remember what was going on in my life, but not just for a few seconds, it would stay like that. I would know the friends I have, but I was not able to remember what was happening to me right now, if I am mad at anybody right now, do I have some guy that I am talking to, etc. When I would check my messages I would see approximately what was going on in my life, but I would still not remember when was the last time I saw some of my friends do I have some special birthday gifts planned for them, do we have a special joke for something at a time. I would just remember they are my friends and maybe like 30% of our time together. It was the same about school and I could not remember what we were doing and what I already studied so I had to do it from the beginning again. The situation got worse when I went to college, and now it is even worse for me because it happens that I wake up and everything that is happening to me feels so distant like it was a few months ago, and not yesterday. Previously, it would usually only happen every couple of months over the night, but for the last three nights, it keeps repeating. I would like to say that I have no problems with drugs, marijuana, etc. I have never used. All of this I already told to my doctor but she did not take me seriously enough. They did take photos of my brain and I do not have injuries. I would also just like to mention that I have very low sugar so do not know if it could be related to my memory, my doctor advised me nothing about that, she only said that she does not know how I am alive with such low sugar, but that it did not matter because I am young.

First of all, a good memory needs a balanced diet, which contains all essential vitamins and minerals such as vitamin B complex, carbohydrates, proteins, and a small amount of fat. Moreover, some drugs like oral contraceptive pills can lead to decrease in vitamin B complex in your body. Stress, pollution, and junk food have a negative impact on memory. The brain needs glucose to work properly, but too much glucose can disturb the memory and the whole brain function. Vitamin B complex deficiency.

The patient should eat healthy food and avoid too much fat, sugar, and salt in her diet."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

About two and a half years ago, I started using Finasteride once a week along with a Ketoconazole shampoo 1 % and Lipogaine, which is similar to Rogaine. I would use this only at night usually using about 2 to 2.5 ml total around my temples and at the vertex. The ingredients in Lipogaine are water, propylene glycol, ethanol, minoxidil 5%, azetinol, saw palmetto, beta-sitosterol, oleic acid, gamma & alpha linolenic acid, apple polyphenol, biotin, niacin, biotinoyl-tripeptide, phosphatidylcholine vitamin B6 and B12. The treatment was working well, and I grew back some hair, but about four months ago, I started experiencing a drastic increase in hair loss. I would wake up in the morning after applying the Lipogaine, and my hair would be extremely dry, brittle and stiff which would cause it to fall out very quickly. Around the same time, I developed a circular rash on my forehead which I received while doing cardio at an unhygienic gym. I went to the gym with no rash and left the gym with a 2 inch rash on my forehead. I went to see a dermatologist who told me it was seborrheic dermatitis but he thought it was weird that it took a circular shape on my forehead. Around the same time, my overall activity level dropped as well. I was much less active although I still go to the gym every day. I would go to bed late around 4 AM and wake up at about 12 to 1 PM. I recently switched to regular Rogaine which has shown an improvement as far as my waking up hair quality is concerned, but now I am experiencing scalp dandruff possibly because I am using it twice a day. I also increased my Finasteride usage to two to three times a week. I am still losing hair, but I do believe it has slowed. My hairline has receded since the start, and I feel that I have been losing hair somewhat evenly everywhere on my head except for my sides. Before I believed it to be a hormonal imbalance like a thyroid issue, but lately I am leaning more towards an immune response brought on by the rash on my forehead and my high quantity of Lipogaine usage, which would cause some scalp irritation, along with my lack of daily activity. Also, even though the doctor did not see it, I have noticed occasional small red bumps on my scalp. After using Rogaine for about three weeks, I decided to try the Lipogaine just for a night and got the same dry and brittle hair response as before. Please help. I would love to keep my hair as long as I can, but it is a losing battle right now.","Doctor":"Hello. From your description, I would say you have a male pattern hair loss also called as androgenetic alopecia. If you are comfortable using Rogaine solution, you can continue with it or consider Minoqilib 5% (Minoxidil) solution 1 ml at bed time over the scalp. If you have seborrheic dermatitis or dandruff then that needs to be controlled with Ketoconazole 2 % shampoo to wash the scalp twice a week. Because, if you apply Minoxidil over the scalp in such a condition, it will lead to more irritation. As you are applying Minoxidil and want to use Finasteride topically consider using a combination instead of separate applications. Also consider procedures like PRP (platelet rich plasma) or hair mesotherapy for better results.

If the diagnosis of PCOS (polycystic ovaries syndrome) is correct, she may require medicines to make her periods regular. PCOS girls are at a risk of obesity, diabetes, hypertension and endometrial hyperplasia. Many of those can be prevented by a good diet, regular exercise, preventing weight gain and taking progesterone tablets to induce a period, if they are irregular even after the age of 20. Regarding diet, there is no specific suggestion, but the consumption of fats and refined sugar should be cut down, and fiber intake increased. The calorie intake should be proportional to the calorie expenditure. In general, if she is following the diet and not gaining weight, it would suffice. Regular sweat-inducing exercise for at least 45 minutes is a must to avoid all the mentioned complications. Exercise is necessary even when she is not overweight. Regarding pregnancy, there is no need to worry, she can conceive easily with medications, if her periods remain irregular despite following the diet restrictions and exercise.

The procedure went fine, but the Coronavirus hit before I was able to get the permanent crown installed as a last-step. My temporary crown is still in and functioning fine, and I was able to acquire my permanent crown before entering quarantine (and thus have it with me). I have heard oral infections can be dangerous, and I am mostly navigating around avoiding danger, but obviously I am going into town to get dental work done is also dangerous nowadays. I would like to understand how much more likely I am to get an infection or some other serious complication if I end up going without a crown for a couple of months (especially given I have had an endodontic treatment of the relevant tooth). I have dental cement, and I am similarly curious whether doing an at-home cementing of the crown would be protective or dangerous?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your query and understand your concern. Firstly, going without a permanent crown but with a temporary crown in place does not gonna cause any serious complications. To make this more clear, I would like to explain the need for a permanent crown after a root canal treatment. Once the tooth is root canal treated and the infected pulp tissues removed, the tooth becomes dehydrated and is more prone to fractures or chip offs and secondary infections if left uncovered. The tooth is ideally shaped and reduced to receive a crown. So going without a crown could actually lead to supra eruption of the opposing tooth. So a root canal tooth has to be covered with some sort of crown to prevent chip offs, secondary infections and supra eruption. Generally, a ceramic or a zirconia crown which can withstand our enormous biting force is installed to protect the underlying tooth. Since the fabrication of such a crown takes time, a temporary or a little less hard crown is installed meanwhile. This can withstand and stay in place for a couple of weeks (depends on the crown and cement material), But if on following certain instructions, you can expect it to come a little extra longer than that. Maybe a couple of months. 1. Avoid biting hard and chewy foods. Hard foods can cause the temporary crown to crack and chewy and sticky foods tend to dislodge the crown. (Fruit seeds, nuts, chewing gum, cheesy foods, burgers, etc.). 2. Brush gently and skip flossing for that tooth. 3. Keep your permanent crown safe. Probably after a couple of months, let us hope the situation gets fine and you can get it fixed safely. Please do follow these and let us expect it to come a little longer. Let this pandemic settle and you can get the permanent crown fixed right away. And it is not advisable to do an at-home permanent crown fixing procedure. Because permanent crowns are strong and are not malleable and adaptable. So if fixed in a very slightly different way could change your bite and cause jaw issues and tooth pain. Sometimes at the doctor's office, the permanent crowns will be adjusted and refinished a little before fixing to bring a proper and stable bite. So fixing at home is not a good idea. And just in case, if this temporary crown decements by accident, do not worry. This is not gonna cause serious trouble in the future. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I have two kids, an 11 year old son and a 6 year old daughter.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Five months back, I was involved in a serious hit and run accident (me being the victim). I sustained numerous injuries, the most prevalent being a traumatic brain injury (SAH). I was released from the hospital after about a month and returned home to continue recovering with my family. After months of recovery and PT for my femur surgery, I am just now beginning to get back on my feet, and I am planning on returning to work as a professor at the end of next month. During my last neurological examination, the CT scan found that my third ventricle has grown from 4 mm to 6 mm. This worries me tremendously since the research I have done online signifies that this may indicate hydrocephalus (attached is the radiologist findings). My question to you is, can my third ventricle enlarging be anything other than hydrocephalus? Is this a common occurrence after a traumatic SAH due to an accident? If it is indeed hydrocephalus, is the only treatment a shunt? Is there a less invasive treatment? I am really scared beyond words, and I am hoping that I do not end up with hydrocephalus. What is the usual timeline for the hydrocephalus to develop after SAH? I will be sure to get a full check-up once I see my neurologist in a few weeks, but I just cannot wait any longer for an answer.

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I consulted a doctor, who asked me to get a circumcision done. So I got the circumcision done. The biopsy result showed that they were viral warts (condyloma acuminatum), and the doctor gave me tablet Valtoval for a month. After going through the internet, I found out that viral warts are caused by HPV, so I stopped taking Valtoval, as it is used for herpes and not HPV. But now, I got a small wart-like lesion on my penis. I feel bad and frustrated, and I do not know what I need to do. Please help me. What do I need to do? I am going to get married next month. I am waiting for your response. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. You are right in saying that genital warts are caused by HPV (human papillomavirus), and even the biopsy of the excised skin confirmed the same. Although there are some reports that Valtoval (Valacyclovir) has some efficacy in HPV, it is largely inconclusive. Having said this, I think you need to opt for Imiquimod or Podophyllin as next mode of treatment. The former enhances your immune system, which helps in fighting from genital warts. In my own practice, I prefer this mode of treatment and find good results. I request you to discuss the use of Imiquimod with your doctor. At the same time, avoid unprotected sex with your potential partner now or in recent future, as it may transmit the disease to your partner. I must assure you that with Imiquimod, there is a good chance of remission of genital warts. I hope this helps you. Feel free to write back if you have more questions. Thanks and regards.

My parents ran a school and naturally, I attended the same. Even though I did not work very hard, I used to top the class. But, when I reached the fifth grade, I got distracted easily and did not study well. When I reached the eighth grade, I decided to study well and score a good percentage. But, I did not succeed. So, I started to mug up all the lessons. After I completed my schooling I somehow managed to get into a professional course. But, I scored below-average marks. That made me sad and depressed. I was advised by many to quit the course but, some of my teachers supported me and encouraged me to study. But, I repeatedly scored poor marks.

Bulky uterus with a cyst in the anterior wall and thickened endometrium is most likely due to a dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Drugs prescribed for epilepsy as well as OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) can cause sedation. If it is not due to the drugs, you can try changing your meal schedule. It is normal for everyone to feel sleepy after a heavy lunch. But, if it hampers your work, you should change your lunch timings. Take a heavy breakfast and skip lunch or take it around 11 AM. Also, take up a daily exercise that activates the reward centers of your brain. This will keep you fresh and awake. For lethargy, you can take multivitamin and multimineral tablets for a month.

I am a singer, and I came down with a very light cold. Due to the weather, I had a light sore throat. During this time, I had to sing and speak loudly with friends, as it was the holidays. While the other symptoms shortly subsided, my throat has been raw ever since and it has left me unable to sing or even speak normally. During my initial medical visit, I was given a week's worth of Amoxicillin, which had no effect. A month or so later, I decided to visit my ENT specialist. He conducted a nasal/sinus and throat exam and noted my deviated nasal septum and \\"turbinate hypertrophy\\" in my nose. As for my throat, he noted no signs of nodules but \\"mild erythema of interarytenoid mucosa around the larynx\\". Basically, he told me to try Prilosec and steroid sprays. Well, I am pretty young, very thin, and have no real history of reflux but I took the Prilosec (Omeprazole) for a few days, I noticed no effect except for constipation. When I stopped the Prilosec, the constipation went away. I then resumed it for an additional two days and the constipation returned, so I quit altogether. The steroid sprays and Claritin did indeed helped clear my nose somewhat, but it had no effect on my throat. Next, in frustration, I returned to my family doctor and this time asked him if a steroid might do the trick. He prescribed 2.5mg of Prednisolone to be taken twice daily for 5 days. It is coming up on day 4 now, and sadly, I cannot say I have noticed any change. I am kind of at a loss for what to do. My family doctor says I probably just irritated my throat, but 3 months in, I am desperate to resume singing and speaking normally. My voice is a quiet, weak thing now and it hurts to carry on conversation for longer than a minute or so. Lower pitches are the most comfortable for me to speak in, anything else and I feel air hitting the back of my throat and a sandpapery feeling that is very uncomfortable. I am really frustrated here.

I have uterine fibroids, so my gynecologist suggested that I take birth control pill, which I do not prefer. I have not missed any periods yet. I have a few normal ones, and then I get very tired, get a headache and then bleed excessively for a long time. This time it has been three weeks so far. The longest time has been three months of bleeding.","Doctor":"Hello. As your gynecologist must have explained that uterine fibroids are benign smooth muscle tumors of the uterus, usually found in childbearing age. Small fibroids usually do not have any symptom and do not require any treatment, but as you have excessive bleeding and other symptoms, you need treatment. After menopause, they usually decrease in size. Fibroids usually do not have any proper cause, but there are some risk factors which may produce fibroids in a lady like obesity, smoking, parity, low thyroid level, low physical activity, excessive consumption of red meat, etc. Fibroids are usually dependent on female hormones estrogen and progesterone, which may contribute to control further bleeding and cramps. Along with contraceptive pills, other symptomatic treatments are given in fibroids like painkillers, Iron supplements, etc. Surgery is required in cases where fibroids keep on increasing, despite all management. But, if you are not willing to take medicines, you can go for ayurvedic management for fibroids which are also very effective if taken properly. First of all, if you are overweight then try to reduce your weight with the help of yoga, exercise, walk, etc. You can take help of a professional trainer to learn some exercises. If you want to practice yoga on your own, then do practice these yoga postures as they will help you a lot in your problem. If you have a thyroid problem, then do take proper medication for it, as it will also help in relieving your problem. Due to excessive bleeding, your body might be iron deficient. So, along with iron supplementation take foods which are rich in iron, like green leafy vegetables, fruits like apple, peach, banana, prune, raisins, etc. Take one glass of warm milk and add a teaspoon of turmeric and coriander powder, mix well and take two times a day. Turmeric is very helpful for fibroid treatment. Include kidney beans and black eyed beans in your daily diet, as they help reduce the estrogen levels. If you eat fish, then you can take once or twice a week, fishes like salmon and tuna have some anti-inflammatory properties and help counter fibroids. Avoid junk food, excessive caffeinated drinks like tea, coffee, cold drinks, and red meat, smoking and alcohol. You can take following ayurvedic medicines which are very effective in uterine fibroids. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking medicines after their consent. Follow all the above dietary and lifestyle changes and take all the medicines regularly and you will soon feel positive results. Consult after one month regarding the results.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

You need to go for nail biopsy for confirmation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I began presenting last fall with some chronic fatigue. The initial blood work showed low iron saturation without anemia. I have attached reports of the same. There were other endocrine-related findings as well. In the course of various endocrine-related treatments and corresponding blood work, I began iron supplementation in the form of ferrous sulfate 143 mg daily. I began this before the blood work was done. So, you can see that that the levels have increased. Subsequent testing, a month later, showed a decline despite continuing treatment. Most recently, you can see that the levels are back up. Note that the ferritin levels began a bit low around 27 ng/mL and had increased to 30 ng/mL. I have received a wide range of conflicting advice about whether low iron levels in the absence of anemia can cause fatigue. I have also received a range of conflicting advice about whether to continue iron supplementation. One doctor told me to continue taking the iron until the ferritin is up around 50 or so. Another said that would be unnecessary and to discontinue it and wait for three months to re-measure the blood work. It is all quite puzzling. Please help me to understand iron's role, if any, in fatigue in the absence of anemia. And help me to then understand the rationale for treatment or lack thereof. And finally, please give me some sense of when iron toxicity emerges in terms of blood work measurements and at what frequency one needs to check the iron levels during any supplementation.","Doctor":"Hello.

I have been off them for almost three weeks and I still feel withdrawal symptoms. The latest side effect, tonight, was red finger tips with white palms. The soles of my feet are also very red. Should I go to the hospital or wait it out? I do not want to lose my hands and feet due to a medication I have been given.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and understand your concern. You received Prednisone for 21 days and have stopped them three weeks ago. Let me explain about steroids. Steroids are tapered slowly if taken for a duration longer than a week. The withdrawal symptoms have a dramatic presentation in the first 48 hours characterized by vomiting, loose motions, low blood pressure and shock. This is a medical emergency with high mortality rate when left untreated. That is the reason why you need to be taken off the steroids slowly. However, new symptoms of withdrawal cannot occur a week after stopping the drug because the hypothalamic-pituitary axis recovers by that time. So, the redness of the soles and fingertips are not withdrawal symptoms and possibly an allergic reaction. I would suggest taking antihistamines for a few days.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have suffered from ill health for many years and cannot remember the last time I felt well. I had a complete hysterectomy at the age of 37, and I was put on 2 mg of HRT Elleste Solo. I have Hashimoto's hypothyroidism and take 150 mg of Thyroxine. I was put on Thyroxine 175 mg, four times a week. I also take 500 mg Metformin tablets, three days. I was also diagnosed with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and I take Creon capsules. My fasting blood results are HbA1C is 56, insulin is 62.5, LH is 24.6, oestradiol is 300, testosterone is 0.9, SHBG is 173, free testosterone is 0.005, TSH is 0.58, T4 total is 178.5, free T4 is 19.62, free T3 is 4.25, reverse T3 is 28.0, reverse T3 ratio is 9.88, anti-thyroid peroxidase is 183.8, anti-thyroglobulin is 882, vitamin D and vitamin B12 all in good range. I have vitamin B12 shots every three months. The symptoms are fatigue, brain fog, forgetfulness, joints and bones aches, and weight gain. I can just lose a few pounds, but it comes back on as soon as I eat normally. My diet is good as I cannot eat fatty foods. Fats go straight through me, even with the Creon. Sugary foods make me feel weird. I do not drink or smoke. At the moment, I struggle to exercise as I get breathless. My legs ache and feel that I am not getting enough oxygen to my legs. I have high cholesterol of 7, which has come down from 10. I do not take tablets as they made me ill. I also have forgetfulness, migraines, and breathlessness. Can you help me? Am I taking too much Thyroxine? Should I take T3? Should I take more Metformin? Am I taking too much HRT? Is the thyroid making me have high cholesterol? I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I am sorry you have had to go through a lot. I really appreciate your writing all your problems in such a detailed way, which makes me easy to understand all your symptoms fully. Most importantly it is high time you stop your hormone replacement therapy. HRT should not be taken for more than five years after menopause. You have your hysterectomy at 37 years age when you entered menopause. HRT is associated with weight gain, which is a problem you are having. HRT is also associated with increased cholesterol levels, which is also one of the problems you are having. It is very important, and I am glad that your vitamin B12 and vitamin D levels are normal. Keep taking the supplements. Now the cause of early menopause at 37 years of age, you have a high risk of osteoporosis, which is low calcium in bones, which can explain your aches and pains. Please get a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan done for bone mineral density at spine, hips, and wrist to rule out osteoporosis. If we diagnose and treat osteoporosis, it can improve your aches and pains. Next, your thyroid is well controlled, as evidenced by a low normal TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone). Hence, we need to reduce your Levothyroxine dose. Currently, you are taking 150 mcg per day. Let us reduce it to 138 mcg per day. Levothyroxine should be taken ideally first thing in the morning in the fasting state, with at least an hour gap between the tablet intake and tea, coffee, and breakfast. If your forget to take some day and remember it only later in the day, do not take at that time, you can take double the dose next day. That is the correct way to ensure pill count 30/30 in a month, and it is perfectly safe. Since your anti-TPO and anti-TG antibody titers are positive (high), you have auto-immune thyroid disease, and you probably have to take thyroid medicines for life. Since we have reduced your thyroid hormone dose, repeat free T4 and TSH levels after six weeks for checking. Other thyroid parameters are not needed. T3 is not safe and should not be used for treatment. Next, your blood glucose is mildly deranged. I would advise you to take 500 mg of Metformin in the morning after breakfast, 500 mg after lunch, and 1 gram of Metformin after dinner. Let us repeat HbA1C after three months. Check your monthly fasting and 2-hour post meal blood glucose value also. I suggest tablet Calcium citrate (1 g) twice daily for good bone health. Avoid Calcium carbonate, as it is linked with gastritis and dyspepsia. Continue Creon as before. Let us review with DEXA report.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I would often get sudden stabbing head pains, numbness in face, painful and sometimes stiff fingers especially, after waking up.

I have already been to multiple doctors about my situation, and they have almost all ruled it out to be a case of anxiety due to the loss of my father, but my symptoms have been getting worse. I fear that I may have another illness that is being overlooked. I saw a rheumatologist three years back, who diagnosed me as having myofascial pain. My results were ANA 31, ENA 19, and ESR 25.

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy.

If the blood sample is taken in fasting, the upper limit is 200 mg/dL. But the value changes with the food taken by you. In your case, there is no need to take the tablets as your LDL (low-density lipoprotein) and HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol are normal.

I have an appointment with the urologist this week, but in the meantime, I am wondering if I should start back on the antibiotics.

The recovery started out pretty well and have been feeling good on and off but in the last two weeks I have been having some neuropathy in random parts of my body. My endocrine surgeon and PCP say that it is just my body leveling out due to the adjustment of normal calcium levels now in my body after abnormal calcium levels I had for three years prior to surgery. However, it makes me nervous and I want to rule out any nerve disorders. All of my blood labs are current and are normal. This includes a full thyroid panel and CBC. I have been recovering from parathyroid surgery and have been having some new symptoms of nerve discomfort the past two weeks, on and off. It ranges from a feeling of a pinched nerve in the right arm and muscle weakness in both legs as well as burning and tingling feeling on random parts of the body, as well as tingling in the bladder and vulva region.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

The twitch seems to be worse at times without any particular reason for it. This night I had difficulty sleeping because it was very annoying. I used to do some resistance training before this (so it might be some type of nerve injury), but I have not experienced any pain or discomfort during exercising before the twitch began. Also, I have stopped training ever since discovering the twitch. I am starting to worry that this might be some type of motor neuron disease, as it is not going away and it is not improving at all.

This is acute onset localized twitches, started after strenuous activity. This seems to be physiological twitches that are occurring due to minor muscle or nerve injury. Just check for any weakness or loss of muscle mass in the region where you are developing twitches, if they are not then no need to worry. Excess consumption of coffee and smoking can cause the same so avoid excessive coffee and smoking if any is there.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I am very sure that within this time frame, my hemoglobin level has never been higher than 10 g/dL. Recently, my hemoglobin was at 7.1 g/dL. I have seen many doctors and have informed them of a family history of a kidney disease, even though my RFT are always within range. All the doctors claim that the reason for my chronic anemia is due to my menstrual period. I do have a heavy menstrual cycle lasting anywhere between five to seven days, but in all honesty, it has never been a cause for concern. I have begun seeing a new hematologist since last year, and according to my lab results, it seems that I have a condition called alpha thalassemia in association with microcytosis. I also learned that I have abnormally shaped RBCs, called as poikilocytosis and the list definitely goes on. I do not want to self-diagnose, but my theory is that there is an underlying issue. When I mention that to the doctors they do not want to think on those lines and try to convince me that it is due to my menstruation. I have a normal month and a heavier month, but it has never been a cause for concern. In looking at my recent blood work, which is not too different from my previous lab results throughout the years, I noticed that my reticulocytes percent is 1.3 %, but my absolute is within the range. I have 2 % saturation, ferritin is at 2 %, iron binding is high at 489 mcg/dL. BUN, and creatinine are fine. Platelets are abnormally high at 716 Thousand/uL. WBCs are all normal.

After surgery, it was in the range of 20-21 mmHg and now it is 32 mmHg. After surgery, my doctor prescribed Timolol maleate drops twice a day. Since last five days, it has been changed to a combination of Brimonidine and Timolol. But, the pressure is still 32 mmHg. I also feel that my eyes are sticky and a bit swollen.

Self-illuminated letters in big size are visible from a distance of 10 to 14 feet. Of course, I have to wear my earlier glasses. My eye was operated for RK before 30 years.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My height is 5 feet and 9 inches, and I weigh 130 lbs. I am a professional dancer. I dislocated my left shoulder while dancing. I had to make a move that involved throwing the arms out and across the body to the right side sharply and quickly. It popped out for about two to three seconds and went right back in. It was sore for the first two days. Initially, I wore a swing and then began moving it gently through a full range of motion. I had slight pain when rotating it outwards with my arm at 90 degrees and lifting up with arm straight out to the side. It has since been 11 days since the injury and the pain has completely subsided. However, I am now experiencing periods of numbness along a line down the center of my shoulder toward my elbow. I am wondering if it might just be a nerve swelling because I went back to activity too soon or if I should be concerned that the shoulder went back in and is compressing a nerve. Or is it something else entirely? Should I give it more time to rest or get to a doctor to have it evaluated? Any opinion or advice would be great.","Doctor":"Hello.

The same would have caused you pain and loss of voice temporarily. The doctor would have tested laryngitis. Now you are possibly suffering from mild inflammation and edema of the region due to the said trauma. The same makes you feel that there is a lump in the throat. You need some supportive treatment for another few weeks. I would suggest you take a proton-pump inhibitors medicine like Rabeprazole 20 mg or Pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily in empty stomach for 15 days. You also would have to take anti-inflammatory medicines like Trypsin-Chymotrypsin Rutopside combination in an empty stomach twice daily for a week and then once daily for next week.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Her hemoglobin is 10.5 to 11.0 g/dL. She is currently on the following medicines, Eltroxin 50 mcg, Olmezest 20 mg, Gemcal D3, Uprise XT, and Folvite. Six months back, one day after breakfast, she had reported an incident of reeling of head and darkness in eyes, which got normalized after she laid down on the bed. She also had a fever (100 to 101 F) with cold and cough that time, which took 3 to 4 days to settle down with antibiotics. One day after lunch, she again reported reeling of head and darkness in eyes, after which she got bent towards left side with her left-hand palm shaking for 15 to 20 second. And she was almost about to fall, which was stopped by us. She seemed to be in a subconscious state for 3 to 4 minutes, and she stared at something during that time. When we attempted to talk to her, initially she could make out only some sounds, followed by normal words, but in a strange voice, which got normal the next moment. However, coming back to sense, she was worried about the ongoing health issues of her son, and she had no memory of the incident at all. She was back to normal activities in next 10 minutes, and she did not report any arm or leg pain during that time. She also had a little cold the previous day, for which she took Cetirizine tablets. We consulted a doctor after 5 to 6 such incidents, who mentioned this as a case of sodium and potassium imbalance due to viral infection. He also examined her physically, and he said that her BP is 122/82 mmHg. As there was no history of convulsion, as well, without ordering for any further investigations. However, I would like to summarize a few symptoms as follows, which keep me worried. She reported feeling very tired and sleepy until at least two weeks of the incident. She had quite a few occurrences of constipation followed by gastritis 5 to 6 times of motion along with weight loss in the last 3 to 4 months. After the day of 5 to 6 times of motion, she reported feeling heaviness in legs, difficulty in walking along with a severe headache right from the morning. When we reported this to our doctor, he asked to test her sodium (138.4 mEq/L) and potassium (3.72 mEq/L) levels, which came back normal. Since the last couple of months, she felt a significant increase in her left knee joint pain, which I am not sure if totally because of existing osteoarthritis or not. Since the last couple of months, she felt difficulty in lifting heavy objects, especially, with the left hand and to some extent with right hand too. I have attached her recent routine test reports along with the doctor's prescription. Could you please review the incident along with the reports? Is it a stroke or TIA or something serious?","Doctor":"Hi. Thank you for your question.

If you are wearing this after braces treatment, there are two other types of retainers which you can opt for. 1. Fixed wire retainers.  2. Essix retainers (clear plastic tray like a retainer).  The retainer which you have should have a passive fit after Ortho treatment. If they fit too tightly, that needs to be adjusted to bring it to a passive fit. Please get back to your orthodontist and get it adjusted. If you are uncomfortable with this retainer, you can always opt for a different type. But if you are wearing it for minor tooth alignment issues, it should be a little tight. Again, if uncomfortable, this needs certain adjustments.  And do note, the retainers need to be worn for the maximum duration (as instructed by your orthodontist) for it to become comfortable. Other times, it should be stored in a container with water to prevent it from shrinking. Accidentally, if the retainer is deformed or shrunken a little, this could cause such difficulty in wearing.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The doctor diagnosed them as STD and advised me to get HIV tested, as part of the diagnosis. The blood sample resulted in a reactive result. I approached another lab and got both ELISA and Western blot tests done. There too it resulted in reactive for HIV-1 and non-reactive for HIV-2. The overall result classified as provisionally reactive. The HIV-1 antibodies have all shown up positive. HIV-2 antibodies have resulted in a negative. I am curious to know as to how it can come positive or reactive when I have no such symptoms, and my immunity is quite healthy. I am enclosing the lab reports for your reference. Please help me with the way forward to negate this or confirm this. Kindly note that my partner denies having been infected with the virus, and I have had no other partner till date other than him. I have a good appetite, sleep, and motions. I do not have a cold or flu or fever in the recent past (last two years). I do not have sudden weight gain or loss either. I have irregular periods and minimal menses flow. Usually, my periods get irregular when I have intercourse with my partner. I do get fungal infections at times, for which I apply Candida ointment. Also, my research on the internet read that there is a window under which repeated tests are needed to be done to confirm the presence of HIV, but no doctor till now has advised me any such thing for that matter.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

The surgeon, at the time, has advised me, the procedure will be done through the ear canal to repair the perforated eardrum. Three weeks after the surgery, I returned to my ENT specialist to get it checked, and upon inspection, he told me that the eardrum has repaired well. I was so happy to hear the news.I thought everything went well because when I push in my finger through the ear canal, I can feel it wobbling just like my healthy ear, but before the surgery, there were no vibrations at all. So two months went by and I felt relieved to have a shower without any earplugs. But three months later, my left ear became infected again. However, this time it was not as severe as before when I had a perforated eardrum. Still, it was slowly becoming wet and smelly and there would be a little discharge when sleeping.A year after the surgery, I had a chronic ear infection with smelly discharge just like prior to the surgery. The initial symptoms after getting water in my ears were ear ache then ear discharge. I got worried. So, I made an appointment with a different ENT specialist to treat the ear infection, as well as to get evaluated on why I was getting the middle ear infection when the eardrum was intact.After micro suctioning my left ear, the doctor discovered no hole but told me that the graft looked like a gauze mat, through which water could still seep in, causing me ear infections. I got prescribed antibiotic ear drops for a week, which treated my ear infection. But, I have never heard of this complication before, nor have I come across any medical websites saying that it is a possibility.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I get some pain in my throat while walking, but not always. I had a TMT test which was positive. I did TMT for 6.3 minutes and stopped due to breathlessness. The ECG showed ST depression of 2.5 to 3 mm in inferolateral leads. My father, who is now 80 years old, had some ischemic issues and is on medication for about two decades. My echo was normal with mild LVH. ECG showed ST depression and T-wave inversion first; later the T-wave inversion went away and again came back. Similarly, it showed LVH with strain earlier and now it does not. I suffer from severe sleep apnea (AHI index 62) and oxygen desaturation up to 50% while sleeping. I am unable to use CPAP machine due to discomfort while using. My LDL was 153 and with medicine it is 90 now. My HDL 39, triglycerides 129 and lipoprotein (a) 68. I never had diabetes all these years, but in my last blood test the HbA1c was 6.2 that is prediabetes. My recent blood work also shows changes in MCV (106), MCHC (27.9), RDW-SD (64.4), RDW-CV (16.7) as well as SGOT (38.1) and SGPT (48.6). I have been advised Sorbitrate, Ecosprin AV, Dilzem and Deriphyllin by one cardiologist. He asked me to try out these before taking further tests. Other cardiologist advised an early angiography. Do I need angiography immediately? I would like to avoid invasive procedures. What is the risk of doing angio? What is the risk of avoiding it or postponing it for several months? My ECG showed ischemia earlier, but then it seems to have gone away. Does this indicate that the medicines have cured it? Similarly, earlier I had RBBB and not now. The same with LVH. Is it possible that a block in artery can cause constriction in throat? Could my TMT be false positive? Should I repeat it? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I welcome you and want to assure you do not worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. I feel sorry for the issues you have with your health. But, do not get panic as there is a solution to every health issue you have. I will come to your queries one by one in the order you asked.  1. Yes, you need an angiography immediately as per your medical record suggests (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Please do not get worried about angiography as you will feel only one single prick of the injection of a normal gauge needle which you already have been taken many times in life. The rest of the procedure is painless. You will be conscious, no general anesthesia needed. You will be listening to the doctors and watching your heart's blood vessels on the screen too. So, it will rather be a pleasant procedure.  2. Risks are associated with everything in life, so are with angio. There are no major risks in most cases. But, some minor chances are there for heart attack, injury to the artery of manipulation, irregular heartbeats, stroke, torn artery or a chamber of heart, an allergic reaction to the dye used for angiogram, radiation exposure is also a risk from x-rays used, kidney problems, bleeding and post angiography infection.  3. Postponing the angiography may have no serious problem or may lead to sudden cardiac event that may be fatal and may have serious life-threatening consequences such as heart attack and death before reaching the hospital. I advise you to go for angio and do not postpone it.  4. The change in ECG (electrocardiogram) sometime happens with variation of results but rarely happens to complete cure with medication. Especially, you got LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy) although to a lesser extent now, that may come back and further deteriorate if not dealt with in a timely manner.  5. Constriction in neck and breathlessness or shortness of breath is the major sign of the partial blockage in vessels of heart and that is over there; you or your reports deny it or accept it. You have issues with sleeping too. That is also a major sign of coronary artery disease and the LVH. It may lead to congestive heart failure in near future if not treated timely.  6. When your body needs more oxygen in the time of increased demand due to some activity or emotional imbalance, it leads to the increased heart beats and forceful pumping so as to fulfill the demand. This increased workload on heart muscles demand more blood and oxygen to the heart muscles too. But, there is partial obstruction and heart's own blood supply is not met with leading to decreased cardiac output in that specific time of body's increased need and the symptoms appear like neck and throat constriction and shortness of breath.  7. You have chest pain that is unrelated to exertion. This is more dangerous and serious. Pain on exertion means less coronary artery lumen obstruction. Pain at walking or at rest means there is more obstruction. There is no need to repeat your exercise stress testing. Angiography. If found positive you may need angioplasty then and there in the same procedure. That will be good as in a single procedure all will be handled.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

My height is 5 feet 6 inches, and I weigh 185 lbs. I feel awful. Please tell me what you think may be wrong. Most of my adult life weight was 150 to 155 lbs. A sudden weight gain started five years ago. My weight is now always in the 175 to 185 range. I eat an extremely healthy diet. I do not eat any processed meat, almost no processed food, wheat, sugar or dairy. I eat only whole foods. I cannot control my weight unless I starve. The majority of the weight is concentrated only in the abdomen, breast, neck, and face. I have isolated fat pockets shaped like eggs above the collar bones, and my face is round and red. My upper back has an odd fat hump. My legs and arms are thin, calves too thin, butt too small, and, I look nine months pregnant. I was bulimic from the age of 23 up to 40. I still struggle with eating disorders, but I am not purging as much as I used to. Osteopenia was detected last year. I have lowered energy, generalized fatigue, and muscle weakness from the past two years. My sleep issues have gotten much worse in the past four or five years. I have trouble falling asleep, and sometimes I am awake throughout the night. I have depression, anxiety and get extremely emotional of late. I suffered a nervous breakdown, extreme sensitivity, paranoia, high anxiety, and worry. I rarely, if ever, leave the house. So, I have no friends. Sometimes, I will not even go outside for two or three weeks at a time. My cognitive difficulties have become very noticeable in the past three years or so. I often cannot find words, have trouble with spatial intelligence, have no short term memory, have difficulty with long-term memory as well. I feel lost like I am floating. I have had a high blood pressure for at least five years now, but it was never officially diagnosed. My BP still fluctuates and is not controlled with the daily 20 mg Lisinopril. My legs and feet have been swollen for the past three or four years. My hands and neck too sometimes look swollen and puffy. My feet feel hot and sweaty often. I have high cholesterol levels from five years, but it is currently untreated. My legs, arms, and hands bruise extremely easily. It takes a very long time to heal. The skin on my hands and arms are thin and shiny, The skin of my upper arms, hands, and face, have lots of broken capillaries. My hair once almost fell out completely, about 60 percent of it, all at once. Now my hair is odd, thin and dry. I also notice some increased facial hair in the past year. I have toenail fungus from the previous five years or so. I had three rounds of anti-fungal treatment, but it would not go away. I have acid reflux from the past three or four years. I always have constipation, which has gotten worse over the past five or six years. I have extreme bloating from the past five or six years. It happens anytime I eat, irrespective of what type of food it is. I first encountered kidney stones five years ago and had to undergo surgery the same year and, one again in the subsequent year. I was informed by my urologist that I have many stones. I have passed one since, but do not know how much more I have. About seven years ago, I had some inflammatory eye problem, which I was told was chalazia. I still have trouble with both the eyes. Sometimes, they are painful, and I spend the morning with a blurred watery vision. I was diagnosed with scoliosis as a teenager, for which I underwent a spine reconstruction surgery last year.  I am recovering well, but do not know yet if the bone graft was a complete success. I still experience some pain. I had a rectocele repair surgery twenty years ago. I still have some issues, but I think it is due to chronic constipation. Also, I have recurring hemorrhoid which I also believe is due to chronic constipation. I have been on some form of opioid for the past two years. And, the six months following my surgery, I was on extremely strong medicines. I took Dilaudid for about three months. I had lab tests done ten days prior, and I am concerned about few values. Cortisol - 19.5, ACTH-Mayo - 63 pg/mL , FSH - 6.4 mlU/mL, LH - 2.1 mlU/mL, Progesterone - 0.21 ng/mL, and Estradiol - 21. I have stopped all of my supplements for about two months except collagen and biotin. I did not think it would affect any of my results. Then, I read that biotin can cause false high positives. I do not think this would have impacted my results, as they are all relatively low. Also, as I noted, the cortisol and ACTH is supposed to be tested around 8 AM, but I was not tested until noon.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your history, and commend you for the detailed presentation. You appear to be suffering from Cushing's syndrome.

On the rash, he asked us to apply Flutivate cream at night time. It has been 15 days since the treatment was started. The itching and rashes have gone down, but she is still itching once in a while. Now, she started itching her motion area too. Can you please tell me if there are further tests to be done, or medicines to be changed?","Doctor":"Hello. Please continue the Atarax syrup (Hydroxyzine) only if there is itching. You can repeat HH mite cream (Permethrin) if itching is significant. It has to be applied to the whole body below the neck. Avoid the head, face, neck, anal and vaginal areas. Also, avoid regions where the skin is scratched. Over the scratched regions, you can apply Flutivate (Topical Fluticasone). Clip the nails of the baby, before the application, as the eggs of the scabies mites are generally present in the nails, which might cause a reinfection. Apply at night, and wash properly the next morning. All the family members should undergo the same treatment, even if they do not have symptoms. All the bed sheets and pillow covers and clothes of the family members should be washed separately. Fresh bedsheets or pillow covers should be used the next morning. I suggest you use HH mite soap (Permethrin topical), till complete recovery after this application. Itching may continue even for a week or two after HH mite application. So, if you have already followed the above procedure during your previous application, you can just use soap for now and wait for recovery. If you have not followed the above procedure, you can repeat the application of cream. For more information consult a paediatrician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 30 year old male. My height is 5 feet and 7 inches, and I weigh about 87 kg. For the past 4 to 5 years, I am suffering from indigestion. This got more serious in the recent years. It used to occur three to four times every week, especially after lunch. I sought medical help and went to see a general physician, who ordered for blood tests. It revealed most of the levels to be normal, except for a mild elevation of ALT and AST levels. Then he ordered an ultrasound which showed I have a fatty liver, though I rarely drink alcohol. Also, H. pyroli came out as negative. He asked me to take a healthy diet and avoid alcohol. For indigestion, he prescribed Rabeprazole 20 mg every day, which seemed to help, since I did not get any indigestion anymore.More recently, I developed frequent loose motions. On some days, I pass stools thrice and have excessive gas. Over this period, I had four to five blood tests, which revealed that my hemoglobin was gradually decreasing. The first blood work done three years ago, showed my Hb to be 152 g/L, then 148, 143 and now in the last month it was 137 g/L. Also, my RBC count dropped from 4.89 to 4.5 million cells. My latest ferritin level was 194 ug/L. I asked my doctor here, and he ordered FOBT test. All three samples showed negative and no blood was found in the stool. Recently, he has ordered for a colonoscopy which I am waiting on, and I am really worried that I might have colon/rectal cancer.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off.

I have shown a WBC of 3.9 for almost two years, and recently had a followup CBC and it showed 3.6. I have felt like I have been fighting off a head cold and particularly stressed with the current virus situation. Do you think this kind of count is of any cancer? Of course, I get on google and got worried about things like leukemia or some sort of illness that could compromise my immune system with the current virus going on. The other levels are below: RBC: 4.5 Neutrophils: 56% Lymphocytes: 31% Monocytes: 11.4% Eosinophils: .3% Basophils: .8% Platelet count: 292.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. First of all, I wish you very safe health during this Covid-19 crisis. Coming to your question, I reviewed your records. And I am glad that you came up with your concerns. I will be happy to answer that based on my experience. One thing which I can say confidently is that you do not have cancer. So good to hear those four words. Yes, that is not the way cancer presents and not specifically at your young age. Your lymphocyte count and neutrophil counts are good and there are no abnormal cells as well. With regard to the current Coronavirus, I agree that we all should be vigilant. Your lymphocyte count and platelet are good and hence blood work-wise you need not worry. But I am sure you must be aware of when to get Covid-19 testing based on the symptoms. Rest assured you do not have cancer, just get lab check yearly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

She got another small boil yesterday, which seems to heal with prescribed medicines and gel. But I want a permanent solution for this boils issue. What can be done? So far, she has got four such boils. All the boils were small, and they healed with medicines. Are such recurrent boils normal for kids her age?","Doctor":"Hi. Repeated skin infection (boil) in a span of four months is a matter of concern. The first possibility is that of an allergic rash due to an allergy to some substance or a mosquito bite getting infected due to repeated scratching. This needs to be treated by anti-allergic medicines. The possible allergen has to be identified. Secondly, it can be due to dry skin condition like eczema (atopic dermatitis), which is prone to infections. This needs to be treated by a pediatric dermatologist. The third possibility is a bacterial infection of the skin, which is responding to antibiotics. The cause of recurrent infection is any low immunity states like anemia, malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies, or other rare reduced immunity conditions. These need blood investigations to identify the cause. It has to be managed by a pediatrician to rule out various causes and a pediatric dermatologist to treat the skin problems.

From the past two weeks, I am feeling muscle pain in hands and knee joints with headache backside. Sometimes while lying down to sleep I am sensing fluttering in my chest left side for which I feel afraid and sit for a while and sleep on the right side. For the past one week I am sensing a lower abdomen pain as well both right and left. Also, I have kidney stones measuring 3 mm and 5 mm in the left and right respectively as per the test I did about six months back and was advised for Noculi suspension in water and which I took for two months. I am afraid as I am away from home. Is this any issue related to my heart and kidneys? Please advise what immediate action I need to take? Is any serious issue?","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, this does not appear serious to me. However, you should get yourself evaluated. This does not appear to be related to kidneys. Your ECG (echocardiogram) is normal and lipid profile shows elevated cholesterol level, which would increase the risk of heart disease in the future. So to reduce it, you should have healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty oily diet. Less of non-vegetarian foods and regular exercises like brisk walking or running according to the capacity. Have less fast and fried food. You should try a healthy lifestyle for eight weeks and repeat lipid profile after that to see for the response. If there is a response then it is fine or else you will need to start medications. Regarding heart fluttering, this may be an extra beat which are usually benign or may be enhanced awareness of normal heartbeats. However, to be sure you should undergo Holter monitoring which is 24 your ECG monitoring, because ECG taken during the symptoms can only reliably rule out cardiac arrhythmia. Alternatively, you may attach mobile based ECG monitors like Kardia device or other devices. Another thing, you should take BP medications regularly as you are not measuring BP all the time and BP may go up during that time, which would damage the internal organs. Also, measure BP frequently. You should also get your Vitamin D and thyroid tested for body aches."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 21 year old female.

I am not able to tell if it is giddiness since I did not fall or have any balance issues. This has been there for a week. I had the same symptoms two weeks back.

I sit for a long time in front of the computer. What would be the reason? I have erratic sleep patterns, and I sleep at 1 AM.

I have been working out regularly for three months, and I have stopped exercising from last two weeks due to foot pain.","Doctor":"Hi. It could be benign positional vertigo, which is more common. I guess you might experience giddiness when you suddenly turn your head. It is mostly because of imbalance in the middle ear fluid, usually following ear infection, which is responsible for maintaining our posture. It is definitely treatable. I suggest taking tablet Cinnarizine 8 mg, twice daily for five days. If not relieved, then consult an ENT specialist for further evaluation.

Due to intermittent chest pain and breathlessness on exertion, CAD was suspected. After positive TMT, I had an angiogram. The angiogram found many minor blocks and no major blocks. The diagnosis was minor coronary atherosclerotic disease and systemic hypertension. The treatment is by medical management. I have been feeling a constriction in my neck (tightness) exactly in the throat region while walking. This happens only while walking and goes away as soon as I stop. I have been advised to consult an orthopaedician to see if the neck constriction while walking can be due to spondylosis. I occasionally have lower back pain and numbness in hand (palm) and also weak hand grip.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I tried to splint it, but it did not work, and it bent down by about 45 degrees, and now the joint is swollen. After getting an X-ray, now that I am home, the specialist said that I could try to splint it religiously for six weeks, to see if it works, with results of a 10-degree bend and a slight bump. He said it has a 50 % chance of working given the time lapse. If it does not work, I will need surgery, where he will clean up the extruded bone, and put something between the joints, and a pin, that will need to be removed. I will wear a splint for six weeks after and need some physiotherapy. The other option is just to have surgery now, and avoid the six-week test.

Before going into the progress of scoliosis, I would like to make you some clarity about the facts on it. 1) The Cobb angle is a measure of the curvature of the spine in degrees. This helps to determine what type of treatment is necessary. A Cobb angle of 10 degrees is regarded as a minimum angulation to define scoliosis. 2) A scoliosis curve of 10 to 15 degrees normally does not require any treatment except for regular check-ups. 3) If the scoliosis curve is 20 to 40 degrees, the orthopedic doctor will prescribe a back brace help to keep the spine from developing more of a curve. 4) More than 45 degrees need correction surgery keeping many pedicle screw and osteotomy to correct the curve. I hope you go for x ray done of your spine and it will be easy to measure properly about the curvature."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,Eight days ago, I had four dental implants placed in the lower jaw.

Your two rounds of CBC (attachment removed to protect patient identity), showing high total WBC (white blood cells) count and high neutrophils. Immature granulocytes are elevated slightly. The inflammation, infection, excess stress, etc like causes might be responsible for that. In the second CBC (complete blood count), count decrease and neutrophils also reduced in number. Hence it does not look like leukemia or blood cancer. Immature granulocyte can be increased slightly in any inflammation. Your count and differential count are not to the level suggestive of leukemia. So it does not seem to be blood cancer as per my opinion.

The nodules found six years back would have manifested into multiple lesions by now if there were cancer and you are right in your thoughts.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

In my mind, I respond as if everyone talking around me is talking to me, so if two people are taking and I can hear, I mentally reply to questions or have a parallel conversation mimicking them in my mind, as they continue to talk outside.

So, I drink two glasses of water maximum a day. I have read a few things online and realized that I have been doing the wrong things as drinking a lot of water will help wash the bacteria out. As of today, I am going to drink two liters of water a day and incorporate that into my lifestyle. What is it that I am suffering from? I have no pain whatsoever and no burning sensations. I do not have blood or cloudy or smelly pee. Will this ever go away? What can I do? I would really appreciate any help or professional advice. This is really starting to take its toll on my life, and I am beginning to feel really restless and unhappy. Thank you so much.","Doctor":"Hi. This is definitely UTI (urinary tract infection). Sometimes, it becomes long-standing if you ignore it. You need to take antibiotics and plenty of fluids daily as a habit. Gradually, it will go. Do not worry. It is not the problem, which is not curable. To relieve your symptoms early, you can take some alkalizer.

I could see the bleeding when I clean the area with a tissue, but I do not see any bleeding in the sanitary pad. Yesterday I got an ultrasound, and it showed pregnancy sac and a fetus with heartbeats. The doctor said the fetus is smaller than the actual size. From today morning, I am again having slight bleeding. My doctor is not suggesting any medicine to stop this bleeding.

I suspect it was due to a dairy product that I ate a day earlier. A few hours later, I ate some pasta, and everything started over again with diarrhea, vomiting, and the rotten egg burps. The next day, I started getting hiccups. I went to see a doctor who prescribed Imodium for diarrhea. I have not had loose stools since. He prescribed Motilium for the vomiting which did not work though. I can barely keep anything down even with the medicine. I spent two days drinking only water. To this day I am still getting these hiccups, and I must say it is discomforting. Yesterday, I started having very little of clear broth soup which I am managing to keep down. I do not feel hungry, but I just want to eat. I do not feel nausea, just real discomfort when the hiccups come by, which is almost every hour. It is even disrupting my sleep. I should mention that I lost around 6 kg since the first episode. I also feel a lot of heartburn during the hiccups. The doctor ordered that I get my blood tested, along with an ultrasound. I am attaching both the reports here. I need a second opinion on what is going on, how long it might last, and what treatments I should be taking.","Doctor":"Hello.

I was given antihistamines and a seven-day course of steroids (Prednisolone 40 mg). The allergy seems to subside, but it keeps coming back. I cannot be sure about the cause of this allergy. The surrounding skin around my eyes is itchy and red, from today morning. I have attached a photo of the initial flare-up. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the attached photo (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This is called as acute urticaria with angioedema. It is basically an allergic reaction, which can be due to change in diet or new medications or idiopathic (sometimes the cause cannot be known). Since there is swelling on the lips and eyes, you should visit an emergency room. You will need another course of oral steroid or injectable dose. Continue with the oral antihistamines. And oral steroid should be tapered from 40 mg to lower doses and then stopped. If stopped suddenly at 40 mg, then there can be chances of recurrence. Self-medication is not advised in this condition. Look out for symptoms like difficulty in swallowing or breathing. If they develop, visit a doctor as soon as possible. Do not wait.

I went to a walk-in clinic, they did an EKG, and everything was fine. They asked me to follow-up with a physician. The nurse conducted a complete blood test and a chest x-ray, and everything came out to be normal. She still recommended me to see a cardiologist for my heart palpitations. I saw the cardiologist, and he did an ultrasound of the heart. He put a Holter monitor on me for a day. All the results came back normal, but I was still having these issues. I feel shortness of breath, chest tightness, and a heavy, dizzy feeling on the back of my head intermittently throughout the day. The heaviness is more pronounced after having meals. Because I felt a bit of reflux too, I went to a gastroenterologist, who confirmed I have acid reflux, and the doctor put me on Omeprazole twice a day. For the shortness of breath issue, I saw a pulmonologist, who said I have asthma after they performed a PFT. He gave me Corticosteroids to use twice daily, and short-acting beta-agonist in the case of an asthma attack. I have been using the Corticosteroids since four days, but I do not feel my condition getting any better. The shortness of breath comes and goes intermittently, and becomes pretty pronounced when I climb a small flight of stairs, or even when I just walk for some time. I researched more about causes of these symptoms on the internet, and I found a few serious diseases like pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis, which have very similar symptoms to what I am experiencing. Note that till date, I have never had a proper asthma attack. This coupled with the fact that it has been four days, and I do not feel like the Corticosteroids are helping as yet. I am a bit anxious if I have other serious issues like pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary fibrosis. Are the symptoms that I am experiencing typical of an asthma patient? Also, considering I have done a chest x-ray, a heart ultrasound and put on a Holter for a day, is it still possible that the serious diseases would have gone undetected? Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello.

I have a long time pain from sound intake and it has worsened into my face. Other sensory triggers the pain. It has become just way too much to handle. I sought advice from friends and groups and nurses, that have trigeminal neuralgia and they suggest Carbamazepine. I learned it lowers Lamictal. I contacted pharmacy that said many will test blood serum of Lamictal and then add Carbamazepine and adjust Lamictal to therapeutic levels. My doctor is a bit concerned. She is not a pain doctor or neurologist. I am waiting to see one. But my condition makes it hard to travel in a car. My doctor asked I seek advice. Do you agree that checking the serum and adjusting is fine to do, in order to take Carbamazepine? The second option is Oxcarbazepine. In your experience is it a good pain drug for TN and does it mess up Lamictal? I found a study that said it did not. I was thinking I could start it now while I wait on Lamictal levels. And see if it helps. Just really struggling. Pain cream not helping much in certain places. My old neurologist wanted me to lower Glutamate as much as I could and suggested Namenda at one point. I know many people are on two and three drugs. I hope to try injections for the pain soon. Do you have any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, we need to be sure if your pain is really Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) as there can be other causes of facial pain like idiopathic facial pain, Post-herpetic neuralgia. Sometimes dental causes of facial pain can mimic TN. Trigeminal neuralgia has sharp, shooting episodes of pain in any distribution of the trigeminal nerve. Pain is mostly along one side of pain and lasts for a few seconds. Pain can be triggered by brushing teeth, cold air, chewing of food. Mostly there is no baseline pain. For TN medications, Carbamazepine is the first line FDA (food and drug administration) approved drug. Second line drugs are Lamotrigine (Lamictal), Baclofen, Oxcarbamazepine, Phenytoin, and Gabapentin. You are already on Lamotrigine which is effective for TN. As add on medication you can do any of the following: 1. Take Carbamazepine and monitor serum levels of Lamotrigine. Both combined will give good relief for TN. 2. You can take Oxcarbamazepine. It does not interact with Lamotrigine. Its effects are like Carbamazepine. I would suggest you to take Oxcarbamazepine to avoid hassles of blood monitoring. I have seen patients getting good relief with Oxcarbamazepine. Remember that these medications take two to three weeks to show results and reach blood equilibrium. Most important is to confirm the diagnosis and then start the treatment. You may require an MRI brain to rule out any vascular loop pressing on Trigeminal nerve. Ultimately for TN, you can go for radiofrequency of affected division of Trigeminal nerve. Surgery is considered if there is a vascular loop. I hope this helps. Avoid exposure of face and ear to cold air. Wrap a scarf around neck and face when exposed to environmental temperature. Avoid your trigger. Practice deep breathing. Sleep for seven to eight hours. Avoid swimming. Avoid smoking and alcohol."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Due to the application of steroid-based products, the clinical picture has been altered. The use of a steroid-based product for a fungal infection aggravates it.

The doctor has prescribed Permethrin cream 5%, Ketoconazole cream, Flutas 150 mg, and Levocetirizine. Are these tablets fine or should I add anything more? What should I do with the furniture and mobile phones? I had protected sexual intercourse 60 days ago, and my HIV result (ELISA test) was negative after 60 days of exposure, and other STDs were also negative. Should I worry about HIV now? What are the probabilities to have HIV and scabies together? My lymphocyte and other blood count numbers were fine. Even if I have HIV, can I spread it to the whole family by skin contact or eating in the utensils used by them? Please explain.","Doctor":"Hi. Permethrin is fine, but Fluconazole and Ketoconazole have no role in scabies. Permethrin has to be applied two times, one week apart and every member of the family should apply it at the same time. Leave the furniture and mobile as it is, as transmission rarely occurs through these. Clothes are the main culprit. Scabies is common in advanced HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). No, touching and sharing will not transmit HIV, and if the sex was protected, then you are not at risk. Regards.

She is getting episodes of dizziness from the last one and a half or two years. Most of the time, they are mild, and they occur for few seconds when she gets up or sits down. Sometimes, they stay long and are associated with nausea and other symptoms. And few months, she does not have any symptoms. She does not have any other complaints like headaches or muscle weakness, and she does not have diabetes or hypertension. But, she gets migraines from the last 15 years, for which, she takes Melzap 0.25 mg. She also takes Vertin 16 mg for insomnia and anxiety.

For more information consult a general medicine physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My 97 year old mother, who is in a nursing home, is more tired and feeling unwell. A blood test has shown she has likely got multiple myeloma. She had left-sided paralysis from a stroke six years ago. She cannot speak, and she is slow in understanding and writing, but she has no dementia. She also has atrial fibrillation from 12 years. Usually, she is alert and enjoys life with what she has. A bone marrow biopsy would be too nasty and cruel for her, so our physician and I have ruled it out. The physician can only offer palliative care, and maybe a blood transfusion if she gets anemic. I have been researching other alternative supplementation to help her. The physician is reluctant to refer her to a hematologist, but I think she should be referred just to get an expert assessment and possibly other tests, even though she cannot have a bone marrow biopsy. Could more be done to help with diagnosis and determining what stage of cancer she is at, or if she has MGUS or smoldering multiple myeloma through a hematologist referral? What do you think? Do you have a particular view about the blood results? Are there any more interpretations to be had? Weirdly, the physician also says you have to do bone marrow biopsy to refer her to the hematologist. But my understanding is the physician refers to the hematologist, who then orders bone marrow biopsy, right? I think they are just fobbing me off because she is old. Her blood report shows, total serum protein is 83, serum albumin is 27, serum globulin is 56,\\tIgA is 1.12,\\tIgM is 0.56, serum protein electrophoresis discrete band in gamma region, serum immunofixation monoclonal band of IgG lambda paraprotein band is 26.1, serum TSH level is 1.46, serum free T4 level 12.9, serum ferritin is\\t30, basophil count is 0.02, eosinophil count is 0, monocyte count is 0.4, lymphocyte count is 4.46, and neutrophil count is 2.71.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

On the 15th day, she was on top, and I ejaculated. Later we took a bath, and after 20 to 22 hours, she took an I-pill. We later had protected intercourse, before and after this unprotected act too. Her periods was due within the next seven days, but she missed it. We are extremely worried. Can she be pregnant? She had not experienced any spotting or mild bleeding as of now, but she has back pain. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Usually, every lady has ovulation around the 12th to the 16th day of the periods. The life of the egg is 24 hours, and that of the sperm is 72 hours. Sex on the fifth day was fine, but it cannot be said about that on the 15th day. The effectiveness of I-pill is maximum if taken within 24 hours of sex. There are two possibilities for no periods now. It could be just the disturbed hormonal balance due to the emergency contraceptive pill. Due to this, the subsequent periods can get delayed. But, she should have had the periods within 7 to 10 days of the pill. She could be pregnant, as the egg would have found the sperms due to the delay of more than 20 to 22 hours. Anyway, have a home urine pregnancy test, with early morning sample urine. If this comes negative, that is, only one line, then have any of the birth control pills like tablet Novelon or Ovral or Duoluton-L or Dear 21 or Intimacy plus 3. I suggest taking one tablet twice a day for 10 days and throw away the 21st pill. No matter what the cause is, except pregnancy, she will get periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. Now if her pregnancy test comes positive, then you will have to visit a gynecologist to take the further decision after a scan, two weeks later. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back.

I have enlarged lymph nodes, with the biggest being behind my jaw just under my ear on the left side. I used a camera to look inside of my ear, and I found a concerning discolored area of the skin inside my left ear canal. It does not look like ear wax, and it does not hurt, but I am concerned that it is melanoma or another harmful growth? I have images of it I will try to attach.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. The area of discoloration does seem to be something like a nevus. Though uncommon nevus can occur in the external auditory canal. Otherwise, your external auditory canal and TM (tympanic membrane) are normal and are not a source of fatigue and lightheadedness. Did you try palpating the lesion? Did you clean ear by syringing? Malignant melanoma in this region is very rare and can be very silent. The best way of making sure that the node below your ear is not due to the lesion is to go for fine needle aspiration cytology. Further, you need to monitor for the growth of the lesion. However, it is most likely to be a benign lesion."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

So, it is important to get your blood pressure checked frequently, about two to three times a day for up to four days, in order to rule out hypertension-induced damage. I suggest you get the following tests done: If the 24-hour urinary protein is increased, then treatment is very different. So, it is important that you get the tests done from a reputable diagnostic center. I suggest you try doing the following: Consult your physician before taking any medications, including ayurvedic. Avoid painkillers like Nimesulide, Diclofenac, Ibuprofen, etc. Ultracet (combination of Tramadol and Acetaminophen) is a safer alternative. Hope this helps.

I noticed that I have some dry skin on my lower lip and a very small scab just underneath it. I ignored the same and thought it is due to winter. Five months back, I had a tender lower lip, which eventually dried off and the old skin peeled off. It left a scab on my lower lip border. I had a fever due to weather change, and as soon as my fever went off, I had a tender, fluid-filled lower lip. It became so tender due to the fluid beneath it and as usual, the scab formed underneath it at the border. But this time, it was bigger than before. Usually, I cannot feel any blisters being formed on my lower lip border because I keep a beard so I cannot notice my chin and it is never painful either. In fact, I never get any blister on my lip, and the lower lip always gets tender.This time, I went to a dermatologist and asked if it is herpes because I started checking my symptoms online. The doctor told me that it is a cold sore, and I was advised to have Acyclovir for seven days. The doctor did not examine it and was just listening to my symptoms. I would also like to tell you that since past five months, my chin area stays red and a bit flaky, and sometimes I feel like there is some wound. The doctor prescribed me antibiotics and fungal creams, but nothing happened.Four days back, I had a stomach infection and had a fever, which went away after two days. But my lower lip border area started itching and then my lower lip was swollen. Later, only the lower lip and its border got soggy and tender this time. And no blisters were formed. This time I visited a senior doctor, and I told him the entire scenario, He asked me to get few test done, like IgM test for herpes, ELISA test, IgG test for herpes, urine test, TLC, etc., when I told him that it is happening for the fourth time. The thing is that all the herpes test came negative. The urine test came back normal, and even TLC and DLC is balanced and normal. All reports were concluded to be normal. He asked me to have Valacyclovir for two days. I would also like to tell you that whenever this thing is going to happen, I get ulcers in my mouth a week or 10 days before this happens. I have always taken pictures of my lip from the first instance to latest, which I am attaching. What is this thing which keeps reoccurring on my lip in every two months? What is the redness (like whiteheads) on my chin, which sometimes dries up like flakes and again returns? Do I have herpes or something else? And this process usually last not more than seven days.","Doctor":"Hi. For more information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am concerned about my reproductive health. Due to poor planning, I ended up taking the next choice (generic Plan B) pill three times within two weeks period. After the third time, I have had mild cramping and spotting every day for two weeks straight now. I am very concerned that I did some permanent damage by taking so much progesterone. I took a pregnancy test, so I know I am not pregnant. I have also been taking my normal birth control (progesterone-only Lyza pill) normally since taking the last dose of Plan B. Any suggestions on what is happening to me?","Doctor":"Hi. Plan B is emergency pills and there are only study about once in a month. There is no study about its effectiveness more than that. And three times in a week is high number. So you cannot say whether it is working or not. And you are taking progesterone-only pills after that. Now, these tablets you can take but have to start after the period. And these bleeding is actually not your period, it is breakthrough bleeding due to high progesterone. Drink more water. Cramps is one of the side effects of progesterone. Stop every medication and wait for your menses. And if you are still bleeding then consult a nearby gynecologist, she has to see the amount of bleeding. Do urine pregnancy test after four to five days. According to the bleeding amount, you may have to take combined pills for a month. Emergency pills can irregularize your period. Do not use this many tablets next time without any consultation. And consult a nearby gynecologist and do have one session about what to use and when to use contraception options available to you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

According to your history ITP (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura), might comes under suspicion. But you are not having ITP, as bone marrow is normal and megakaryocyte not showing any sign of ITP. Check hypersplenism by USG (ultrasound)abdomen investigation. Second, rule out dengue by Ig M dengue testing (ELISA or card test). Check your kidney profile investigation for serum urea, creatinine, etc. Blood infections has to be ruled out like septicemia by blood culture. Your bleeding and all other complaints are because of low platelets. Low platelets with bleeding need transfusion of platelet in form of SDP or random donor platelet.

I do not see any chance of pregnancy. For any lady, ovulation will be around 12-16th day of the period. Life of egg is 24 hours and that of sperm is 72 hours. Since you had sex on day 7 of periods, there is no chance of sperm being alive till date. Ovulation and the egg will not be available on the 7th day of periods. So in total, there is no chance for pregnancy, delay in periods is not due to pregnancy. It can be delayed even if any significant mental or physical stress, any severe anxiety, or depression. As you had sex so early in periods when there was no egg available. With full protection, then there is no chance for pregnancy. Chances of pregnancy are zero. You can wait for periods up to 7-10 days after the expected date, this is normal. If you want to diagnose pregnancy, it can be done with a home urine pregnancy test, earliest one day after the expected date. If doubtful, it can be confirmed with blood serum Beta HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) tests. This can diagnose the smallest of pregnancy anywhere in the body. There is no chance of pregnancy, but if you still think there is a chance then you will have to have MTP pills (Mifepristone) once pregnancy is confirmed.

It is a hormone normally present in the body, which is secreted in the second half of your menstrual cycle. It gradually decreases in concentration due to which you get your menses. This gradual drop is the reason for the breast soreness before the menses. When you take progesterone orally in a higher dose to prevent pregnancy, some females experience the side effects of the tablets. Although your menses were on time, some patients may experience irregular menses for two to three months. Hope this helps.

Early morning, I will get 10 sneezes continuously. If I take cold foods, I will have running nose throughout the day and severe sneezing. Also I have itching and watering of eyes. Currently, I am taking homeopathy treatment. When I have severe sneezing, I use Allegra 125 mg. Please tell a solution to get cured of this.","Doctor":"Hi. My diagnosis of your condition based on the information you have provided is allergic rhinitis. However, to confirm the same I want you to do two investigations namely serum IgE and absolute eosinophil count. Both are blood investigations. Allergy is not curable, however you can control it. You can keep it under wraps so that you are not bothered by the frequently disturbing symptoms. It needs patience and perseverance from your side. Following are some precautions and suggestions to help you deal with this problem. If we know for sure that you are suffering from allergy (positive results in those two tests which I told you) we can institute you on steroid nasal sprays namely Mometasone Furoate (Metaspray) or Fluticasone Propionate (Flomist). These will reduce local inflammation in the nose and prevent allergic symptoms like running nose tremendously. However, they have to be used continuously for a period of one or two months. They are safe and do not produce side effects like systemic steroids. I am unsure regarding homeo medicines whether it will be helpful for this condition or not. You are advised to use your discretion regarding the use of homeo medicines. However ayurveda medicines being entirely natural (as what is claimed by manufacturers and ayurveda pharmacies) can be combined with allopathic medicines without fear of side effects. 1. Dust, dust mite, smoke, pollution, wind, pollen, saw dust, husk, agricultural dust and industrial air. 2. Food allergies like prawns, peanuts, milk and gluten. 1. Serum IgE. 2. Absolute eosinophil count. 3. Total blood count. 1. Allergic rhinitis. 2. Non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome. Allergic rhinitis. When you suffer from allergy (on the day of intense sneezing and running nose) take a tablet of Allegra (Fexofenadine) 120 mg. If the problem appears daily then take Montair Fx (combination of Montelukast sodium and Fexofenadine hydrochloride) for three nights daily.

About five years ago, I began taking moderate to high doses of Magnesium to ease my heart palpitations. This caused my stools to be very loose and easy to pass. I would normally have 2 to 3 bowel movements a day. Beginning last year, I started to experience persistent bloating. Now, I have bloating, nausea, and excessive gas. I have recently stopped taking the Magnesium to see if this helps. But now, I am unable to have consistent bowel movements without Magnesium. I usually have to strain very hard for little amounts of stool. I feel ill and lose my appetite if I eat too much or too little. It feels like the stool is sitting inside me and bubbling. I already include a lot of fiber in my diet, but eating too much fiber also makes it difficult to pass stool. I have got a lot of tests done this year. I was having small amounts of bright red rectal bleeding on the toilet paper. On doing a colonoscopy, the results were normal, but a small hemorrhoid was found. I occasionally still get the same type of rectal bleeding. The abdominal and pelvic CT scan came negative, but large amounts of stool were found in my ascending colon. The pelvic MRI results were also negative, but large amounts of stool were found in my sigmoid colon and cecum. The diagnostic laparoscopy to check for endometriosis came back negative too. Do you think that I may have developed an unintentional laxative dependency from the Magnesium, which may be contributing to my symptoms? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello.

I have been smoking weed for about six months and my quality of life drastically improved. Now, I could sleep at night. I went back to being myself happy. My confidence went up and my social anxiety virtually disappeared. Once, while watching videos on the internet, I came across one talking about reality and how we might be part of some sort of virtual reality. When I started thinking about that, it really freaked me out and I had a panic attack. Then, the mixture of the anxiety and being high made me really entertain the idea of this reality was fake. I was in a constant state of being on the brink of a panic attack for a few days afterwards, even while being completely sober. I am better now, through the day I am fine even thinking back on it makes me kind of laugh. But, when I am alone at night the thought comes back and no matter how hard I try, I cannot take my mind off it. I could not sleep because of the anxiety related symptoms, putting on a podcast and listening to people talk is the only way to calm me down. I hate this and I cannot stop thinking about how I may become this crazy person who truly believes were in some sort of matrix and end up in some asylum rocking back and forth. Should I be worried about this? Am I going crazy? I do not want to develop schizophrenia and lose touch with reality. I have not smoked since the incident and I have gotten better.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

They took a chest x-ray and blood tests and confirmed that it is pneumonia, and my uncle was on O2. He was also suspected for swine flu, and we waited for the reports, but gradually his lungs functioning started diminishing. He showed pO2 levels of 60 in ABG at this time. But the CT scan of the lungs depicted bilateral infection. But, the doctor treating him took it reluctantly and was waiting for the swine flu report. H1N1 was negative, yet his breathing became a major problem. All this happened in two days, on the night of the second day, he was almost closing his eyes with a fever of 101 F and pO2 levels of 54 in ABG. He was shifted to ICU and was put on NIV. The next morning he did not improve, and his pO2 levels were 45. So, we shifted him to a better hospital, who again put him in an isolated ward, suspecting H1N1, but diagnosed it typical pneumonitis. All other parameters of his were normal, but he was put on a ventilator. Here also H1N1 report was negative, but the pulmonologist said that the pictures depict swine flu. The team said that he his struggling in the ventilator too, but since all other vitals are stable they promised us that he would recover slowly. On the ventilator, he showed pO2 levels of 90, but the respiratory element in the monitor showed 25 to 35. He was on the ventilator for seven days, in between they tried weaning, but he could not tolerate. On the eighth day, he was extubated and put on NIV fearing for VAP, he sustained for 24 hours in NIV with great difficulty with diminishing pO2 levels, and the respiratory element in monitor rose to 40. During this 24 hours, he was extremely drowsy, and he did not respond to us. He was restless and breathed with so much of difficulty, but then neurologist concluded that he is psychologically dull. After this tracheostomy was done and he was intubated again. Now it is the third day he is on the stoma. But yet he is in full artificial support now and not breathing naturally. A CT scan was taken yesterday, and I am attaching it. Again the doctors are suspecting swine flu, although the reports are negative. He is on high antibiotics, so the infection did not spread. But the lungs are full of scars, but he does not have a fever. We do not know where to go, please help. He has not been on natural nutrition for nearly three weeks, so he is very tired. His muscles need to be mobilized, and so they thought of keeping him on the chair, but he could not. And today again he is on ventilation.

The doctor has described my headaches as tension-type headaches, I have pain behind the eyes mainly, but it can be on the top of the head and upper neck, the base of the skull. I also had vertigo for two months after the injury. Does vertigo or dizziness give an indication of the severity of the concussion that I suffered? I still require vestibular correction, as the Unterberger test was positive. Can vestibular problems cause headaches? Is there any way of telling if I suffered more than one concussion during the accident? Could that be the reason for my prolonged symptoms? To my knowledge, I did not suffer a loss of consciousness, but I am not entirely sure. Does concussion cause damage to the structures of the head and neck and to the blood vessels supplying the brain, that could be causing the recurrent headaches? Can a C5-C6 bulge cause headaches, because this was revealed in the MRI? The brain CT scan was normal at the time of the injury. What can I do to repair the muscles of the neck if they are causing my headaches? Would physiotherapy help? The brain MRI, four years after the injury, revealed a few scattered foci of high signal intensity in the frontal lobe deep in the white matter. The doctors that I have consulted so far will not definitively say whether or not they are attributable to the injury. One doctor said that these white matter hyperintensities could be caused by the hardening of the arteries. Would this not be unusual for a man, who is 40 years old? The radiologist has described the hyperintensities as a small established lesions. As part of the MRI, I had a gradient echocardiogram which was normal for the investigation of microbleeds. I used to smoke for about two or three years only, and I gave up smoking about fourteen years ago. The severity of this injury and the persistent, debilitating symptoms caused by it, continue to ruin my life and as well as the persistent headaches.

Revert with more information to a neurologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It was described as petechiae when I got back to my native. The infection had got into my blood stream and my white blood cell count was extremely high. It took some time for it to return to normal. I always have problems with reactions to the sun. I used to develop rashes, swellings, severe burns even if only going out for five minutes, also fully covered dizziness and tiredness. However, I am again going on holiday later this month. I would like to know how I can protect myself, so this does not happen again. I have been taking antihistamines for two months now. I noted that sunscreens did not help to prevent this last time. Please give some advice regarding this. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. 1. Confine your summer excursions to early in the morning and late in the evening. 2. Wear clothes that cover exposed areas uniformly. 3. Use sunscreens with SPF 50 particularly that which has Zinc in it. 4. I also suggest vitamin D supplement and antioxidants like carotenoids and polyphenols. Consult your doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. 5. Avoid your tour to high altitudes and snowy areas as snow reflects sun and may cause worse sun burn.

Ever since, I have been worrying all the time about possible HIV infection. I feel little embarrassed writing about all this. Please excuse if you find any content of my note below unwarranted. I will try to describe the experience in as much detail as possible. She appeared hygienic, and had a clean skin all over and seemed to be of good health. We had vaginal intercourse three times on that occasion. Each lasted not more than five minutes. We did it in a single position all three times, that is, the woman on top. I did not ejaculate at all. She neatly put on the condom, which I believe was a latex one, every time. I did not notice how she removed it after each act. However, I did not hear the condom rupture or tear. Even if the condoms had failed, there was no such expression or reaction from her to that effect. I also do not think the condoms had slipped off totally, but it could have slid upwards at times during the act, but I am not sure though. I am uncircumcised by the way, and I have read quite a lot about HIV symptoms, which are similar to the flu. However, I did not have any such symptoms so far, at least nothing noticeable. At some places on the net, I found that 50 % people infected with HIV show symptoms, while at some places they say 80 %. Also, some say symptoms appear within four weeks from exposure, while some say it can appear up to eight weeks also. What are the exact figures for these, please? I have a small penis, 3.5 to maximum 4 inches when erect, and we had intercourse in a single position as I said above. Can it be implied that the risk was very low in such a case? I understand the foreskin retracts during the act exposing its inner surface. Given the size of my penis, did the condom had a higher chance to slide upwards to a vulnerable level? So far I recall, there was no fitting issue. Through which area in the penis does HIV enter? Some say it enters through the glans, some through the opening at the tip, some say through the gap between glans and foreskin, and some say through the foreskin itself. Kindly clarify. Is it easy for HIV to cause infection once it enters through any of the above or does the body’s system resist and kill the virus at times? I have read the chance of one catching HIV is 1 in 263. What does this effectively imply? I know the only way to determine HIV is by doing a test. However, right now I definitely cannot have any such test done due to certain reasons. In the absence of the test, if you could reply with clear and specific answers to the above queries, it will help calm me to a great extent. Thank you so much for your patience and time.","Doctor":"Hi. The answers to your queries are: Hope your queries are answered, but if you have any other question, please do not hesitate to ask.

I did start to panic as I suffer from anxiety, so I cannot tell if the facial numbness was from panic or not. But my left leg two hours later is still feeling heavy and cold. What is going on?

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I have read and understood your problem. You have PCOS (Polycystic ovarian syndrome) so your ovaries might be producing less of estrogen and more of testosterone.

My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it?

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I was hospitalized for SVT, five years back. The medications had it under control for a while, but I got older, a little bit heavier, and had some life changes, so things changed. It was also recommended that I have an echocardiogram, stress test, and Holter monitor. But, I put it off and did it a few months back only. My EF came back 50 to 55 %, my aortic valve was leaky, and I have a murmur. Based on those results, my doctor increased Metoprolol to 100 mg, twice a day. It was going fine for a while, but gradually it crept back up. Last night, I had chest pain and pain in my jaw, so I went to the ER. My troponin level was 2.4. The doctor never called my cardiologist, and he did not increase my medication, and I was going from NRS to SVT to SVPB, with my heart rate going all over the place. I have all my results, so I can show them to my cardiologist tomorrow, while I go to work. Should I be concerned? Was something missed? I was taken aback because I was not given any medication to stop the pain and heart rate, and I am still on the same medication dosage. The same medicine was in my system while all that was happening, and it did not resolve anything.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, I think you should upload your reports like the echocardiogram to know the severity of aortic regurgitation, and electrocardiography to know what kind of SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) it was. It will give a better idea if it is PSVT (paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia) or atrial fibrillation. It appears from your description that you had a repeat episode yesterday, so certainly you should have been added with some more medicine like tablet Diltiazem, to control your heart rate further. Regarding troponin, you did not mention the unit, was it within normal range or out of range. If it is within range, then no need to worry and your chest pain is probably due to high heart rate. Also, ECG would have shown some changes if it is due to heart attack. So you, please upload the ECG. I advise you undergo electrophysiological studies, which will diagnose the exact type of arrhythmia and treat it permanently in most cases. So, at this moment if you still have it and heart rate is still up, then certainly more drug needs to be added. Also, your leaky valve does not seem to be severe as your diastolic BP (blood pressure) is not low. Hope this helps you. Get back with reports for better opinion and if you have any doubts.

Once I got back from deployment, I drank pretty hard with friends. I would say 3 to 8 beers every other night and then 12 to 16 on weekends. I quit drinking cold turkey a month and a few weeks ago, but then I started having weird symptoms. I get panic attacks, my heart would race, and I would get dizzy and light headed. About the same time, I hurt my lower back using an ab roller. Now, my heart still beats faster than it normally does, especially in the mornings when I first get out of the bed. It almost slows back down to normal when my wife and I go on walks though. My back is still hurting as I am waiting for my MRI, but I have been to the ER four times in a month with chest tightness and a racing heart. The last time I went, I was given Morphine, which brought all my vitals back to normal. Am I at risk for alcohol neuropathy or could the racing heart and sometimes shortness of breath be attributed to a potential back injury?","Doctor":"Hello. After quitting alcohol, many patients get alcohol withdrawal symptoms, but that usually develops within a week of quitting alcohol. Chest tightness and racing heart can be because of some cardiac problem like rhythm disturbance or ischemic heart disease, or it can also be due to severe anxiety or panic attack. But it does not seem to be related to the back injury. Chronic alcoholismis a risk factor  for developing heart problem also. For back pain, you can get an MRI of the spine. As you have consumed alcohol for such a long time, there is a possibility that it might have affected your nerves already, which may be subclinical and can be looked for by doing the following tests: If your heart tests come out to be normal, you can meet a psychiatrist for proper de-addiction treatment and also a treatment for your anxiety and panic attacks.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I cannot climb stairs without support and I feel tired most of the day. I cannot stand for long and also cannot run or walk. My legs and feet always get numb.

Please guide me about my disease, prognosis and any rehabilitation that might help.","Doctor":"Hi I have read your question with care and understand your concerns. My opinion is as below: You are having both myopathy and neuropathy. You need to get treatment for both. Hypothyroidism and vitiligo are may be signs of abnormal functioning of the pituitary gland. You have to do a complete pituitary hormone profile along with thyroid profile. Please also do a diabetic profile and lipid profile.

He also smokes 5 to 6 cigarettes per day. We consulted a psychiatrist last week, and he prescribed some medicines. After taking these medications he is feeling drowsy, and he says that his head spins. He is in general discomfort. I have enclosed the prescription of the doctor. The doctor says these side effects are normal. Please answer the following questions. What is the purpose of these three medicines? Should he continue taking them? Are there any other substitutes that you can suggest for these three medicines having the same salt but different manufacturer?","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the attached prescription (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The medicines which are prescribed for your cousin are antidepressants, mood stabilizer, and multivitamins. As you have told that your cousin is feeling depressed, irritable, and anxious, to make a proper diagnosis, I need more details about his symptoms. However, he may be having either plain depression, were getting irritable is a rare presentation and the second diagnosis is bipolar disorder. Coming to the questions that you have asked: You can stop other medicines, but only after consulting your treating psychiatrist. His discomfort seems due to the salt itself, and not because of the manufacturer.

I have a long history of indigestion, mostly experienced as a pressure in the throat. About ten years ago, I had a clear endoscopy, and I took Nexium for six months and cut way back on alcohol drinking, which seemed to do the trick. I had occasional relapses over the recent years, but only after consuming four or more alcoholic drinks at night, which happens once a year. It always clears up a couple of days later. Currently, I consume one to two drinks at a time, twice a month, which causes no problems. About two months ago, I had three drinks a night for three nights in one week, and then I had a few more the following weekend. This caused daily indigestion, which stuck around for more than a week. I self-prescribed a course of Omeprazole and probiotics, but I had to stop around day 10 due to stomach upset. I had gas, bloating, cramps, and gurgling sounds. Things have gotten better over the last 14 days, but sporadic stomach upset persists, mostly after a bowel movement. I do not have gas and bloating anymore, but I have mild cramping. My stool has also firmed up much more than normal in the last week or so, but I am not exactly constipated. I also feel something in the anus, which I assume is hemorrhoid. I do not have pain or itching, but it did bleed once, after a hard bowel movement, several weeks ago. It did not recur even after more than six weeks. Since things were getting better, I planned to ignore it until I had a bowel movement today and noticed what looked like a worm. I have attached a picture of the stool, sorry for the graphic nature.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I also had three surgeries to remove benign lymph nodes. My levels had been pretty steady until the last one and a half year. I am post menopausal. I am now with the highest TSH value of 13.1. I did not even miss any dose. I am eating very healthy and doing work out. My TSH works best for me at 2. Now I am on 112 mcg Synthyroid. My doubts are as follows. Is thyroid cancer any way related to adenoma? Is follicular nodular hyperplasia similar to adenoma? Can FNH's show up in multiple areas of body?

I also have benign tumor and cysts in ovary. The thyroid nodules are reactive and enlarged lymph nodes in neck. My dad had kidney cancer, prostate and melanoma. Now, he is fighting CLL. My son, who is 10, had several 3+ cm lymph nodes in the neck removed. His doctors went on thinking lymphoma due to the size.

He is 82 years old and has been having chronic lymphocytic leukemia for the past seven years. He had no symptoms other than the high blood cell count and was doing regular checkups every six months. Recently, his hemoglobin level dropped a lot (around 3 to 4 g/dL), white blood cell count was very high, he also had a high percentage of antibodies in his blood. I was also told the red cells were being destroyed. He was admitted to the hospital and was given Mabthera, after which he got better and went back home.

There are various reasons for having palpitations followed by dizziness. The most important one being an abnormal heart rate or rhythm which starts suddenly and terminates abruptly. This could be detected by different monitors that you can carry with you and these devices can pick up the abnormal heart beats. Second of all is a thyroid disease. Excessive thyroid hormones can cause stimulation of sympathetic nervous system and you will feel hot, flushed with palpitations. Weight loss and diarrhea along with excessive appetite may also occur. Last but not the least is the most common type and is called as vasovagal phenomena. It happens when you suddenly change position from sitting to standing; your body does not have enough time to compensate and you may feel having racing heart beats followed by dizziness. A panic attack is a diagnosis of exclusion and I would not jump to this conclusion as of now. I believe that you experienced the last type I mentioned above that is vasovagal. If you get another episode then I would suggest seeing a cardiologist. Try cutting down the caffeine intake (including soda and other caffeinated beverages), I request your doctor to check your thyroid profile.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I am on the combined contraceptive pill, but I have taken only two tablets of the active pills. What are my chances of getting pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Unprotected sex definitely has a chance of pregnancy. Even if he did not ejaculate inside you, even the pre-seminal fluid or precum, that is, the clear fluid that comes out of the penis before the semen, which is rich in young healthy sperm, comes in contact with the genitals or the thighs, sperms can swim up into the vagina and reach the egg. So, then there is a chance of pregnancy. If you started taking combined pills two days ago, then there is no hormonal suppression and there is a chance of pregnancy. Mechanism of action of these pills is the same as estrogen and progesterone hormone produced in your body. They are given in high dose, so the body hormones are suppressed, so there will be no ovulation, so no pregnancy. But for such a suppression to occur, you should have been on the pills for at least two months and should have been taking the pills regularly without fail. If during such regular intake with good suppression of hormones, if you have sex during the period of the inactive pill, there is no problem.

My husband got angry hearing that there is something wrong with our child. We are still confused. How can I be sure that he is a normal or an autistic child? He grinds his teeth frequently without any reason, and he gets angry if we try to help him fix things like wearing cloth in an improper way. He bites us as a defense for small reasons, and cries and shows stubbornness. His communication skill is poor, as he talks not in a sentence but word by word. He sometimes looks at my face and responds when I ask him anything, but if he is playing with a toy, he screams and repeatedly asks for. If he wants ice cream and we do not give him, he repeatedly asks and screams. He likes to play with other children and sometimes throws things at them, which hurts them, but he thinks it is part of playing. He understands well and responds properly. His grasping skill is good, and he is very smart. He learns to do things by himself without anyone's help. He is overactive, and he loves watching songs on TV and playing with mobile. Is there anything wrong with him?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. Autistic children exhibit impaired social interaction, impaired language in social contacts, and repetitive behavior patterns. There is a spectrum of disorders ranging from mild to severe symptoms. It may be associated with mental retardation, seizure disorder, and microcephaly. The stereotype behavior starts around three years of age and usually there is impaired social interaction and communication. A definitive diagnosis is made around six years of age. The behavior pattern in your child is slightly towards the hyperactive side. The child should be evaluated by a psychiatrist. IQ levels of the child should be checked. It is very difficult to say that your child has an autistic disorder or not, but the behavior is slightly indicative of autism. So, get your child evaluated at 6 years of age.

I have had four cases of SVT recently, and I am now really worried about these test results.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, low BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and creatinine levels are not a matter of worry. Normal BUN range is from 2.5 to 7.1 mmol/L. Also, ionized calcium is a bit lower but still normal. Anion gap is high, but it has got significance if you have acidosis as well low pH. If you read it on a printed ABG (arterial blood gas) or VBG (venous blood gas) report, then it is inaccurate most of the times. Also, creatinine and BUN report on the printed report are rarely accurate. So, nobody usually pays attention to that. And if the clinical scenario is suspicious, then assays are done and anion gap is calculated manually. Next, regarding SVT (supraventricular tachycardia), it is probably not related to your above reports. It is arrhythmias caused by extra pathways in the heart. They are rarely life threatening but cause symptoms. There are two options as follows. It is better if you can upload ECG showing SVT, so as to know what type of SVT it is.

I took the pregnancy test, but it was negative. I feel it is probably too early to tell. Is it possible to get pregnant, even though I had no period the previous month? Or are these just side effects of taking too many pills?","Doctor":"Hello. I see you have messed up your hormonal balance. Your first step was absolutely right. The principle of emergency contraception is that it is a very high dose of progesterone hormone. This is the same hormone produced in the second half of periods after ovulation. This makes the inner lining of the uterus (endometrium) very thick suddenly, by a single dose. This thickness is unfavorable for the possible pregnancy. So, the embryo that is formed just slips out without a proper place to sit. As it is a single dose, it cannot hold on, and it gives way or falls off, so you will have periods within 7 to 10 days of having pills. This is the same hormone in combination with estrogen in Yaz. If you recollect, in the second half of periods, you have similar symptoms of nausea, vomiting, heavy headedness, bloated feeling, mood swings, depression, and breasts discomfort. As the hormone has been taken in a high dose, that too on two occasions, the symptoms are exaggerated. You have to wait for 7 to 10 days after the intake of emergency pills for the bleeding to occur. You can try taking symptomatic treatment for gastritis, like Pantoprazole and Domperidone combination, twice a day, half an hour before food. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking medicine after their consent. If you have crossed your expected period date by even a day, you can check your urine for pregnancy. Further confirmatory is blood serum beta-hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin).

Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My skin itches all over, especially my face and scalp. A lot of the times, when I speak, I sense a vibration in my eyes or a little bit lower. It is as an inner thread is vibrating. I have the urge to rub my eyes, and when I do, they squeak profusely. I also get the urge to scratch my skin. When I scratch some parts, I feel like I am scratching a thread, extending to other regions (not only the scratched area). This is especially noticeable when I scratch my cheeks.My joints feel a little stiff and oily, and they crackle a lot when they feel like that. My fingers and palms also feel oily. My scalp and forehead feel tight and a little bit numb. My eyes are very sensitive to light, and there is an increase in eye floaters. Halos around lamp posts at night and double vision when I look at vehicle lights at night.I also feel an inner pressure in my nose when I am speaking. When I pronounce sounds like t, s, and z clearly, the pressure amplifies and sometimes my ears click. Thus, this pressure hinders my ability to speak normally. I used to be a presenter of radio shows, and my pronunciation and enunciation skills were top notch, and the fact that I can no longer speak as well because of this pressure concerns me a lot. I also feel like my olfactory sense has diminished a little bit. I have also noticed that I do not breathe as much through my nose.I am fatigued and depressed. I feel like I do not get enough sleep even when I sleep 8 to 9 hours. Sometimes, when I do not sleep enough, there is a dull pain in my ears and eyes.Some things that may or may not be related to what I have written above  are red itchy blotches appear on my skin after I take warm showers, sometimes I feel like my tongue and gums are slightly burning, there is a small internal lump in front of my ear that has not subsided for about seven months, and I have moderate acne.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 2.5 years old. For a week, he is complaining of stomach pain. After farting he is fine. Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

She is short tempered, and I know that as we know each other for long.

I understand you want to help her and which is very genuine. But with a case like this, unless the person wants help we cannot do much about it. First, your wife has to understand that something is odd and she should be willing to get help. Once these two steps are done, then a professional psychologist can take it from there. If she is willing, then you consult a psychologist. If she is not, then the first step is for you to calm down and try to understand her perspective. I am sure you have been doing this for a long time. The idea is that she starts trusting you to show her ways to be calm. Both of you can go for yoga or some meditation. This helps in calming the mind and some form of exercise, to release extra energy.

I am afraid of being under general anesthesia in the presence of neuromuscular blocks. Is there a way to ensure that I am unconscious before administering the neuromuscular block? I have read a horrible story about someone being paralyzed first, before the other drugs took effect and being conscious during intuition. Is a neuromuscular block necessary during this entire surgery or is it only in the beginning for intubation? Is it possible that intraoperative awareness is more common than we realize, because amnesia-inducing drugs erase people's memory of it? Or would anyone with conscious during surgery also have a memory of it? Are any sort of analgesics used in this surgery? Is it true that if I experience awareness I would also be experiencing severe pain? If heart rate and blood pressure are indeed sufficient indicators of awareness, then why have other healthy young people like myself experienced awareness while paralyzed without anyone noticing their stress response and therefore deepening the anesthesia? How was that able to occur and what would prevent it from occurring in my case? I read that some drugs used in anesthesia can block the body's normal stress response, so that heart rate and blood pressure would not increase even in a state of intense pain and anxiety. Would I be receiving any drugs that would produce such an effect, blocking my body's normal stress response and preventing those indicators of awareness? Is it possible to listen to a recording on headphones while in surgery?

I have a history of chronic osteomyelitis of skull bones and mastoiditis. The infection symptoms started approximately three months ago after a hospital stay, mostly bacterial or viral. I got a rash and pimples on the lips, which moved to around the mouth and looked like impetigo. I picked at it and pulled out the heads of the pimples with a tweezer. It created deep pitting sores (will send photos). It did not bleed, but my pores seem to be open. Then it got painful when it settled into my left jaw, chin, left cheek, left ear, and it started breaking through my mastoidectomy scar. I think it was me touching the pimple and then touching my scar, which made it spread. And then it turned into cellulitis on my face; I had what could only be described as fluctuant carbuncles. It was horrible, and I also started to get spots rubbery hard skin where the scab should be. Now I am wondering if this is the parasite trying to wall itself off. Important to note here that I had two negative cultures within the first six weeks. Also important to note that the stuff coming from the wounds was not a typical pus, it was more of a gel-like substance. But because of my history, and because of the presentation of the wounds, I was put on IV antibiotics. I have been on Cefazolin, Rocephin, Invanz, and oral Flagyl and Keflex.

If I use Mometasone, it gives a good result. Is it okay to continue this?","Doctor":"Hello. Acne is a universal issue in the age group of 15 to 25 years due to hormonal changes in adolescents. However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 2.5 years old. For a week, he is complaining of stomach pain.

Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.

The one I have been most worried about was using Cannabis. The Cannabis itself does not worry me too much. Although, we occasionally had access to papers being teens and also not the smartest we inevitably utilized plastic bottles to create make shift bongs or waterfall pipes with aluminum foil bowls. I know that using a flame anywhere near plastic should be considered a cancer risk and I am sure the heated smoke coming into the container released some kind of BPA like chemical. At one time I even used a beer can, which even at 17 that seemed like a bad idea, but I was drunk and who cares about your long term health. Now I am 27 and just graduated. I am at that point where I know I am not invincible. So, have I all but guaranteed myself a cancer diagnosis down the line? I had this risk factor for around two to three years at which point I left to my college. Would this be on par with a couple of decades of smoking or much more worse? Any assistance or information would be greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi. For further doubts consult a medical oncologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Before the vaccinations, I was in good health and optimal fitness level. The Hepatitis B vaccine caused me an unresolved encephalopathy and symptoms of autoimmunity. It caused flu-like symptoms, including malaise, sore throat, diffuse musculoskeletal pain, extreme exhaustion, numbness of both feet, abdominal pain, diffuse myalgias, arthralgias, and fatigue. I also had problems with cognition and concentration. The mild numbness I had in my hands after vaccination has spread, and I developed burning, lancinating pains in my arms and legs. It is painful to even wear shoes. I feel electric shocks in my arms and legs, and heaviness in my arms and legs got worse. I feel as if I have the flu every day, and all my muscles hurt. I am dizzy and light-headed. I have intermittent problems with numbness and tingling in my arms and legs, clumsiness in my right hand, trouble running, painful jerking of my right arm, and a low energy level. Overwhelming exhaustion that rest does not improve. I also have short-term memory loss, difficulty with attention span, low-grade fever, and rapid heart rate. The shoulder pain inhibits my ability to do chores and to groom myself. Afterward, I started to struggle with dressing and lifting my arm. The shoulder pain onset was gradual, and I have body aches, frequent muscle tension, severe muscle weakness, muscle spasms, and soreness across my shoulders. I feel less coordinated, and have pain under my left arm, severe frontal and parietal headaches, and nausea. I feel weak from shoulder to the elbow of my vaccinated arm, sweats, chills, joint aches, and stiffness. There are some unusual pains down the sides of my fingers, and inconsistent tremor of my right hand greater than my left. I also have vertigo, abnormal involuntary movements, memory loss, weakness in my left arm and left leg, and an inability to exercise. I get very ill when I try to exercise. According to my doctor, molecular mimicry is a potential mechanism for these adverse events. In such cases, a vaccine specifically activates cross-reactive T cells or antibodies that initiate a process, which ultimately injures the host’s nerve tissues. My GP said it is to do with 'nerves' and he referred me to a neurologist. The list of investigations that would prove worthwhile is deltoid muscle biopsy, plasma creatine kinase levels, MRI shoulder, EKG, nerve conduction studies, and brain perfusion scan.

Since a year, I have been suffering from very strange symptoms like dark yellow urine (very deep yellow and sometimes turbid and cloudy in appearance), yellowish eyes, very sour taste in the mouth throughout the day, increased heartbeat, and sudden sweating. Before a year, I was having asthma and breathing difficulties for nearly five years, for which I had been taking Asthalin inhaler and sometimes nasal spray. I was passing dark yellow urine throughout the day, in spite of drinking large amounts of water. I visited a general medicine doctor, and she checked my heartbeat and blood pressure, and it was 145/94 mmHg. So, she put me on BP medication, and also prescribed antacid Nexpro for some days. I took antacid and found temporary relief for ten days. After that, she told me to do all body tests. Kidney scan, ECG, x-ray, blood tests, etc., all reports were relatively normal. So, she told to continue my medicine for BP. She said my symptoms could be the side effect of my asthma medication, and she asked me to stop the nasal spray and asthma medicine. So, I stopped the drugs five months back itself. Three months back, the problem of dark urine continued, and I did not visit any doctor, thinking that the problem will slowly go away. The doctor had told me not to worry. However, I am waiting now since three months, and I still suffer the same symptoms. The symptoms are less now, but they are not completely gone. I visited a cardiologist, and he said that it is a metabolic or blood disorder. Most probably hemoglobinuria or hemolytic anemia and told me to meet some other doctor. I went to a diabetologist, he asked me to do liver function test, so I did it. Now the doctor is out of town so I cannot visit him. I do not know which doctor to visit and I am very confused, and my symptoms are not going away. My BP now stays at 130/85 mmHg after taking the BP medication.

It was unilateral headache on the left side of my head. Pain is in my temporal area which sometimes radiates across my cheek and even down my jaw, as well as on the top left of my head. I have occasionally felt discomfort on my chin too, almost like a bruised bone feeling when pressed. The pain subsided with Paracetamol and Ibuprofen, but returned the following evening. Medication no longer had any effect on it. After a week of non-stop pain, I went to my doctor. He could not work out why I was having the pain when I have absolutely no other symptoms. I feel fine other than the pain. He sent me to other hospital for further evaluation. My bloods were taken and came back normal and I passed all of the doctor's strength, reflex and cognitive tests. It was a mystery to him too. He referred me to a specialist who said it was likely a benign tension headache and I was discharged. While the pain is not generally as bad as it was, it is still there every day. I get a few moments of pain every now and then, as well as head pressure. But, some days the pain lasts all day, a dull ache that does not seem to shift. The most annoying part of is that within a minute of my head hitting the pillow at night severe pain suddenly kicks in my left temporal region and back of the head. I could not sleep without taking medication. At home, I have tried three different pillows, yet I still get pain. The only medication I take for it is a combination of Paracetamol and Aspirin. I am currently taking it each night about 30 minutes before bed to ensure the pain will not kick in. If I do not do this I simply cannot sleep. I do not want to be reliant on these pills or take too many, so I am trying to limit myself to just two of each before bed. I still have no other symptoms other than the unilateral pain and pressure. I do not suffer with migraines and do not feel anxious or stressed at the moment. The only anxiety I have recently felt was during hospital visits as my pulse rate went a little high, but returned to normal later. Is it really a tension headache or something else?

The radiologist report says there is an improvement in previously seen dural venous thrombosis, with residual nonocclusive filling defects within the superior sagittal sinus and torcula, and extending into the proximal right transverse sinus. Initially, after having been placed on Warfarin, my headaches pretty much went away. I have, however, woken up in the morning with the occasional bad headache. I was confused as to why this would happen, so I did some reading to find out that headaches could continue for quite some time due to scar tissue. What confuses me about this is that if it is scar tissue, then the scar tissue is always there. In that case, why would the headaches come and go? I spoke to my doctor almost two weeks ago, because Acetaminophen does not help the headaches, and they can sometimes be quite painful.

I would suggest that you do some blood tests to know what is going on. In the meantime, the best treatment is to avoid exposure to any of the causative agents. I suggest the use of some antihistamines such as tablet Loratadine 10 mg and topical Hydrocortisone 1 % cream, once daily for 3 to 5 days, whenever you get these rashes. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. Do go to the nearest ER, if your rashes worsen and you have breathing difficulty. If you are pregnant, then the treatment mentioned above is not recommended. Hope my advice is of some help to you.

The one behind the palatopharyngeal arch is red, and another one on the back of my throat, on each side, which is red in color with little white things on them. What is it? I do not know how long I have had it for. I do not drink or smoke. Is it throat or mouth cancer?","Doctor":"Hi. Here in your case, a step-wise approach should be considered. According to the history provided, you have red swelling on posterior pharynx with white dots over that. Hence, it could be a tonsillar enlargement or posterior pharynx mucosa swelling or a mass. It can be a chronic infection as well. I suggest you get the following investigations done. If needed, your doctor will give you an antibiotic course after examination. Salt water gargle is beneficial in such a case. If the inflammatory swelling is more, then a short-term steroid might be given for five days. If no improvement occurs and if it seems like a mass on examination, then a biopsy should be done and sent for histopathology examination, to rule out the nature of the lesion. Hope your concern is solved. Consult an ENT specialist for examination with keeping all this in mind.

The upper is 100 % fine, which they pulled. The lower they pulled the tooth without removing the root because it was too close to the nerve. I do have some stitching in this area currently on the lower cheek. Noticed a hard lump about 1 inch between my lower jawline and cheek area. Is this normal because of swelling or something else. Currently taking Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 600 mg. Please let me know what this hard lump is, also generally on the lower side where this lump is, remains sore.","Doctor":"Hello. The lump is mostly a hard swelling which forms postsurgical removal of the wisdom tooth or maybe even by swollen lymph nodes due to infection. It takes a week or two for the swelling to subside. Sometimes, if the root is still inside, the infection may be remaining there causing swelling. Get an X-ray done to find out the exact problem and stronger antibiotics like Augmentin (Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid) along with a painkiller for a week.

If I use Mometasone, it gives a good result. Is it okay to continue this?","Doctor":"Hello. Acne is a universal issue in the age group of 15 to 25 years due to hormonal changes in adolescents. However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem. I would advise you to stop Mometasone immediately and kindly upload appropriate images to help us assess your current grade of acne and treat you better. Regards.

Or any other dermoatology cream can I use? My hands are also brown in color and full of tan. Do you suggest any creams to get fair?

If I use anything, then will it have any effect in case of pregnancy, etc? Please help me. Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My son is 2.5 years old. For a week, he is complaining of stomach pain. After farting he is fine. Our family doctor recommended one antibiotic for five days and a medicine to avoid vomiting. He had small vomits twice, but later it was fine. Now, after completing the course of medicine he again complaints the same. His diet is almost nothing and he is not ready to take any food. He just has few mL of milk. He does not have fever. His stool was watery, but it is normal now. Can you provide any recommendation on diet and medicine? Please give me a solution to the problem. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concerns. Complain of abdomen pain with vomiting suggests that your child probably has acute gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Since, antibiotic is already given and now there are no loose stools or vomiting, there is no need to give antibiotic again. For abdomen pain, you can give syrup Cyclopam (Dicyclomine hydrochloride and Paracetamol) 5 mL on SOS basis (as and when required) that is when abdomen pain occurs. Whenever a child becomes sick, there is decrease in his appetite which improves as child recovers. Now, you should give him all the foods that you were giving him earlier. If he is not eating then you can start Glucon-D in water thrice a day for one or two days. Start a multivitamin like syrup Bevon 5 mL once a day for 15 days. Keep patience.
