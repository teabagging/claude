For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

This may occur due to compression of the nerves supplying the right arm leading to the symptoms. You should get cervical spine AP (anteroposterior) or lateral view. Till that time he can have tablet Neurobion Forte (vitamin B1, B6 and B12) once a day which is a nerve vitamin. If this is not helpful then you need to take tablet Pregabalin 75 mg bedtime, which is a nerve stabilizer.

She is 32 years old. I do not have her complete gynecology, obstetrics, medical, previous family and drug history actually but at 32 years of age, the risk is not as much as elderly pregnant ladies at 40 years of age or above. So age-wise low risk as you have described report 1:596 means one in around 600 children will be affected. So least risk. For previous history in her and your family of Down's syndrome you have not mentioned actually but if it was significant (means if you had any relative with Down's syndrome) it should be mentioned them in the report as well. The biochemical risk they have mentioned one in 224 children in her laboratory report (attachment removed to protect patient identity) they made risk value. Normal cut off value for biochemical risk is one in 250 children actually below this doctors just have to describe petient that your risk is one in 224 children. But this risk is not all over for her it is just biochemical results in the laboratory that can have some fluctuations as well in results. All over her age, the previous history is not having any significant risk and biochemical markers also not very abnormal. It is better to have a scan around 13 weeks for nuchal translucency to have a more clear idea as this also need to check for Down syndrome for safe side. It is measurement 2.98 mm or below is normal. At 20 weeks better to have detailed anomaly scan with expertise hands and at 22 weeks better to check hearts and its flow tracts for develping baby via scan. In case of any abnormal symptoms like bleeding, pain or dizziness or palpitation report to the hospital.

Please look at the report and guide us. Also, tell if chances of lymphoma or any cancer.","Doctor":"Hi. Sorry to hear about your brother's symptoms. I have checked the attached reports thoroughly (attachment removed to protect patient identity), the pleural effusion and the enlarged lymph nodes could be due to many causes, although TB is the most likely diagnosis. In order to confirm the diagnosis, we need to take a sample from this effusion and analyze it. Analysing the morning phlegm for TB bacteria is required. In case the diagnosis is confirmed, a combination of antibiotics is required for six months. In case the effusion increased and causes shortness of breath, removal of the fluid by a needle will be required. Lymphoma could be the cause, but less likely.

Three days later I took unwanted 72. 10 days after taking the emergency contraceptive I experienced spotting accompanied with mild stomach pain and sore breast. Could I be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi. If you have had sex on the last day of your period, your chances of getting pregnant are slim. When you say you took unwanted 72 after three days, did you take it within 72 hours of having sex? If you have then it is unlikely you are pregnant. The spotting you had after 10 days could be the withdrawal to the pill. Breast soreness too is because of the pill as it is very high in hormones. It should only be used in emergencies not as a routine contraceptive. Effects can change. It has a failure rate of 0 % to 2 %. So if you do not get your next period in two weeks, do a pregnancy test.

The first thing to promote healing is stool should be soft. For that, he should eat high fiber diet like fruits apple, banana, oranges, green leafy vegetables like spinach, raw cucumber. Avoid smoking, refined food, fatty and oily food. He should have plenty of fluids and regular exercises. Also, syrup like Lactulose 15 to 30 ml bedtime to maintain your stool soft. Second, he should have Nitroglycerin gel two times a day.

Before my wife and I give up and start looking for a sperm donor, I wanted to get a second opinion. Is that truly the final word or is there some next step I could take, however unlikely the odds of success? I eat mostly fruits and vegetables, work out every other day, have no history of trauma to the groin or exposure to extreme environmental toxins.

I would like to know a few more details to answer your query better. Were your serum gonadotropin levels measured during the evaluation? What was the exact procedure performed? The chances of sperms appearing naturally in semen is next to impossible. If just a normal testicular biopsy has been performed, an intra-op microscopic testicular biopsy may give you an additional chance of finding sperms.

Your serum iron level as well low. Hence, it is suggestive towards iron deficiency anemia. For further workup, peripheral smear examination and serum ferritin investigation have to be done. You need to have a prescribed iron tablet that contain good elemental iron like Orofer XT like tablet containing Ferrous Ascorbate with elemental iron 100.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Your child is having a rare entity of non-seminomatous germ cell tumor and common extragonadal site for it is mediastinum. Mild splenomegaly is because of malignancy related process and no worry about that and nothing extra treatment needed. Second, only WBC count is slightly low according to history so it can be because of bone marrow suppression temporarily by malignancy or chemotherapy induced. If clinical improvement present than no need for doing any other investigation. Repeat CBC (complete blood count) after few days and if still, WBC is low then you can consult your oncologist for examination.

I will be happy if you explain this to me.","Doctor":"Hello. There is no harm in marrying a girl with the same blood group as you. Everyone is born with a certain blood type that is either Rh positive or Rh negative. Rh-positive blood is more common than Rh-negative. There is no problem if you marry a partner with the same blood type/grouping as yourself. When looking at a blood type, it is not the letter you should be concerned about, but the Rh factor (the positive or negative sign after your blood type letter, example: O + or O -). A woman is at risk when she has a negative Rh factor (example: O-) and her partner has a positive Rh factor (example: O +). This combination can produce a child who is Rh positive. While the mother's and baby's blood systems are separate there are times when the blood from the baby can enter into the mother's system. This can cause the mother to create antibodies against the Rh factor, thus treating an Rh-positive baby like an intruder in her body. If this happens the mother is said to be sensitized. A sensitized mother's body will make antibodies. These antibodies will then attack an Rh-positive baby's blood, causing it to break down the red blood cells of the baby and anemia will develop. In severe cases, this hemolytic disease can cause illness, brain damage, and even death. If you have more questions feel free to ask.

Just check that her sugars should be in the normal range. Injury is stress for her body, so it could lead to impaired sugars for a while. Keep a proper check on that. Also, wounds take time to heal, a little longer in diabetics. If there is an external wound, take proper care of the wound with regular clean dressings.

I still experience pain somewhat different from diverticulitis and bouts of diarrhea. I was referred to a gastroenterologist. I underwent gastroscopy and colonoscopy after consulting him. I have attached the report for your review. One of the recommendations given by the doctor is to see a Nutritionist, who first put me on the FODMAP diet. This had a small benefit regarding pain reduction. This time, the Nutritionist recommended me to increase fiber in my diet to improve gut motility and function. So, I introduced some oats into my breakfast. After few weeks, I saw Nutritionist, who recommended me to increase more of fiber in my diet and finally advised me to go on with RPAH diet. I am not feeling confident about taking this strict diet. I would really appreciate if you could review my current treatment plan and provide advice or recommendations. I had a very severe pain several nights back and my partner was so worried and called an ambulance. The severe pain finally receded after several loose bowel movements. All of this made me feel depressed.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). They are related to IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) Mixed type. IBS is of three types:1. Diarrhea-predominant.2. Constipation-predominant.3. Mixed variety. IBS is treated as follows: 1. Proton pump inhibitor like Pantoprazole and Rabeprazole, which will help in neutralizing any acid present in the stomach. 2. Avoid fat and pepper in diet and take soft diet. 3. You can take smooth muscle relaxant like Mebeverine SR 200 mg twice daily for stomach pain. 4. A combination of Chlordiazepoxide and Clidinium bromide is also beneficial. 5. Mirtazapine, as you have been taking, also help in controlling symptoms of IBS. 6. If you feel constipated, you can take Syrup Lactulose in the night. I hope this will help you. Revert if you have further queries. For more information consult a medical gastroenterologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had pain in my left chest area may be twenty times in last years. Ongoing to hospitals and doctors ruled out heart problem called costochondritis. What are the very best recommended ways to solve this problem? The last episode lasted some three days ago. Episodes last for hours. I need relief from the upper left chest pain sometimes radiating to face, arm and neck areas.","Doctor":"Hi. Costochondritis originates from the front of chest area where ribs join the breastbone named sternum. It mimics a heart pain. Here, the physician can help in few ways to have a complete recovery. Proper rest and avoiding activities that aggravate the pain are helpful. This pain can last for varying degrees of time and usually relieves on its own. The main focus remains on pain and inflammation relief. Different medications are used for this condition like Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen. If there is no relief from pain, your physician may prescribe you medications containing more potent painkillers like a combination of Hydrocodone and Acetaminophen. It is very helpful for many patients having this pain. Sometimes, your physician may add some more specific medications (like Amitriptyline, Gabapentin) if he feels better. You may talk to your local physician about them. Stretching exercises and other techniques like TENS (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) prove to be helpful for a large number of patients and it can be done for you to get relief from pain.

I want any medication maybe for 1 month for concentration. My doctor gave me Bupropion but it is no good for me.","Doctor":"Hello. From your query, I can understand that you are having difficulties related to poor concentration. There can be different reasons for struggling with poor concentration. More information will be needed to clarify the etiology behind poor concentration so that you can be guided about getting appropriate medication and treatment. How long have you been experiencing concentration difficulties? Was it present when you were a child and did you have problems with studying whilst at school? Or did the concentration problem start in recent months or years? Are you experiencing any other difficulties? Are you sleeping well? Are you eating normally? Are you using any alcohol or recreational drugs? If poor concentration has been a problem since early childhood, you need to be assessed for neurodevelopmental conditions like ADD/ADHD. Following a comprehensive assessment, if you fulfil criteria for ADD/ADHD, stimulant medication can be considered to improve concentration and inattention difficulties. Stressful situations and conditions like depression, anxiety can also cause poor concentration. I see that your doctor has prescribed Bupropion which is a helpful antidepressant medication. Have you been having problems with low mood ? How long have you been taking Bupropion? If it is not effective despite taking for more than 6 weeks, discuss with your doctor about optimising the dose or alternative antidepressant needs to be considered. Also, physical health problems like low iron levels, low thyroid, etc can also cause concentration problems. So this needs to be ruled out as well. So, if you are able to provide further additional information regarding your symptoms we can guide you appropriately."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

You have been diagnosed with hepatitis B around one and a half years ago. Now, you have to repeat HBsAg, ELISA testing to check whether you are HBsAg positive. If still HBsAg is positive, then you can be a carrier of it. Further tests need to be done as follows: According to these reports, further management can be done.

There is no blood discharge and poop was soft. I avoid eating spicy foods. The burning sensation lasts for hours.","Doctor":"Hello. The most common cause of burning sensation in anus following stools will be the consumption of spicy food. Another cause can be constipation, which can cause fissures around the anus. If this is the condition, apply Diltiazem gel 2 % three to four times a day for seven to 10 days and use a stool softener like Cremaffin syrup (milk of Magnesia and liquid Paraffin) two tablespoons once a day for 15 to 20 days. If there is no history, you can apply Lignocaine jelly to your anus for few days. If the problem persists, consult a doctor who could examine your anal region.

Do not get worried about the condition that it is dangerous. But, I need to go through some investigations to complete the diagnosis. We need tympanometry to asses the middle ear and its ossicles.

Now, my ejaculate is in strawberry color. It was nice and white in color before the day and there are no other symptoms.","Doctor":"Hi. It is unlikely for the food or drinks to change the color of your semen directly. The pigments in your urine/urethra can change the color of your semen. The other possibility is blood in the semen, which again without symptoms, is not a cause for concern. I would advise you to wait for a few days. If it is due to drinks, it will disappear. If it persists, I would suggest you visit your local urologist for a clinical examination. Even if it turns out to be blood, it usually subsides within a week or two and it is not a cause for worry.

Whether it is good for dialysis or try to maintain with medicine.","Doctor":"Hi. From what you mentioned, your father has sustained acute kidney failure, the cause is not clear (may be due to bleeding and losing a large amount of blood). Dialysis is required if there is volume overload (lower limb edema and chest congestion), also if there is high potassium. A thorough assessment is required for a more appropriate decision. One or two sessions of dialysis does not mean that he will be on dialysis forever, assessment is required after the sessions.

Next day at 9 AM, I underwent angiogram and noticed RCA 99 % block, kept stent. After six months, I developed ectopics around 20 per minute. The drugs were changed to Bisoprolol, Metoprolol, Sotalol but there was no use. The cardiologist advised for EP study. What next? Do I need a device? I am sending briefly about my cardiac MR study and Holter report.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Most probably, these VPC (ventricular premature contraction) are due to the scar in the RV (right ventricle). As advised by the cardiologists, I would also advise an EP study (electrophysiology studies), which, if positive, that, induces a VT (ventricular tachycardia) which needs an ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) implantation. The second option is ablation of these VPC's. It works better if you have a structurally normal heart, but you have LV (left ventricle) dysfunction. Also, ablation is fine if you have recurrent ICD shocks. So summing up, I would advocate an ICD if VT is induced.

Yes, it will because it does not have the same control as your hand will do. Not till you keep it as controlled as possible but it is a mechanical device. It can make your teeth more mobile if the tooth mobility is more than grade one (that means you have a slightly loose tooth). If your teeth is much mobile it will cause damage.

I read carefully your question and would explain that your symptoms could be related to tension-type headaches or a cervical spine disorder (a bulging disc or a wrong posture). Coming to this point, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician and performing a cervical spine X-ray study, a complete blood count for anemia and PCR for inflammation. If the above test results are normal, tension-type headache remains the main possible cause. In such case, a local muscle relaxant ointment in the neck and painkillers are the main treatment.

I passed carefully through your question and would explain that your symptoms do not seem to be related to any cardiac issues. Considering your age and the fact that you have no cardiovascular risk factors there is nothing to worry about your heart. Your heart rate and blood pressure fluctuations are quite normal during physical activity and do not indicate any serious cardiac condition. Costochondritis or inflammation can be the cause of your complaints. Anxiety may also trigger this clinical situation. I would recommend using painkillers. If the pain persists, I recommend performing a chest X-ray study, a cervical spine X-ray study, complete blood count, PCR (polymerase chain reaction), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) for inflammation.

A year later, my WBC decreased to 4 and since then has continued to decrease but now I have a low granulocyte count of 1.7 which I have not had before. It is now 3.5 from recent CBC. My last draw was a year ago and it was 4.0. I have been as low as 3.6 in the past. I am a highly stressed person since after the birth of my son. I have been in school for my BSN and MSN and I am wondering this could be related to stress. My H+H is within normal limits with only a slight decrease in my HCT of 28.1. At the time of my CBC I was menstruating so I am attributing the low HCT to menstruation. The only symptom I have is fatigue. Otherwise, my PLT, RBC, HGB and other cell line are fine. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Previously I have had anxiety and leukopenia.","Doctor":"Hello. According to the provided history, you are having low WBC count along with normal hemoglobin, platelet, and other values. But your WBC count is not much low and so not much alarming. Viral infection, hepatitis B, HIV, autoimmune disorder like SLE, enteric fever are some causes. According to examination, further workup can be planned according to need. But I need to check your differential WBC count and for that peripheral smear, examination report will be best. So provide your peripheral smear examination report to check it. Take care.

Last two months ago I have pain in my right leg while walking and irritating buds while sitting on the right side. So I went to doctor. He took MRI and says I have disc bulge L4 L5 and it presses the nerve root. The doctor prescribed some anti-inflammation tablet and take physiotherapy for ten days and take rest some days. I finished my physiotherapy and I do exercise twice a day suggest by the physiotherapist. I take rest in bed for one month, but my pain not reduced. I consulted some ortho specialist they said bulge is very small only no need to worry. Now I have some shoulder pain and nerve pain in my right hand. While sleeping I feel numbness in my baby finger and ring finger from the wrist on both hands. I am confused now is it the only disc problem or something nerve problem? I have taken medication for erectile dysfunction for two months ago. The doctor prescribed one month medicine but I took two weeks only later I scared of my leg pain and I stopped medicine.","Doctor":"Hello. The numbness in your small finger is related to a pinched nerve in the elbow, probably related to a wrong position during sleeping. It is not related to the bulging disc in the lumbar vertebral column. I would just recommend performing a nerve conduction study if the numbness persists. In the meantime, I would recommend avoiding pressure on the elbow during sleeping or on the desk.

I went in for my NT scan today and they said it has possible gastroschisis and I am honestly just so worried. I have a checkup in the next two weeks but I am just curious to know if it could be normal that the intestines still are not inside the fetus? Is it too early to diagnose? I am so stressed and worried.","Doctor":"Hi. Normally intestine is outside body of the fetus from 6 to 10 weeks of gestation is known as an intestinal hernia. Around 11 weeks it should be inside the body of the fetus. If you have been irregular periods there could be a discrepancy of dates between the scan and your menstrual periods then you need rescan to check things again.  Gastroschisis and omphalocele two defects if a similar place of a fetal body with some difference. Better to have nuchal translucency check now as it should be done around 13 weeks via scan in fetus having a risk of congenital defects. You might need double marker test to check for any syndrome. So better to have serum beta hCG and serum PAPPA (pappalysin-1) checked. Have nuchal translucency and double marker test now and discuss here or local gynecologist and then repeat scan as per schedule after two weeks.

It is very rough to touch and skin appears dry in that area. It does not cause him itching as far as I can see and it is not bleeding or oozing. It has black dots (like when a wound heals) in some areas. Is it a long lasting skin problem?","Doctor":"Hi. Babies at this age might suffer from seborrheic dermatitis over scalp, face and upper trunk and the most probable cause is maternal androgens hormones. And skin in such cases are dry, flaky, erythematous and somewhat oozing. However, there is nothing to worry about the condition as it will subside by itself within a few weeks to months. Please apply Vaseline two to three times daily or use baby oil. If it does not improve, only then I will advise you to use 1 % hydrocortisone cream otherwise do not use it for the baby at this age as it is a steroid. Avoid antiseptics like dettols or safeguard.

I have gone through an ultrasound to confirm that it is an intrauterine pregnancy. I need to know how I can terminate it through abortion pills and what other precautions I need to take. Also, are there any other antibiotics or pain killers I need to keep handy during the procedure?","Doctor":"Hello. You need to take an MTP kit a medical termination of pregnancy which will be sold only at the prescription of a registered medical practitioner and is no longer available as an OTC (over the counter) drug. It contains two medications namely Mifepristone and Misoprostol. Take one tablet of Mifepristone 200 mg on day 1 and 48 hours later, take the rest of the four tablets of Misoprostol. If there is excess bleeding with giddiness, you need to report to your gynecologist immediately. Please get your blood group checked earlier because if it is Rh negative type, you will have to take an anti-D injection to prevent your blood from getting sensitized. If your husband is also Rh negative, it is not needed. Please consult your gynecologist for the prescription and have a safe abortion. You can take tablet Meftal spas for pain.

I might not be sure but I may have roughly massaged my head or while wearing t-shirts a scab fells off, will this result in failed hair transplant?","Doctor":"Hi. Hair transplant failure or success is evident within four weeks. The follicles which have been implanted into our skin of the scalp would die initially within two weeks or they lead to the growth of the good hair. After that you massage it or do anything it will not have any effect on the hair transplant, because the hair follicle by that time would have established at that place as the original ones. So the effect of rubbing, friction or any disease will be the same whether transplanted or not. So I do not think you need to worry about that. But what you should worry is that there is not any other infection like fungus on this lesion which I can see on your head. If there is anything itch or burning and the lesion is expanding kindly tell me with a clear photograph of the skin of the forehead. Regarding hair transplant, it is successful you need not worry about it. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Then my dermatologist decided to drop my dosage down to 10 mg, three times a week, to try and ease me off the drug. As soon as the dosage dropped my skin started breaking out again, particularly around my mouth and nose. I was devastated and so I went back and am now on 20 mg a day again and have been for just over a month but nothing has changed, in fact, the breakouts have only gotten worse. Now I have patches of skin around my mouth that are red, irritated and dry with small clusters of fluid-filled bumps which I assume are acne. The skin that is irritated stings, and is so dry it feels almost scaly, especially with the scabbing from the pimples or fluid-filled bumps. I am 18 years old, weigh around 60 kg and am now wondering what my next step should be? And wondering why the original Accutane dosage of 20 mg per day has not helped at all this time around.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case in detail. Please do not stop Accutane (Isotretinoin) as it is the normal response of this drug that initially all acne lesions get aggravated during first 4 to 6 weeks of treatment. And dryness and redness are also observed as its result. So if you feel extreme dryness just take a little amount of Vaseline lotion and apply on your palms and gently tap on your face. Do not take too much of any moisturizer because it will again block ur pores and acne will be aggravated. Be patient, acne sometimes takes time to heal, like 3 to 4 months and lesions get aggravated due to stress or hormones.

To start with if you have throat pain with fever and cough or weakness in the body, please consider going to a Coronavirus OPD to get tested. Considering the present times, it is possible.

Apart from dust, there are many other materials that can cause allergic rhinitis also. Patients also may not have itching in the eyes, itching in the nose, eye watering, headache, watery nasal discharge.

Most probably, these are ventricular premature complexes. These are ectopic or extra beats. These are usually benign and not life-threatening. These are frequently associated with MVP (mitral valve prolapse), also caffeine, alcohol, thyroid, gastritis and acidity problems may aggravate these. Since these are not frequent, ECG may be normal.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I think she may have endometriosis. She got her first periods in her fifth grade and the symptoms started when she began her sixth grade. She is having extremely heavy periods with painful cramping, nausea and diarrhea. Also, she has occasional spotting. I have researched it a lot. It gets worse every time and it is getting to the point where she sometimes has pain at all times of the month. What is wrong with her?","Doctor":"Hello. As she is just 13 there are menses which are anovulatory in the initial two years and the hormones are not matured at all. Endometriosis in adolescents is fairly uncommon unless they have been sexually active. An endometriosis pain is typically only during menses and not in mid cycle or throughout the cycle. That is likely due to progesterone or estrogen imbalances. So, if she is bleeding really heavy and the menses and premenstrual symptoms are painful, then you may opt for depot injections to fairly stop her menses and allow natural maturation of hormones. It shall serve as a contraceptive as well. If not, then I suggest her tablet Meftal Spas (Mefenamic acid) twice a day for three days from the start of pain to relieve pain along with hot fomentation to soothe yourself. Hormonal pills as of now are not advised though an ultrasound pelvis can be undertaken to look for any adnexal abnormalities.

I have been doing this for seven years now. Four years ago, my doctor noticed that I had a discoloration on the back of my scalp.

It has become bigger, more pronounced and red all the time. It does not itch ever, but it does stay red and feels rougher than the normal skin to touch. It just looks like a bright red rash that never goes away. It does not turn scaly or white and also does not flake off to my knowledge. I do not have a lot of anxiety over it, but it is extremely embarrassing to the point where I do not show my full head a lot in the public. Could it be folliculitis? Could that last for years?

NICH present at birth and usually flatter, presented as well defined round to oval, slightly indurated mass with overlying visualized deeper blood vessels (telangiectasias) and a rim of pallor.

I got circumcised at the age of 21. So, I have a little extra foreskin. I had a few small red bumps show and then disappear. One doctor said it was balanitis and the other said penile friction. One prescribed an antifungal cream and one prescribed Bacitracin. The area burns a little. What do you think?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your history and seen the attached photograph (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I think it is due to penile friction. I do not see any signs suggestive of fungal infection. You should apply a steroid-antibiotic combination like Mometasone Fusidic acid cream on the affected area twice daily for a week's time. Besides this, keep this area as dry as possible. Use plain water for washing this area and avoid vigorous masturbation till it gets healed.

Creatinine of 7, Hb 7.1. She does not seem to respond to plasmapheresis or dialysis well. Has 4+ pitting edema in hands, arms, legs, feet. BP 190/84. She has had three sessions of hemodialysis over five days. She is very nauseated. The patient believes that she began to be sick after she changed from brand name Osteocalcin (salmon) spray to a generic form. Do you think she could be having an idiosyncratic reaction to the fish calcitonin which has been stopped?","Doctor":"Hi. No, changing the brand is not a reason to develop microangiopathy and HUS (hemolytic-uremic syndrome). She needs to be convinced to accept what has happened. She would require hemodialysis sessions thricea week with adequate diuretics. The pedal edema is mostly because of low protein and water retention. She should take moderate protein diet. She has been initiated on dialysis recently. What really happens is that, once you are initiated on hemodialysis, gradually you start showing tolerance to it.

I am experiencing intense pain during sex, to the point that it often entirely prevents intimacy. This has been going on for about 12 months. The pain is consistently in the same spot, just behind my hymen to the right. It is not cervical or abdominal, does not shift, and is not linked to any vaginal contraction. It is worst immediately upon penetration. I am a lady with a very high pain tolerance, but initial penetration has me screaming/throwing my partner off me at the moment. If I am able to battle through the first minute or two, it starts easing. I am not generally intensely sore (beyond the usual little ache) after sex, and the whatever-it-is does not usually make itself known outside of sex (even when I sit down hard/use the bathroom), although there have been perhaps four to five little twinges over the past 12 months when I have been walking around. I have had two doctor's appointments about this previously. On the first, I went through full STD testing to eliminate a disease or infection, but all tests came back clear, including BV. On the second appointment, I went in for a pap-smear and visual inspection of the spot. Pap smear was negative, and the doctor was only able to say that she could see a 'pink irritated area' in the location. I described the pain as being centered - no cysts/polyps/tumors/notable textural difference/cuts/scarring/injury to my hymen. I am self-lubricating relatively normally and using lubricant when I do not. I am not experiencing any contractions upon penetration. The painful spot is consistent whether I am with a partner/using a sexual aid/touching it with my fingers. It does seem to ease somewhat when it has been seven or more days since I have had a sexual encounter, but every time after the first time following a break it is as painful as ever.","Doctor":"Hello. What you seem to be suffering is from vaginismus where the pain is related only to the initial penetration and not due to any organic cause. The cause of vaginismus is either the vaginal muscles are too taut, or you are not sexually excited enough before the act. And also, the vaginal opening may be slightly small. So, I suggest using alternatives to widen the opening before penetration is practiced. This problem generally goes away after delivery when the vagina is stretched. So, the same can be mechanically applied in privacy and am sure you would be benefitted.

There are two diagnoses, which matches with your pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and symptoms. The first one is infected nevus sebaceous and the second one is infected wart. Now let us differentiate the two diseases. Nevus sebaceous is a type of birthmark, which may be remain unnoticed. Now, it is infected and so become tender and symptomatic. Wart is a viral infection. Sometimes, it grows on the scalp like this. Due to touching, it becomes infected and tender. The treatment plan is as follows. First, I suggest an antibiotic cream like Mupirocin cream on it for seven days to reduce the infection. Then, I suggest oral antibiotics like Augmentin 625 mg (combination of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate) twice in a day for seven days. It will becomes dry and non tender once infection subsided. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with their consent. Once it become dry and non-tender, go for removal of the lesion. In both cases, either wart or nevus, you have to get it removed by radiofrequency or surgically.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

Should we just move on and embrace our birthmarks?","Doctor":"Hello. I appreciate you deciding to go an extra mile in gathering information about your and your friend's problem. In answer to your problem, chances of it to turn malignant (cancerous) are remote but nevertheless cannot be ruled out. As such, birthmarks tend to be deeper than acquired sunspots or other similar malignant lesions. Plus they also show signs that might suggest its change to a cancerous one. It is best if you avoid direct sun exposure on the affected side and see a doctor for a close-up examination. I would suggest a removal after a common consensus from your family's side. As for your friend again, I think from the photograph that it looks like Becker's nevus. Laser treatment followed by a minor skin surgery will cure it for life.

Melanocytic nevi maybe benign or malignant. If this lesion has recently changed any character that is increased in size, change in color, uneven pigmentation, etc., and then chances of malignancy are more. Please observe it carefully. Malignant melanoma is a disorder which carries a high index of suspicion and especially if it occurs on the feet. Hence, we cannot ignore this lesion. Since there is a strong family history, I advise that you should get a biopsy done as soon as possible. A biopsy will determine the true nature of this lesion. 1. Melanocytic nevus. 2. Malignant melanoma. 3. Lentigines. 4. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.

In ischemic heart disease also it can be prescribed. But it is not related to mood swings. You are having mood elevations as well as depression. So, suggestive of some form of psychiatric disorder.

What does heart pain mean? Where is it present? Usually, heart pain does not come where the heart is located. Heart pain causes pain in the inner border of the arm and also radiating to shoulders and jaws. So I do not think your description of heart pain matches it. If you are having left side pain may be due to lungs also. Is the pain varies with breath? If no then it will be musculoskeletal pain only.  Kindly take any analgesic if necessary. Any OTC drugs can be used. Palpitations are common due to anxiety and especially if you feel these pains thinking could be due to heart. Also in your age group palpitations are more common.

I suggest the following: Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My left hand (below where we tie the watch) occasionally burns and has the same 'sensitive to touch' feel as the feet. Sometimes, I have felt the same kind of sensitivity on my nose-tip and edges of the lips. Recently, I am noticing that the finger pads on both the hands have become too sensitive to pressure and the reddish and painful mark remains for a long time even after applying a bit of effort like turning a key in the lock.

I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your uric acid is slightly increased. So, avoid red meat and recheck uric acid after three months. Most of your symptoms point to a neuropathy. So, you need to get a nerve conduction study done. It is done by a neurologist on an OPD basis. Low calcium levels can cause some of these symptoms. So, I suggest starting tablet Shelcal 500 mg (Calcium and Vitamin D3) once a day for three months.

I am trying to work on my posture since I am getting arm pains. I am doing lots of stretching, exercises, and foam rolling. The foam rolling made me think about sleeping on something similar to get extra benefit. A pool noodle is softer, can be cut to any size and can even be taped to a T-shirt so it does not roll around. I could then offset my neck by just using a thicker pillow. I am not too sure about the lower back area, perhaps another pillow or I can taper the edge of the noodle? I thought I would ask a professional before I went out and did something possibly very silly.","Doctor":"Hello. Do not try unusual methods as sleeping for six to eight hours in an unusual position may be more harmful and cannot be equated to a foam roller as its use is controlled and for a short duration. The pool noodle, being softer, will not provide the deep tissue massage that a foam roller does.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune condition. The condition can affect a single organ or multiple organ systems. DVT (deep vein thrombosis) in SLE is multifactorial. The most common cause is the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. However, in some patients who are negative for antiphospholipid antibodies, also present with DVT.

There is no pain in the stomach or lower abdomen or near the anus. My concerns:  Did this blood come due to piles? Should I get worried about colon or stomach cancer? Will this blood in the stool keep occurring? How to treat this issue?","Doctor":"Hi. The clinical picture looks typical of bleeding from piles. This is unlikely due to cancer. Do not worry. However, to make to be sure, you need to consider a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. This blood comes whenever pressure happens on the pile mass, usually when you have hard stools or when you strain at stools. So, your primary aim should be to avoid these two.

My major concern is the day-to-day anxiety which is hampering my studies, and I want that to be cured.","Doctor":"Hi. Now your main concern is anxiety. There are few options available such as increasing the dose of Paroxetine CR to 75 mg or adding Propranolol or Buspirone. You can try any of the options. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take medications with their consent. Another thing is that you need to do regular exercise, progressive muscle relaxation techniques or yoga, as these things improve your mood as well as induces relaxation thus decreasing anxiety. Also, try to feel the anxiety and do not react to that, live in present moment. By doing this, you will be better able to tolerate anxiety.

I also have terrible pain in my ankle at night and in the morning but disappears during the day. Moreover, I have a high temper and worry a lot about everything.","Doctor":"Hello. From the given symptoms, it is not possible to zero in on the exact cause of your present condition. But because you have mentioned you work as well as study and have a tight schedule, the sleeplessness could be due to the stress you are experiencing. We cannot yet say it is stress disorder. But it has to be stress-related. Regarding the ankle pain, when the muscles relax, it pains and when it is stretched there is no pain. It has to be arthritic kind of pain. For that, I suggest you consult an orthopedic. For stress, you should try to reduce the stress you are taking now. Learn relaxation techniques. Start physical exercises and be calm. I suggest you consult a psychologist online or in person. There is no need to worry. Take care.

About one year ago, I started experiencing chest pains that would quickly go away after awhile. Then, there were a few occasions where I abused my medication and took too much. Since the last time that this happened (about six months ago), I have experienced squeezing chest pains that last longer and longer. I also cannot drink alcohol anymore because my chest hurts so bad afterward. Now, for the past three weeks, I have experienced a constant squeezing pain in my chest and it does not go away. I have had an echo, multiple EKG, stress test, and a CTA scan of my chest, but the pains are still getting worse. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. Likely, this is gastritis and reflux disease. Pain occurs due to acid reflux and esophageal spasm. You should avoid fatty, oily and spicy diet. Have some walk after having food instead of taking rest. Have multiple small meals instead of heavy meals. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Avoid smoking and alcohol for few days, for about 2 to 3 weeks. Elevate head end of the bed or use pillows while sleeping. You should get prescribed tablet Pan DSR (Pantoprazole, Domperidone) 40 mg or Esomeprazole, Domperidone combination before breakfast once a day for two weeks, and if relief then two additional weeks. If not adequately relieved, then you should add syrup Sucral O (Oxetacaine, Sucralfate) or Gelusil two teaspoons three times a day for a week.

As my cataract was only 20 %, but eye pressure was 22. My OCT was done, which showed no damage to nerves. My perimeter too is clear. No family history of glaucoma. I was put on various drops which could not bring eye pressure in the expected range for the doctor (fluctuation between 22 to 28). She suggested implant surgery to make eye pressure normal. Another doctor stopped eye drops saying I do not have glaucoma. And, do not need eye drops too. I am confused.","Doctor":"Hi. It is a practice that if perimetry is normal, one waits to start any antiglaucoma medication. The protocol is to graph your IOP (intraocular pressure) for 24 hours or IOP at different times of day repeatedly for a week, then one can decide if you have glaucoma or if you are just a case of ocular hypertension. Let me tell you there is no need of any implant and these many medications should not be started now. Chart your IOP, also a gonioscopy. Then, one can decide if one has to start medication.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

One of my medical friends suggested Aldactone may be introduced. It has no effect on uric acid, is that right? Kindly help me.","Doctor":"Hello. I agree with you that Hydrochlorothiazide increases uric acid levels, while Amlodipine may increase the leg swelling (peripheral edema). Coming to this point, Aldactone can be added to your therapy, but it has a weak antihypertensive effect and it may lead to high potassium levels. For this reason, it is important checking regularly potassium levels while taking Aldactone. If your blood pressure values remain still high while on Aldactone, I would recommend adding Moxonidine to your therapy. You should discuss with your doctor about the above treatment options.

Since many years I have the dry eye problems and have been using Refresh tears drops or Refresh Liquigel. Last year, I developed frequent twitching of eyes and eye specialist prescribed the same eye drops and fish oil 1200 mg that contains 360 mg of omega 3. Since then, the dry syndrome improved a lot. I am continuing to take the fish oil one gel a day soon after lunch. My eye pressure is normal (L 14 R 17) and no glaucoma. I have mild cataract formation in my right eye and I am advised to wait for another year for its removal. I use only reading glasses.

It is not an emergency, maybe within the next six months, you may have it. Your respiratory symptoms are likely related to ASD only, due to increased pulmonary blood flow.

My face is full of acne and oil. Please help me. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, I would like to assure you not to worry. Tension and worry only worsen your problem. So, relax Secondly, you need to do the following: You have mentioned about undergoing depression and anxiety but have not mentioned the kind of medication you took. Some anti-depressants cause weight gain and the changes it causes to your physical state needs to be counteracted through physical activity. So, check the medications and follow up with me or your therapist to make changes for the same. I am assuming you have not done any investigations or laboratory tests for the present condition. You need to carry out thyroid tests, complete blood count and uterus scan for ruling out certain conditions like PCOD (polycystic ovaries disease) that result in the current symptoms. In case of PCOD, it needs treatment and your present symptoms would fade with time. So, it is very important. You need to make changes in your diet plan. You need to have a good and balanced diet with each meal containing a portion of carbohydrate, protein and fat each and meals should be taken four hours apart. Include a lot of fruits and vegetables in your diet. Consume enough water at least eight to nine glasses each day. Drink a lot of green tea. Avoid any soda, milk or hot beverages. Avoid dairy, including milk, yogurt and cheese. Reduce red meat and focus on eggs or fish instead of meat. You need to exercises. Start with yoga and cardio twice a week and increase it eventually. It is very important to counteract the weight gain and helps fight any physical illnesses.  Avoid fried food. Stick to the grilled version instead. Follow the above advice and you will be good to go. Do not worry. For more information consult a family physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My GP says I have fluid in my middle ear especially in my right ear. I have tried antibiotics and using a nasal spray for two weeks. This has been going on for six weeks. Is there any way to clear it or like my GP says will it just take time? Can this also make you feel slightly off balance/dizzy?","Doctor":"Hello. Fluid in the middle ear is called serous otitis media (glue ear or otitis media with effusion). What we do in such patients is give medical management (antibiotics, decongestants, mucolytics, nasal sprays) and if it fails we go for myringotomy and grommet insertion. Myringotomy involves making a small cut in a portion of the tympanic membrane, sucking out the fluid and then insertion of pressure equalization tube (ventilation tube = grommet) which stays for few months and then comes out by itself. Coming to your problem, the symptoms of giddiness or off balance are common with fluid in middle ear. A decisive diagnosis requires demonstration of fluid inside using a tympanometry test. This test measures the compliance of middle ear at different pressures and when there is fluid the compliance is blunted. It gives a B type curve in the tympanogram. Clinically we see using an otoscope that the drum is bulged out, the typical landmarks are obscured, cone of light is distorted and sometimes we even see bubbles. Additionally, in history, there is some fullness of ear, hearing loss, dizziness, lightheadedness, gurgling sounds inside the ear, etc. If you were to come to me, I would be doing a full clinical ENT examination and then do a tympanometry test. Complete ENT examination helps us to rule out conditions in nose and throat that could have caused this fluid collection. In your case, thus, I would advise that you go to an ENT and get your ears checked by an otoscope or otoendoscope. Such an examination also rules out any other pathology that may be masking as fluid in the middle ear. If your GP had done otoscopy and then made the diagnosis, then I would suggest to you to get the tympanometry test done. Normally, fluid from middle ear gets drained to the back of nose via the eustachian tube, that also functions to equalize pressure on both sides of the eardrum. Eustachian tube block or catarrh results in malfunction of the tube resulting in reduced ventilation of the tube consequent negative pressure which sucks out fluid into the middle ear. An obstructed tube will reduce the drainage of normally produced mucus and cause collection. I hope this helps you. Let me know what medicines you are on. If getting the test is difficult, you may take the medicines for two weeks and then see for improvement and decide about the test then. It does take some time to resolve. But six weeks is a long time. Either the medicines are not working or are inadequate. Or there may be some physical block or growth in the back of the nasal cavity. This would require a nasoendoscopy or radiological investigation. Such a thing will cause additional nasal symptoms (block, running nose, headache, facial pressure, facial pain, reduced sense of smell, postnasal drip). Do revert back with all details and we shall help you with the right advice. If you share the details of the medicines you are taking, I shall check if they are fine.

She used to say things that happened at school openly. At home, I never scold her for telling the truth and even if she lies, if she comes and tells me that, I never scold her. She gets severe punishment and beating if she lies. But still, she lies. I wonder why. She hates hearing no from me. I fear that if I say no to her, she would not confide in me and do things behind my back, as she does now. How can I make her confide in me?","Doctor":"Hello. Dealing with a 7-year-old could be difficult. Acceptance is the key when dealing with them. Accept what she says without being judgemental. Rather than telling her what is right/wrong, tell her why right is right and let her do the decision making. Rather than scolding her for lying, appreciate and reward her when she speaks the truth. You can reward her more, when she confesses her lie. I suggest you read 'token economy' on the internet. It is an excellent way of weakening the undesirable behavior and strengthening the desirable behavior. In it, children are given tokens everytime they do a desirable behavior and those tokens are exchanged at the weekend for something that they desire like sweets/toys. A regular and dedicated system of token economy works wonders in the long term. Hope this helps.

Tell her to count backward (20,19,18, etc). 4. Tell her to stop where she is feeling problem without trying to say it with stress. Stop then relax again start saying.

My health problems started two years back, when I had a lot of stomach pains, though they went away quickly once I had a filling meal. After an endoscopy, the doctor observed a large axial hernia as well as moderately pronounced gastritis. I was prescribed PPI, and the problems went away for a while. The effects of the PPI seemed to diminish after a while as the pain returned during nights and while exercising. In the mornings, I suffered from severe heartburn and short-term breathing troubles possibly because stomach acid went into my lungs at night. Over time, I have been prescribed different PPIs like Pantoloc, Esomeprazole, and Pariet, and the dosage always increased. As the symptoms did not improve, the doctors recommended a surgery last year. Beginning of this year, I had a laparoscopic fundoplication. I could not swallow anything, not water or even my saliva, during the first five days after the surgery. The doctors suspected this was due to strong swelling, and I was able to start swallowing again after the sixth day. After the suggested diet phase, I was able to eat almost everything and was very happy about that. Since the end of last month, however, I have had strong symptoms again. I celebrated my birthday by drinking some alcohol the day before it started. The stomach pains, bloating, gurgling noises in my stomach, and most uncomfortably, pain in my lungs started again. The chest pains come mainly when I bend my upper body or when I turn in bed. My primary care doctor prescribed me 20 mg Pantoloc to take for a week, as she suspected gastritis. The symptoms were still present after a week, so the doctor who performed the surgery did another endoscopy. He determined it is a moderately pronounced gastritis and suggested three weeks of PPI therapy. As I was still concerned about the pain in my chest, I also went to a lung specialist, who diagnosed an inflammation of the bronchi, probably caused by the yearlong influence of the stomach acid. He prescribed a Cortisone inhaler, which I have been using for two weeks now. Also, I currently take 40 mg Nexium in the morning and try to take a light diet.Â The conditions now have lasted for about six weeks already, and I am starting to worry.Â Can it be anything else? Is it normal that it takes so long? I should have no heartburn after the surgery, right?","Doctor":"Hello. You are having gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

I was wondering if you could tell me if everything looks fine. I am still in pain and find it hard to eat solid foods.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the pictures you attached with your query (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Both the extracted regions looks perfectly good. I see that the sutures have been placed for helping those gums to heal quickly. Also, there is the food debris or remnants stuck on the sutures. This is absolutely normal. What you should be doing is rinse your mouth after every meal with warm salt water to get rid of that food. No vigorous gargling, please. Try to avoid hot and spicy food as you should have been already advised. Any cold food such as fresh fruit juices or yogurt soothens the gums than getting irritated with spices. You will have to revisit the dentist probably this weekend to get the sutures removed. And do not forget your medications if prescribed any. You will be completely alright. Take care.

His RBC and WBC are also going down. What can be the reason?","Doctor":"Hi. Your husband's hemoglobin and WBC count are going down very fast, it is not normal. For such low hemoglobin levels, blood transfusion is needed immediately. A peripheral smear examination should be done, to look for schistocytes like fragmented RBC and normoblast count. Reticulocyte count, serum LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), serum bilirubin, etc., need to be checked. These reports will rule out hemolytic anemia, which causes hemolysis, leading to a rapid decrease in hemoglobin. Hypersplenism and blood septicemia (blood infection), can suppress the bone marrow, which can also be presented like this. A blood DCT (direct Coombs test) has to be done, to look for autoimmune hemolytic anemia. For hemoglobinopathy induced low hemoglobin, Folic acid and Hydroxyurea are given. So, consult a nearby physician as soon as possible, to identify the cause, clinical and physical examinations need to be done.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I am a 24 year old female and this number worries me. What is the amount of pacs a person my age would usually have? And how many pacs is too many? I fear of it leading to afib.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand you may have Holter monitor or loop recorder. First of all, if you are reading from a machine, it is not accurate every time, a doctor needs to check the rhythms if your machine recorded something. PACs as you said, are premature atrial contractions, most of the time these are fairly benign rhythms and especially if your Holter did not record any atrial flutter or fibrillation or NSVT rhythm with that, it means its tendency to degenerate into an abnormal rhythm is very minimal. Next, it depends upon how many APCs you have and what symptoms you have with that. Usually, less than 5 to 10 % APC of total time are not considered a problem but if you have symptoms like dizziness, lightheadedness, and sweating with that, that may be worrisome even with 1 % APCs. Treatment is usually decreasing stress levels, cutting back on caffeine and alcohol and also if you snore at night, getting a sleep study for obstructive sleep apnea. If these things do not work for your symptoms, then low dose beta blocker, once daily (extended release) can be used and are very effective, I would suggest you have an echocardiography done regardless of symptoms for any structural abnormalities and also get TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) done. In contrast to PVCs, APCs are considered benign.

In case I am pregnant, please guide me how to get it aborted.","Doctor":"Hello. In your case, the unprotected intercourse took place at a very fertile time and the delayed intake of Unwanted 72 might render the pill useless. It is highly possible that you still might get pregnant despite the pill. However, the symptoms of back pain and stomach cramps are usually expected after taking the pill. So these symptoms are unlikely due to pregnancy and more likely due to the pill as pregnancy symptoms develop usually around five to six weeks of pregnancy. Expect your next periods to be a little delayed than usual and may look abnormal as well, like blackish in color. If your periods get delayed by over a week then take a pregnancy test and check.

I am a young breast cancer survivor in my twenties who had cancer a few years ago. I am now cancer free. However more recently than this, a doctor gave me a wrong diagnosis and told me he thought cancer had spread to my brain. It took weeks to get the brain scan and the results to find out it was clear. During this time I was panicking a lot and even now this event has passed a few months ago I am left with fatigue, internal shaking, head pressure and I jump out my skin to the slightest noise. I have all these anxiety symptoms, however, I am not worried about cancer anymore as the results were clear, but I seem to be stuck in some kind of stress response. I have tried Prozac and Citalopram (just in case these would help) and had a serious reaction to both of them (face going completely numb, vibrating and too dizzy to walk). I am not sure counseling would really help because as I mentioned the event that made me like this has now passed and I feel fine about it and do not think about it anymore. In fact, I am worried that might make it worse as I am trying to forget about it. I am not anxious anymore. I just seem stuck with these symptoms. I would just like to know if you have heard of this before and is it normal that this can happen? Also, do you have any suggestions what I can do? Should these symptoms go away in time?","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your problem. The symptoms you have mentioned suggest anxiety only. When the doctor told you mistakingly that cancer has spread to the brain, that was the trigger for anxiety. Even now when you are clear but the anxiety triggered by that event is resulting in the symptoms you are having. The symptoms like fatigue, internal shaking, head pressure, startle like response even on slightest of noise, etc., are part of persisting anxiety only.  Yes, I came across many such patients who developed such symptoms after diagnosing with some serious issue. No need to get worried about that. Such type of anxiety is common. I would advise you to keep yourself busy and distract yourself from any thoughts. Try to follow a healthy lifestyle and take high protein diet rich in complex carbohydrates and low in fats. The symptoms will go away with time, no need to get worried. If you could not tolerate Prozac or Escitalopram then the probable reason was first dose effects of SSRIs. You could have prevented this by starting with a low dose that is 5 mg for Escitalopram or 20 mg for Prozac. I hope your thyroid hormone levels are normal.

I have reviewed your detailed query and can well understand your concerns. Lymph nodes are the areas where our body fights against the foreign bodies like pathogens (like bacteria). If there is an infection of the throat, lymph nodes draining the throat area kicks in and fights against the pathogens. In this process, these nodes enlarge. But this is a temporary process and lymph nodes get to normal size once the infection is over. Sometimes, however, these nodes remain enlarged and this is a benign increase in size (harmless and is merely a cosmetic concern). Sometimes, nodes enlarge due to cancerous (malignant) lesions. But this possibility has been ruled out by your doctors. D-Dimer levels are usually high in states where there is a tendency of high blood clot formation and its breakdown in the body. Hormonal imbalances in females also make them prone to coagulation states. PCOS (polycystic ovaries syndrome) also may cause it. Certain medication may also do the same. Do not worry about lumps if they are cleared by your physician as they are possibly benign and not malignant. Hope it helps.

Since then I have taken their advice but my gums still bleed, my whole mouth is sensitive and I have noticed my teeth feel slightly loose. It is currently impossible to get to a dentist so I am concerned. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, I can make out from x-ray and picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it is gum disease for obvious. Your lower front teeth have grown gingival inflammation better called gingivitis. Gingivitis needs to be treated by a procedure called gingivectomy, means removal of excess gingiva. Home remedies as such there are not many or much effective in this case yet I can understand the situation cannot permit you to go out. For now only until the situation gets better try the following: 1. Warm water salt rinse three to four times daily. 2. If you can get some guava leaves crush them and mix with warm water use as mouth rinse for one to two minutes and spit out. 3. Crushed cloves act as good oral treatment in pain and gum diseases or if you can get clove oil that will be great to apply. 4. For loose tooth, you can apply a mixture of table salt and mustard oil where there is loose gums and then later spit it out. 5. Rest, keep brushing teeth twice daily. Kindly use soft bristle brush and do not brush very hardly or for very long. You need to brush softly for one to two minutes only. 6. Before brushing apply toothpaste all over teeth and at place teeth attaching to gums, leave it for two to three minutes then do the brushing. After brushing must give soft finger massage overall teeth and especially gums. 7. Brush in a circular manner and not in up and down motion. I hope this helps. I advise you for a complete deep scaling and root planning as soon as things get better in your area."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

At moment, I can only bend my knee 30 percent then its starts to really hurt if I try to bend more. What could be the cause and what sort of exercise should I do to get my knee working properly? Are any medicines available that will help me bend my knee?","Doctor":"Hello. In my opinion, you should get investigations done for your dislocated knee to see the level of damage that happened and also to rule out any avulsion or fracture associated with it. Then coming to your range and movement, it is always possible to get movement completely. So, do not worry about that, just a couple of mobilization of the knee joint will get you full movement and few weeks of rehabilitation will get your knee strength back. Firstly, get your knee properly assessed. Kindly get back to me with the investigation report of MRI knee, then we will plan a further course of action. For now, keep icing frequently like once in every two hours for 15 minutes. Keep moving your knee gradually and gently stretch your muscles.

From childhood, I have the habit of masturbation but due to excess of it, my sex organ does not get tight like earlier and size is also small. Please guide me so that it would not affect my married life.","Doctor":"Hi. Excessive masturbation is not a good habit, it is like an addiction. So you should limit the frequency of it. You can do it once or twice weekly. But I want to clarify that masturbation never causes a change in the size of the penis, also not known to cause erectile dysfunction. Excessive masturbation causes psychosexual dysfunction, which can affect sexual life. And it is a common condition. So keep masturbation in limit. Decrease the frequency gradually. Try to distract your mind (by taking cold water, deep breathing, talk to family members, and listening to good music), when you have urge of doing masturbation. Follow a healthy lifestyle. Do daily exercise, take healthy food, follow the routine of the day, have good sleep. If you control it, definitely your sexual life will be satisfactory. Best wishes.

I am a loner in life and now completely withdrawn from social life. I cannot name a few friends to whom I can talk and my family does not show any care towards me. I am staying away from my family due to a job and staying alone. I consulted a psychiatrist five months back as I was having sleeping problems (I used to feel severe anxiety and fear during nights without any reason). He diagnosed me with a major depressive disorder and the doctor had prescribed some anti-depressants but I am reluctant to take such depressants as I think they might have side effects so am not using any medicines. I cannot connect to people or converse or mix up with them easily ever since my childhood, as a result, I remained a loner in life. I had never been in a loving relationship with any boy till now and that upsets me a lot. I had feelings towards two guys but they left me saying they do not love me. I feel always rejected in life. As I could not bear this loneliness daily anymore, I started chatting online not realizing I was making a wrong move. I met one person in real but I was forced to have sex without my interest (this happened two months back and I fear pregnancy). I feel totally guilty and sometimes nothing for what I did. I shut down online chatting and now I feel it impossible for me to have a social life any more. My family cannot get me married. I feel there is nothing in my life to be happy about and I feel I am not worth anything on this earth. I am feeling very much suicidal (I may not do it but I really feel that I do not want to live a life like this). I feel irritated and lose control over myself easily. I started abusing my family members saying that they do not care me enough. I lost interest in my career and not able to work properly and unable to speak friendly with my colleagues. I cannot go out of my home to anywhere on my own nor do I have anyone to go with and feel more depressed to go alone. I am afraid I may lose my career along with personal life too. I wake up in the night sometimes not recognizing myself and for what purpose I exist. I am not able to put my entire feelings but I feel them very strong. I am writing this with a hope that you will help me.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query and have an impression that your psychiatrist is right in diagnosing you as a person suffering from a major depressive disorder. In fact almost all the symptoms are present at this moment which point toward major depressive disorder. I understand your concern about side effects of medications but at the same time, I am really worried about the outcome if you do not take care of yourself. I mean to say that medications may have side effects but they are really helpful to get you out from major depressive disorder from which you are currently suffering. In addition to this most of these side effects are short lasting and not everybody develops side effects. In fact, around 10 to 20 % of a person with antidepressant develop some side effects and only 1 to 2 % develop serious side effects. If you do the risk-benefit analysis of antidepressants you will find that the risk is much lower in comparison to benefits. In addition to medications, there are other options which can be handy to get rid of depression. One among them is counseling and psychotherapy. You can find a psychologist in your city for psychotherapy. If you are unable to do so I will be happy to do online counseling for you.  At this moment my advice is to start taking medication and stay active. If you do not have friends, develop a friendship with your body. Do regular exercise and stay healthy which will help you to get the right person in your life and will also help in depression.

Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Can mental retardation or other such problems detected by ultrasound at 30 weeks?","Doctor":"Hi. Absent nasal bone is a soft tissue in ultrasound to diagnose Trisomy 21. Absent fetal nasal bone is one of the strongest soft markers in the second-trimester ultrasound screening. Detailed prenatal diagnosis is advisable to rule out abnormal karyotype when absent nasal bone is associated with other ultrasound markers of fetal aneuploidy or structural abnormality. Nearly two-thirds of 15-22-week-old fetuses with Down's syndrome lack a nasal bone according to fetal-medicine specialist. For normal fetuses, the figure is 1%. This makes it unlikely that the test would wrongly diagnose Down's syndrome. Mental retardation cannot be diagnosed in 30 weeks scan. But if only an absent nasal bone is there with no other structural abnormality and NIPT (noninvasive prenatal testing) or amniocentesis is normal then please understand that the risk of isolated NB absence compared with non-isolated NB absence is much lower."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am pregnant for one month.

Firstly, if this is an unplanned pregnancy then you may consider termination. But it is important to learn the location of pregnancy first, whether it is intrauterine or an ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the uterus). This is because in that case, you cannot undertake abortion by MTP (medical termination of pregnancy) pills. Hence, an ultrasound pelvis is a must to establish the location of pregnancy first.

Recently, I checked my blood sugar levels fasting sugar: 100 and postprandial: 81 and HbA1c: 4.9. On a routine ultrasound scan, two years ago I was diagnosed with bilateral polycystic ovaries and doctor told me not to take any medication but just do regular exercise which I could not do (sedentary lifestyle). Am I diabetic yet? Is it because of PCOS? Also, how is my postprandial sugar levels less than fasting sugar?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Fasting and postprandial blood sugar levels are an indicator of your blood sugar on the day of testing. On the day of testing, if you have eaten less food than usual, or if you have indulged in physical activity after the meal, you could get a lower postprandial blood sugar reading. You could also have high secretion of insulin, which can be regulated by following a healthy lifestyle of a balanced diet and regular exercise (which you already seem to be following). HbA1C is a better indicator of blood sugar control. It shows your blood sugar control over the last couple of months. Since your HbA1C is within a normal range, you do not have anything to worry. PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) is a risk factor for developing diabetes. Since you are following a healthy lifestyle, you are at less risk of developing diabetes. Continue your healthy habits, make conscious positive efforts, but stop worrying. Stress is a risk factor for many chronic diseases, one of which is diabetes. Hence, keep calm and carry on. Keep checking your HbA1C once in six months to keep your mind calm. As long as HbA1C is normal, you do not have to worry about diabetes. As for PCOS, keep it checked with yearly ultrasound scans. Go to reputable laboratories to avoid erroneous reports.

I started bleeding bright red and cramping yesterday morning and today, I am still bleeding (some small tissue which is sometimes stingy) has shown up. Today, I also have low back pain and a constant headache. I was told to rest yesterday and I have been on bed rest today. I had an ultrasound but there was nothing and the doctordid not say much except that it may be too early to see anything. She also stated my cervix was not bleeding but stated I may have a bacterial infection. She labeled it as a âthreatened miscarriageâ. They took a blood test for hCG levels and I will return next week. My question is that if this does happen, what can I take for the pain I may feel? I know one cannot stop a miscarriage from happening even with bedrest and at this point, I am not very hopeful that I am still pregnant with blood and extremely small tissue being seen. Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hello. Try to collect beta hCG report immediately and have another sample to be given for beta hCG 48 hours from the previous report when that was collected. The difference in both levels will help to differentiate between miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. If the level reduces after 48 hours, it is a miscarriage and it is occuring by itself, but if beta hCG shows less than 60 % increase in level then from previous beta hCG it is an ectopic pregnancy that needs an emergency intervention. Better observe symptoms closely. In case of single-sided lower abdominal pain, dizziness, fainting, weakness, you need to report to the hospital immediately. For pain, only if it is a miscarriage, you can have Ponstan (Mefenamic acid) or Paracetamol, but if it is ectopic, it needs emergency intervention. Have beta hCG repeated after 48 hours of previous beta hCG blood collection and discuss here or with your doctor. Have a multivitamin and a good diet.

They are always raised and stretched looking. I went to see a doctor in high school and she basically shamed me and said I was not cleaning the area properly.

Contact dermatitis which is a type of allergy caused by something irritant comes into contact with your skin like your necklace. Many artificial jewelries have nickel which irritates skin. So best treatment is avoidance. I know it is difficult. The second treatment is steroid like when you have a rash just apply one percent Hydrocortisone two times a day only for 3 to 5 days. But remember you are also having truncal acne which will get aggravated when steroids are used. So, please use above prescribed steroid when you have a rash.

I had a scan at 6 weeks 3 days approx. and fetus measuring around 5 mm with HR of 120, was told its good and measured 6 weeks.

Ideally, the serum beta hCG levels should rise by 63 to 65 % in 46 hours. So, as can be seen, that they are and to add further, the fetal heart rate has arrived. The heart rate is low with known standards (140-160 bpm), but nevertheless, this is an ongoing pregnancy and you should be placed on Progesterone support for the next four weeks to allow better placentation.

She gets infected with sinusitis at least once in two months. When she gets infected, it takes one to two weeks to recover. Her nasal passages gets blocked and she finds it difficult to breath through the nose. Also, the mucus is very thick and she tries very hard to squeeze the mucus out. Sometimes, she applies too much pressure and finds blood stains in the mucus. She tried vaporizer and saline spray, but none of them seems to work for her. She also gets a severe headache at times due to the mucus getting blocked. She feels a pain around her eyes too. Due to this she remains inactive during the entire period. The assumption is that most of the time, she gets infected due to exposure to dust or cold climate. Is there a permanent solution for this problem? Is there anything that she can do to prevent the infection? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. She may have an allergy and a superadded bacterial infection. If she is getting recurrent infection, then get a skin prick allergy test and CT scan of the sinuses. The CT scan may show either mucosal thickening or polyp or a deviated septum, which may block the drainage of the sinuses. If positive findings on CT scan, then she may need endoscopic sinus surgery.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Well, the best way to find out whether this is spotting due to pregnancy or I-pill is by doing a simple blood test namely the serum beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) to rule out pregnancy. Please share the report when ready. Home pregnancy tests are not very accurate. With regards to the duration till when one can get I-pill related.

I cannot read anything. My eyes still get hurt by bright light and my pupils are big. Why?","Doctor":"Hi. After the cataract surgery, pupil may remain dilated due to surgical trauma to constrictor pupillae muscle or iris is damaged and becomes atrophic. Some drops also cause pupil dilation. Make sure you are not using any dilating drops with red caps such as Tropicamide, Cyclopentolate or Atropine. There is also a condition called Urrets-Zavalia syndrome in which pupil remains dilated after any kind of eye surgery. So, pupil is actually just like the shutter of the camera that controls the amount of light entering into the eye. When the pupil is dilated more light enters that cause photophobia or blurring. Blurring may also be due to intraocular edge effect. Other causes of blurring could be astigmatism. You have not explained when the surgery was done and which procedure was done? Please mention whether it is phacoemulsification or extra capsular cataract extraction with IOL or without IOL (intraocular lens) and whether the surgery was normal or complicated. So, the first thing is refraction has to be checked to know whether your vision improves with glasses and contact lens or not. Complete eye examination needed for other causes of blurring like postoperative inflammation or any other complication. So, I would advise you to get your eyes examined and get refraction. To solve the dilated pupil problem some surgery may be done or you may use colored contact lens. Colored contact lens will do the same job as a pupil.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I have yet to get the implant but recently I have developed a lump and pain around the site of the removal or graft. My oral surgeon and dentist cannot see me for next three days but I am nervous as to what it could be?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. You do not have to worry. It could be just an exaggerated soft tissue or hard tissue growth in that area as a process of healing. But since you are saying that you have pain, I assume you would have had toothbrush trauma or irritation due to denture (if you are wearing denture), or any hyperplastic tissue (bone or soft tissue). If these are ruled out, then it could be due to some infection in that site or nearby tooth. Mostly, it must be physiological only. Do not worry. If you can send me a picture of that area, I can guide you with a provisional diagnosis. Radiograph (intra-oral periapical) will be required to assess that area. Do you have any lymphadenopathy (painful swelling of lymph nodes near the angle of the jaw or below jaw)? Any pus discharge? If it is just erythematous and moderate pain, you can take Paracetamol. Do lukewarm salt water gargling. Do not worry. You will be fine. Take care. For more information consult a dentist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,My husband and I have been trying to have kids.

What are our chances of having a baby after the surgery at 25?","Doctor":"Hi. Undescended testes should be corrected in infancy actually. Mode of correction depends on the type of undescended testes. There could be chances of malignancy and infertility if a correction does not occur in infancy. But the positive point here is that your husband having one side undescend and other side, not undescend but other side having a varicocele (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is not clear in research as well how much chances of fertility correction after correction in the age of 25 years but their could be intrauterine semination, other IVF options always there if just one or two normal sperm could be detected from semen. Better to consult good fertility advisor or IVF center and surgeon as well for your conception issue but before that have proper investigations and correction of varicocele and undescended testis as well. You need multidisciplinary care and approach to find a correct solution as he needs surgery urgent or not. Before surgery, you can have IVF or IUI or after.

He has been seeing the same doctor who has recommended the same tests to be done for each follow-up since the past five years. Initially, he saw him once a year, recently it has become quarterly. I have uploaded a copy of the blood test reports and ECG was done for the follow-up on eighth of this month. Yesterday too he had to do a confirmatory blood test (Troponin) as well as ECG which confirmed he had a silent heart attack 10 days back. The admitting doctor after being informed of the test results recommended to stop Eliquis 2.5 mg 1-0-1 and take Ecosprin 150 mg 0-1-0 and tablet Plavix 75 mg 0-1-0. Also injection Clexane 80 mg SC twice a day for five days. He strongly advised getting admitted for a couple of days at least. My query is:Is hospitalization necessary now or can we wait for five days since injection Clexane 80 mg has been recommended? What is the function of the injection Clexane 80 mg recommended for five days? How does it work?What would be the purpose of hospitalization now?If we do go for hospitalization, what would be the likely tests to be done? Why has the doctor advised to get admitted along with recommending taking the injection Clexane 80 mg for five days?","Doctor":"Hello. So he did not have any symptoms, and this was detected on routine blood testing, right? His troponin is elevated here (attachment removed to protect patient identity), so it suggests he had a heart attack. So such patients are admitted for observation and administration of medications. We usually recommend admission immediately after a heart attack for 5 to 7 days, but since this time has already passed, admission is not absolutely necessary, but better to get admitted for observation, injectionClexane, and angiography. He should undergo echo and angiography, and for angiography, he has to be admitted. After angiography, he may need angioplasty or bypass. Also, if any warning signs like low bp or shortness of breath are there then he should be admitted.  Also, Clexane is blood thinner which helps in the dissolution of an already formed clot which is the reason for heart attack. So it should be given after heart attack.

Specifically, it was disrupting the nerve root for the T8 or S1 dermatome. Would the whole region of the dermatome be affected with decreased sensation? Meaning, would it wrap around the torso (T8) or down the calf (S1) or is it possible to have an isolated numb spot within the T8 or S1 dermatome itself? What specifically would you do to test and map out the area of the deficiency and how would the symptoms truly present? If you were testing the cranial nerves for deficiencies, would it matter if the patient can see you touching his skin for the trigeminal nerve?","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that an arterial gas embolism in the spine, would not affect just a nerve territory or a dermatome. But it would lead to a much more severe condition, associated to spinal shock, inability to move the legs, inability to control the sphincter and a sensory deficit affecting both lower limbs or the four limbs and the body (in case of an upper cervical spine). A spine MRI study is necessary in such cases after a careful neurologist consult. Nevertheless, gas embolism in the spine is a really exceptional diagnosis, because it usually affects the brain. The trigeminal nerve is normal if you can feel equally the touch in both sides of the face.

Unfortunately, I went to a dermatologist recommended by family and he insisted to apply Yag Laser at 55 days post-bite. I asked if it was not too soon but he said it was harmless and would only be targeting the vessels that were giving the scar the red color. I trusted and it hurt a lot. Immediately after it was horrible looking but the doctor said it was normal and not to worry. The next day I had blisters that resolved two weeks later. One month and a half later my scar that was a red line is now horrible and has local indentations. Seems that I have lost tissue on the blisters site. 15 days ago the dermatologist said it would resolve and I would not be worst than before the laser. Now I returned to his office and he tells me that it may pass but it will take two years. I am devastated and so depressed. It has been psychological hell.Can the sunken areas really fill with time and become a line scar again? I am more than a month and a half now. I have red people burned by YAG laser and never recovered. I have been applying Cica Care (silicone sheet) but I do not see any improvement. The doctor wants me to apply Hydroquinone but I stopped to trust him really. Also in a few months, if the skin does not return to normal level, will scar revision work on this site to give me a virtually invisible scar? I am so scared because the burn area with the scar is now wide. Can the revision be made without lengthening the scar? Do I have hope? What techniques of revision should be approached? Would it require multiple stages? Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, sorry for the unfortunate events you are going through. I have seen your pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The first scar was definitely a small linear one which could have been corrected by few non-interventional methods than the lasers as you said it was just 55 days old. However, the YAG laser is known for its potential to decrease the increased vascularity in such scars and help improve the outcome. So I do not think your dermatologist is wrong in suggesting you this. The post-laser picture shows that it second-degree burns, which is a common side effect of YAG, which had to be explained to you by your dermatologist beforehand, and you could have taken a better decision. Right now the scar is having two main problems, that is the depression and the pigmentation which is making it look worse. My suggestion would be to ask for micro-needling with PRP (platelet-rich plasma) or fat nano grafting underneath the scar will give you the elevation in the scar. And as suggested, the Hydroquinone with an Isotretinoin based cream will help in depigmenting it. Both these methods has to done in a proper protocol. Do discuss these things with your dermatologist, or a new skin specialist and let him or her come to the best decision after personal examination of the scar.

From what I have read, the first three medications should not be taken together. I am after a second opinion, please.","Doctor":"Hi. There is no drug interaction between Phentermine (Duromine) and Perindopril (Idaprex). Duroxime (for weight loss) can increase blood pressure which will be counteracted by Idaprex (for high blood pressure). There is no drug interaction between Citalopram (for depression) and Idaprex. Citalopram has a serious drug interaction with Duromine. Citalopram may increase the effects of Phentermine, and side effects such as nervousness and anxiety. A rare but serious condition called the serotonin syndrome can occur that includes symptoms such as hallucination, seizure, extreme changes in blood pressure, increased heart rate, excessive sweating, shivering or shaking, blurred vision, muscle spasm or stiffness, and tremor. You should regularly consult with your doctor and do report if any of these symptoms occur. You have been prescribed Prednisolone (Panafcortelone). This might be for the renal failure. But Prednisolone is known to cause depression, weight gain, and high blood pressure itself. You must get clarified with the consulting doctor about the prescription of Prednisolone (why it has been prescribed). Additionally, consult about changing Perindopril to Fosinopril as Idaprex is primarily eliminated by the kidney and may accumulate in patients with renal impairment.

For the last few occasions you have erection problems and delayed ejaculation, it can occur because of many issues including the stress or performance or time hurry. Once you had one episode of ED (erectile dysfunction) or delayed ejaculation it can cause you anxiety and that can lead to ED for the next sexual activity.

I took X-rays and the doctor is telling me that both elbows are broken. As a non-professional, I cannot see if it is really broken. I do not have any pain if I am not stretching the elbow too much. Are both elbows really broken? And if yes, do I have to wear the cast for 2 to 3 weeks?","Doctor":"Hello. There are fractures in both elbows but that is where a detailed description is needed (attachment removed to protect patient identity). If you look at the radial head and neck area (the bone in the elbow that is on the outside or thumb side and had a round appearance at the top). Look carefully and trace the bone upwards towards the elbow joint and you will notice a subtle fracture which is in its place in both views or undisplaced.  You do not need a plaster. Only a sling and mobilize as pain allows. Ice the elbow for pain relief and some of the counter painkillers. Avoid wrenching and twisting activities for 3 to 4 weeks as they may be more painful.

My ophthalmologist diagnosed it to be decompensated heterophoria. Is there anything I can do about it? I spend a lot of time writing and reading on my computer, could that make it worse?","Doctor":"Hi. Decompensated heterophoria, can result from a variety of decompensating factors. The most notable few are: Refractive errors are easy to detect and correct. You can do a simple test called pinhole test at home to check if you do have a refractive error. Just take any piece of paper and poke a hole in it with a pen. Then try looking at things at least 6 meters away. If you feel things look sharper or better in any way that means that you need glasses, or if you already wear glasses, then the power has changed. The sure shot way to diagnose refractive errors of-course is to get a cycloplegic refraction done by an ophthalmologist. Cases who do not respond may need an orthoptic referral for prismatic lenses.  Now coming to your question on writing or reading, there are numerous reports that say near work (reading and writing) are tasks that cause progression of myopia. If there has been any change in your working hours or intensity, this can also cause a decompensation. I suggest that you follow the 20-20-20 rule of taking a 20-second break every 20 minutes and looking 20 feet away while working on the computer, also take study breaks while reading or writing. Glasses with anti-reflective coating and lubricants may also help you work for longer periods with minimum strain on your eyes. With glasses of appropriate power and avoiding overexertion whilst reading or writing, your weakened fusional reflexes should make up some ground. Surgical treatments are considered only for cases not responding to the above measures. In case the problem persists or if you start to have problems like double vision, headache or increasing severity of symptoms, please consult your ophthalmologist. Partially accommodative esotropia with decompensation. Cycloplegic refraction.

I am taking one Valkem of 500 and Flunil 20 mg in morning and one Valkem OD 500, Soltus 100 mg, Rivotril 0.5 mg at night.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query and understand your concerns about the medications. From the available details, there is a possibility that you suffered from either resistant depression or bipolar depression as some of the medications prescribed to you are often used in these conditions. I mean to say that you are taking an antidepressant (Fluoxetine), mood stabilizer (Valkem-Divalproex sodium), antipsychotics (Amisant-Amisulpride) and sleeping pills (Rivotril). In my opinion, most individuals with resistant or bipolar depression need long-term treatment and any attempt to withdraw medication without supervision can bring the depression back to your life. In case you are really concerned about the medications, I think Rivotril can be tried to reduce. For this purpose start taking three-fourths of Rivotril and decrease it to the half tablet after one week. Then after this make it one fourth for another week and then stop it. In this process, you will need three weeks to four weeks to stop this. Once this is done revert back to me after three to four weeks.

Sometimes, he will grunt and raise his knees to his chest when he has gas but has always been able to get a normal amount of sleep.Today, though he has been very agitated and alert, the whole day he has been kicking with his legs and flailing his hands like crazy. Extremely agitated I would say. He was hungry and ate a reasonable amount (he is bottle-fed), but the rest of the time he keeps squirming and kicking. He did not get almost any sleep for 12 hours so far. He falls asleep and wakes up every 5 minutes, with startling reflex, throws hands in the air and then starts to squirm and kick. Then cries and weeps and this keeps going. Sometimes, he just stares super alert and kicks his legs and arms for a long time. This is not a usual behavior.Â He occasionally has been like that, but not as much as today, and it never stopped him from sleeping.His temperature is normal (rectal 99.1 F).

In the chest x-ray report, it was mentioned as bilateral apical inhomogeneities. What does it mean?","Doctor":"Hello. A chest x-ray is a routine part of any pre-employment checkup. Your query regarding reporting of x-ray as bilateral inhomogeneous opacities suggests old or active infection most probably tuberculosis. So, it is advisable to do sputum AFB test (acid-fast bacilli) to rule out whether it is an active or old infection. Usually, only the presence of inhomogeneous opacities does not make the person unfit for the job. A medical examination is done as a part of a pre-employment checkup for working abroad. Certain countries are very peculiar about some communicable diseases like tuberculosis. If the old or active infection is noted on x-ray, the candidate is declared unfit for the job. So. if your x-ray is reported as same as the other I advise you to do sputum AFB test and chest specialist consultation. If the report is positive, you can complete the full course and take a certificate from the treating physician before you apply for next job.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have never been depressed and I am a really happy person. The problem that I am facing is that whenever I talk to somebody, with anyone at all, my heart starts to rush and my face becomes red in just one second. I blush like I have done some dumb thing and it is intense and very very red, anyone can notice it. I have tried to manage it by going out as much as possible and I have learned that when I get comfortable with someone, the blush and red face thing disappears (but it took two years to get comfortable with my boss for example). I am aware the problem might be associated with anxiety, but I have never taken pills for it. I just want the blushing to go away, as that will make me less awkward and better in general. I have got a mitral valve prolapse and a ventricular hypertrophy.","Doctor":"Hello. The problems you have mentioned like the history of shyness, palpitations and flushing of the face on talking with any new person, etc., are occurring most likely due to anxiety. This could be due to social anxiety. You are facing these problems in day to day routine too and to get rid of these symptoms you should consult a psychiatrist for help. Drugs like SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) can help you to come out of the anxiety. Sertraline can be tried. The drug is safe even for cardiac problems.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Please let us know if she is pregnant or not. I am very worried.","Doctor":"Hello. Since she has taken an emergency contraceptive pill within 72 hours of intercourse then there is no chance of pregnancy. The delay could be because of hormonal changes due to the pill you have taken.

It has been going on for about four years and recently I have started having neck and shoulder pain. I am a 22 years old male. I have asthma. Currently, I am taking Albuterol. I took EKG, chest X-ray, and multiple blood test.","Doctor":"Hello. Where exactly do you get chest pain, is it in the center or on the sides, upper or lower chest, does it occur at rest or exertion? Is there any upper abdominal pain, bloating, burping, nausea, vomiting, chest burning, or relation to food? This is most likely due to cervical pain, due to compression of nerves between spine. Does this pain increase on neck movement or any neck trauma, these may be the associated symptoms. You should get X-ray cervical spine AP (anteroposterior) and lateral view and further may need MRI. You need to visit physiotherapist after X-ray and also orthopedician. Till the time have tablet Neurobion forte (Vitamin B1, B6, and B12) once a day which is a nerve vitamin.

For dyspnea, CBC will rule out anemia if present and it will also help in abnormal respiratory sound if present. Then, if needed after auscultation, further workup done in form of chest X-ray.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 51 years old with hypertension, having an elective liposuction surgery with general anesthesia. I have been preopted.

I am asymptomatic- no chest pain, no dizziness, no shortness of breath, no edema, no wheezing, no fever. Do you think I can have the liposuction surgery with general anesthesia with the mild plus tricuspid regurgitation?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, you may have it. There is no additional cardiac risk due to mild tricuspid regurgitation if there is no pulmonary artery hypertension mentioned in the echo report. It is being mild will not increase the risk beyond usual cardiac risk if there is no pulmonary artery hypertension.

We had a sexual contact a week later. She had her periods completed on Tuesday, and we had this on Thursday, and it was not intercourse. I was not able to penetrate her and was only sliding against the outer lining. Since it was unprotected, so as soon as I got the feeling of ejaculating, I withdrew. After that, I ejaculated outside. But I have a little doubt that maybe a drop or so might have come out when I felt like ejaculating and may have got on her outer vagina or slightly inner vagina. Are there any chances of getting pregnant? I doubt because of a drop that might have come out. She has a regular cycle of 28 to 30 days.","Doctor":"Hello. There is almost no chance of pregnancy in your case if you are sure that the drop of semen just touched the outer vagina. Pregnancy happens only on penetration intercourse with some volume of semen ejaculated inside into the vagina. Practically, I feel there is no chance of pregnancy. Also, the time period that you had intercourse is her safe period and not the fertile window which further reduces chance of conception. There is no need to worry regarding pregnancy or even take a contraception.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

Sometimes it goes to the right side of the chest also. I have done my ECG and blood test 6 months ago. ECG and blood sugar were normal. No hypertension but hemoglobin was 10 and Vitamin B 12 was below average. What can I do as in lockdown it is not possible to see the doctor as a person. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I would like to ask you some more questions, do you have symptoms of acid peptic disease or GERD? Or any burning sensation in the epigastric region, the center of your chest (heartburn). If you do, it could also present as chest pain so I will guide you accordingly. I would also like to rule out any muscular pain, for which I will encourage you to take a muscle relaxant and see if it helps. Take tablet Muscoril (Thiocholchicoside 4 mg) one tablet once a day when you experience pain and let me know in the follow up in a couple of days to see if it relieves the pain. Like you said your Vitamin B12 levels are below normal, it could also be neuropathic pain for which I will only advise vitamin B12 supplements (tablet Methycolbalmine once a day for three months) or B complex supplements. You can also improve these levels with diet. Take diet enriched with beef, liver, and chicken. Fish and shellfish such as trout, salmon, tuna fish, and clams. Fortified breakfast cereal. Low-fat milk, yogurt, cheese, and eggs. Since your Hb is also below the ideal levels, take iron-rich foods which are usually Vitamin B12 rich as well. So I will advise diet modification to incorporate these in your everyday routine or take supplements with iron and Vitamin B12 as well. Because anemia can also present with the said symptoms. Lastly, I will encourage you to reduce weight with exercise and changing your diet and switching to a low-fat diet with the addition of more fruits and vegetables to your diet. Try to start with atleast 30-40 minutes of cardio workout every day and work it up from there according to your stamina and you will see the visible change that you feel. You will feel more active and fresh. Try to bring your BMI (body mass index) as close to the normal range as you can. Because obesity itself can cause countless problems as well. I hope this helps.

When I told my mother about it, she confessed that she had known since I was 16 and that my father died of AIDS whilst she has been on ART for almost a decade now. They realized my status after I got tested since I was having frequent abscess wounds or boils, almost on a monthly basis but they never told me about it. I am a health student and interact with a lot of health professionals hence my hesitation to seek help to start treatment just in case I meet up with someone I know. However, my major concern is that I have recently been having drowsiness spells and frequent, almost consistent headaches though they are very light. An FBC test done a month ago showed that my Hb and HCT, as well as my neutrophil count, were slightly below normal, and I was advised to go on a month of Saferon tablets which I followed religiously. Recent full blood tests showed that my RBC, Hb, HCT, MCV, and MCH values were all now slightly below normal whilst all my WBC were within the normal range. The Hb and HCT went lower than the initial test. Therefore, my questions are, might this be related to my HIV positive status and how so? Also if it is, why is it that my white blood cells are not affected? I am mostly curious about whether such an instance as mine is quite common where a patient is born with HIV and lives an otherwise normal livelihood though with more frequent infections that go away after some time? I really do hope to hear from you. I am now 22 and have accepted my condition and forgiven my parents. I am trying to, however, get as much information and understanding about my condition hence contacting you. I sincerely thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Hi. This could be related to HIV.

It was at too high of a pressure and gave me a bruise just beneath the glans. There was burning, itching discomfort in that area at all times for around a week. It seemed to basically heal fully so I decided to pump again a month later. I used too high pressure accidentally 17 inches of mercury for a total of around 10 minutes. This reinjured the same previous area right beneath the glans. No new bruise, but the itching burning pain returned more intensely. I could not get a full erection for a week. My flaccid size shriveled noticeably. The erection quality returned fully, but I have suffered every day since in a lot of pain and discomfort in form of itchy burning sensation. It does not usually hurt when erect. Only hurts when flaccid. I have seen a good urologist last month and he said no signs of Peyronie's plaque. The diagnosis was a hematoma. He said to give it time and take anti-inflammatories. The anti-inflammatories make the pain go away temporarily but never cures. This interferes with my quality of life a lot. I am very concerned since it happened 10 months ago and still I have not recovered to normal. It has been the hardest year I have ever had due to this. I want my life back. Any advice or help would be appreciated tremendously.","Doctor":"Hello. These symptoms are because of penile trauma due to high pressure. As urologist told you it is likely hematoma or nerve injury.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Even if I consult a doctor and take prescribed medicines, the cough will continue after the course is finished. It is so severe I cannot speak, eat or do any other office work.

What happens is during infection, the virus causes damage to the cells of the throat and your windpipe. Healing of which will take around three weeks. So, even if your symptoms of fever or sore throat are gone, cough or irritation in throat might persist. Plus pollution and smoking further delays recovery. What I usually suggest is cough suppressant with steam inhalation. Benz pearls (Benzonatate) or non-codeine syrup like Levodropropizine will also help.

I just read your query about your symptoms and saw your detailed laboratory tests results (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It appears that you have a non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia in which there is a partial deficiency of 21 alpha hydroxylase enzyme leading to an overproduction of androgens like androstenedione in your case. Androstenedione is responsible for the symptoms of PCOS, hirsutism an excessive body hair, acne, and oligomenorrhea (infrequent periods). The treatment is Metformin 500 mg thrice a day and tablet Diane (a combination of Cyproterone and Ethinyl estradiol) once daily. Since you have a deficiency of vitamin D and B12, you need to take tablet Vitamin D3 5000 IU once daily for two months and tablet Neurobion forte (Vitamin B complex) twice a day for two months.

Followed by that the right tonsil remains the same and the left got subsided. In these four months, I had few episodes of pain in my ear. Also the glands in my right side of neck got swollen. I had Azithromycin, Erythromycin, Penicillin and Clavamax but the swelling of the tonsil and the glands did not go down? What should I do to prevent further episode? Does the cold temperature affect the tonsils?","Doctor":"Hi. With the conversation we had, I understand that you are an 18 year old male suffering from tonsillitis and you have been having acute exacerbation of the tonsillitis now. Due to the infection, you suffer from ear pain and swollen neck glands. You seem to be suffering from chronic tonsillitis. This resulted in episodes once a while leading to throat pain, difficulty in swallowing, ear ache, neck swelling, fever, etc. Tonsils are lymphoid organs which act as portals to remove offending agents like bacteria. However, in some individuals they themselves become the cause of infection. Infection from enlarged tonsils can spread to nose, ear or further down as throat infection which will cause great discomfort to the patients. Also, because of the same patient suffers from loss of days at work place or school or college. For your condition, I would suggest you to go ahead with tonsillectomy operation. This operation removes both the tonsils. It is done under general anesthesia and is done through the mouth. There will not be any incision outside. The reasons why I suggest you to go for the tonsillectomy operation are that, Few episodes of tonsillitis in a year can be successfully managed using medicines. However, in your case tonsillectomy operation is ideal as I explained above. In the meantime till we decide for surgery, please follow the instructions and suggestions I have given below. Some precautions to be taken are, It is true that cold climate can result in increased susceptibility to tonsillitis. Cold winds accompanied by consumption of road side or outside food can increase the chance of infection. Always use boiled water and desist from drinking water from local places. When tonsils are enlarged, the infection can move through the eustachian tube into the ear, complicate the condition and cause decreased hearing or ear discharge. Sometime the tonsils can cause referred pain to the ear though the infection may be restricted to throat. Lymph fluid from tonsils drains into neck nodes, more particularly the jugulodigastric node below the angle of jaw. Hence, the tonsillar infection will also infect the node and cause neck swelling. The swelling will resolve once the tonsillitis is cured. If the symptoms do not recede then please do the following tests. 1. Complete blood count including but not restricted to ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), platelet and lymphocytes. 2. Absolute eosinophil count. 3. Throat swab for culture and sensitivity. 1. Tonsillolith. 2. Acute Follicular Tonsillitis. 3. Acute Parenchymatous Tonsillitis. Acute exacerbation of chronic tonsillitis. I suggest you the following medications; however a complete and thorough physical examination is required to make a definitive diagnosis and prescribe the apt medication. 1. Take a stronger antibiotic, like Cefixime 200 mg, twice a day for 5 days. 2. Take an antibiotic that against anaerobic organisms, like Tinidazole or Ornidazole for 3 days after consulting with your doctor. 3. Take anti-inflammatory enzymes like trypsin-chymotrypsin tablet before food daily thrice for 2 days (Chymoral forte). 4. Take pain killers if necessary (Paracetamol 650 mg twice a day). 5. Hot salt water gargling daily three to four times and steam inhalation. 6. Follow the general instructions and precautions explained above. If the treatment does not help, you may need hospitalization and intravenous administration of medicines. Also a throat swab is necessary in such cases to ascertain if any dangerous strain of bacteria has caused the infection.

The symptoms include itching, ear discharge, ear pain, ear fullness, temporary hearing loss and tinnitus. Although most individuals will get immediate relief from tinnitus following the treatment, some may continue to experience ringing. Standard management includes a course of antifungal drops to be taken five times a day for 1 to 3 weeks. As the name suggests, this condition often occurs due to excessive moisture in the ears. Hence, it is very important to clean and wipe dry your ears after bathing and swimming. Do not clean your ears with bud frequently as frequent cleaning with a cotton bud prolongs the condition.

Pleural effusion itself can be a cause of pricky pain on inspiration and pleural fibrosis can cause continuous dull aching or pricky pain that if does not settle, may need surgery. The second thing that will require surgery is if the effusion is loculated or has multiple loculations or loculi containing pus. You should get an ultrasound thorax done which can tell if there is any residual effusion or not. If there is no effusion and still you have severe on going pain that means pleural fibrosis for which surgery is indicated. For now take ATT (anti-tubercular therapy), full course without gaps.

The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have no idea if Iâm actually pregnant or how I could tell that something else is wrong.","Doctor":"Hi, Donât worry,I am there to help. I need to know about the date on which you got last periods.Also please give me certain details- -Are you having weight gain? -Is there excessive facial or body hair? -How much delayed are your periods? -Any dark pigmentation around neck or armpits? Since your pregnancy test is negative-you may not have conceived. Itâs probable that you are developing PCOS too. During lockdown period the physical activity of most of us is a bit restricted and also there looms a lot of stress regarding Covid 19 These are factors that may lead to hormonal imbalance and hence delayed cycles.

Regarding your ear pain, it is most likely what is called otitis externa which is an infection of the outer canal of the ear most likely fungal. Wet ear is the most common cause also called swimmer's ear.

Is it possible that my level of calcium is the thing which is shortening my QT? My calcium is 2,54 mmol/L. Is it too less? I still feel something around my heart, mainly when I am in stress. Currently, I am taking Metoprolol. Previously I used to take Amlodipine.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your ECG (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I do not think, you have SQTS (short QT syndrome). I guess you do not have any family history of sudden cardiac death or ventricular tachycardia or of electrical shocks for cardiac reasons.  Your calcium is normal. Although there is no exact cut off for the diagnosis of short QT syndrome, it is usually seen in patients with QTc of 360 msec ( not in all patients with this). And most patients with SQTS have QTc less than 340 msec (range 220 to 340 msec). Yours is 367 msec (QTc). Also, according to Rautaharju's formula, your QT is borderline (which is nearly 88 percent of predicted, short QT is less than 88 percent and very short is less 80 percent). So your QT is borderline and does not entirely qualify for short QT syndrome. So I do not think, there is much need to worry about it. Even in patients with short QT or very short QT, all will not have short QT syndrome.

I am suffering from erection problem and lack of desire for sex. Just after marriage, these problems were not so severe, so I did not bother about it. We used to have sex successfully but with lesser frequency earlier. Although, on some days I failed to do intercourse due to loss of erection in the middle of it. Before marriage, I was addicted to pornography and do masturbate weekly 1 to 2 times. My personal feeling is that due to these habits I am not aroused sexually in real life with full potential with my wife.However, with age, these problems have gradually increased although I have abandoned pornography and masturbation after marriage. Now, I am only able to have sex after a long period gap of intercourse. Even after a gap, after 2 to 3 days of sex again I lose the desire and erection problem continues. I use sexual thoughts during sex and masturbate for some time to get some erection and complete the task somehow. But this is very uncomfortable for my wife. I have to do this because we are planning for a child now. At present, my primary concern is to be able to have sex at least for 10 to 12 days period per month (every alternate day) during her ovulation time. Kindly advice.My blood pressure is normal. I do not have sugar, thyroid or any major diseases at present. I do not have the habit of smoking and drinking. My semen analysis was done. The report shows slightly less sperm count. The only thing that from childhood my health and working power is below average. I get tired after small work. During worst situations, I took 50 mg Viagra only 4 to 5 times in the last three months. This worked very well for me without noticeable side effects. But I am scared to have this drug too often without medical advice. From last 20 days I am taking Himalaya Confido regularly and Tentex Royal on the day we want to have sex. I have found little improvement. Please help and suggest how can I overcome these problems.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. The history you have mentioned clearly ruling out any serious organic problem for erection. Just to reassure you I would like to tell you that masturbation is a safe habit and it is not a cause for poor erection or loss of libido. But yes if an individual watches excess porn then that can affect his mind adversely. The expectation for sex increases after watching porn. Sex is shown in the dramatic and appealing manner in a porn video. By watching excess porn expectations increases. Once the individual is with his partner then this affects the mind psychologically and due to this unconscious stress, the libido or even erection decreases sometimes. So to overcome this first step is to stop watching porn completely. This you have done already. Try to spend more time in foreplay and both of you can play role play games. This will make sex interesting. Spend more time talking about sex too and this will also help a lot. Do not think that you will not get a proper erection or you might lose the erection. Try to distract yourself from these thoughts. Since you are getting good erections during masturbation or after stimulation with hands so this rules out any physical issue. The problem is in the head and this is resulting in stress during sex and consequent loss of erection. You have to suppress unwanted thoughts that you might not get a strong erection and also try to reduce the stress. You can continue to use Confido and Tentex Royal, these are herbal medicines and will surely help you. You can take two tablets twice a day for best results. Even if you take Sildenafil or Tadalafil on SOS basis even then no need to get worried. For some time you can use the medicines as per prescription and this will help in improving the confidence and you will get a good erection without tablets too. Though your weight is in normal range according to your height even then I would advise you to get serum testosterone levels done. This could be one of the reasons for low libido. If the levels are in mid to high range then no need to get worried. Try to have sex daily during 12 to 16th days of a menstrual cycle of your wife (day one is the first day of bleeding). Sex during this period will result in maximum chances of conceiving.  For more information consult a psychiatrist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am 27 years old male.

Can this issue be resolved by physiotherapy? Any specific treatment or advice?","Doctor":"Hi. The problem you are suffering from is because of excessive use of chairs while sitting. The reason you are not able to sit with your knees close to the floor maybe because of the tightness of the muscles on the inner side of your thigh which needs stretching. It may also be because of the structure of your hip joint. The reason you are in need of a back support when you sit with your legs straight is because of hamstring muscle tightness. If you stretch your hamstring muscles you will be able to sit with your legs straight without any back support.

It is almost one month, still, hair fall is there. It is not at all decreasing. Even when washing her hair, lots of hair loss is seen. I am worried about it. What could be the reason? Any remedies?","Doctor":"Hello. Perhaps her hair fall is due to telogen effluvium. Telogen is the shedding phase of hair cycle. Usually, after an illness like high-grade fever, typhoid, malaria jaundice, etc., hair gets shifted from growing phase (anagen) to shedding phase (telogen) which is manifested as precipitous hair fall. Telogen starts one to three months after one recovers from the illness. This is self-limiting and recovers in a few months. I would like to know what was the cause of her fever.

But in this period you should regularly monitor your blood pressure level. Now you can take the following medicines and do pranayama regularly like anuloma vilom, Nadi sadhana, and bhramari.

It is colorless, odorless with no itchiness and the quantity of the discharge is more than normal.

There is nothing much to worry about. I have seen the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and such small red spots could appear due to a number of reasons. The management depends on knowing the cause for it. It could be due to taking some hot food, any hard food hit in the roof of the mouth, reduced hemoglobin levels sometimes, an allergic reaction or due to smoking (if you have the habit). As the ENT doctor suggested, it could be a case of acid reflux. So, there are a wide number of possible reasons. The medication you are using is fine. They should resolve in about 10 days time.

Is there any solution to this problem? I read on the internet that hair can turn white even when vitamins or iron levels are low. If supplements are taken, can this problem be reduced? What kind of diet would help?","Doctor":"Hello. Graying of hair is not specifically due to a vitamin deficiency. If the rest of the body does not show any signs of a vitamin deficiency, then white hair is usually idiopathic. Many genetic and environmental factors play a role. Check if the water is polluted with salts and heavy metals. Except for cosmetic concerns, grey hair usually is not a sign of a disease. Oiling the hair with ayurvedic oils might help.

A few days back when we tried to have one, it hurt a lot and he withdrew. He didn't ejaculate inside. The very next day I had a brown discharge and since then tiny blood clots ranging from red to brown have been surfacing along with light stomach cramps. Is this a sign of an internal injury. My husband's erection lasted a few seconds and he couldn't penetrate properly since I started to get hurt.","Doctor":"Hi, Hope you are doing well. From the history that you have posted -I believe that you may be suffering from a dry vagina due to some reasons. 1.Were you experiencing pain during cycles previously? 2.How are your periods now-interval and amount of bleed-normal or reduced? 3.Are you breast feeding? 4.Have you ever gotten Pap smear done? Sometimes dryness may be due to allergy and anti allergic medications that probably you could have taken due to pharyngitis. Itâs necessary to involve in enough foreplay before actual penetration-it helps in stimulating your genital glands to provide proper lubrication for penetration. Normally, the walls of the vagina stay lubricated with a thin layer of clear fluid. The hormone estrogen helps maintain that fluid and keeps the lining of your vagina healthy, thick, and elastic. A drop in estrogen levels reduces the amount of moisture available. It can happen at any age from a number of different causes. It may seem like a minor irritation. But the lack of vaginal moisture can have a huge impact on your sex life. Fortunately, several treatments are available to relieve vaginal dryness. You can use KY jelly locally in and around vagina before attempting intercourse. An internal injury is unlikely but please follow up with a gynaecologist If pain or bleeding is severe to get an examination done. Please use Tab Dolo 650 to ease off pain and hot water bag around lower abdomen during menses to avoid cramps. And the jelly I prescribed above to help reduce discomfort during intercourse. Since menses are heavy -your estrogen levels arenât sufficient- so no hormone supplements needed. Premenstrual syndrome manifests as severe cramps sometimes and since you do not plan to get pregnant as of,you can consider taking contraceptive pills- it will slowly reduce the excessive cramps and will make your bleeding volume moderate Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

I always felt embarrassed when I was with many people and when I had to say something I felt that I was shivering. When we prepared a presentation I assigned it to a student to present it and everybody were impressed but the reason I avoided speaking was the embarrassment I felt.

In social situations like speaking in front of a gathering, talking to someone of high reputation, speaking with opposite sex individuals develop anxiety symptoms like redness of face, tightness of body, feeling as if body will fall down, trembling, slurred voice, dryness of throat, etc. These are the symptoms of anxiety and should be treated properly. You have mentioned that you develop these symptoms especially when you have to speak on a large group like in assembly or yard. In such situation we can suggest you to take Propranolol (Inderal). If the situation is severe, then regular use of anti-anxiety drugs like SSRIs is advised (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Regular intake will help to control the anxiety symptoms. Apart from conventional treatment I would advise you to try progressive muscle relaxation exercise. You can take help of internet source for that. Do yoga to keep yourself relaxed. Try to practice by speaking in front of mirror. This will boost your confidence. These methods will help to supplement the actions of the drugs. If your blood pressure and pulse rate are normal then the drug should be started with 10 mg dose and can be increased to 20 mg. The drug can be taken on SOS basis (as and when necessary) like about half to one hour before presentation. This will help to control the autonomic symptoms and you will feel better. No, the medicine is not addictive. It is very safe and does not cause abuse. No, the drug will not cause drowsiness. No need to worry. In some cases taking in evening the drug might cause disturbed sleep.

I am starting to wonder if it could be something else than a fungal infection since nothing I have tried is working. Could it be bacterial? Are symptoms different? And if my symptoms are causing no pain could it be something else than an infection?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query and would like to know a few more details to answer your query better. Based on your history of medication, it is unlikely for any bacterial infection to be persistent for such a long time and without any overt symptoms. Fungal infections may persist and may require prolonged treatment sometimes, a simple skin scraping test can help diagnose it. Another possibility is non-infectious inflammation, which is common around the meatus and glans called BXO (balanitis xerotica obliterans) which in early stages can cause similar symptoms but needs a clinical examination to diagnose. I would advise you to visit your local urologist who can clinically examine you and identify your problem.

A few weeks into my first pregnancy, he and I have just broken out into HPV genital warts. Is it possible for warts to appear 14 years later? Is it more probable that my partner has been unfaithful?","Doctor":"Hello. I have noted your concern. Most HPV infection is self-limited. Most of the infected individuals are able to eradicate the virus within 20 to 24 months of infection. However, HPV infection can persist and it is possible to develop genital warts years after infection. Therefore it is hard to know when did one acquire the infection if he or she has had more than one sexual partner.

Also, the effect of the painkillers I take only last a few hours. I guess I have an infected tooth, as there is pus. Now the right side of my jaw and the area under it started hurting. I am taking Ultracet or Tramadol for pain and Augmentin for infection. What is the problem and what do I do?","Doctor":"Hi. With all the signs and symptoms you experience, it is definitely an infected tooth. It seems like a deep tooth decay. Painkillers and antibiotics do help for a toothache with infection. As you said, it is the nature of the painkillers to last only for few hours and that is why it has to be taken every four or six hours depending on the dosage. These medications will not completely cure the tooth problem unless an active dental treatment is done. Hence I advice you to visit a dentist and get it sorted immediately. Depending on the depth of the tooth decay, it could be treated with a simple root canal treatment. Please do not self-medicate Augmentin. It is not to be taken for long, not more than five days. And with the painkillers, do not take multiple brand tablets. I suggest you continue tablet Ultracet (Tramadol) thrice daily after meal for three days. Gargling with warm salt water after every meal also will give a temporary relief.

My sex life was absolutely fantastic before two months but my wife had a conversation with her friends that their husbands are doing sex for half an hour. I made her understand that normal ejaculation time is 8 to 10 minutes and that we are having when we do it. She understood but now after sex she is not being satisfied. I am worried about this so I want to know whether it is premature ejaculation. If yes, then what is the treatment and if no, then is there any tablet available to increase the time duration of ejaculation?","Doctor":"Hello. No, it is not a premature ejaculation, and it is normal to have ejaculations after this much time. In premature ejaculations, usually, ejaculation occurs within a minute. Still, to increase your ejaculation time, you can try behavioral techniques like technique which involves stimulating/penetrating the penis and stopping just before you feel you are about to ejaculate. Stop the stimulation for 30 to 60 seconds and start again once you feel that you have regained control. You can repeat this process again and again. Although, I cannot recommend a medical treatment as it is not a premature ejaculation, you can try using Lidocaine-Prilocaine spray to be sprayed over glans 5 minutes before intercourse and it will prolong the ejaculation time. Other medicines like Paroxetine and all are not recommended for you as it is not a true condition.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out.

I am concerned about the cost of the crown which I know could be very expensive even with insurance. Is it possible this can be filled with a simple filling instead of a crown?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your complaint and the relevant details. Crown placement after root canal treatment will happen once the tooth is particularly shaped and prepared for it. It is also followed by an impression making of that shaped tooth. If this step has been done, then you are definitely going to have a crown. If not, it is the root canal treatment which has just got completed (I am saying this because you had mentioned only a little portion of the tooth is removed). Answering the last part of your question, yes a simple filling can be done instead of a crown for a root canal treated tooth, but there are few conditions for it. It depends on how far the tooth is opened up for the root canal treatment, that is, the depth of the cavity and the extension. Since it is a molar tooth, we do not want to risk your tooth undergoing a fracture in the later days. So, a crown is always advisable. I request you to always ask your dentist which part of the treatment plan is going on and what is next. It is your right to question.You should not be signing the consent just like that but know what is happening actually.

I run several times a week, often sprinting up hills for two to three minutes. In the past three years, I have had a few minor cardio-related symptoms, which I had checked out because I am motivated to stay in top physical condition. These include:  Dizziness (drop in blood pressure) when standing up suddenly. Feeling of shortness of breath during minor physical exertion (for example climbing stairs). That seemed out of character for my general level of fitness. A minor episode of palpitations that resolved in a week or so (last year).  I have had two thorough cardio workups in the past five years to look into these issues, including a 24 hour Holter monitor, EKGs, and two cardio treadmill stress tests. Two cardiologists have told me my cardiovascular system is in excellent shape and they cannot find anything wrong. They seemed quite impressed I made the full 21 m on the treadmill. I have no current cardio issues. My question is this: what are the risks of intense cardio exercise? Basically, what are the risks if I try to sprint up a mountain? I have read about the dangers of long periods of running, one hour or more, but do not really see anything about the risks of dropping dead from sprinting too hard too long.","Doctor":"Hello. Exercising regularly is a good thing to keep ourselves healthy. If you are a trained athlete and exercising under the guidance of an expert for intense cardio, exercise risk will be minimal. Your expert will design a workup that will suit you, like duration of the session, the frequency of the session, and adequate rest periods between workup. So, the risk of intense cardio exercise will be minimal if it is planned properly according to your fitness levels. Coming to your second question, if you sprint up a mountain with an adequate recovery period in between, the risk will be less. If you do not allow adequate recovery period, you may get symptoms related to muscular fatigue and dehydration. If you go high up the mountain (at 5000 to 8000 feet), there will be less oxygen availability and if you are not accustomed to such conditions of low levels of oxygen you may develop acute mountain sickness and then exercising will be harmful. If you are accustomed to low levels of oxygen, moderate-intensity exercise may be advisable under expert guidance.Hope this helps.

I have been facing erectile dysfunction for the past one month. Now, I have come to know that this is the side effect of Dutasteride. How to get out of this?","Doctor":"Hi. Drugs like Dutasteride acts by inhibition of conversion of testosterone to its more active and potent form of dihydrotestosterone. Thus the side effects may include loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, low mood, irritability and depression. Although, the frequency of such adverse effects is not very high, but they are potentially frustrating. Sometimes, reduced libido may not be due to a direct side effect of Dutasteride, but is purely psychological. But still, if you have noted significant reduction in sexual desire and erection, I suggest you stop the medication. With prolonged use the condition may be irreversible and no doubt that would be more troublesome than loss of hair. Let me give you two tips for both the problems.  Onion juice contains sulfur, which increases production of keratin. Garlic on the other hand cleanses fat and cholesterol deposition from smaller blood vessels, thus improving erections by supplying more blood to the penile tissues.

LCIS (lobular carcinoma in situ) is not cancer in comparison to that of ductal carcinoma in situ. In LCIS, abnormal cells grow in lobules.

His doctor told us about a hepatoma in his liver and the liver is enlarged. Now, kindly tell me the treatment. The doctor said about chemotherapy but we did not agree for it.","Doctor":"Hello. Hepatoma can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous called HCC). If cancerous, there are many types. You have not attached any reports of your respected father. If the doctor is talking about chemotherapy, that means, it is malignant or cancerous. The common type of liver cancer is called hepatocellular carcinoma. Usually, it has a poor prognosis. The only cure for it is radical surgery. But surgery cannot be done for every case. It depends on the stage of cancer plus liver function tests and many other factors. So, without the reports, it is difficult to give some valuable suggestions. For more information consult a medical oncologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son is 4 years old.

Today, I visited the cardiologist and he suggested 2D echo and ECG. The reports show mitral valve has AML prolapse and no MR. Kindly clarify this. Is something wrong? I am attaching the reports.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your ECG is normal. In the echo, there is AML (anterior mitral leaflet) prolapse, which means there is slight backward bulging of the valve leaflet. This is mild and there is no leakage in the valve. The risk associated with this is of valve leakage called as mitral regurgitation and it is not there. In most of the individuals, it is benign and does not lead to any complications and some may develop leakages. In you, it less likely to develop leakage as it is not there at present. So, nothing to worry about it now, but get an echo once in three to five years just to keep a check over it. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

In the OCT (optical coherence tomography) the optic nerve heads do seem bulged out. Was an MRI done? VP (ventriculoperitoneal) shunt surgery is done to make an alternate drainage path for the CSF (cerebrospinal fluid). An optic nerve sheath fenestration is done to relieve any pressure on the optic nerve due to the raised CSF.

When she is having periods have simple tablet Ponstan (Mefenamic acid) 500 mg from day two to day five or if symptomatic, can have for total five days eight hourly it will not only reduce pain but also blood flow. For vomitings as well she can have antiemetic like tablet Cyclizine 50 mg eight hourly half an hour before meals. There are many hormonal medications to prevent symptoms as you described but along with Ponstan in menses day you can give her tablet Primolute N (Norethisterone) 10 mg twice daily from day five to day 24 for total three cycles to regulate cycles.

The likely cause for his shortness of breath is an accumulation of fluid in lungs which occurs in patients with heart diseases. This is especially common in patients with reduced ejection fraction. I guess he does not have a history of asthma or smoking in the past. Is there any wheezing like sound whenever he is breathing? In treatment, he should restrict fluid intakes like water and other liquids, and have a low salt diet. We have to initiate diuretics like Torsemide, after seeing his ejection fraction. I have gone through reports, his triglycerides are elevated. He should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and sugary diet. Have regular walk. We have to initiate Fenofibrate 160 mg in his current medicines to control his triglycerides if he is not taking. His eosinophils are borderline elevated, but it is fine. Does he have any abdominal complaints like indigestion, pain, etc, for worm infestation which can cause raised eosinophils?  So overall, upload his echo report, list of all medicines he is having, and provide some history which I have asked.

I would appreciate having someone look at it to further determine if I should have it looked at in person. I have had the mole my whole life. However, I do not remember it appearing the way it does today (I feel that the color has changed).","Doctor":"Hi. The mole certainly looks irritated and red (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Perhaps it is due to trauma. Trauma is the most common cause of a mole becoming inflamed or irritated. I suggest you use an OTC (over-the-counter) topical antibiotic like Neosporin ointment or Mupirocin 2 % cream, twice daily for a week or 10 days.

Last was before 14 months and then had a break-up. Now I see that she is HIV positive. Now I fear about HIV because there is high risk and I want to marry another girl. My symptoms are a sore throat before one year, dry cough for last two years, and shortness of birth. I have a red pimple on my body no more but 3 to 4 and this hides after 1 to 2 days. Also itchy. I do not have a fever, diarrhea or weight loss. I have a headache only sometimes when I work on the computer late night. So after 15 months of exposure, I went to a doctor to check my problem. The local private hospital doctor advised me for HIV test. And then, a person drew blood from my vein and the test was received next day. It was a rapid immuno-concentration HIV test for both HIV 1 and 2. The result was nonreactive. Kit used was Retroquic-HIV (qualpro). Due to fear of HIV, I was thinking about the possibly failed negative test so I went to another hospital and spoke with the doctor and the doctor recommended for ELISA HIV test but when the results come back it was not an ELISA test. It was an ECI combo test for both Ab and Ag. On the results, method ECI chemiluminescence, kit. Vitros or ortho result. 0.35 nonreactive. I do not know what is the generation of this test. Please help me what I can do or do not.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. Do not worry, I will solve your doubt. After around one year almost any test can rule out HIV conclusively. So rapid test is reliable and no need for further testing. But still, you have investigated with chemilumiscence test that gives result equivalent to ELISA test. It is called CMIA test for HIV and it is reliable. So I think now you do not have to worry about HIV. If any sexual exposure present in last 3 to 6 months then only we will think further otherwise do not worry and be relax. Take care.

I should explore the idea of fixing it even though my MRI shows that even with just one vein my blood ratio on one side to the other is noticeable and borderline. I have an appointment with a electrophysiology because I seem to be tachycardic quite often even though my pulse used to air in the 70âs also because I have been having episodes they think could be an arrhythmia and possibly related to the defect.","Doctor":"Hello. Do you get frequent respiratory tract infection like pneumonia since your childhood? Please upload MRI and echo reports. Is your hemoglobin fine? Usually, with single vein shunt is not significant, and severity of shunt can be seen on echo as well. So in small defect surgery is not considered unless shunt ratio is more than 2:1. As there is no effect of surgery on survival so it is not done. So if reports are not showing any evidence of damage to heart then surgery may not be done. However, you should be given a trial of low dose diuretics like tablet Torsemide 5 to 10 mg and look for a response in term of exercise tolerance. Hemoglobin should be corrected if it is low at it can cause these symptoms. You should try to exercise and gradually increase the exercise without thinking about the defect. Yes, a cardiac arrhythmia may be associated with the defect. Since you are having frequent palpitations, you should have Holter monitoring done, which is 24 ambulatory ECG monitoring, which will detect the rhythm during palpitations and confirm whether arrhythmias is there or not. In treatment part, you should be given beta blockers like Metoprolol after we rule out or rule in diagnosis for palpitations.

I had a low-grade fever too during those two days. I managed to carry it over with natural supplements. But it did not subside. The next day, it worsened with watery stools and I started getting dehydrated since I could not take anything inside. I had a fever and severe shivering. I took Doxicycllin (three tablets in one dose), but I did not get better. Then, I started vomiting up too. So, I was taken to the hospital and prescribed oral medicines since I hesitated to get admitted because I was to write my CA exams in two days. So, I took the oral medicines. They were: Orni-O, Pan DSR, and Bifilac. But I did not get alright still as I could not take any food inside and I vomited blue foamy. So, I was admitted and put on IV fluids and antibiotics. I felt little better but had the extreme discomfort in my tummy but I got discharged and followed oral medicines. The next day I was totally unwell, vomiting and watery stools (six to seven times). But the next day, on the day of my exam, this continued. So, I had to get admitted again and had a short session of IV fluids and medicines to stop my immediate symptoms as I needed to sit for three hours exam. So the JR there prescribed me to take Loperamide once in two hours. I took two pills as such and my loose stools got stopped and my bowel movements were nil. My stomach got bloated and I could not eat anything. So again, we went on a second opinion where they prescribed Racedotil, Endogen, Emecet and Pantocid diagnosing as viral gastroenteritis. After this course, I had my dehydration gone by and started taking fluids but I did not have proper bowel movements. Then started my severe constipation which ended up hurting my colon and I took Dulcolax. After that, I passed loose stools for two days but then now I stopped taking Dulcolax. But my botheration is my metabolism is still not alright. I am not able to eat as much as I feel hungry. I take bland foods only and on liquids too. But as soon as I take my food, my tummy is bloated and I need to walk but then it is not getting fine. Past two days, I did not have my stools. So, I took that soft stools drink and this morning with great pain passed out. But, I could not eat anything properly. My stomach is bloated and I feel like something hurts me badly in the stomach but I do not have a particular local pain but have some upper abdominal pain and discomfort after I eat. My questions are:  Is it good to continue taking Dulcolax till my metabolism gets fine? Are these after-effects because of the viral gastroenteritis or do I need to check with any other specialist regarding this? I feel tired. Why do I feel so? It has been 19 days I am with this ailment. What type of foods can I take to ease my bloating?","Doctor":"Hi. It is always better to avoid regular use of Dulcolax (Bisacodyl). Your symptoms now are secondary to after effects of a severe diarrheal episode. This is self-limiting. You need to give time. Tiredness is mainly because of the nutritional inadequacy as well as dehydration added on. Your aim now is to increase gradually your dietary intake and hydration. Always consider foods that are easily taken in, well cooked, avoiding excess spicy or oily stuff. Consider short frequent feeds rather than usual three-time feeds. Take around three liters of water daily in various forms. Make sure the water is clean. You can add tablets like Zincovit (multivitamin and multimineral) and Econorm (probiotic) twice daily for a week.

The exercise in question is the dumbbell bench press. It causes a sharp pain in the triceps and sometimes across the brachioradialis. There is no pain in any other exercises that extend the elbow with resistance. I am also not experiencing golfers elbow or tennis elbow symptoms. I know that one of the best things I can do is rest the muscle. My question is, can I just avoid the specific exercise that is causing me pain and choose ones that do not? Or does rest mean completely forgoing every elbow extension exercise? I am just taking psychoactive medication.","Doctor":"Hello. It might look like your tricep muscle imbalance or the tricep muscle fibers are not adapting to the resistance in this position. I recommend you to do not stop exercise but doing the same exercise with little to no resistance and then gradually start increasing the resistance. That will help these muscles to gain strength.

I made an error in my original dosing and now have learned I have been overdosing (approximately 20 mg per week). Three weeks ago, I started to feel fatigued. I could not concentrate at work. Stopped the medication. Yet three weeks after stopping RHGH my IGF-1 is still 2.2 SD above normal, at 500. My GH readings are basically zero (.2), indicating that the IGF-1 is suppressing my natural production. Three weeks ago I developed brain fog, a disconnected feeling, so I stopped the Somatropin. Currently, I am taking just asthma medication (Advair). But I still feel very fatigued and cannot work. I have cut back on proteins. I have three questions:  Will the IGF-1 go down to normal, and how long? Is there a medication that can lower my IGF-1? Is the fatigue from constantly high IGF-1 or because I am not producing GH?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned it appears that you have used Somatropin without actually having any growth hormone deficiency. First of all please do not restart it at any cost. Secondly, visit a cardiologist for your symptoms as the major side effect could possibly have some effect on your heart. Thirdly if it turns out that your heart is good then have a checkup with the endocrinologist for finding any effects on your brain.  I am sorry these are the side effects which can occur after prolonged usage of the said drug. If hopefully everything turns out to be normal with your brain and heart then you can just wait for some months for your pituitary to produce your own natural hormones. There has to be a proper assessment by an endocrinologist before any treatment could be given if at all to reverse it. Yes, your fatigue is due to it.

I have been experiencing erectile dysfunction for the past two years. Consulted with a couple of doctors and took medicines. But in vain. Hence we decided to go for fertility center. After consulting in a center, they advised taking few blood tests for my wife and a semen analysis for me. Reports seem fine for us. But the doctor informed that AMH level is low. Hence, she has been advised to go for IVF. But we request to consider her for IUI for few times and then we go for IVF. She agreed to go for IUI for two times. She has the regular period of 28 to 30 days and HSG report is also normal. We have also done follicle study. Please go through the reports and clarify us whether we both fit for pregnancy. Is really AMH is deciding factor for pregnancy? Kindly scrutinize the semen analysis report too. Currently, I am taking medicines for prolactin and Vitamin D.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the elaborate investigations performed (attachment removed to protect patient identity). In your case, I feel you must be suffering from premature ejaculation, rather than erectile dysfunction. You are not able to hold back semen for long, sometimes your erection goes even before ejaculation, maybe also some irritation or burning sensation at end of the penis after ejaculation, while passing urine after sex. Your only problem in semen is the lack of rapidly motile sperms. Usually, this is seen in males with low water intake, frequent urinary infections, renal stones, who hold back urine for long. IUI (intrauterine insemination) is not the first step. Better to have a course of antibiotics, improve the weak sperms and then go for IUI. Have: During this one month, do not have sex, so your infection does not go to her. Use a condom if sex. After one month masturbate 2 to 3 times then have sex. This will clear the semen and sex issue. Medicines for prolactin really not needed. For your wife, the only problem is AMH (anti-mullerian hormone) in the results. Hope the test was done within first 10 to 12 days of periods. As per scans, her follicles are growing on time, so there is something wrong with results. Better have a day three or four FSH (follicular stimulating hormone) and serum AMH from a different or better center. I think the result will come normally. For IUI,ideally, more follicles are induced. She can be given small doses of hormones and around 4 to 5 follicles are grown, they are better in health and can be triggered and ruptured using hormone injection. Then IUI can be done, of course after correcting semen only. In that case, more eggs will have a better chance with more sperms. Maybe we can discuss the corrections I have advised. I hope and feel the results will be different. You will not need IVF in that case.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It is very disturbing. I went to the doctor and he told it is maybe because of inflammation of the food pipe and gave me to do an ultrasound but everything went well. Nothing was found. But the feeling of something stuck is making me worried. Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Hi. The lump feeling is most probably due to reflux laryngitis. It is a manifestation of GERD (gastro-esophageal reflux disease) higher up near the larynx (Adam's apple and voice box). Smoking aggravates the same or can be a trigger for it. The reflux symptoms may also be voice change, hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, increased throat mucus and frequent clearing of the throat.  You will have to take some proton pump inhibitors (Pantoprazole, Esomeprazole or Lansoprazole) twice daily for few weeks and then take once daily for a week and stop. Have Gavison syrup (Sodium Alginate and Sodium bicarbonate) after each meal. Follow all precautions for GERD as your doctor would have told you before. If the problem persists and does not resolve you may have to repeat the endoscopy and this time we will have to do a video laryngoscopy along with the UGI (upper gastrointestinal) endoscopy.

Today morning I felt certain fluid coming out of my vagina. Should I take an I-pill to avoid pregnancy? Will it cause any side effects in later stages? My menstrual date is around 7th of each month. Also, I have PCOD so will the contraceptive pill cause any problem? Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello. It would be better if you take regular cyclic contraceptives instead of emergency for few months generally. At present emergency contraceptive pills to be taken to be on safe side as millions of sperms in 1 to 2 most of semen and only one sperm enough to give pregnancy, if things go well at each step.  Emergency and hormonal contraceptives have hormones so every hormone have its effects and it is not necessary that body get all side effect for every individual. It might be possible you would have irregular, unscheduled bleeding for some time. After taking emergency pills, withdrawal bleeding after 1 to 2 weeks is most commonly observed. In addition, mood variations, breast tenderness, abdominal fullness can be observed.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I have not used Isotretinoin or peel procedures though I have heard about them. Kindly explain what is that. I am attaching the latest picture. Please have a look and suggest some medicines.","Doctor":"Hello. All the medications you are on are right. I agree with your treating doctor. Peeling is a procedure where fruit-concentrated extracts are used, such as Glycolic acid and many other (Salicylic acid) which help reduce the activity of the sebaceous glands and in turn reduces acne. This procedure can be done along with your present medications. I guess that is what your dermatologist will do when you visit him next time. The other alternative is taking oral Isotretinoin. It is also a wonderful medication. It is an oral retinoid (basically a high dose of vitamin A), which has a similar action as the peel. So, either a peel or oral Isotretinoin can be considered. Isotretinoin should not be considered if you are planning to start a family.

I also get the urge to pass stools often sometimes like 2 to 3 times a day, stools are normal. I do not get to sleep a lot. I work in shifts and some days end up having four hours of sleep. Burning sensation is also present in the palm and sole sometimes, also I get uncontrolled body jerks sometimes while falling sleep but that is rare only after excessive masturbation. My mouth also remains dry most of the times. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See if all of your investigations are normal then it will not be a serious issue. However, if you are feeling all these symptoms due to masturbation then, first of all, try to control the excessive urge of masturbation. However, masturbation is a normal body phenomenon. Also, your sleeping pattern is not consistent, due to this, the problem related to digestive system may occur like excessive burping, gas and bloating, etc. So try to normal your sleep pattern and get 6 to 8 hours of regular sleep. I will prescribe you treatment for ten days for all your problems, take it regularly and you will feel better results.

If I continue to stretch my head forward and back, I no longer get the sensation down my back and neck, but this sensation will come back after I have not looked down for a while. The closest thing I can find that matches my symptoms is the LâHermitte sign. I do not have any other symptoms, my vision is fine, I have no problems with balance or anything else associated with MS (as LâHermitte is typically found in MS sufferers) but this was the only disease I could find that fit my symptoms best. Nothing is painful it is just a weird sensation. I have had no accidents or traumas to my neck or anywhere, and I do not take part in any aggressive physical activity. I am otherwise active and healthy, BMI of 26.2. I am a 25-year-old male. Just to mention, I do have a bad back posture if this is contributing?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  Your query will be addressed properly and you will be provided with best of the treatment, I assure you that.  Now Coming to your condition, your BMI (26.2) comes in preobese category which could be one of the cause of tingling sensation because weight puts more pressure on your spine and your bad posture may add up to your condition. Do you spent lots of time in front of screen like mobile or laptop? Given your medication history, are you taking it for asthma? Which other medications have you taken for it before? Is it under control?  I can prescribe you proper drugs and exercise, but I have a few questions about your condition that need to be asked. If you can join me for the follow up, or hotline chat, it will help me to analyze you properly and you will be fine with proper guidance. follow up with details."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

During menses, body have spurts of androgen. These androgen causes stimulation of pilosebaceous duct and leads to acne during this period. These types of acne usually appear in chin area may be because of more concentrated pilosebaceous unit localized to this place.

There are possibilities of transmission of HIV by pre-seminal fluid if the person is HIV positive. If negative, the chances are nil. The two tests done are reliable and suggest you are free from HIV.

I just read your query and from what you have mentioned it is seldom that Cushingâs disease and Addisonâs disease occur together.

Kindly recommend a drug that can stop ovulation and menstruation permanently. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. For stopping menses, few medical options are there but you have to be on hormones continuously and it could have some long-term side effects as well. But, if you go for a surgical option, it would be permanent with no side effects. You can have continuous Progesterone withoutwithdrawal or continuous oral contraceptive pills will out pill free tablets but continuous as well as cyclic hormones have their own specific side effects like endometrial hyperplasia, unscheduled bleeding or spotting, mood variations, breastengorgement, stroke, high blood pressure, clotformation, breast and endometrial cancer, etc. Another option is gonadotropin-releasing hormone to reduce sex hormone production but can cause bone pain and menopausal side effects within six months. Even then, if you want to have medical treatment or find it convenient, I would like to say it is temporary and the choice is yours. It is better to have a total abdominal hysterectomy as you do not need fertility. It is a whole surgery, but if done nicely there should be no long-term side effects. So, the complete removal of the uterus will give you complete cessation of menses.

I am 5'8\\" and have no history of heart disease in my family. My blood pressure is a little high and my cholesterol is normal. My LDL was 120 three months ago before I started losing weight. I have been having chest pain for three months now along with palpitations. The palpitations seem to get worse a day after I do any exercise. In the three months, I have gone running once and when I ran that time the chest pain increased and felt like an ache on the left side of my chest. I have had 6 kg numerous blood work, an echocardiogram, a stress test, and a stress echo test that all came back normal and I did not feel any chest pain during the stress and stress echo. The chest pain seems to come after I have walked a while or when I am stressed even though I have not felt the pain much since I got my result for my stress echo I would say because I have been calmer and also when I wake up some morning I can feel the ache right below my chest. The situation has completely taken over my life as I worry day and night. What are the chances of it being coronary artery disease?","Doctor":"Hello. It is unlikely to be a coronary artery disease. Firstly, considering your age, it is very unlikely. Next thing, your stress test is normal and you did not have any pain during a stress test. Pain should be uniform of cardiac blockages, and you should have got it while testing as well. So the first possibility in you is gastroesophageal reflux disease, which can explain all your symptoms. You also have epigastric pain, right. Do you also have nausea, vomiting, bloating, burping, throat or chart-burning, these may be the associated symptoms. So you should have a trial of antacids like Pantoprazole or Lansoprazole. Does this pain increase on applying pressure over the chest area, if yes then it is likely a musculoskeletal pain and unlikely to be heart-related? Also, if your pain is persistent even after antacids as well, I would also like rule out a myocardial bridge in you which can cause exertional pain. However, we would expect some changes on the stress test. Did you undergo you treadmill test or just stress echo? So just go through it and let me know some more details.

I went to a doctor yesterday and he put me on antibiotics. Yesterday night, when I took the antibiotics, after some time I got the feeling of stiffness in my right calf and thigh. My leg felt heavy and affected my walking a bit for some time too. I had thought it was due to a little bit of walking I had done yesterday.

In the morning again after taking the medicine, I felt stiffness in the right leg, and it is still there (it is late evening now) though less than before. Left leg appears to be fine. I also have a ringing sensation in my ears. I am wondering if this is due to antibiotics? Or is it just coincidence? I am not seeing any noticeable swelling in my right leg, but not very sure. Maybe there is a little bit. Please let me know your thoughts. Is it an emergency? I am in my office now and cannot go to the doctor before tomorrow morning unless it is an emergency.

Even that leads to throat infection. What measure shall I take to protect myself from throat infection?","Doctor":"Hi. Many patients come to me with this complaint of frequent sore throat. First I would say do not worry about this. We must evaluate if there is any pathogenic organism residing in the throat and causing recurrent infections. For the same a throat swab (culture and sensitivity) test is required based on which we can proceed further treatment. If tonsils are the foci of infection they frequently enlarge and cause obstructive symptoms like difficulty in swallowing, pain while swallowing and also bad smell from mouth. A physical examination by an otolaryngologist can easily diagnose tonsillar enlargement. Rather you can send me a selfie with open mouth taking care the back of throat is visible and tongue does not obstruct the view. Frequently the condition can be allergic when it does not result in pain and pus but causes frequent itching, throat discomfort and nasal discharge and sneezing. On the inflamed mucosa secondarily bacteria can multiply and produce an infection. Throat infection can cause pain and infection in the ear due to continuity with ear through the eustachian tube. Eustachian tube which serves to maintain equal pressure on both sides of eardrum and drain ear secretions can result in ear pain and fullness when blocked. As general precautions in addition to salt water gargles, take steam inhalation also. During throat pain, use Chlorhexidine gargles. Mix 5 mL Chlorhexidine in plain water and gargle the throat and spit out the fluid. Also let us know if you have any additional symptoms like cough, vomiting, fever, headache, giddiness, etc., which can help us to make more decisive diagnosis.

She took I-pill within six hours. Four days later, she had bleeding again but not like the normal period, it was different. What is the problem? And how long will this bleeding continue and when the normal periods will come? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned it appears that your fiancee is experiencing withdrawal bleeding and it happens after taking I-pill as it causes progesterone withdrawal and that is what is expected. She will get her period after a month after the discontinuation of the current bleeding which should be like 5 to 6 days approximately. If it is too much bleeding to handle then have a visit to a local gynecologist. Test for pregnancy after a month in spite of this. No one can be too sure. Use a proper contraception next time.

About 10 to 11 months back we saw a very very small dark black colored dot on her side of the tongue. But now there are 4 to 5 similar sized dot around her tongue on both sides. The size has not grown. But it is just that new location has emerged. Lately she is continuously touching her tongue and her tip of tongue appears red. She says she feels like there is a hair on her tongue and there is some sensation on her tongue. I do not know if she is able to correctly describe her feeling. I am more worried about the black spots. Rest she is absolutely fine. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for providing good quality images (attachment removed to protect patient identity). These are hyperpigmented macules. Most of the time these are asymptomatic. The cause can be hereditary or acquired (nutritional or poor hygiene or local trauma-thermal or mechanical to tongue).

Earlier, I had the problem of ringworm, but then after medication of Clotrimazole ointment and oral tablet Terbinafine, it was treated. After a couple of months of that problem, I noticed two weeks back, red rash on the ring of my glans and foreskin with burning sensation. I checked on the internet and used Clotrimazole ointment with FourDerm and Terbicip. It got subsided, but every time after a bath, it emerged. I also keep hygiene around my genitals and also washed it with warm water with salt. However, it did not get cured but remained controlled. Two days back, I consulted a dermatologist, and he suggested to stop all that and instead apply DK Gel and take AF 150 orally, one tablet every three days after dinner. It has become redder and has covered the complete foreskin with redness and swelling. I checked with the dermatologist, but he said it is due to the use of steroid FourDerm ointment, and that it will subside in 7 to 8 days. It burns and is too sensitive even if it touches the cloth. I am attaching a picture of my penis. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. By your complaints and the picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity), your concern is balanitis. What your dermatologist had suggested is appropriate. You are facing side effects due to potent steroid in FourDerm (combination of Chlorhexidine, Clobetasol, Miconazole, and Neomycin). You can continue what your dermatologist had suggested. I suggest applying DK gel (Miconazole) at bedtime and Efficort 0.127 % (Hydrocortisone) mild medicated steroid in the affected areas until redness subsides. Try taking Crocin (Paracetamol) 500 mg, as on required to reduce pain. AF 150 mg (Fluconazole), weekly once after dinner. This will help you. Do not worry.

Takes medication for his illnesses. His blood sugar levels are usually between 20 to 30 mmol takes Lantus Solostar 62 units and NovoRapid 60 units 2 to 3 times a day. What kind of complications can my dad get in the future if he continues to have high blood sugar levels?","Doctor":"Hello. Such high sugars may cause acute complications like dehydration, diabetic hyperosmolar state or diabetic ketoacidosis, which may be life-threatening. He should drink plenty of water to reduce the risk of dehydration. Also, in long-term, it can lead to heart disease, worsening of kidney disease and neuropathy, blindness, diabetic foot or gangrene. So on priority, his sugar should be brought under control. As I mentioned, the diet should be optimized and insulin dose should be increased. His Lantus and NovaRapid need to be increased. So we need recent sugar levels. So either have a glucometer and measure it at home or get it tested from the nearby laboratory. Initially get before breakfast and post lunch levels done and later we will need some more readings for tight sugar control. So the dose needs to be increased depending upon the recent sugar levels.

I had some blood laboratory work done and it showed my AST 812 and ALT 1,115. Could this be a rare side effect of Protonix? My glucose also went up to 192 and lipase is 72. I do not drink, smoke or use drugs. My doctor ran more tests the next day, but has not gotten the results yet. So, he has not prescribed anything yet for my sugar levels. She knows that I have not been feeling well for the past three weeks. I just stopped taking Protonix from yesterday. Also, I discontinued my regular Plaquenil before three months, which I used to have for the past 20 years for fatty tumors in my arm. Is there anything I can take to bring both the liver function and sugar down?","Doctor":"Hello. Is this the only liver function test you have? I wanted to trend it. Plaquenil (Hydroxychloroquine) and Protonix (Pantoprazole) both can cause elevated liver function test, but it is relatively rare with Protonix. I also want to make sure that you are not using Aspirin, Tylenol or cholesterol medications, since they can have direct effects on the liver. Another important point is that the slight elevation of lipase and blood sugar can happen in pancreatitis, which again could be a rare side effect of Protonix. But, this point goes against the fact that the elevation of blood sugar is out of the proportion to the lipase levels. A person, who has prediabetes, may develop full blown diabetes transiently under physiological stress. I was trying to understand if you had been tested for diabetes ever and if this blood sugar was obtained in fasting. For high blood sugars, I would suggest that you try to avoid high carbohydrate diet, soda, bakery products, white bread or pasta and juices. Hydrate yourself with plenty of water.

Hypertension is very common these days, because of the prevalence of bad lifestyle, genetic predispositions, etc. In your case, your mom's history of CKD (chronic kidney disease) increases your chance of hypertension. I suggest you get CBC (complete blood count), lipid profile, urine analysis, and EKG (electrocardiogram), to review your cardiovascular system. To help reduce your blood pressure, changes have to be made as follows. If after three weeks your blood pressure does not normalize, you will have to start taking medications.

I used to have the same problem in the last year also. Please guide. Can this be symptom of ovarian cancer? Recently I lost 6-8 kg of my weight.","Doctor":"Hi. Do not think of ovarian cancer as such with a single symptom. Frequent urination can be due to UTI (urinary tract infection), cystitis, bulky uterus, or uterine prolapse. It's acute onset points towards infection more likely. Just drink more water that keeps urine clear. Keep the vaginal area as dry as possible. Avoid having sex. You can take liquid Cital 2 tablespoons two to three times daily, tablet Niftas 100 mg two times daily for 15 days. If not relieved then only we have to look for other problems. Right now I am giving treatment and precautions for UTI only. For bloating, it may be due to acidity or stomach upset. Starvations or not walking like home lockdown can also increase the acidity. So avoid spicy and oily food. Do not starve. Do not take stress. You can take tablet Ondem 4 mg like tablets two times a day or Pan 40 once daily. If weight loss is without decreasing food habit and other things then need to do one ultrasound abdomen and pelvis along with one chest x-ray may be required. Means need to investigate for finding the reason. Ultrasound will also tell about any other pathology if you have doubts about your ovaries. And if symptoms are increasing then urine routine test and if pus cells found than culture sensitivity of urine also required. You can start with drinking more water and precautions and other medicines. Will see in two or three days whether decreasing or not."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

When my wife was in the kitchen, suddenly she felt some pain and heat in the upper part of her stomach and felt all her body become hot. I took her to the hospital, in the emergency department her pressure was 110/70 mmHg and the doctor requested ECG. The doctor showed some kind of worry in respect to the ECG, made some mark in the ECG and requested for a blood test. After four hours he repeated the blood test and the ECG and then he discharged her from the hospital and gave her some medicine for the stomach and advised me to follow up with heart doctor. Then we went to a heart doctor and he did another ECG and echo for her heart and advised us to get a CT image of her heart, so that he can decide and give opinion. We did not go for CT image until now and went to another doctor. He made another ECG and once he saw the ECG he was surprised and said that the ECG belongs to women of age 60 years old and not 32 years old.

Her other blood investigations are normal. Endoscopy showing that there is gastritis and duodenitis. It can be cured easily. Coming to ECG (electrocardiogram) there are some T wave inversions in lead V2 and V3. They are of little concern. Coronary artery disease is very rare in a woman of 32 years age. You can go for CT coronary angiogram, which is a very simple procedure. With reports of cardiac markers and 2D echo we can say she does not have any cardiac muscle injury and she does not have any functional problem in her heart.

I am sorry to say but I do not agree with the diagnosis of subacute stroke as per the radiology report.

Also, if that is a stroke, the symptoms would start suddenly with a left-sided weakness like in left arm or left leg and facial droop on the left side. I would recommend you to see a neurologist who can get proper history about the onset of symptoms, and do a neurological exam. Also, if the DWI (diffusion-weighted imaging) sequence if not done on the MRI, should be done to see if she had a stroke.

My height is 6 feet and weight is 88 kg. My waist is 36 inches. Around 20 years back, I was heavily into sports and a winner of a gold medal at the national level athletics. Nine months before, I was diagnosed with hypertension and occasional mild chest pain or discomfort. I was sleepless, restless and under stress of a prevailing family medical emergency. I was asked to take two trop T tests and they were negative. Then a TMT, which showed some issue at stage 3 and 4. I could not complete the TMT as my legs were paining because of the fatigue. My cardiologist (C1) said it is false positive and prescribed me Ecosprin AV 75, Razo 20 and Nebicard 5 mg. After two months, I felt some mild pain and discomfort. I went to another cardiologist (C2) and he asked for echo, which was normal with mild LVH, 66% EF and grade 1 diastolic dysfunction. But, he said since I smoked for the last 15 odd years, it is better to do an angiogram. A few ECG reports during this time as per the doctor were showing fine. My first cardiologist (C1) said angio is not required and I literally forced him to do the coronary angiogram as I wanted peace of mind. The angio was normal, but it showed a myocardial bridge in mid LAD causing a 30% systolic narrowing. Then, my doctor said it is nothing and it is pretty normal. But, he gave me a whole lot of medicines, including Pinom 40, Ecosprin AV 75, Nebicard 5, Razo 20 and Dilizem CD 90. Since then, the problem actually started. Earlier, I never had pain in the chest. There was only some mild sensation and discomfort. But now, I had pain in the middle and left side, left arm, shoulder and back. I was getting very anxious and my BP would fluctuate. I could not work or do anything properly with concentration. After three months of suffering, I visited my general medicine specialist who stopped all medicines and asked to take only Pinom 40 and Concor 5 for BP and Atorvastatin for lipid though the cholesterol levels were fine. He said that the Ecosprin and Dilizem were causing gastric problems and hence, the chest pain. Also, arranged me to see a well known cardiologist (C3) and he asked me to continue only BP medicines and a Pantocid DSR for a month. He said that it is reflux, which is causing the issue. Since then my pain is down by almost 75%. I saw a gastroenterologist and he also said that I am suffering from GERD. He did an upper GI endoscopy, which was normal. He also did a Helico test, which was positive as in H. plyori. He prescribed Pantocid HP kit for 10 days followed by Pantocid 20 mg twice daily for 60 days. 60 days got over and though things have improved, I still get pain in the chest (left side maximum), left arm and left shoulder. I just do not understand if it is related to the esophagus, then why would there is a pain in left arm and left shoulder pain? Incidence happens mostly after 3 to 4 PM. Someone said that it can be musculoskeletal pain. So, I consulted an orthopedician. The gastroenterologist also said that since I get anxious, it always aggravates the pain and the GERD and gave an opinion that maybe I should see a psychiatrist. I do not know how many more doctors should I see. I am only worried if it is anything to do with cardiac in nature and that is making me nervous and anxious. The cardiologist says that angio is done and it is clear. That is conclusive and a gold standard test. I have started doing exercises and yoga since last six months, diet modification, lost around 5 kg weight (do not know if it is because of lifestyle changes or tension), cut down smoking by 80% (resolve to quit) and very occasional drink maybe once or twice a month. I am on Pinom 40 (morning), Concor 5 mg (evening) and Pantocid 20 mg twice daily. BP is mostly controlled 130-145/80-90 mmHg. But on occasions where I have chest pain, the BP also goes up. Even after seeing all the good doctors with reputed hospitals I do not have a complete cure. Will I ever get rid of this problem completely? Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hi. It is evident that your solution of one problem led to another. Systolic bridging does cause chest pain and also smoking can cause vasospasm that is, constriction of vessels. Hence, the chest pain will be alleviated only if you totally quit smoking. All the doctors who have treated you have done a good job, although advising you to get an angiogram after a false positive TMT (treadmill test) is odd. Try to keep your blood pressure around 130/80 mmHg. Your drugs are at a minimum and that should also help you as GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) can be precipitated by all this and your anxiety. Chest pain has many causes and so you can have a cardiac, neuropathic and orthopedic cause of various types of chest pain in the same person. As a cardiologist I can advise you regarding the systolic bridging and continue Concor (Bisoprolol) perhaps 5 mg twice daily will be good. If this is too troublesome, then meet your cardiologist as a last resort. There are interventional and surgical options, but only as a last resort. All the best. Congenital. 1. Fibromyalgia. 2. Neuropathies. Myocardial bridging. Increase beta blockers, totally quit smoking and do meditation. Quit smoking and optimal blood pressure control.

We have consulted a doctor but what all further steps we have to take? He is currently taking iron supplements Absolute 3g omega.","Doctor":"Hi. The weakness and feeling cold are because of severe anemia. He needs a blood transfusion. Iron supplements are not enough. After that, we have to evaluate the cause of anemia. At his age, we need to get some investigations done to determine if there is any occult blood loss. If he has other symptoms of altered bowel habit or blood in stool we need to get a colonoscopy done. If he has dyspepsia or epigastric pain, then we need to see if he has a bleeding peptic ulcer or anything else. Also, we need to get a complete blood count done to see if there is any parasite infection. Please get the following investigations done after immediate blood transfusion. 1.Malena. 2.Hematuria. 3.Parasites. 1.Colonoscopy if altered bowel habit or Malena. 2.Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. 3.Complete blood count. 4.Serum creatinine. 5.Liver enzymes. 6.Hb (hemoglobin) electrophoresis.

For stopping loose motion what shall I do? For past six days I am taking Pantocid HP kit. No problem except loose motion of about 5-6 times and some weakness. I am taking Bifilac HP one tablet daily and a vitamin capsule. How long loose motion will happen as it is a 14 days course. I know this is a side effect. Can I take electrol powder (ORS) and coconut water? Should I follow any food restriction except spicy food?","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Pantocid HP kit contains Pantoprazole, Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin and is used in the treatment of gastritis by Helicobacter pylori bacteria. Pantoprazole reduces acid secretion while the other two kill bacteria. Loose motion is a common side effect of Amoxicillin and Clarithromycin. I will suggest you to take Bifilac (probiotic) 3 times a day. That may prevent loose motion from antibiotic and also to replenish your gut flora. Take this after consultation with your physician. You can take ORS (oral rehydration salt) and coconut water. I also suggest you to take Imosac M (combination of Loperamide Hydrochloride and Simethicone) and Racicadotril to stop loose motion till you consult your doctor. Avoid spicy food and take a light diet that your body can digest easily.

He has mentioned that his forearms feel like they tingle after which clammy hands follow. It happens suddenly and stays for a while then goes away. It is not constant. He does seem to have had intestinal blockage however it has been regular this past week. He has been to a doctor who tested his cholesterol there and it read 6.5. Should we be concerned? He is currently on Topzole. With some reading online, we are concerned that there are signs of a heart attack? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Your husband's tingling is most likely due to the long time effect of Topzole (Pantoprazole) which causes hypomagnesemia which is reduced magnesium in the blood which in turn causes tingling and also increases the chance of a heart attack. There is nothing to worry from your complaints as there are no signs to indicate any possibilities of a heart attack. Chest pain migrating to back, neck, or jaw with shortness of breath and cold sweat are the most common signs of a heart attack. I suggest you do a random blood sugar test to rule out diabetes. A lower dose of Topzole (Pantoprazole) is suggested. For more information consult a cardiologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I had unprotected sex with a sex worker five months back.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Sometimes, I vomit especially when my cough is severe and it sometimes makes me breathless. I have been taking antihistamine for it but it has no effect. I am so bothered and worried because it is been a year but still I am not well. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. According to your statement, you are suffering from chronic cough for almost a year now that makes you breathless. You did not mention here about your family history, working history, living history, allergic history, smoking history, and the factors that make you breathless sometimes. There is no history of nutritional status, night sweating or weight loss. As we know, chronic persistent cough that occurs most of the days for three months for two successive years is called chronic bronchitis. Again, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) includes chronic bronchitis along with emphysema. So, my probable diagnosis is COPD. COPD can be confirmed by reversibility test, as it is irreversible so FEV1 will be <15% after Salbutamol or steroid trial. You should undergo lung function test that will reveal FEV1/FVC <0.7%, TLC-increased, RV-increased, CXR, sputum for C/S, blood gas analysis, etc. By using Salbutamol or anticholinergic inhaler, corticosteroid or oral steroid intake, occasionally oxygen inhalation, you may control your chronic cough to some extent.

I have gone through your query and your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I would like to know a few more details to answer your query better: It is unlikely for an STD to present for four months after sexual contact, also your symptoms are more suggestive of a UTI. It is possible to have a negative urine culture because of sampling errors (the urine specimen given may not have had an adequate bacterial load) or organisms that do not grow in culture or infection of the prostate gland.  You would require a detailed clinical examination by a urologist to ascertain the probable cause of UTI and also rule out STD. I would also advise a repeat urine analysis and urine culture and serological tests if you are concerned about the possibility of STD's from the unprotected sexual contact. In the meantime, you can drink plenty of fluids to help flush out any bladder infections.

I have not usually had trouble maintaining an erection, but I have never been able to ejaculate during sex, despite going for over 30 minutes at a time. Since I was 14, I have been on Zoloft, and recently switched to Paxil last fall. I believe the issue may have something to do with the fact that I masturbated frequently as a teenager, sometimes as frequently as once per day, and I feel this may have desensitized me to the feeling of sex. I masturbate by rubbing my penis against a bed or other surface and do not usually have trouble reaching ejaculation this way but do not find much pleasure from handjobs or blowjobs. I want to know if there is anything I can do to fix this.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query, I would like to know a few more details to answer your question better. How old are you presently? How long have you been on medication? Do you have a steady partner with whom you have this problem? Do you have any problems with arousal before or during sexual contact? Are you able to maintain the erection for the duration of the encounter? Based on your history, I feel that your problems are due to a combination of your vigorous masturbation style coupled with your anti-depressant medication which is known to cause delayed ejaculation. The amount of stimulation by vigorous masturbation cannot be provided by either oral or vaginal intercourse. In addition, it is also important to rule out if there are any reversible hormonal disorders that may cause this like hypothyroidism. Therapy for this will involve psychosexual therapy integrated with changes in your lifestyle, medication. Medications are under investigation but mostly are used off-label and are not approved for use in this condition as their effectiveness is limited. With combination therapy, there will be a definite improvement, but the magnitude will depend.  For more information consult an urologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am a 25-year-old female.

As you have achieved skeletal maturity and now have stopped growing with your curve only 25 degrees then the spontaneous increase in the curve is highly unusual. You will have to, however, monitor the curve. Scoliosis leads to muscle and structural imbalances and getting knotted on one side is not uncommon.

The pain is mild but constant, it feels as if there is something is stuck in the back of my throat or on my tongue, but nothing is there. There is redness around the area. I went to the doctor five days back and was prescribed a 10 days course of antibiotics (Amoxicillin). It did not make much of a difference. Is there anything else you would recommend me to do to clear this up. Those are the only symptoms. I am a 23-year-old male.","Doctor":"Hi. You seem to have granular pharyngitis (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your throat looks chronically infected. Do you have post nasal drip as well that means does phlegm drains down from your nose to throat? It is suggestive of sinusitis which can recurrently cause throat infection for a long time.  You can start Clarithromycin 250 mg twice daily for five days but if possible get throat swab tested for culture and sensitivity and then start antibiotics based on the report. If it is difficult for you to get a throat swab done then you may directly start Clarithromycin as advised.

I am 29 years old, working woman and worried about the aesthetic part of the final dental implant. If the implant is placed too deep in the bone the final tooth might appear longer than other. How to verify if the surgeon has performed correct root extraction that will not lead to cosmetic failure. Also, what is the possibility of rectification?","Doctor":"Hi. Generally, immediate placement of implant after root extraction is easier compared to placement of an implant in solid bone (because the extraction socket just guides the position of the implant to be placed). Even if the implant is placed too deep, nothing to worry as there will be an abutment placed on it later on and then impressions are taken for the crown. The length of the final artificial tooth will be normal only (not too long if the implant is deep). To know whether your surgeon had performed the correct procedure, usually implant placement will not be done if the root extraction process is not complete. Anyways X-rays would have been taken after the procedure which will tell us about the condition. The best thing is you can directly ask your surgeon as to how the procedure had been. He will definitely give you the prognosis of the treatment.  Regarding the failure of this procedure, let us be affirmative and optimistic about it. Generally, the implant procedures are done successfully but as we all know, there can be a failure anywhere. I hope this procedure is a successful one. Just be positive and discuss with your surgeon regarding the necessary and needful precautions to be taken by you to enhance the success of the implant (the implant should get embedded with the bone for the success of it).

So my body is feeling totally weak. I am unable to stand properly also and also have a reddish color in the throat. What to do doctor?","Doctor":"Hi. The symptoms you are having are suggesting of possible viral flu infection. If you have a reddish color in the throat, then it is possible bacterial tonsillitis. Should get further checked by your physician as might need prescription medications. Meanwhile, you should take iron supplement together with drinking plenty of fluids. Use nasal saline spray to keep your nose unblocked. Apply cold balm on your chest and upper back to relieve congestion at night. Aerosol therapy can help together with taking anti-histaminic orally.

I have taken nasal spray. Now my right ear is plugged. How do I unplug it? Currently, I am taking Bupropion , Celexa, and Naproxen.","Doctor":"Hi. Sinus congestion or attacks of sinusitis can lead to a sensation of blocked ears as the congested sinus passages tend to block out the eustachian tube at one end. You can try steam with menthol inhalation three times a day, along with Budesonide nasal spray one puff in each nostril once daily for a week or two. As this is a steroid medication you may need to talk to your pharmacist about its availability over the counter in your country. These measures can clear up your sinus congestion which will also help your clogged ears to open up. If you have or develop fever, or if your symptoms worsen, you may require prescription antibiotics.

And since you have received a regime of anti-rabies it erases the chances of getting rabies. The muscle twitches you are experiencing may be happening because of some other reason.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have no allergies to medicines. Hope to have meds that are not harmful to liver as I am diagnosed as HepaB asymptomatic or HepaB carrier. Thank you in advance for your help. God bless","Doctor":"Hello Sorry to hear that you are suffering from chest and back pain. If it's happening after eating then probably it's more of a stomach issue. As your query goes regarding alternative medications apart from Omeprazole and kremil syrup we can definitely change to lansoprazole which is similar to Omeprazole but slightly stronger. Dosage would be 30 mg twice a day for 7 days. There are other things that I would like to discuss. As obvious the above medications are for symptomatic relief but we need to find the root cause of the problem. Possibilities include gastritis, H pylori infection( a type of bacteria affecting stomach), ulcer in the stomach or upper part of small intestine. To rule out any of these you would need to see a Gastroenterologist who can then do an endoscopy and get a tissue sample from your stomach to check for H pylori. I know that you might be afraid of these tests but there is nothing to worry as the procedure is usually painless and done as a day care so that you don't have to stay in the hospital.

One possibility is you would have had a hypersensitivity reaction to some proteins in the filler. But it is very unlikely for it to stay for a year.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I am suffering from clinical depression and GAD. I was diagnosed by a neurologist with migraines approximately two years ago, and have been on Lyrica 75 mg twice daily. Recently, I started having trouble swallowing (endoscope was normal), so I returned to the neurologist who prescribed Topamax 15 mg SC. I suddenly switched to Lyrica 75 mg in the morning, and Topamax 15 mg at night and developed the most insane premenstrual migraine I have ever experienced. I have never experienced that intensity of migraine symptoms, ever. I had shimmering or flickering vision, sometimes a white haze, parasthesia across forehead (with or without a slight headache), parasthesia down right side of body, upper back or neck muscle pain, irregular heartbeats, sudden whooshing sensation and feeling like I was going to faint accompanied by feeling of doom, confusion and mild hallucinations (almost like I was having a seizure), dizziness and nausea (especially with light and smells), dehydration (could not eat or drink because of nausea and swallowing issues), occasional twinging in chest. It got so bad that I got the family to drive me to the ER. By the time we arrived, I was unable to answer simple questions, and the attendor was concerned about TIA, so they admitted me, and I was seen by my neurologist, who ordered a CT scan. My results were blood count, platelet count, ESR, urea, creatinine, a lipogram, glucose fasting, TSH were normal except slightly low kidney function. ECG was normal (normal on the previous admission too, so were cardiac blood tests), chest X-ray, CT scan were normal, BP was consistently low (between 95-105 over 65-75 mmHg) lowest 88/45 mmHg while in hospital. The temperature was consistently normal. Since being discharged, I have had nausea, dizziness, sweating, urea kind of smell through my back, extreme muscle pain, low blood pressure. I returned to my GP twice because I was concerned about these symptoms. It suddenly dawned on me that these opiate-like withdrawals could be due to me suddenly stopping all of my medications before admission, the Lyrica in particular. The more I read, the more concerned I get. I saw a study where a woman had gone cold-turkey on Lyrica and ended up with cerebral edema. I guess my question is, can I safely continue weathering these withdrawal symptoms? Would the CT have picked up edema and would there be a danger of it randomly happening now that I am a few days cold-turkey off Lyrica? I do trust professionals and do not like to self-diagnose, but my anxiety levels are through the roof, and I am now certain even the hospital visit was a result of the sudden drop in dosage and combination of Lyrica and Topamax. I would appreciate your input.","Doctor":"Hi. It is fine to stop Lyrica (Pregabalin). In my opinion, your symptoms could be related to a panic attack, probably caused by Topiramate adverse effects. Besides, as Topiramate can also cause kidney dysfunction. So, I strongly agree with your doctor on stopping it. On the other hand, Lyrica is not the best drug for migraine headaches prevention. Brain edema is a serious medical condition, where the patient is usually drowsy or unconscious, with possible seizures or coma. So, I do not think that there is any serious medical condition going on. Lyrica can help against anxiety and stopping Lyrica may lead to increased anxiety. Anyway, these withdrawal symptoms are quite transitory, and you have nothing to worry about. I would recommend discussing with your doctor on the possibility of starting Amitriptyline or Propranolol in low doses to help prevent migraine headaches. These two drugs can help also improve anxiety. For more information consult a neurologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having spots on glans since I had a risky unprotected oral sex. After few days, they seemed to be normal. Again about one month and 15 days after the intercourse, while checking my penis underskin, I saw multiple tiny white dots (not on glans this time). They are not itchy but a week ago had little sporadic tingling feeling. I got tested for herpes 1/2, syphilis, hepatitis B and C just to be sure. I will get the results in a few days. Please help me. I am very concerned also because I have a regular partner that also gave oral sex recently (just before I noticed the dots).","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your question and I understand your concerns but these dots are not consistent with the usual symptoms of any of the sexually transmitted diseases (attachment removed to protect patient identity).This is more consistent with a bacterial infection, probably a Staphylococcus aureus infection. So, I would recommend that you apply an antibiotic ointment three times daily for one week after cleaning the area.

It is safe, and you can continue it if you have any breathing trouble, asthmatic issues, respiratory infection or cold and cough. There are several causes to pass green stool. Your previous day food intake is one of them. Undigested bile pigment, coloring agents in food and some bacterial infection also causes green stool. Wait for a few days and watch it.

I consulted a dermatologist doctor two months back and he prescribed Fexofenadine and Levocetirizine plus Montelukast Sodium tablets. He advised me not to take tomatoes, onions, potatoes, and lemon. The medications are over. Still, I find some hives in my body. How long should I take the medicines? Is it curable? Can I recover fully even if I take tomatoes, onions, and potatoes? Can you suggest me?","Doctor":"Hi. If you have an allergy to certain foods, you must be getting hives when you consume them. You might get hives within an hour of consuming those above-mentioned foods. Are you getting hives when you take these foods? If yes, then you have to completely avoid them in the future. Once your body develops an allergy to something, it remembers it forever. Whenever you take those foods, you will have hives. This is like, if you have an allergy to a wristwatch, you should stop using it. That is the only remedy for that. Similarly, if you have found out that you are getting hives after having these foods, then you should stop eating them. I am afraid that allergy is not curable, but it can be controlled with medications. Your dermatologist has given you the right anti-allergic pills. Are you on any other oral medications? Have you done any blood test? How often do you get hives? Do you get swelling of lips, eyes, breathing difficulty or any joint pain?

You should have plenty of fluids and regular exercises. also syrup like lactulose 15-30 ml bedtime to maintain your stool soft.

The right side of my head feels like there is a cyst or something there. My skull on the upper back right side would feel sore, bruised when touching it. It felt like a cyst, or something was inside the brain beyond the skull. After the MRI, it felt like a large bubble has got released from that area bursting into my skull. After the bubble burst, about an hour after the MRI, the bruising feeling in my skull started disappearing. There is a feeling like something is in my head in the upper back right side radiating up and down into my neck. On the right side of my neck, sometimes I feel a pinch or swelling but mostly feels like a lymph node is swollen. The MRI showed that I have a meningioma and localized frontal atrophy. The atrophy looks horrendous to me, and I found a lightened area where I have pain but it is not on the right but left side. My questions are:  Can you tell me whether a lightened area on an MRI could be an infection and not a tumor? As far as the atrophy is concerned, I have felt like my brain cannot create its energy for about 1 to 2 years. I was drinking a lot of sugar to provide energy but then started using supplements like acetyl carnitine which changes fat to fuel. I was under a lot of stress for several years and also was using a lot of anticholinergics like allergy medicine and antidepressants. I read that the brain will cannibalize itself for Choline. I take Choline now, but do you think my brain shrunk due to stress, not enough Choline, low blood pressure (not enough nutrients)? Would acetyl carnitine which helps utilize fat for fuel cannibalize my brain for fuel if I do not have enough glucose or ketones?  Currently, I am on Lexapro 20 mg, Wellbutrin 75 mg and Spironolactone 25 mg.","Doctor":"Hello. I would like to review your MRI report for a more professional opinion directly. A hyperintense lesion could be related to low blood perfusion area or migraine headaches (if you have suffered before). The meningioma is a benign tumor, which grows slowly without causing obvious symptoms. In case of a frontal meningioma, it can lead to depression and memory problems. Regarding the brain atrophy, it could be related to different possible causes: Chronic hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, a sedentary life, family history, etc. But, you should know that this is not a specific finding. As there are many persons with brain atrophy, who have normal cognitive function and well-preserved memory. So, as long as you do not have any short-term memory problems, there is nothing to worry about. I recommend consulting with a neurologist and performing some cognitive tests, just to be sure that everything is fine. It is also necessary following a healthy lifestyle: A healthy diet (Mediterranean diet, a low salt diet, be active and perform a lot of physical activity, avoid smoking or alcohol, etc.). I would also recommend continuing taking daily Aspirin.

So, they compared my prostate to that one Psa 1.5 and pre-void 265cc and post void 22cc normal jets. Currently, I am on 75 mg Effexor. Now the two streams happen 30% of the time and if I pinch my penis it goes back together. But sometimes not. I have seen it come together midstream and go apart midstream. Doctors here feel the double stream is linked to pressure on the bladder, from anxiety. What do you think?","Doctor":"Hi. The split stream can be due to narrowing of the urethral opening or sometimes due to voiding with high pressure. If you consult your urologist, get a uroflow test done. If there is any narrowing, it will show in the flow. Splaying of the stream can sometimes be prevented by pissing with foreskin fully down (non-retracted) provided you are not circumcised.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have reviewed your health query and can well understand you are worried about your heart health. I would not say to stop Xarelto (Rivaroxaban) and/or Cordarone (Amiodarone) as these are very important medications and you need them. For stent patients, Xarelto reduces the risk of strokes, pulmonary embolism, and deep venous thrombosis, and clots initiating from the stents area. It is a blood thinning agent and keeps the blood running in veins and arteries without excessive clotting. Cordarone, on the other hand, keeps you away from heart rhythm problems like AF (atrial fibrillation). With the fact that you are having no arrhythmias while taking this medication, I do not think there is an obvious need to change the dosage. If your cardiologist gets some indication to reduce the dosage after examining you physically, that would be a different story.

I think we timed it well during and before ovulation. I started feeling to have cramps after having sex. I never feel cramps at the time of ovulation. So, it was unusual. It used to increase when I stand for long. It was normal and not really uncomfortable. It was there for four days. Can it be cramps after conception? I felt tired for two days. My pelvic area also felt heavy. But, now I do not have any cramps. I think I feel bloated. I read online that all these could be early pregnancy signs. I thought it would take more time to get pregnant. Am I pregnant? I feel no more signs. Now I am in a week after my ovulation and a week before my expected periods. So, IÂ cannot do pregnancy test. I am going crazy thinking that I might be misreading the signs. I am a pessimist, so do not want my hopes up. My age is 28 at present. Please guide.","Doctor":"Hi.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I got an ultrasound done, which revealed a 5 cm hemorrhagic cyst in my right ovary. MyÂ period is also delayed. Is this cyst regular or an endometriosis cyst?Â Is this pain related to the cyst? What should I do? I am attaching my scan reports.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), you are fine and only need very few changes. Let me tell you the problems one by one followed by what to do. Your cyst is just a hemorrhagic or corpus luteum cyst. After ovulation, the remains of the follicle may sometimes keep bleeding and form a cyst. It is not endometriosis because in that case, you would have regular painful periods every month, brownish discharge and severe pain during sex. Your cyst will resolve on its own. Just forget about it, you can have a repeat scan after four weeks to check the size. Your scan says polycystic ovaries. But, the criteria for PCO is at least ten cysts of 10 to 12 mm on both sides. So you do not have PCO. I suggest you try the following to reduce your weight. Try to reduce 2 to 4 kg per month. Do not hurry on weight reduction, as it will be difficult to maintain. As soon as you reduce at least 5 kg, you will see changes in your health.

I had gone through two to three sets of tests back then including HIV, and all were negative. But I still have some neurological problems which started one month after I had the intercourse. The doctor did not find any STD through VDRL test. And the doctor informed it was psychological. Four years back, I had safe sex and oral sex with some random girls. At present, I have very small two or three warts on my penis, which a dermatologist said is normal and it recurs. He prescribed one ointment and it was gone. It has come back again. Also, I have a very small white line or very light patch in the penis. Still having the neurological problems (under treatment) for some nerve suppression at neck level disk. Not sure if there is any link with STDs from back then. I am having a problem with having babies. Therefore I would like to confirm if I have any STDs.","Doctor":"Hello. I have noted your concern and I have viewed the images (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I can see a single, skin colored, raised and round bump on the glans. Perhaps it is a genital wart, however, I request you to kindly upload a few more good quality and closer images so that I am able to have a closer look and guide you better. The whitish line on the undersurface of the prepuce is not an STD. It seems like it is due to Fordyce spots arranged in a linear pattern. Fordyce spots are quite common. They are ectopic sebaceous glands. As far as your screening tests are concerned they seem to be conclusive since they were done almost five years after sexual contact and would have certainly ruled out HIV and syphilis. You neurological symptoms are most likely unrelated. Regards.
