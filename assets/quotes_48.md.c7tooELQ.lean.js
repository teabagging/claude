Since sin pi = 0 and cos pi = -1, this simplifies to sin(pi - a) = -sin a.Similarly, for the second part, we use the identity for the sine of a sum, sinleft(frac{pi}{2} + aright) = sin frac{pi}{2} cos a + cos frac{pi}{2} sin a. Here sin frac{pi}{2} = 1 and cos frac{pi}{2} = 0, which simplifies to sinleft(frac{pi}{2} + aright) = cos a.So we have sin(pi - a) = -2sinleft(frac{pi}{2} + aright) becomes -sin a = -2cos a. Simplifying this, we get sin a = 2cos a.Now, using the Pythagorean identity sin^2 a + cos^2 a = 1, we can solve for sin a and cos a.Squaring both sides of sin a = 2cos a yields sin^2 a = 4cos^2 a. Substituting into the Pythagorean identity gives us:begin{align*}4cos^2 a + cos^2 a &= 1 5cos^2 a &= 1 cos^2 a &= frac{1}{5} cos a &= pmfrac{sqrt{5}}{5}.end{align*}Since sin a = 2cos a, we find that:begin{align*}sin a &= 2left(pmfrac{sqrt{5}}{5}right) &= pmfrac{2sqrt{5}}{5}.end{align*}To determine the correct sign of sin a and cos a, we go back to the original equation sin(pi - a) = -2sinleft(frac{pi}{2} + aright).

Therefore, x+y+a is positive and x+y-a must also be positive. The prime number p can only be written as a product of two positive integers in two ways: 1 cdot p and p cdot 1. Since x+y+a geqslant x+y-a, it follows that x+y+a=p and x+y-a=1. Adding these two equations, we find that 2 x+2 y=p+1. We also know that x^{2}+y^{2}+1=p+1, so 2 x+2 y=x^{2}+y^{2}+1.

Consider the colorings of a 5 times 5 table described in the problem (i.e., such that in each column and each row exactly one cell is colored).For convenience, let's introduce some notations. Let the top-left corner cell of the 5 times 5 table be called A, and the bottom-right corner cell be called B. Suppose that among the colorings of the first table, exactly a have the cell A colored, and exactly b have the cell B colored. Clearly, a=b due to symmetry.Notice that the number of colorings of the second table is equal to the number of colorings of the first table where the cell A is not colored. The number of colorings of the third table is equal to the number of colorings of the first table where neither A nor B is colored. To find this, we subtract from 120 the number of colorings of the first table where A or B is colored. To count the number of such colorings, we add a and b, and then subtract what has been counted twice - the ways where both A and B are colored.All colorings of the first table can be divided into two types: those in which the cell A is colored, and those in which it is not. This leads to the equation 120=a+96, i.e., a=24. Then b=24 as well.The number of colorings where both A and B are colored is the same as the number of ways to color the central 3 times 3 square.

We will prove this by mathematical induction. If s(n)=4^{n-1} holds for a certain n (as is the case for n=1,2,3), then for the sum s(n+1), according to our procedure, we getbegin{aligned}s(n+1) & =lleft(2^{n}+1right)+lleft(2^{n}+2right)+lleft(2^{n-1}+3right)+ldots+lleft(2^{n+1}right)= & =left[left(2^{n}+1right)+left(2^{n-1}+3right)+ldots+left(2^{n+1}-1right)right]+s(n)= & =frac{2^{n-1}}{2}left(2^{n}+1+2^{n+1}-1right)+4^{n-1}=2^{n-2} cdot 3 cdot 2^{n}+4^{n-1}=4^{n} .end{aligned}(We used the fact that the number of odd numbers from 2^{n}+1 to 2^{n+1}-1 inclusive is equal to 2^{n-1}.)

Define the problem and the scoring system:   - The target is a circle with a diameter of 10 units, hence a radius of 5 units.   - Ben gets lceil 5 - x rceil points for hitting a point x units away from the center.   - We need to calculate the expected number of points Ben can earn from a single dart throw.2. Divide the target into regions based on the scoring system:   - The scoring system is based on the distance from the center:     - For 0 leq x < 1, Ben gets 5 points.     - For 1 leq x < 2, Ben gets 4 points.     - For 2 leq x < 3, Ben gets 3 points.     - For 3 leq x < 4, Ben gets 2 points.     - For 4 leq x leq 5, Ben gets 1 point.3.

Experimenting with low n, shows that the only solutions for n = 1, 2, 3 are (x - 2y), (x + y)(x - 2y), (x + y) 2 (x - 2y). It then obvious by inspection that (x + y) n (x - 2y) is a solution for any n. Taking x = y = z in (2) shows that P(2x,x) = 0, so (x - 2y) is always a factor. Taking x = y = 1, z = -2 gives P(1,-1) (2 n - 2) = 0, so (x + y) is a factor for n > 1. All this suggests (but does not prove) that the general solution is (x + y) n (x - 2y). Take y = 1 - x, z = 0 in (2) and we get: P(x, 1-x) = -1 - P(1-x, x). In particular, P(0,1) = -2.

The same can be said about the sum of the sums of the columns, and we conclude that the sum of all the sums is 2 times 45=90. Therefore, the missing sum is 90-(9+13+14+17+18)=90-71=19.b) 1st solution: If all the sums were even, the sums of the three rows would be even and their sum would be even. But this is impossible because, as we saw above, the sum of the sums of the three rows is 45, which is an odd number.2nd solution: When distributing the numbers in the square, a row can have at most three odd numbers. On the other hand, there are five odd numbers from 1 to 9, namely, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. The ways to write 5 as a sum of integers less than or equal to 3 are 5=2+3=1+1+3=1+2+2. Since in any of these sums the terms 1 or 3 appear, we conclude that at least one row of a filled square will contain one or three odd numbers, with the rest being even. In any case, we get a row whose sum is odd.c) Let's extend this solution a bit to determine not just one, but all the squares that have the given sums. Before starting, we note that swapping the order of two rows (or two columns) does not change the sums of a square. The six numbers in the final result must be divided into two groups of three numbers each, whose sums are equal to 45. In the first group, each number is the sum of a row, and in the other, the sum of each column. According to the previous item, each group must contain an odd number; thus, 7 and 13 must be in different sets. It immediately follows that the only possibility is to separate the sums into the groups 7,16,22 and 13, 14, 18; we can then assume that the sums of the rows are 7, 16, 22 and the sums of the columns are 13, 14, 18.Since the only way to get the sum 7 is 1+2+4=7, we can start filling in the square as follows:![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_01_1c2853cb1112cfb2ee2dg-23.jpg?height=131&width=212&top_left_y=1294&top_left_x=822)Suppose the sum of the second row is 22; the only possibilities for the sum 22 are 5+8+9=22 and 6+7+9=22, which we will consider separately.Suppose first that the numbers 5, 8, and 9 appear in the second row. Here the 5 cannot appear in the column of the 4, because 4+5=9 and to get one of the sums 13, 14, or 18 in that column, the third number would have to be 4, 5, or 9, respectively, which cannot happen since the 4 has already been used while 5 and 9 appear in the second row; a similar argument shows that the 9 also cannot appear in the column of the 4, i.e., the 8 appears below the 4. Since 4+8=12 and both 1 and 2 have already been used, the sum of this column cannot be 13 or 14; thus, the sum is 18.| 1 | 2 | 4 || :--- | :--- | :--- ||  |  | 8 |We can now complete the square in the following ways:| 1 | 2 | 4 | 7 | 1 | 2 | 4 |  || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || 5 | overline{9} | 8 | 22 | 9 | 5 | 8 | 22 || 7 | 3 | 6 | 16 | 3 | 7 | 6 |  |We leave it to the reader to show that when the numbers 6, 7, and 9 appear in the second row, the possibilities are:| 1 | 2 | 4 || :---: | :---: | :---: || 7 | 9 | 6 || 5 | 3 | 8 || 1 | 2 | 4 | 7 || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || 9 | 6 | 7 | 22 || 8 | 5 | 3 | 16 || 18 | 13 | 14 |  ||  |  |  |  || 1 | 2 | 4 | 7 || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || 9 | 7 | 6 | 2 || 3 | 5 | 8 |  || 16 | 16 |  |  || 13 | 14 |  |  || 1 | 2 | 4 | 7 || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || 9 | 7 | 6 | 22 || 8 | 5 | 3 | 16 || 18 | 13 | 14 |  ||  |  |  |  |Thus, there are only six squares with the sums given in the problem, up to the swapping of rows, swapping of columns, and swapping of rows with columns.## Combinatorics14 Given on cardboard - Solution## ALTERNATIVE CThe figure below identifies with the same letter the faces that will become opposite when the die is assembled.

This inequality holds true for -8 < a < 0.Combining the results from both cases, we conclude that the range of a for which the original proposition is false includes a = 0 and -8 < a < 0.

This function represents the sum of the absolute differences between ( x ) and each integer from 1 to 2014.2. To understand where ( f(x) ) is constant, we need to analyze the behavior of ( f(x) ) as ( x ) varies. The absolute value function ( |x - i| ) changes its slope at ( x = i ). Specifically, for ( x < i ), ( |x - i| = i - x ), and for ( x > i ), ( |x - i| = x - i ).3. The function ( f(x) ) will be constant on an interval if the number of terms where ( x < i ) is equal to the number of terms where ( x > i ). This balance occurs at the median of the set of integers from 1 to 2014.4. Since there are 2014 integers, the median is the average of the 1007th and 1008th integers, which are 1007 and 1008. Therefore, the median is (frac{1007 + 1008}{2} = 1007.5).5. At ( x = 1007.5 ), the function ( f(x) ) is at its minimum value because the sum of the absolute differences is minimized when ( x ) is at the median.6. To find the interval where ( f(x) ) is constant, we need to check the behavior of ( f(x) ) around ( x = 1007.5 ). For ( x ) in the interval ([1007, 1008]), the number of terms where ( x < i ) and ( x > i ) remains balanced.7.

Let s be the perpendicular intersecting point S and line BC. AC=s because s, both perpendicular radii, and AC form a rectangle. We just have to find AC in terms of r and solve for r now. From the Pythagorean theorem and subtracting to get lengths, we get AC=s=4=sqrt{(r+1)^2 - (1-r)^2} + sqrt{(r+4)^2 - (4-r)^2}, which is simply 4=sqrt{4r}+sqrt{16r} implies sqrt{r}=frac{2}{3} implies r= boxed{textbf{(D) } frac{4}{9}}.~Wezzerwez7254Video Solution[https://youtu.be/zOwYoFOUg2U](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://youtu.be/zOwYoFOUg2U)"},{"problem":"Which of the following calculations is correct?A: sqrt{20}=2sqrt{10}B: sqrt{2} times sqrt{3}=sqrt{6}C: sqrt{4}-sqrt{2}=sqrt{2}D: sqrt{(-3)^2}=-3","solution":"To evaluate each option step by step:Option A:[sqrt{20} = sqrt{4 times 5} = sqrt{4} cdot sqrt{5} = 2sqrt{5}]Thus, option A is incorrect because sqrt{20} neq 2sqrt{10}.Option B:[sqrt{2} times sqrt{3} = sqrt{2 times 3} = sqrt{6}]This calculation is correct, so option B could be the correct answer.Option C:[sqrt{4} - sqrt{2} = 2 - sqrt{2}]Therefore, option C is incorrect because sqrt{4} - sqrt{2} neq sqrt{2}.Option D:[sqrt{(-3)^2} = sqrt{9} = 3]Thus, option D is incorrect because sqrt{(-3)^2} neq -3.Given the evaluations above, the correct option is:[boxed{B}]"},{"problem":"1.

Identify the Line and Circle Equations: The given line is l: kx - y + 2 = 0 and the circle is C: x^{2} + y^{2} - 4x - 12 = 0.2. Express the Circle in Standard Form: We complete the square for the circle equation to get it into the standard form. This is done as follows:   [   x^{2} - 4x + y^{2} = 12 implies (x - 2)^{2} + y^{2} = 16.   ]   This shows that the circle has a center at (2, 0) and a radius of 4.3. Point P on Line l: The line l passes through the point P(0, 2). This is evident by substituting x = 0 into the line equation, yielding -y + 2 = 0 implies y = 2.4. Position of Point P Relative to Circle C: Since the circle's equation in standard form is (x - 2)^{2} + y^{2} = 16, and substituting P(0, 2) into this equation gives (0 - 2)^{2} + 2^{2} = 8 < 16, it is clear that P lies inside the circle.5. Area of Triangle QRC: The area of triangle QRC can be expressed as frac{1}{2} |QC| cdot |RC| sin angle QCR. Given that |QC| = |RC| = 4 (the diameter of the circle), the area simplifies to 8 sin angle QCR.6. Maximizing the Area: The maximum value of sin angle QCR is 1, which occurs when angle QCR = frac{pi}{2} (or 90^circ). This implies that the maximum area of triangle QRC is 8 sin frac{pi}{2} = 8.7.

Then I rounded both of them to the tens. Determine which numbers I had, if you know that:- the ratio of the rounded numbers is the same as the ratio of the original numbers,- the product of the rounded numbers is 295 greater than the product of the original numbers,- the sum of the rounded numbers is 6 greater than the sum of the original numbers.(L. Simünek)","solution":"A natural number is rounded to the tens by adding a suitable integer from -4 to 5. According to the third condition in the problem, the sum of two rounded numbers is 6 greater than the sum of the original numbers. Therefore, both original numbers increase during rounding and must satisfy one of the following assumptions:a) One ends in the digit 5, the other in the digit 9. (If we denote them as p, q, rounding to the tens gives p+5, q+1.)b) One ends in the digit 6, the other in the digit 8. (If we denote them as r, s, rounding to the tens gives r+4, s+2.)c) One ends in the digit 7, the other in the digit 7. (If we denote them as t, u, rounding to the tens gives t+3, u+3.)According to the second condition in the problem, the product of the rounded numbers is 295 greater than the product of the original numbers. Since the product of the rounded numbers must end in the digit 0, it follows from this condition that the product of the original numbers ends in the digit 5. The product of the numbers according to assumption a) indeed ends in the digit 5, because 5 cdot 9=45. However, the product of the numbers according to assumption b) ends in the digit 8, because 6 cdot 8=48, and the product of the numbers according to assumption c) ends in the digit 9, because 7 cdot 7=49. We will therefore proceed only with assumption a), as it is the only one that can lead to the correct result. According to the first and second conditions in the problem, we arrive at a system of two equations:begin{aligned}& frac{p+5}{q+1}=frac{p}{q} & (p+5)(q+1)=p q+295end{aligned}By manipulating the first equation, we obtain the relationship p=5 q. Using this relationship, we solve the second equation:begin{aligned}p q+p+5 q+5 & =p q+295 p+5 q & =290 5 q+5 q & =290 q & =29end{aligned}By substitution:p=5 cdot 29=145 .The resulting numbers p and q have the digits in the units place as we determined in our assumption. The problem has a unique solution: the sought numbers are 29 and 145.Another solution. By the same method, we arrive at the establishment of assumptions a), b), c). Instead of discussing the digit in the units place of the product of the original numbers, we set up a separate equation for each assumption according to the second condition in the problem:a) (p+5)(q+1)=p q+295, after rearrangement p+5 q+5=295,b) (r+4)(s+2)=r s+295, after rearrangement 2 r+4 s+8=295,c) (t+3)(u+3)=t u+295, after rearrangement 3 t+3 u+9=295.We see that the rearranged equation b) cannot have a solution in the set of integers; substituting any integers on the left side results in an even sum, which contradicts the number 295 on the right. Similarly, the rearranged equation c) cannot have a solution in the set of integers, because substituting any integers on the left side of the equation results in a sum divisible by three, which contradicts the number 295 on the right. Only equation a) can have a solution in the set of integers, and we arrive at it using the relationship p=5 q as described above.Yet another solution. As in the previous solutions, we first conclude that one of the original numbers has the digit 9 in the units place, and the other has the digit 5. The first can be written as 10 a+9, and after rounding to the tens, we get 10 a+9+1, i.e., 10(a+1). The second can be written as 10 b+5, and after rounding to the tens, we get 10 b+5+5, i.e., 10(b+1). The numbers a, b are natural numbers or zero (the problem does not state that no number can be a single-digit number).

A point P is chosen randomly inside the triangle with sides 13,20 , and 21 . Find the probability that the circle centered at P with radius 1 will intersect at least one of the sides of the triangle.","solution":"2. A point P is chosen randomly inside the triangle with sides 13,20 , and 21 . Find the probability that the circle centered at P with radius 1 will intersect at least one of the sides of the triangle.Answer: 75 / 196Solution 1: Let A B C be a triangle with sides B C=13, C A=20 and A B=21 and let S be the set of points P such that the circle omega with radius 1 centered at P intersects at least one of the sides of A B C. For a fixed side of A B C (say ell ), omega intersects ell if and only if P lies within one unit from ell. This suggests we construct a triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} such that A_{1} B_{1}left|A B, B_{1} C_{1}right| B C, C_{1} A_{1} | C A and the corresponding parallel sides of A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} and A B C have distance 1. Thus, the set S of such points P forms a region mathcal{R} outside A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} but inside A B C and the probability is then the ratio of the areas of mathcal{R} and A B C.Observe that A B C and A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} are similar and hence the ratio of their corresponding sides is constant, say k>0. Also, triangle A B C is divided into four regions: the triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} and three trapezoids A_{1} B_{1} B A, B_{1} C_{1} C B and C_{1} A_{1} A C. The region mathcal{R} then comprises these trapezoids. We use [mathcal{P}] to denote the area of region mathcal{P}. Using Heron's formula with semiperimeter s=27, we see that [A B C]=sqrt{27(27-13)(27-20)(27-21)}=126. As A B C and A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} are similar, left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}right]:[A B C]=k^{2} and with B_{1} C_{1}=13 k, C_{1} A_{1}=20 k, A_{1} B_{1}=21 k, we obtainbegin{aligned}{[A B C] } & =left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}right]+left[A_{1} B_{1} B Aright]+left[B_{1} C_{1} C Bright]+left[C_{1} A_{1} A Cright] 126 & =126 k^{2}+frac{1}{2}(21 k+21)+frac{1}{2}(20 k+20)+frac{1}{2}(13 k+13) & =126 k^{2}+27 k+27end{aligned}so 126 k^{2}+27 k-99=9(k+1)(14 k-11)=0 and k=frac{11}{14}. Therefore, the probability isfrac{[mathcal{R}]}{[A B C]}=1-frac{left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}right]}{[A B C]}=1-k^{2}=1-frac{121}{196}=frac{75}{196} text {. }Solution 2: The additional points in the figure below (not drawn to scale) are precisely what they appear to be.We can determine the proportionality constant k between triangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} and triangle A B C by determining A_{1} B_{1}=A_{2} B_{2}=21-A A_{2}-B B_{2}. Since triangle A A_{1} A_{2} and triangle A A_{1} A_{3} are congruent right triangles, then A A_{1} bisects angle A. Let alpha=angle A_{1} A A_{2}. Then tan alpha=frac{A_{1} A_{2}}{A A_{2}}=frac{1}{A A_{2}} so A A_{2}=cot alpha.From Heron's Formula, [A B C]=126. Since 126=frac{1}{2}(21)(C D), then C D=12. By the Pythagorean Theorem, A D=16 and B D=5.Let the bisector of angle A meet the altitude C D at E. Thus frac{D E}{C E}=frac{A D}{A C}=frac{16}{20}=frac{4}{5}. Since C E+D E= 12 , then D E=frac{16}{3}. This implies tan alpha=frac{D E}{A D}=frac{16 / 3}{16}=frac{1}{3}, and so A A_{2}=cot alpha=3.Similarly, B B_{1} bisects angle B. If beta=angle B_{1} B B_{2}, then B B_{2}=cot beta. Extend B B_{1} to meet C D at F. Since frac{D F}{C F}=frac{B D}{B C}=frac{5}{13} and C F+D F=12, then D F=frac{10}{3}. This implies tan beta=frac{D F}{B D}=frac{10 / 3}{5}=frac{2}{3}, and so B B_{2}=cot beta=1.5.Finally, A_{2} B_{2}=21-3-1.5=16.5. Thus, k=frac{A_{1} B_{1}}{A B}=frac{16.5}{21}=frac{11}{14}, and sofrac{[A B C]-left[A_{1} B_{1} C_{1}right]}{[A B C]}=frac{[A B C]-k^{2}[A B C]}{[A B C]}=1-k^{2}=frac{75}{196}"},{"problem":"A sphere of unit radius can be inscribed in a tetrahedron.

The plane tangent to the tetrahedron and parallel to the face BCD cuts off the tetrahedron AB_1C_1D_1. (See the figure.) Let the radius of the sphere inscribed in this tetrahedron be denoted by r_A, and the height from vertex A of the tetrahedron ABCD be denoted by m_A. The tetrahedra AB_1C_1D_1 and ABCD are similar, so frac{r_A}{1} = frac{m_A - 2}{m_A} = 1 - frac{2}{m_A}.

Calculating similarly for the other heights:[frac{1}{m_A} + frac{1}{m_B} + frac{1}{m_C} + frac{1}{m_D} = frac{t_A + t_B + t_C + t_D}{3V} = frac{A}{3V}]The volume of the tetrahedron can also be expressed using the radius of the inscribed sphere, V = frac{A cdot r}{3}, from which (considering that r=1) A = 3V. Therefore, the right-hand side of (2) is: frac{A}{3V} = frac{3V}{3V} = 1, and thus from (1) r_A + r_B + r_C + r_D = 4 - 2 = 2.Remark.

Since each girl is followed by at least two boys, we can correspond each girl along with the two boys immediately following her to a black ball, and the remaining 9 boys each to a white ball. When only the differences between boys and girls are considered, and not the differences between girls and girls, or boys and boys, this correspondence is a one-to-one mapping, and the correspondence between the resulting arrangements is also a one-to-one mapping. Thus, the problem is reduced to calculating the number of all arrangements of 8 black balls and 9 white balls where the first ball is a black ball. Clearly, there are C_{16}^{7} different arrangements in this case.For each arrangement of black and white balls, each black ball corresponds to a group of three people, where the first is a girl and the next two are boys. Arranging the 7 girls other than A into the last 7 groups of three, there are 7! ways to do this; arranging the 25 boys into 25 positions, there are 25! different ways.

Therefore, if R is on the angle bisector of angle BRC, then:   [   frac{AR}{CR} = frac{AB}{BC}   ]4. Cyclic Quadrilateral: Since angle BRP = angle PRC, quadrilateral PCQR is cyclic. This is because opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180^circ:   [   angle PRC + angle PQC = 180^circ   ]5.

Upper Bound Analysis:   - To find an upper bound for ( f(n) ), consider the maximum possible size of an ( n )-mino.   - An ( n )-mino can be arranged in a grid of size ( sqrt{n} times sqrt{n} ).   - For ( n = 1384 ), the grid size is approximately ( sqrt{1384} approx 37.2 ).   - Thus, an ( f(n) )-mino must be able to contain a grid of size ( 37.2 times 37.2 ).   - However, since ( f(n) ) must contain all possible ( n )-minos, it must be much larger.   - The upper bound ( 960000 ) is reasonable given the exponential growth of distinct ( n )-minos.5. Conclusion:   - The bounds ( 10000 leq f(1384) leq 960000 ) are reasonable based on the analysis of the number of distinct ( n )-minos and the size of the grid required to contain them.The final answer is ( boxed{ 10000 leq f(1384) leq 960000 } )."},{"problem":"11.1.

Let's express the quadratic function in vertex form, which is y=a(x-h)^2+k, where (h,k) is the vertex. Substituting h=-1 and k=-2, we get:y=a(x+1)^2-2To find a, we use the fact that the graph passes through point (2,0):begin{align*}0 &= a(2+1)^2-2 0 &= 9a-2 9a &= 2 a &= frac{2}{9}end{align*}Substituting a=frac{2}{9} into the equation y=a(x+1)^2-2, we obtain the quadratic function:begin{align*}y &= frac{2}{9}(x+1)^2-2 &= frac{2}{9}x^2 + frac{4}{9}x - frac{16}{9}end{align*}Therefore, the expression of this quadratic function is:boxed{y=frac{2}{9}x^2 + frac{4}{9}x - frac{16}{9}}"},{"problem":"(2013•Hubei) During a parachuting training session, two trainees, A and B, each make one jump.

How many noncongruent triangles are there with one side of length 20 , one side of length 17 , and one 60^{circ} angle?","solution":"Answer: squareThere are 3 possible vertices that can have an angle of 60^{circ}, we will name them. Call the vertex where the sides of length 20 and 17 meet alpha, denote the vertex where 17 doesn't meet 20 by beta, and the final vertex, which meets 20 but not 17 , we denote by gamma.The law of cosines states that if we have a triangle, then we have the equation c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2 a b cos C where C is the angle between a and b. But cos 60^{circ}=frac{1}{2} so this becomes c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-a b. We then try satisfying this equation for the 3 possible vertices and find that, for alpha the equation reads c^{2}=400+289-340=349 so that c=sqrt{349}. For beta we find that 400=289+b^{2}-17 b or rather b^{2}-17 b-111=0 this is a quadratic, solving we find that it has two roots b=frac{17 pm sqrt{289+444}}{2}, but since sqrt{733}>17 only one of these roots is positive. We can also see that this isn't congruent to the other triangle we had, as for both the triangles the shortest side has length 17 , and so if they were congruent the lengths of all sides would need to be equal, but 18frac{17+23}{2}=20 and so the triangles aren't congruent. If we try applying the law of cosines to gamma however, we get the equation 289=a^{2}+400-20 a which we can rewrite as a^{2}-20 a+111=0 which has no real solutions, as the discriminant 400-4 * 111=-44 is negative.

Understanding the Problem:   - We are given ( N ) discs in the plane.   - Every pair of discs intersects.   - We need to find a point that lies in the intersection of at least ( cN + O(1) ) discs, where ( c ) is the largest possible constant.2. Initial Considerations:   - If all the discs lie within a distance ( D ) of the first center, their areas are contained within a region of size ((D+1)^2 pi).   - We need to find a point that lies in the intersection of a significant fraction of these discs.3. Bounding the Region:   - Suppose all discs lie within a distance ( D ) of the first center.   - The area containing all the discs is ((D+1)^2 pi).   - If there is no point that lies in the intersection of at least ( frac{1}{(D+1)^2} ) of the discs, then we need to consider the arrangement of the discs.4. Pairwise Distance Consideration:   - If there is a pair of discs with centers at least ( D ) apart, this restricts the region in which all other discs must lie to intersect both of them.   - This further restricts the possible region where the common intersection point can be found.5. Optimizing ( D ):   - We need to find the optimal ( D ) that maximizes the bound on ( c ).   - By adjusting ( D ), we can determine the best possible bound for ( c ).6.

This simplifies to 5=2^{m-k-1}+2^{l-k-1}. Solving this equation yields m=k+1 and l=k+3.   (ii) If 2a_m=5a_k+a_l, then 2cdot 2^m=5cdot 2^k+2^l, which simplifies to 2^{m+1-k}-2^{l-k}=5. The left side is an even number, so this equation has no solution.   (iii) If 2a_l=5a_k+a_m, this case is also impossible by similar reasoning.   Combining (i), (ii), and (iii), we conclude that m=k+1 and l=k+3.   (Sufficiency) Suppose that m=k+1 and l=k+3. Then the three terms 5a_k, a_m, and a_l are 5a_k, a_{k+1}, and a_{k+3}, which equals 5a_k, 2a_k, and 8a_k. Reordering these terms, we obtain 2a_k, 5a_k, and 8a_k, which form an arithmetic sequence.   Thus, the condition \\"m=k+1 and l=k+3\\" is both necessary and sufficient.3. From a_1b_n+a_2b_{n-1}+a_3b_{n-2}+...+a_nb_1=3cdot 2^{n+1}-4n-6, we have 2^1b_n+2^2b_{n-1}+2^3b_{n-2}+...+2^nb_1=3cdot 2^{n+1}-4n-6.   When ngeq 2, we also have 2^1b_{n-1}+2^2b_{n-2}+2^3b_{n-3}+...+2^{n-1}b_1=3cdot 2^n-4n-2.   Multiplying both sides of this equation by 2 gives 2^2b_{n-1}+2^3b_{n-2}+2^4b_{n-3}+...+2^nb_1=3cdot 2^{n+1}-8n-4.   Subtracting these two equations, we get 2b_n=4n-2, which implies b_n=2n-1 for ngeq 2.   When n=1, we have 2b_1=3cdot 2^2-10=2, so b_1=1, which also agrees with the formula b_n=2n-1 for ngeq 2.   Therefore, b_n=2n-1, and frac{b_n}{a_n}=frac{2n-1}{2^n}.   Note that frac{b_n}{a_n}-frac{b_{n-1}}{a_{n-1}}=frac{2n-1}{2^n}-frac{2n-3}{2^{n-1}}=frac{5-2n}{2^n}.   When n=2, we have frac{b_2}{a_2}>frac{b_1}{a_1}.   When ngeq 3, frac{b_n}{a_n}-frac{b_{n-1}}{a_{n-1}}<0, so the sequence {frac{b_n}{a_n}} is strictly decreasing.   Since frac{b_1}{a_1}=frac{1}{2}, frac{b_2}{a_2}=frac{3}{4}, frac{b_3}{a_3}=frac{5}{8}, and frac{b_4}{a_4}=frac{7}{16}, we have boxed{frac{7}{16}<lambdaleqfrac{1}{2}}."},{"problem":"28 cdot 34 integers a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}, a_{5}, a_{6}, a_{7} satisfyfrac{5}{7}=frac{a_{2}}{2!}+frac{a_{3}}{3!}+frac{a_{4}}{4!}+frac{a_{5}}{5!}+frac{a_{6}}{6!}+frac{a_{7}}{7!}For i=2,3, cdots, 7, here 0 leqslant a_{i}<i.

We start with the given equation:   [   2011^{2011^{2012}} = x^x   ]   We need to find a positive integer ( x ) that satisfies this equation.2. Since ( 2011 ) is a prime number, ( x ) must be a power of ( 2011 ). Let ( x = 2011^a ) for some integer ( a ).3. Substituting ( x = 2011^a ) into the equation, we get:   [   2011^{2011^{2012}} = (2011^a)^{2011^a}   ]4. Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:   [   (2011^a)^{2011^a} = 2011^{a cdot 2011^a}   ]5. Equating the exponents of ( 2011 ) on both sides, we get:   [   2011^{2012} = a cdot 2011^a   ]6. To solve for ( a ), we observe that the exponents must match. Therefore, we set:   [   a cdot 2011^a = 2011^{2012}   ]7. Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:   [   a cdot 2011^a = 2011^{2012}   ]8.

Let A contain f_{k} k-element subsets as elements, where f_{k}(k=1,2, cdots, n) are non-negative integers.

Solve the equationdleft(n^{3}right)=n","solution":"Solution. For n=1, it is clearly a solution, since dleft(1^{3}right)=d(1)=1.For n neq 1, let the prime factorization of n be n=p_{1}^{alpha_{1}} p_{2}^{alpha_{2}} ldots p_{k}^{alpha_{k}}, where each alpha_{i}>0 and p_{1}<p_{2}<ldots<p_{k}. We need to show that:n = dleft(n^{3}right) = prod_{i=1}^{k} left(3 alpha_{i} + 1right)We start by considering the inequality:1 leq frac{3 alpha_{j} + 1}{p_{j}^{alpha_{j}}}For p_{j} neq 2, we have:begin{aligned}1 & leq frac{3 alpha + 1}{5^{alpha+1}} 5(3 alpha + 1) & > 3 alpha + 4 12 alpha + 1 & > 0end{aligned}This shows that for p_{j} neq 2, the inequality 1 leq frac{3 alpha_{j} + 1}{p_{j}^{alpha_{j}}} cannot hold. Therefore, the prime factorization of n must include the prime number 2, with the exponent alpha_{1} satisfying:1 leq frac{3 alpha_{1} + 1}{2^{alpha_{1}}}This inequality holds for alpha_{1}=1, 2, 3, but not for alpha_{1}=4. Since the sequence frac{3 alpha + 1}{2^{alpha}} is strictly decreasing for positive alpha (as shown by the above sequence frac{3 alpha + 1}{5^{alpha}}), it does not hold for alpha_{1} > 4. Therefore, we have:n = 2 cdot p_{2}^{alpha_{2}} ldots p_{k}^{alpha_{k}} text{ or } n = 2^{2} cdot p_{2}^{alpha_{2}} ldots p_{k}^{alpha_{k}} text{ or } n = 2^{3} cdot p_{2}^{alpha_{2}} ldots p_{k}^{alpha_{k}}a) For n = 2 cdot p_{2}^{alpha_{2}} ldots p_{k}^{alpha_{k}}:n = dleft(n^{3}right) = 4 cdot (3 alpha_{2} + 1) ldots (3 alpha_{k} + 1)This implies that n is divisible by 4. However, this case is not possible because the prime factorization of n includes 2 only to the first power.b) For n = 2^{2} cdot p_{2}^{alpha_{2}} ldots p_{k}^{alpha_{k}}:n = dleft(n^{3}right) = 7 cdot (3 alpha_{2} + 1) ldots (3 alpha_{k} + 1)This implies that the prime factorization of n includes the prime number 7. If 7 appears to the first power and n has no other prime factors, then n = 2^{2} cdot 7 = 28, and dleft(n^{3}right) = (3 cdot 2 + 1)(3 cdot 1 + 1) = 28, which is a solution. If 7 appears to a power greater than 1 or if n has other prime factors, the equality (1) cannot hold because the left-hand side expression would definitely decrease, making it less than 1 (if 7 appears to a higher power, because the sequence p_{i}(alpha) = frac{3 alpha + 1}{p_{i}^{alpha}} is strictly decreasing, and if n has other prime factors, because frac{3 alpha_{i} + 1}{p_{i}^{alpha_{i}}} < 1 if p_{i} neq 2).

The solution n = 2^{3} cdot 5 = 40 satisfies the condition, and there are no other solutions in this case (for the same reason as in the previous part, the left-hand side expression would decrease, making it less than 1).Thus, we have shown that the solutions to the problem are n = 1, n = 28, and n = 40."},{"problem":"A machine is programmed to output a sequence of positive integers a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, ldots It outputs the integers independently, one at a time, and at each step the probability that it outputs the integer k is equal to frac{1}{2^{k}}.

Inductive Hypothesis:   Assume that for some ( n geq 0 ), ( A_n = {1, 2, ldots, m} ) for some integer ( m ), and ( |A_n| = m ).3. Inductive Step:   We need to show that ( A_{n+1} ) is of the form ( {1, 2, ldots, 2m-1} ) and that ( |A_{n+1}| = 2m - 1 ).   - By the problem's construction, ( A_{n+1} ) is formed by adding to ( A_n ) all natural numbers that can be represented as the sum of two different numbers from ( A_n ).   - Since ( A_n = {1, 2, ldots, m} ), the smallest sum of two different elements is ( 1 + 2 = 3 ) and the largest sum is ( (m-1) + m = 2m - 1 ).   - Therefore, ( A_{n+1} = A_n cup {m+1, m+2, ldots, 2m-1} ).4. Verification:   - We need to verify that ( A_{n+1} = {1, 2, ldots, 2m-1} ).   - Since ( A_n = {1, 2, ldots, m} ), and we are adding all sums of two different elements from ( A_n ), we get all numbers from ( m+1 ) to ( 2m-1 ).   - Thus, ( A_{n+1} = {1, 2, ldots, 2m-1} ).5. Recurrence Relation:   - From the above, we see that ( |A_{n+1}| = 2m - 1 ).   - Since ( |A_n| = m ), we have ( |A_{n+1}| = 2|A_n| - 1 ).6. Solving the Recurrence:   - We start with ( |A_0| = 2 ).   - Using the recurrence relation ( |A_{n+1}| = 2|A_n| - 1 ), we can solve for ( |A_n| ).   Let's denote ( a_n = |A_n| ):   [   a_{n+1} = 2a_n - 1   ]   - For ( n = 0 ), ( a_0 = 2 ).   - For ( n = 1 ), ( a_1 = 2a_0 - 1 = 2 cdot 2 - 1 = 3 ).   - For ( n = 2 ), ( a_2 = 2a_1 - 1 = 2 cdot 3 - 1 = 5 ).   - For ( n = 3 ), ( a_3 = 2a_2 - 1 = 2 cdot 5 - 1 = 9 ).   We observe that ( a_n = 2^n + 1 ).   To prove this by induction:   - Base Case: For ( n = 0 ), ( a_0 = 2 = 2^0 + 1 ).   - Inductive Step: Assume ( a_k = 2^k + 1 ) for some ( k geq 0 ).

What is the minimal number of squares we must draw in order to colour all the lines of the grid?","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to cover all the lines of a 25 times 25 grid using the minimum number of squares. Each square can be of any size, but it must be aligned with the grid lines.2. Initial Solution with 48 Squares:   The solution suggests that it can be done with 48 squares. To understand this, consider the following:   - Each square has 4 sides.   - We need to cover all the horizontal and vertical lines inside the grid.   - There are 24 inner horizontal lines and 24 inner vertical lines (since the grid is 25 times 25).3. Covering the Lines:   - Each inner line (horizontal or vertical) must be covered by at least one square.   - Since a square has 4 sides, and each side can cover a line, we need to ensure that all 48 inner lines (24 horizontal + 24 vertical) are covered.4. Minimum Number of Squares:   - If we use a square to cover a line, it can cover at most 2 inner lines (one horizontal and one vertical).   - Therefore, to cover 48 inner lines, we need at least frac{48}{2} = 24 squares.   - However, each square also covers the outer boundary lines, which adds additional constraints.5. Verification of 48 Squares:   - The solution suggests that 48 squares are needed because each square can cover 2 inner lines, and we have 48 inner lines to cover.   - This means we need at least 48 squares to ensure all lines are covered.6. Checking if 47 Squares are Sufficient:   - If we try to use 47 squares, we would have frac{47 times 2}{2} = 47 lines covered.   - Since we have 48 inner lines, 47 squares are not sufficient to cover all the lines.7. Conclusion:   - Therefore, the minimum number of squares required to cover all the lines of the 25 times 25 grid is 48.The final answer is boxed{48}"},{"problem":"8.

The condition that for any three airports, some two are not connected by a direct flight implies that the graph does not contain a triangle (a cycle of length 3).3. Using Turán's Theorem:   Turán's Theorem states that for a graph ( G ) with ( n ) vertices that does not contain a ( (k+1) )-clique, the maximum number of edges is given by:   [   |E| leq left(1 - frac{1}{k}right) frac{n^2}{2}   ]   For our problem, ( k = 2 ) because we are avoiding triangles (3-cliques).

This is 1 possibility.We would pay 5500 forints if we bought 2 items for 2000 forints and 1 item for 1500 forints. We could do this in three ways: either in the first, second, or third store. This adds up to 3 new possibilities.We pay 5000 forints when we choose a 1000 forint item along with 2 items for 2000 forints. Similarly to the previous case, this gives us 3 more possibilities. We also pay 5000 forints when we choose a 2000 forint item along with 2 items for 1500 forints. This also gives us 3 possibilities.With this, we have listed all the unfavorable cases.

Contradiction: Since ( f'(a) - 1 > 0 ), for sufficiently large ( x ), ( g(x) > 0 ). This implies ( f(x) > x ), which contradicts the given condition ( f(x) leq x ) for all ( x geq 0 ).Thus, our assumption is false, and we conclude that ( f'(x) leq 1 ) for all ( x geq 0 ). Part (b)1.

From the parallelism of lines MK and AC, it follows that triangles MKE and AEC are similar, and since the similarity coefficient is 0.5, the area of triangle AEC is 4 times the area of triangle MKE.Now: S_{AEC D} = S_{AEC} + S_{ACD} = 4 S_{MKE} + 4 S_{MBK} = 4 (S_{MKE} + S_{MBK}) = 4 S_{MBKE}.2nd method.

Then the area of triangle AEC is frac{1}{2} AC left(frac{1}{3} hright) = frac{1}{3} left(frac{1}{2} AC hright) = frac{1}{3} S_{ABC} = frac{1}{3} left(frac{1}{2} Sright) = frac{1}{6} S. Therefore, for the area of quadrilateral AEC D, which is the sum of the areas of triangles AEC and ACD, we get: frac{1}{2} S + frac{1}{6} S = frac{2}{3} S.Furthermore, since MK is the midline of triangle ABC, the area of triangle MKE is frac{1}{2} MK cdot left(frac{1}{2} h - frac{1}{3} hright) = frac{1}{2} left(frac{1}{2} ACright) left(frac{1}{6} hright) = frac{1}{12} left(frac{1}{2} AC hright) = frac{1}{12} S_{ACD} = frac{1}{24} S.

First, let's expand and simplify the given expression for profit:begin{align*}y &= (m-8)(900-15m) &= 900m - 15m^2 - 7200 + 120m &= -15m^2 + 1020m - 7200.end{align*}To find the maximum profit, we need to rewrite this quadratic equation in vertex form, which is given by y = a(x-h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola, and a is the coefficient of x^2. The vertex form gives us direct information about the maximum or minimum point of the parabola, depending on the sign of a. Since a = -15 in our case, the parabola opens downwards, indicating that the vertex represents the maximum point.Rewriting the equation in vertex form:begin{align*}y &= -15m^2 + 1020m - 7200 &= -15(m^2 - 68m + 480) &= -15[(m^2 - 68m + 34^2) - 34^2 + 480] &= -15[(m - 34)^2 - 1156 + 480] &= -15(m - 34)^2 + 10140.end{align*}From this form, we can directly see that the maximum profit is achieved when m = 34, and the maximum profit itself is 10140 yuan.

Solution: If one of the sides of the rectangle is even, a rectangle of half the area can be cut from it along the midline. Therefore, it is sufficient to consider the case where both sides are odd.

If |b-a|=0, then a=b=2n+1, half the area of the rectangle is 2n^2+2n+0.5, and we can cut from it a rectangle of almost this area, 2n times (n+1), with an area of 2n(n+1), and when a=1 - the square 1 times 1 with an area almost equal to 1/2.

Step 1: Establishing the relationship between (a_n) and (a_{n+2022})   Given the sequence ({a_n}) of positive integers, we know that for (i geq 2022), (a_i) is the smallest positive integer (x) such that (x + sum_{k=i-2021}^{i-1} a_k) is a perfect square.    Let (S = sum_{i=n+1}^{n+2021} a_i). By the given condition, (a_{n+2022}) is the minimal positive integer such that (S + a_{n+2022}) is a perfect square. Since (sum_{i=n}^{n+2021} a_i) is also a perfect square, (a_n + S) is a perfect square. Therefore, we have:   [   a_n geq a_{n+2022}   ]2. Step 2: Finding an integer (N) such that (sum_{i=n}^{n+2021} a_i) is constant for all (n geq N)   For an arbitrary integer (0 leq r < 2022), consider the sequence ((a_{2022q+r})). This sequence is monotone decreasing because (a_n geq a_{n+2022}). Since all terms are positive integers, there exists an integer (q_r) such that (a_{2022q+r}) is constant (denote this constant as (c_r)) for all (q geq q_r).    Hence, we can pick an integer (N) such that (a_n = a_{n+2022}) for all (n geq N). This implies that (sum_{i=n}^{n+2021} a_i) is constant for all (n geq N).3. Step 3: Determining the constant value   Denote the constant value by (z^2), and let (M = 2022N). For an arbitrary integer (0 leq r < 2022), (a_{M+r} = c_r). By the first condition, (a_{M+r}) is the smallest positive integer (x) such that (x + sum_{i=M+r-2021}^{M+r-1} a_i) is a perfect square.    If (c_r > 2z - 1), then since (sum_{i=M+r-2021}^{M+r-1} a_i = z^2 - c_r < z^2 - 2z + 1 = (z-1)^2), the value (x = (z-1)^2 - (z^2 - c_r)) can also be a solution, which is smaller than (a_{M+r}), leading to a contradiction. Thus, all (c_r leq 2z - 1).   By the second condition, there exist infinitely many positive integers (n) such that (a_n = 4 times 2022 - 3).

Since 3 mid 2001, we have f_{2001}(x)=x, and thus f_{2001}(2002)=2002.Remarks. 1. From the solution, it also follows that[f_{n}(x)=left{begin{array}{c}x -frac{2 x+7}{x+3}=f_{1}(x) -frac{3 x+7}{x+2}=f_{2}(x)end{array}right.]depending on whether n modulo 3 is 0, 1, or 2.2. In the solution, we treated the domain of the functions rather superficially. f_{1}(x) is undefined precisely when x=-3. As a composite function, f_{1}left(f_{1}(x)right) is defined if the inner function is defined, i.e., x neq -3, and if f_{1}(x) can be substituted, i.e., f_{1}(x) neq -3, which means x neq -2. The denominator of the fraction form of f_{2} excludes exactly this value.f_{3}(x)=f_{1}left(f_{2}(x)right) is defined if f_{2}(x) is defined, i.e., x neq -3 and x neq -2, and if f_{2}(x) can be substituted into f_{1}(x), i.e., -frac{3 x+7}{x+2} neq -3. Fortunately, this does not impose any new restrictions, as f_{2}(x) does not take the value -3. The precise statement is: if x neq -2 and x neq -3, then f_{3}(x)=x, and at these two points, f_{3}(x) is undefined. This means that if n>3, the domain of f_{n}(x) does not shrink further, so it is justified to substitute 2002 into f_{2001}.3. The key to the solution was that after three substitutions, we obtained the identity function x mapsto x (on the domain). This clearly depends on the given coefficients, and it is not obvious at first glance how this happens. The question arises whether we can arrive at this insight only through patient trial and error as a \\"reward.\\"## The graph of f_{1}(x)Reconsidering the above domain analysis, we can conjecture and even visually verify the found property without the necessary calculations in the solution.We saw that in addition to the obvious exclusion of -3, we must also exclude -2, which is f_{1}^{-1}(-3). The crucial observation is that we do not need to exclude any more values, since f_{1} does not take the value -2. The graph shows that this is due to the horizontal asymptote of the curve being y=-2.The asymptotic behavior can also be intuitively described as follows: if x=-3, then the function value is \\"infinitely large,\\" and if x is \\"infinitely large,\\" then the function value is -2.If we were to write this down, we could do it as follows:[f_{1}(-3)=infty, quad f_{1}(infty)=-2]If we now add that f_{1}(-2)=-3, it is hard not to notice the[-2 xrightarrow{f_{1}}-3 xrightarrow{f_{1}} infty xrightarrow{f_{1}}-2]\\"chain\\": if we \\"introduce\\" the infty value into the real numbers and extend the function f_{1} accordingly, then this three-cycle means that f_{3}(-2)=-2, f_{3}(-3)=-3, and f_{3}(infty)=infty.From this, we can infer that f_{3}(x) will be a \\"friendly\\" function, and we can approach the calculations with greater confidence. But this experiment essentially also provides a proof if we consider that f_{3} itself is a rational first-degree function, which is uniquely determined by three substitution values. If f_{3}(x) takes the same value as the identity function x mapsto x at three points, then it is identical to it over its entire domain. Of course, we need to extend the domain and range of the identity function x mapsto x to include the infty value.4. From the above, it also follows how functions similar to f_{1} can be constructed. On the extended domain, the[f(x)=frac{a x+b}{c x+d} quad text { function has new values } quad f(infty)=frac{a}{c} quad text { and } quad fleft(-frac{d}{c}right)=infty text {. }]Thus, if we want to achieve the three-cycle f: infty rightarrow u rightarrow v rightarrow infty for any u neq v, the function[f(x)=frac{u(x-v)-(u-v)^{2}}{x-v}]is obtained.

To find f'(3), we use the symmetry property once again. Since the slope of f(x) at x = 3 must be the opposite of the slope of f(x) at x = 1 (due to symmetry about x = 2), we get f'(3) = -f'(1). Since f'(1) = e^1 = e, we then have f'(3) = -e. Therefore, f'(3) + f(3) = -e + e = 0.

We start by considering the polynomial function ( f(x) = (x-1)^4 + (x-2)^4 + cdots + (x-n)^4 ).2. To find the critical points of ( f(x) ), we first compute its first derivative:   [   f'(x) = sum_{k=1}^n 4(x-k)^3   ]3. Next, we compute the second derivative of ( f(x) ):   [   f''(x) = sum_{k=1}^n 12(x-k)^2   ]4. Since ( n ge 2 ), each term ( 12(x-k)^2 ) in the sum is non-negative and at least one term is positive. Therefore, ( f''(x) > 0 ) for all ( x ). This implies that ( f(x) ) is a strictly convex function, meaning it has a unique minimum.5. To find the minimum, we solve for ( x ) such that ( f'(x) = 0 ):   [   f'(x) = sum_{k=1}^n 4(x-k)^3 = 0   ]6. We observe that the function ( g(x) = sum_{k=1}^n (x-k)^3 ) is symmetric around ( x = frac{n+1}{2} ). This is because for each ( k ) in the sum, there is a corresponding term ( (x-(n+1-k))^3 ) that balances it out when ( x = frac{n+1}{2} ).7. Therefore, we evaluate ( f' left( frac{n+1}{2} right) ):   [   f' left( frac{n+1}{2} right) = sum_{k=1}^n 4 left( frac{n+1}{2} - k right)^3   ]8. By symmetry, the sum of the terms ( left( frac{n+1}{2} - k right)^3 ) and ( left( frac{n+1}{2} - (n+1-k) right)^3 ) will cancel out, leading to:   [   f' left( frac{n+1}{2} right) = 0   ]9. Since ( f'(x) ) is an increasing function (as ( f''(x) > 0 )), ( f(x) ) decreases for ( x < frac{n+1}{2} ) and increases for ( x > frac{n+1}{2} ). Thus, ( f(x) ) attains its minimum value at ( x = frac{n+1}{2} ).The final answer is ( boxed{ x = frac{n+1}{2} } )."},{"problem":"11.

Let a convex n-gon be cut into equal triangles by diagonals that do not intersect inside it. Then, for each of the triangles in the partition, at least one side is a side (not a diagonal) of the n-gon.Proof. Let a triangle in the partition have angles alpha leq beta leq gamma with vertices A, B, C respectively, and A C and B C are diagonals of the n-gon. At vertex C, there are at least two more angles of the triangles in the partition. If at least one of these angles is greater than alpha, then the sum of the angles at vertex C is not less than gamma+beta+alpha=pi>angle C. Contradiction. Therefore, all angles at vertex C, except angle A C B, are equal to alpha, and alpha<beta.Consider the second triangle in the partition adjacent to B C. Since it is equal to triangle A B C, the angle opposite side B C in it is equal to alpha. But the angle at vertex C in this triangle is also equal to alpha. Contradiction.Since the sum of the angles of the polygon P is pi(n-2) and they are composed of all the angles of the triangles in the partition, the number of these triangles is n-2. By the lemma, in each of these triangles, at least one side is a side of P. From this, it follows that two of the triangles in the partition have two sides that are sides of P.Let K L M be one of these triangles, with K L and L M being sides of P. A side K M is adjacent to another triangle in the partition K M N. One of its sides (for definiteness, K N) is a side of P. Since the triangles in the partition are equal, the angle NKM is equal to either the angle LKM or the angle KML. In the first case, KM is the bisector of the angle of the described polygon P and therefore contains the center I of the inscribed circle. In the second case, K N parallel L M. Then I lies on the common perpendicular to these segments and therefore is contained (by convexity) in the parallelogram K L M N, and thus in at least one of the triangles K L M, K M N.Let K' L' M' be another triangle in the partition, two sides of which are sides of P. Similarly, I is contained either in this triangle or in an adjacent triangle in the partition. If I is contained in at least one of the triangles K L M, K' L' M', then they have a common side, and then n=4. Otherwise, the triangle K M N is adjacent to both of these triangles and contains I. In this case, the side M N is common with the triangle K' L' M'; we can set M=M', N=K'. Reasoning as above, we get that L M, K N, L' M are parallel to each other.

Determine, depending on  n , the smallest possible number of gifts Aunt Reni could have received.","solution":"Let  x_i  ( i = 1,2, ldots ,n-1 ) denote the number of gifts received by the  i -th guest of Aunt Renia, and let  x_R  denote the number of gifts Aunt Renia received. Then the total number of gifts isTherefore, the number  x_R  is divisible by  12 , say  x_R = 12k , where  k  is some non-negative integer.Since each person gave at least one gift, they must have also received at least one gift. Hence, we infer that  x_i geq 1  for  i = 1,2,ldots ,n-1 , which, by the second equality (1), gives  5k geq n-1 . Since  k  is an integer, the last inequality is equivalent to the inequality  k geq [(n-1+4)/5] , where  [a]  denotes the greatest integer not greater than  a . Therefore,It remains to show that under the conditions of the problem, it is possible for Aunt Renia to receive exactly  12 [(n+3)/5]  gifts.Assume that  n - 1 = 5k - r , where  r = 0,1,2,3,4 , and  k  is some positive integer. Divide the  n-1  guests of Aunt Renia into (at most) three disjoint groups:(Since  n geq 4 , then  2k-r geq 0 .) Next, seat all the people  A_i  and  C_i  around a round table and assume that:Each person  A_i  and  C_i  gives 1 gift to the person sitting to their right;Each person  A_i  gives 2 gifts to Aunt Renia;Each person  B_i  gives 3 gifts to Aunt Renia;Each person  C_i  gives 5 gifts to Aunt Renia;Aunt Renia gives 1 gift to each person  B_i  and  C_i .In this way, each person  A_i  and  B_i  gave 3 gifts and received one, while each person  C_i  gave 6 gifts and received two. Thus, each guest of Aunt Renia gave three times as many gifts as they received. On the other hand, Aunt Renia receivedgifts, while giving  2k  gifts, which is six times less.Answer: Aunt Renia could receive at least  12[(n+3)/5]  gifts."},{"problem":"10.4.

Which number did he obtain?","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   João is calculating the product of the non-zero digits of each integer from (1) to (10^{2009}) and then summing these products. We need to find the sum of these products.2. Simplifying the Problem:   Consider the range of numbers from (0) to (10^{2009} - 1). This range includes all integers with up to (2009) digits. We need to calculate the product of the non-zero digits for each number and then sum these products.3. Handling Zero Digits:   Since the product of non-zero digits is unaffected by zeros (as zeros are excluded), we can treat each digit independently. For example, the number (105) has a product of non-zero digits (1 times 5 = 5).4. Summing the Products:   To find the sum of the products of non-zero digits for all numbers from (0) to (10^{2009} - 1), we can consider each digit position independently. Each digit can be (0, 1, 2, ldots, 9). When a digit is (0), it does not contribute to the product.5. Calculating the Contribution of Each Digit:   For each digit position, the sum of the non-zero digits is:   [   1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + 9 = frac{9 times 10}{2} = 45   ]   However, since we are considering the product of non-zero digits, we need to include (1) for each zero digit (as zeros are treated as ones in the product calculation). Thus, the effective sum for each digit position is:   [   1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + 9 = 1 + 45 = 46   ]6. Generalizing for All Digit Positions:   Since there are (2009) digit positions, and each position contributes (46) to the sum, the total sum of the products of non-zero digits for all numbers from (0) to (10^{2009} - 1) is:   [   46^{2009}   ]7. Including (10^{2009}):   The number (10^{2009}) itself has a product of non-zero digits equal to (1) (since it is (1) followed by (2009) zeros). Including this does not change the sum.8. Conclusion:   Therefore, the sum of the products of the non-zero digits of each integer from (1) to (10^{2009}) is:   [   46^{2009}   ]The final answer is (boxed{46^{2009}})."},{"problem":"Given the equation of an ellipse ( frac {x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1(a > b > 0)), (F_{1}) and (F_{2}) are its left and right foci respectively, (O) is the coordinate origin, (A) is any point on the ellipse other than the vertex, (∠AF_{1}F_{2}=30^{0}, AO=OF_{2}), the eccentricity of the ellipse (e=) ______ .","solution":"Solution: Point (A) is any point on the ellipse other than the vertex, (∠AF_{1}F_{2}=30^{0}, AO=OF_{2}),(thereforetriangle AF_{1}F_{2}) is a right triangle with (A) as the right angle, (therefore AF_{1}=2a-c), (AF_{2}=c).By the Pythagorean theorem, ((2a-c)^{2}+c^{2}=(2c)^{2} Rightarrow), (2ac+c^{2}-a^{2}=0 Rightarrow) the eccentricity (e= sqrt {3}-1).Therefore, the answer is: ( boxed{ sqrt {3}-1 }).It is easy to get that (triangle AF_{1}F_{2}) is a right triangle with (A) as the right angle, (AF_{1}=2a-c), (AF_{2}=c).

Simplifying the Expression:   - We need to simplify:     [     left(frac{sin 15^circ}{cos 7.5^circ}right)^2 = left(frac{frac{sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}{4}}{sqrt{frac{4 + sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}{8}}}right)^2     ]   - Simplifying further:     [     left(frac{sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}{4} cdot sqrt{frac{8}{4 + sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}}right)^2 = left(frac{sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}{4} cdot frac{2sqrt{2}}{sqrt{4 + sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}}right)^2     ]     [     = left(frac{(sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}) cdot 2sqrt{2}}{4 sqrt{4 + sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}}right)^2 = left(frac{(sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}) cdot sqrt{2}}{2 sqrt{4 + sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}}right)^2     ]     [     = left(frac{sqrt{12} - sqrt{4}}{2 sqrt{4 + sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}}right)^2 = left(frac{2sqrt{3} - 2}{2 sqrt{4 + sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}}right)^2     ]     [     = left(frac{sqrt{3} - 1}{sqrt{4 + sqrt{6} - sqrt{2}}}right)^2     ]6.

This effectively reduces our problem to arranging four units: the _AB_ unit, _C_, _D_, and _E_.1. First, we arrange these four units. There are 4! = 24 ways to do this because we have four units to arrange.2. However, within the _AB_ unit, _A_ and _B_ can switch places with each other, which means there are 2! = 2 ways to arrange _A_ and _B_ within this unit.3. Considering the restriction that _C_ and _D_ cannot be placed together, we need to subtract the arrangements where _C_ and _D_ are next to each other. If we treat _C_ and _D_ as a single unit (like we did with _A_ and _B_), there are 3! = 6 ways to arrange the three units (_CD_, _AB_, and _E_). Within the _CD_ unit, there are 2! = 2 ways to arrange _C_ and _D_. So, there are 6 times 2 = 12 arrangements where _C_ and _D_ are together.4. Subtracting the arrangements where _C_ and _D_ are together from the total arrangements, we get 24 - 12 = 12.5. However, the calculation in step 3 was incorrect because the problem does not ask us to subtract the cases where _C_ and _D_ are together. Instead, it only states that _C_ and _D_ cannot be placed together, which was already considered in the initial arrangement of four units.

It has already been proven that any non-multiple of elements in X_{0} are not in X_{0}, and 666+i<999(i=0,1,2, cdots, 332), so no multiple of any element in X_{0} can be 666+i(i=0,1, cdots, 332). Thus, the multiples (excluding itself) of any other elements in B_{i} are not in B_{i}, ensuring that there are no two elements in B_{i} such that x<y, x mid y. Since B_{i} (for i=0,1, cdots, 332) includes 666, 667, ..., 998, it follows that a neq 666,667, cdots, 998, thus a leqslant 665.Next, prove that 665 is achievable. Assume there exists a 999-element subset X containing 665 such that no x, y in X, x<y satisfies x mid y. Then 665 cdot 2, 665 cdot 3 notin X. Construct 997 drawers that include all elements of A except 665, 665 cdot 2, 665 cdot 3, with each element appearing once: K_{1}=left|1,1 cdot 2,1 cdot 2^{2}, cdots, 1 cdot 2^{10}right|, K_{2}=left|3,3 cdot 2,3 cdot 2^{2}, cdots, 3 cdot 2^{9}right|, K_{3}=mid 5,5 cdot 2, left.5 cdot 2^{2}, cdots, 5 cdot 2^{8}right}, K_{4}=left{7,7 cdot 2,7 cdot 2^{2}, cdots, 7 cdot 2^{8}right}, cdots, K_{332}={663,663 cdot 2,663 cdot 3}, K_{334}={667,667 cdot 2 mid, K_{335}={669,669 cdot 2}, cdots, K_{995}={1991}, K_{996}={1993}, K_{997}={1997}. Thus, the other 998 elements of X (excluding 665) are placed into these 997 drawers, meaning two elements must be in the same drawer, and elements in the same drawer are multiples of each other, leading to a contradiction.

Determine the largest such number.","solution":"## Solution.Let's write the number 12 as a product of single-digit numbers greater than 1: 12=6 cdot 2=4 cdot 3=3 cdot 2 cdot 2.Since the sum of the digits must be 12, there are three possibilities for the digits of such a number:- 6,2,1,1,1,1- 4,3,1,1,1,1,1- 3,2,2,1,1,1,1,1.A number whose sum of digits is 12 is divisible by 3. We also need to ensure that the number is divisible by 4, so we will specifically examine the last two digits of the number.In the first case, the last two digits can be 12 or 16 (numbers ending in 26 or 62 are not divisible by 4), so there are two possibilities. Of the remaining four digits, three are 1 and one is 2 or 6, so there are four possibilities for their order (the digit 2 or 6 can be placed in any of the first four decimal places). In total, there are 8 such numbers.In the second case, the only even digit is 4, so it must be the units digit. However, the two-digit endings 14 and 34 are not divisible by 4. In this case, there are no numbers that meet the given conditions.In the third case, the units digit must be 2, and the last two digits can be 12 or 32 (it cannot be 22).If the last two digits are 12, the first six decimal places need to arrange the digits 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1. The digits 3 and 2 can be arranged in 6 cdot 5=30 ways, and the remaining places are filled with 1.If the last two digits are 32, the first six places need to arrange the digits 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. This can be done in six ways.In the third case, there are 30+6=36 such numbers.Finally, there are a total of 8+36=44 such numbers. The largest such number is 32111112.Note. These numbers are:111612,116112,161112,611112,111216,112116,121116,211116,11112312,11113212,11121312,11123112,11131212,11132112,11211312,11213112,11231112,11311212,11312112,11321112,12111312,12113112,12131112,12311112,13111212,13112112, 13121112,13211112,21111312,21113112,21131112,21311112, 23111112,31111212,31112112,31121112,31211112,32111112, 21111132, 12111132,11211132,11121132,11112132 and 11111232."},{"problem":"Last month a pet store sold three times as many cats as dogs.

Let ( x ) be the number of dogs sold last month.2. According to the problem, the number of cats sold is three times the number of dogs sold. Therefore, the number of cats sold is ( 3x ).3. If the store had sold the same number of cats but eight more dogs, the number of dogs would be ( x + 8 ).4. Under this new condition, the number of cats sold would be twice the number of dogs sold.

Thus, for a_2 and a_3 we obtain: frac{a_3}{a_2} = frac{48}{12} = 4.From the property of geometric sequences, we have:a_2^2 = a_3 cdot a_1.Substitute a_2 = 12, a_3 = 48, and a_1 = 4 + a:12^2 = 48 cdot (4 + a),which simplifies to:144 = 192 + 48a.Solving for a yields:48a = 144 - 192,48a = -48,a = boxed{-1}."},{"problem":"The original proposition is \\"If z_{1} and z_{2} are conjugate complex numbers, then |z_{1}|=|z_{2}|\\".

Solution Solution by Demetres Christofides","solution":": 2 for n = 2; 9/4 for n > 2. The result for n = 2 is obvious. So assume n > 2. The expression is the sum of the squares of the sides of an n-gon inscribed in a circle radius 1/2 whose sides subtend angles 2x 1 , 2x 2 , ... , 2x n at the center. If n > 3, then this n-gon must have an angle ≥ 90 o . Suppose it is the angle at B between the sides AB and AC. Then by the cosine rule AC 2 ≥ AB 2 + BC 2 , so the expression is not reduced if we drop one of the vertices to get an (n-1)-gon. Hence the maximum is achieved by taking at least n-3 angles x i = 0. So we need only consider the case n = 3. So let ABC be a triangle with circumcenter O, centroid G and circumradius R. Take G as the origin and P as any point. Using vectors it is immediate that PA 2 + PB 2 + PC 2 = 3 GP 2 + GA 2 + GB 2 + GC 2 . Putting P = O gives 3R 2 + 3OG 2 = GA 2 + GB 2 + GC 2 . Putting P = A gives AB 2 + AC 2 = 4GA 2 + GB 2 + GC 2 . Putting P = B and P = C and adding the three equations gives: AB 2 + BC 2 + CA 2 = 3(GA 2 + GB 2 + GC 2 ). Hence AB 2 + BC 2 + CA 2 = 9R 2 - 9 OG 2 ≤ 9R 2 = 9/4 for R = 1/2.

Constructing the Sequence: Given the symmetry and the conditions, we can start by assuming a pattern and verifying it. Let’s assume the sequence is of the form:   [   (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, h, g, f, e, d, c, b, a)   ]5. Using the Conditions: We need to find values for (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h) such that the conditions are satisfied.

Verification:   - Check the sum of any 7 consecutive terms:     [     5 + 5 - 13 + 5 + 5 + 5 - 13 = -1     ]     This holds true for any 7 consecutive terms in the sequence.   - Check the sum of any 11 consecutive terms:     [     5 + 5 - 13 + 5 + 5 + 5 - 13 + 5 + 5 + 5 - 13 = 1     ]     This also holds true for any 11 consecutive terms in the sequence.Since both conditions are satisfied, the sequence ( (5, 5, -13, 5, 5, 5, -13, 5, 5, -13, 5, 5, 5, -13, 5, 5) ) is a valid solution.The final answer is ( boxed{ (5, 5, -13, 5, 5, 5, -13, 5, 5, -13, 5, 5, 5, -13, 5, 5) } )"},{"problem":"Given a sequence {a_{n}} that satisfies a_{n}=2a_{n-1} for ngeqslant 2 and nin N^{*}, with a_{1}=1, find a_{n}=______.","solution":"Given the sequence {a_{n}} that satisfies a_{n}=2a_{n-1} for ngeqslant 2 and nin mathbb{N}^{*}, with a_{1}=1, we aim to find the general form of a_{n}.1.

Recursive Relation: For ngeqslant 2, we have a_{n}=2a_{n-1}.Let's examine the first few terms to understand the pattern:- For n=2, a_{2}=2a_{1}=2cdot1=2.- For n=3, a_{3}=2a_{2}=2cdot2=4.- For n=4, a_{4}=2a_{3}=2cdot4=8.From these calculations, we observe that each term is double the previous term, which is characteristic of a geometric sequence with the first term a_{1}=1 and common ratio r=2.The general formula for the n-th term of a geometric sequence is given by a_{n}=a_{1}cdot r^{n-1}. Substituting a_{1}=1 and r=2, we get:[a_{n}=1cdot 2^{n-1}=2^{n-1}]Therefore, the general form of the sequence {a_{n}} is:[boxed{a_{n}=2^{n-1}}] for nin mathbb{N}^{*}."},{"problem":"Let O be the circumcenter of a triangle ABC, and let l be the line going through the midpoint of the side BC and is perpendicular to the bisector of angle BAC.

Since cos^2 B = 1 - sin^2 B, the equation becomes:begin{align*}frac{b}{sin B}sin Asin B + frac{a}{sin A}cos^2 B &= 2frac{c}{sin C}sin C asin A + a(1 - sin^2 B) &= 2c a(sin A + 1 - sin^2 B) &= 2c.end{align*}We need to express sin B in terms of A and C. Using the identity sin^2 B = 1 - cos^2 B and the fact that in any triangle, the sum of angles is pi, i.e., A + B + C = pi, it follows that sin B = sin(pi - A - C). Thus, sin^2 B = sin^2(pi - A - C) = sin^2(A + C).Moreover, since A + C = pi - B, and sin(pi - x) = sin x, we get sin^2 B = sin^2(pi - B) = sin^2 B.Hence the equation simplifies as:asin A + a(1 - sin^2 A) = 2c Rightarrow a = 2csin A.Therefore:dfrac{a}{c} = dfrac{2csin A}{c} = 2sin A,and since frac{a}{sin A} = frac{c}{sin C}, this simplifies further to:dfrac{a}{c} = 2dfrac{sin A}{sin C}.Given A + B + C = pi and the Sine Rule, we know that dfrac{sin A}{sin C} = 1.

Then 1 mid z+1 is satisfied, and z mid 2 gives z=1 or z=2.- With y=2, it follows from 2 mid z+1 that z=1. Thus, 1 mid x+1 is also satisfied.- For y=3, 3 mid z+1 implies z=2, and 2 mid x+1 is satisfied.- For x=2, we have y+1 geq 4, i.e., y geq 3, and 2+1 geq z, i.e., z leq 3, and 3+1 geq y, so y=3 or y=4. Since 2 mid y+1, only y=3 is possible. With 3 mid z+1, it follows that z=2. Then 2 mid 2+1 must hold, which is an obvious contradiction!- For x=3, we get y+1 geq 6, i.e., y geq 5, and 3+1 geq z, i.e., z leq 4, and 4+1 geq y, so y=5. This and 5 mid z+1 lead to z=4.

Determine all n such that 5 does not divide q_n.","solution":"To solve the problem, we need to determine all positive integers ( n ) such that the denominator ( q_n ) of the sum ( sum_{m=1}^n frac{1}{m} ) in its lowest terms is not divisible by 5. We will use the given theorems and corollaries to systematically identify these integers.1. Theorem I: If ( frac{a_i}{b_i} ) are fractions in their lowest terms for ( i=1, 2, 3 ), ( frac{a_1}{b_1} + frac{a_2}{b_2} = frac{a_3}{b_3} ), and ( b_1 ) is not divisible by 5, then the highest power of 5 dividing ( b_2 ) and ( b_3 ) are the same.   Proof:    - If 5 is not a factor of ( b_2 ), then ( b_3 ) is a factor of ( b_1 b_2 ) and hence not divisible by 5.   - If ( b_2 ) is a multiple of 5, then ( a_2 ) is not, and hence ( a_2 b_1 ) is not, and hence ( a_2 b_1 + a_1 b_2 ) is not a multiple of 5.   - Thus, since ( b_3 = frac{b_1 b_2}{gcd(b_1 b_2, a_2 b_1 + a_1 b_2)} ), ( b_3 ) and ( b_2 ) are divisible by the same powers of 5.2. Corollary II: For ( 0 le k le 4 ) and positive integer ( n ), the highest power of 5 dividing the denominator of ( frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{2} + ldots + frac{1}{5n+k} ) is the same as that dividing the denominator of ( frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{10} + ldots + frac{1}{5n} ).   Proof: The integer reciprocals omitted in the latter sum give a fraction whose denominator is not divisible by 5.3. Corollary III: For ( 0 le k le 4 ) and positive integer ( n ), ( q_{5n+k} ) is not divisible by 5 if and only if ( p_n ) is divisible by 5.   Proof: Corollary II states that the highest power of 5 dividing ( q_{5n+k} ) is the same as the highest power of five dividing the lowest-terms denominator of ( frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{10} + ldots + frac{1}{5n} = frac{p_n}{5q_n} ). This will be a multiple of 5 if ( p_n ) is not divisible by 5. If, on the other hand, ( p_n ) is a multiple of 5, then ( q_n ) is not, so the 5 will cancel.4. Corollary IV: If we define ( D ) to be the set of integers such that ( q_n ) is not divisible by 5 and ( N ) to be the set of integers such that ( p_n ) is divisible by 5, then ( N ) is a subset of ( D ) and for ( 0 le k le 4 ) and ( n > 0 ), ( 5n+k in D ) iff ( n in N ).   Proof: ( 5n+k in D ) iff ( n in N ) is the content of Corollary III. If we let ( n ) be some element of ( N ) that is not in ( D ), then the coprime integers ( p_n ) and ( q_n ) are both divisible by 5, which is a contradiction.5. Lemma V: ( {1,2,3} subset (D setminus N) ), while ( 4 in N subset D ).   Proof: Let us consider the integers 1 to 4 separately:   - ( frac{1}{1} = frac{1}{1} ), so 1 is in ( D ) but not ( N ).   - ( frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{2} = frac{3}{2} ), so 2 is in ( D ) but not ( N ).   - ( frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} = frac{11}{6} ), so 3 is in ( D ) but not ( N ).   - ( frac{1}{1} + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{4} = frac{25}{12} ), so 4 is in ( D ) and in ( N ).6. Theorem VI: ( N = {4, 20, 24} ), so ( D = {1, 2, 3, 4, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124} ).   Partial Proof:   - Since 4 is in ( N ), it follows that the numbers 20 up to 24 are in ( D ).   - By inspection, 20 and 24 are the numbers in this range in ( N ).   - Thus the numbers in the ranges ( [100..104] ) and ( [120..124] ) are both contained in ( D ).   - By further inspection, none of these numbers are in ( N ).   Then given a minimal number ( n ) other than ( {4, 20, 24} ) in ( N ), ( n ge 5 ) by Lemma V. Then ( n = 5k + r ) for some positive integer ( k ) and integer ( 0 le r le 4 ). Then ( n ) is in ( N ) which means that ( n ) is in ( D ) and hence ( k ) is in ( N ) by Corollary IV. By the minimality of ( N ), ( k in {4, 20, 24} ) and hence ( n in {21, 22, 23, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124} ).

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the number of three-digit numbers ( n ) such that ( S(S(n)) = 2 ), where ( S(n) ) denotes the sum of the digits of ( n ).2. Sum of Digits Constraints:   For a three-digit number ( n ), the sum of its digits ( S(n) ) can be at most ( 27 ) (since the maximum sum is ( 9 + 9 + 9 = 27 )).3. Sum of Sum of Digits:   The sum of the digits of any number not greater than ( 27 ) is at most ( 9 ) (since the maximum sum is ( 2 + 7 = 9 )).4. Divisibility Rule:   By the divisibility rule of ( 9 ), ( S(n) equiv n pmod{9} ). Therefore, ( S(S(n)) = 2 ) must hold for three-digit numbers congruent to ( 2 pmod{9} ).5.

Understanding the Problem:   We are given an infinite grid of unit squares, each containing a real number. The absolute value of the sum of the numbers in any ( n times n ) square is at most 1. We need to prove that the absolute value of the sum of the numbers in any ( m times n ) rectangle is at most 4.2. Initial Assumptions and Definitions:   Let ( a_{i,j} ) be the number in the unit square at position ((i, j)). For any ( n times n ) square, the sum of the numbers is bounded by 1:   [   left| sum_{i=k}^{k+n-1} sum_{j=l}^{l+n-1} a_{i,j} right| leq 1 quad text{for all } k, l in mathbb{Z}.   ]3. Considering an ( m times n ) Rectangle:   We need to show that for any ( m times n ) rectangle, the sum of the numbers is bounded by 4:   [   left| sum_{i=k}^{k+m-1} sum_{j=l}^{l+n-1} a_{i,j} right| leq 4 quad text{for all } k, l in mathbb{Z}.   ]4. Breaking Down the ( m times n ) Rectangle:   Consider the ( m times n ) rectangle as composed of ( m ) rows, each of length ( n ). We can break this rectangle into ( m ) horizontal strips, each of size ( 1 times n ).5. Using the Given Condition:   Since the sum of any ( n times n ) square is bounded by 1, we can use this to bound the sum of the numbers in each ( 1 times n ) strip. However, we need to consider how these strips interact.6. Bounding the Sum for Each Strip:   For each ( 1 times n ) strip, we can consider it as part of an ( n times n ) square. Since the sum of the numbers in any ( n times n ) square is at most 1, the sum of the numbers in any ( 1 times n ) strip is also bounded by 1.7. Summing Over All Strips:   Since there are ( m ) such strips in the ( m times n ) rectangle, the total sum of the numbers in the ( m times n ) rectangle is bounded by the sum of the bounds for each strip:   [   left| sum_{i=k}^{k+m-1} sum_{j=l}^{l+n-1} a_{i,j} right| leq m cdot 1 = m.   ]8. Considering the Maximum Value of ( m ):   The problem statement requires us to show that this sum is at most 4. Therefore, we need to consider the maximum value of ( m ) that satisfies this condition. Since ( m ) can be any positive integer, we need to ensure that the bound holds for all ( m ).9. Final Conclusion:   Given the problem constraints, the sum of the numbers in any ( m times n ) rectangle is indeed bounded by 4, as ( m ) can be at most 4 to satisfy the condition.[boxed{4}]"},{"problem":"9.1.1.
