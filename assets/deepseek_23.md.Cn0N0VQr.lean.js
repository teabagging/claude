Our normal body sodium us between 135 to 145 meq/dl. It is maintained at that level by a complex interplay of hormones and Add or anti diuretic hormone is the most important among them. You have an inappropriately high ADH  level,that is inappropriate to your body sodium level. The normal or low sodium that u have is sensed by the body as inappropriately high and body fails to suppress the ADH release that ought to have taken place at such low sodium level. So if u take high salt body is just going to retain more water and your blood sodium level will not improve. Best practical way is to restrict water. Next best thing is to use oral/intranasal ADH analog called desmopressin. Either way since your Nephro judged it is due to trauma, it will stick with you for for the rest of your life.

I have gone through your question and I understand your concern Yes your dull ache can be caused of the kidney stones also the blood in urine too . If the stones are in big size and they keep being in the kidney they will irritate your urinary tract and so you will have symptoms.  It could be also cause of infection of your urinary usually you will have  burning  during urination  and  frequent urination. Also when you have stones for a long time they may cause kidney problem ( hydronephrosis) . If the stones are there you will keep having symptoms so I would advise:Drink  a lot of water , avoid salt and proteins in your diet ,while you are waiting for you CT scan  that will show the diagnosis Wish your good health !Thank you for using HCM"},{"Patient":"My seventeen year old son has calcification of his right kidney...he has developed blue tinged arms with marked red spots with a white area around them.

There is a certain amount of uric acid that your kidneys can handle, if your intake of Purine containing foods is more than what your kidneys can handle, the extra uric acid remains in the blood and gets deposited in various parts of the body, like skin and joints. This is what has happened in your case. Infact extra uric acid even stagnates in kidneys causing stones. To that extent, yes it is a kidney problem. However, it has no relation to sympathetic dystrophy. Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi I have bilateral pUJ obstruction. my right kidney was operated before almost 3 years.

I have been a smoker for off and on for about 8 years. For 5 years I have been battling a condition that is still unclear to me. 5 years ago, after a night of not sleeping and drinking alcohol, I had an attack that landed me in the ER. It started out with my arm going numb, continued to heart palpitations, feeling that I was swallowing my tongue and couldn t really breathe, became really pale and couldn t control my movements, trembled and couldn t really speak, nauseous and feeling like I wanted to throw up. In the ER I got a diagnosis of calcium deficiency and they gave me a calcium shot. That didn t calm me down, so they also put me on an IV drip. However, the following days I continued to feel really badly, on made recurring trips to the ER. Because of that, I took various tests: EKG, X ray of the chest, samples from the mouth, various bloodtest, and also a test of how my muscle conduce electricity, to see if they react normally. All the tests came back normalThe diagnosis still was a bit unclear, it ranged from calcium deficiency to magnesium deficiency, others mentioned spasmophilia, with one doctor suggesting I consult a psychiatrist. But my family doctor told me that it is due to calcium, so because of that I have been taking calcium for 5 years, with sometimes mild attacks, similar to the one that was the starting point. I have also had a problem with my menstruation, it was later discovered that I had a tumor like build up on my hormone gland in the brain, but after taking medications for it and regular MRI s, I am now considered cured, with a relatively normal menstruation cycle. My main concern now is my heart however. I have been studying away from home for 4 months now, and before I left I had a really bad attack, so I decided to consult a cardiologist, who did an EKG and gave me a physical, said it was spasmophilia and gave me a prescription for calcium, magnesium, some vitamins and a plant based pill that is supposed to calm me. However, I am still worried because I have been getting these sudden pains in my upper chest area, right above the left breast, and in my left arm for a while now, with arm pain radiating from my wrist to my shoulder. The pains in the chest come after I walk really fast, but the pain in the arm has been going on for some days now. I am also conscious that I have a very bad position when I sit and I also tend to lie in bed and look at my laptop while I am balancing my weight on my left arm. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi, In summary, you are young, heart disease is unlikely. You have anxiety with hyperventilation, carpo-pedal spasm due to calcium deficiency.

I would advice you to undergo the following tests.CT scan of abdomen pre and post contrast, Blood tests- calcium, uric acid, creatinine, serum PTH, alkaline phosphatase, PSA,creatinine, urine for bence jones protein and routine analysis as a minimum. You might need additional tests such as bone scan or myeloma screen depending on the exact findings on the xray. If you are a recurrent stone former then you might also need 24 hour urine collected and analysed for calcium, uric acid, oxalate and citrate as a minimum. You might want to seen a general physician or endocrinologist for evaluation."},{"Patient":"doc i have pain on the right side of stomach i.e. i think on the right kidney..the pain pinches me lik nethng...i cant walk straightly coz of this pain...i went to a doc nearby he adviced me for a urine test and ultrasound...urine report was normal but in ultrasound it showed that there might be a grain sized stone which got passed out through urine but there  is swelling in the kidney...i had treatment for ths thing but aftr few days again i got the similar pain ...i dnt knw wat to do ....i m getting irritated by ths...plz help me..n suggest me some solution","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to Health Care Magic, I am Dr Asad Riaz, I have closely read your question and I understand your concerns, I will hereby guide you regarding your health related problem.stone are many types like calcium phosphate ,calcium oxalate, cysteine etc...it causes severe pain that can lead to nausea a n bomiting and also hematuria.. if u were my patient I would like to do usg abdomen pelvis again n do urine R/E and also do CT if needed Bcs some stone are only visible on CT m may easily missed by usg.. after dx then I'll give some antibiotic for infection that caused by stone , painkiller n ask to drink a lot of fluid .. if stone is large enough then will offer other Tx options like lithotripsy or surgery..I hope this answered your question, if you have more feel free to ask.Regards.Dr.Asad Riaz.General and Family Physician.."},{"Patient":"My husband is 55 years old in good health.

The shock waves have to pass through the skin and get focussed on the stone- so the maximum concentration of the shock wave is on the stone but some falls on the skin as well. This may not be the same achine you have had 6 years ago and power and efficiency of machine can change in a different machine -hence the bruise may not have happened previously.

My dad has arrythmias in which his pulse increases and he has been diagnosed with an enlarged heart and was born with a heart murmur. He is overweight and has high blood pressure. I've had 2 EKGs, a chest X-ray, blood tests, and an echocardiogram done. The EKG showed I was having PVCs. All the other testing came back normal. I was officially diagnosed with benign PVCs. They occur about twice a week. They can occur when I'm stressed, after a night of heavy drinking, or after working out. I assume the triggers of my PVCs are increased adrenaline levels (which explain 2/3 of my PVCs) and a low level of magnesium (which explains why I get them after heavy drinking). I recently have been afraid to workout after reading about HCM and sudden cardiac arrest in players after or during exercise. I also have really bad allergies.

When kidney function decrease to 10% or low then he needs dialysis. At the age of 76,before starting dialysis many factors shoukd be considered like burden on care givers his cardiac status etc. With 24% function I would expect at least 2 more years he can survive without dialysis.

By far what you have told is that you are very healthy individual with no medical history or family history and your BMI is also good.But you are worried about your persistly raised Creatinine level. Well its very hard to tell with out a related urea level along with it.With what ever information you have provided. There are few non-medical reason for raise in creatinine. Now Creatinine is basically a waste product that our body make when its working. So, if you are exercising regularly and not having proper sleep for 6-8 hrs daily, your creatinine will be on the higher side. It is also formed when we eat meal that is high in protein, like red meat, Chicken, Beef. So, if you have heavy non-veg meal before the test, it can lead to high levels of creatinine.What I will suggest is to do a 24 hrs creatinine clearnce test and blood Urea, when you get your blood checked up next time. That will be able to give a better picture what might be the cause of it.Thank you.Hope your concern is dealt with."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have a question about kidney issues.

Inj.epofit is nothing but erythropoietin which is released by kidney and in kidney patients as it is released in low quantity and thats the reason why hemoglobin will be low in such patients.

First you need to know whether it is a acute kidney injury or chronic kidney injury. Please have an ultrasound kub done and see the size of the kidney.

Your BP is on higher side and it may cause brain hemorrhage also.Below the age of 85 years, if you are on antihypertensive medicines then your BP should be below 140/90. ACEI is the first line drug like Ramipril or Enalapril in younger age group. The 2nd line is Ca channel blocker but 1st line in older group.Diuretics may be added and combination of these three along with Beta-blockers to control the BP. Lifestyle modification is also helpful.Weight loss, Regular exercise, Quitting smoking, Stopping alcohol consumption, Reducing intake of caffine, salt, fat, sugar and processed diet may be helpful.Avoid meat and have more fruits and vegetables.

I'm wondering if it might be just a calcium absorption problem? How might I fix this?","Doctor":"HiCalcium levels in the body is regulated at three different levels. Amount of absorbtion at the level of intestines, Excretion from the body at the level of kidneys and mobilisation of calcium stores from your bones and all three are dependent on hormone levels in your body. You could have excess mobilisation of calcium from your bones or inadequate deposit in to bones both causing osteopenia.On the other had one of the cause for formation of urinary stones may be excess excretion of calcium in the urine and this may be independent of what happen at bone level. Have you had 24 hour urine collection to check for increased calcium excretion in the urine or other abnormalities that makes you prone for stone formation. Dietrary advice for calcium is better guided by this result."},{"Patient":"I have a reccuring Kidney stone Problem.

After the adrenal glands are removed is caused a so called jatrogenic adrenal insufficiency,  which is resolved by giving the hormones as a treatment by mouth , such as WYSOLONE and flouricot . So you should never interrupt your medication.Not only that , but you have to be careful with your health. If you note any change in your health such as your weight, appetite, blood pressure, sleep etc. you should do  a series of laboratory exams such as sodium, potassium, glucose, BUN, Creatinine, ACTH, cortisol levels in blood and consult with an endocrinologist to see if you need any change in the dosage of your treatment or not.Regarding pregnancy, you should understand that the issue is not that you are ‘taking hormones’ or ‘using steroids’ in pregnancy but you are just replacing something your body is missing, not adding extra chemicals or un-natural substances to the body. On the other hand is obvious that the management of the disease during pregnancy, requires high caution and must be guided by both the endocrinologist and the obstetrician.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

Initially the kidneys compensate by stimulating the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone–system & anti-diuretic hormone to maintain blood pressure. However, if a patient previously had hypoperfusion (decreased blood supply to the kidneys), this compensatory mechanism may fail resulting in a decreased glomerular filtration rate.Benadryl (Diphenhydramine) can cause post-renal obstruction (blockage of the urinary tract). Obstruction can occur from the urinary tubule to the urethra  resulting in urine accumulation and ultimately increasing upstream pressure and decreasing GFR.Such elderly patient should be carefully evaluated by a physician or nephrologist and a dosage reduction of Lisinopril or use an alternate medication would restore the normal GFR.Hope this will help."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, I am a 93 year old man, comparatively healthy.

They performed a spinal decompression surgery and removed several tumors.  They said his spine looked like swiss cheese.  The biopsy of the tumor came back as a plasma cell neoplasia.  A week later, they did a bone marrow biopsy and when that returned there was no sign of multiple myeloma in the marrow.  There are lesions in his kidney, ribs, spine and liver.  They did a biopsy of the kidney and that lesion came back as renal cell carcinoma.  They told my father they have never seen anything like it before.  We could use any information you can give.  They will be doing a biopsy of the rib tumor next week to determine what that is.  Any thoughts??

Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.There is a probability of a 6 mm stone in the left kidney. This is not confirmed but it is likely that the stone is not well seen and therefore written as questionable calculus.It is important to know if the stone is causing any obstruction to the flow of urine. If it is mentioned that there is no hydronephrosis then there is no obstruction and it is not a serious problem.If you want to confirm about the stone then please do a CT scan KUB region and this will show whether there is a calculus in the left kidney.Please find my suggestions for kidney stones which you can practice. These are my own opinions and I suggest this to my patients.DOs for kidney stones(i) Drinking as much as 1.5 to 2.5 liters a day may help flush out your urinary system. This will also allow small stones to pass through.(ii) Visit washrooms regularly and empty your bladder when you feel like doing urination.(iii) Please take fruits like apple, papaya, watermelon, pineapple, sweetlime, bananas and orange, vegetables like, white gourd, ladyfinger, pumpkin, pulses and legumes.(v) If you have sharp pain then you should consult your doctor and take pain reliever medications under strict supervision.DONTs for kidney stones(i) Please avoid holding urine for long intervals.(ii) Please reduce foods containing oxalates like non veg, vegetables like spinach, tomato, cauliflower, brinjals, nuts like cashew, pista and almonds.(iii) Decrease extra salt in foods.(iv) Avoid spicy pickles.(v) Please eat meat products in normal amounts, avoid eating too much."},{"Patient":"I had my left adrenal gland removed in 09 and a third of my kidney , my kidney had a cancer s tumor. but now over the last six month s or so I am just so irritable and fatigued , I am just so hateful the least little thing will set me off , I believe this could be as a result of not having but one adrenal gland , don t know what I should do need some relief. thanks","Doctor":"hello, thank you for writing in to hcm.removal of adrenal glands can cause hormonal imbalance as it is a site for secretion of corticosteroid hormones, mineralocorticoids and sex hormones. kindly consult an endocrinologist as some investigations like the level of the above mentioned hormones in the body through blood tests are important.  deficiency of such hormones can be treated with right medications which will substitute the hormones and reduce the irritability and mood swings. regards, dr.riyanka"},{"Patient":"I am a 62 year old male who just had a procedure done to break up Kidney stones.

This requires a longer course of antibiotics than usual. Partially treating pyelonephritis will cause the disease to not get eradicated and lead to antibiotic resistance.In the case of your mother it is suggested that she gets a urine culture and sensitivity test done. This will tell which antibiotics are required to eradicate the bacteria causing the pyelonephritis. The culture and sensitivity test will show which antibiotic will work the maximum and give relief in a short time.Having diabetes makes treatment difficult and this is probably the reason why she is taking longer to recover. If she does not like to eat then her diet is to be modified to include healthy food which can be given like fluids and juices. Hydration is important and she should be told to drink adequate fluids.Once the treatment of the infection is over then the urine culture should be done again to confirm that there is no persisting infection. If infection is still there then for few weeks specific urinary system antibiotics like nitrofurantoin can be started and monitored.

Kindly tell me what should I do to rduce the swelling and how can I normalize my fatty lever?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The swelling in the calf regions during periods of activity can mean decreased venous return and pooling of blood. This is not related to your right kidney stone. There are arteries which supply blood to the different regions including limbs and veins which bring back the blood to the heart. The veins have valves at some places to prevent back flow and allow the blood to reach the heart. In some people which progressing and and in those doing standing jobs there is malfunctioning of the venous valves and the blood gets pooled in the lower limbs. This opens up connecting channels between veins called perforators and that causes varicose veins which is tortuous superficial veins in the lower limbs. It is suggested that you consult a doctor and discuss the probability of varicose veins and if required get a venous Doppler of lower limbs done.For the right kidney discomfort please get the ultrasound scan done again to know of any dislodgement of the stone which can cause the discomfort.

Fluid gain can occur in people with kidney disorders and this is treated with diuretics and medicines to improve kidney function.

The normal creatinine level in blood is less than 1.3 in most clinics. If your creatinine level in blood is 1.84 then it is increased. This can mean that the kidney filtration rate has decreased with time. A nephrologist is the specialist in kidney disease and they will evaualte kidney function in detail and suggest investigations like urinary protein, creatinine clearance and if required then a nuclear scan based on your clinical symptoms and medical history.Occasionally food habits can cause increase in blood creatinine level and this is to be discussed.

This can happen if the urinary bladder is full, if there is a stone in the path of ureter or any kidney infection.The CT scan was probably to look for stones and is normal. If laboratory tests are normal then kidney infection is less likely.One of the possibilities which still holds good for your pain is the passage of a small stone through the urinary tract. This causes significant pain even after the stone passes out. The scans do not show any stone because it was passed out over few hours before doing the scan. The stone can injure the lining of the ureter leading to pain. Please drink adequate water and visit washroom regularly to feel better. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have few queries, 1. how much would a kidney transplant cost in india (kolkata for instance)2. How effective is the transplant if the patient has already started dialysis3. Is there age limit for a transplant, the patient is approaching 61 yrs","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Kidney transplant is a common surgery now and it is done in most cities. The transplanted kidney should be from a matching donor and this is a voluntary donation in India. Buying or selling kidneys is illegal. The const of the transplant is for surgery and recovery. This is around 3 to 5 lakhs Indian rupees. It can be higher if there is any problem. Please know that even after kidney transplant the person should be on long time medicines which will cost few thousands of rupees every month.The native kidneys are not disturbed during kidney transplant. The new kidney is put in the pelvis. Effectiveness of kidney transplant is based on many factors including primary cause of kidney failure, age of the patient, immunity and host graft rejection and the surgery. Many kidney transplants are successful on patients getting dialysis.Usually kidney transplant is done before 60 years of age. If patient is healthy then it can be done at 61 years of age after getting clearance from ethical board. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I JUST HAD PYELONEPHRITIS WAS IN THE HOSP.

This is a moderate infection and requires a strong antibiotic like ciprofloxacin for it to be cured. If you had to be in hospital then your doctors have stabilized your condition and then sent you home. It usually takes 15 days to feel normal. However it can take slightly longer in elderly people like you because of other conditions like hypertension and diabetes should you have them.Please drink adequate amount of water and visit washrooms regularly. You should not hold your urine for long duration because this can cause recurrent infection. Feeling crummy during the recovery phase is felt by many patients and this can be there for few days. In almost every patient the recovery is complete in one month.

Kidney infections take time for recovery and cause symptoms like pain in the lower back, burning urination, pain and bleeding in urine and lower abdominal pain with fever. However every symptom is not found in each patient and it is important to know what are the symptoms your daughter is having regularly.Kidney infections are caused by bacteria and sometime a bacteria cannot be controlled with an antibiotic. This is to be clarified with her tests and if required then a change of antibiotics will treat the infection completely.If in doubt, you can request your doctor to repeat the kidney function tests at regular intervals. Imaging investigations like ultrasound scan or CT scan abdomen can help if the symptoms persist after treatment changes.

It is important to have a complete evaluation of your general health including blood counts to know if your immunity is good and to confirm the absence of infections. Considering deep sea diving, a depth of more than 80 to 100 feet is to be undertaken only after getting examined and taking a fitness permit from your doctor.Diovan contains valsartan and this is a good anti hypertensive medicine. People who have high blood pressure require a medical fitness permit from the doctor.In conclusion, a general health examination and medical fitness permit is required which you can get from your doctor attached to the deep sea diving institute.

Stents are tin long tubes with curves in both ends. One end is in the pelvis of the kidney and the other end is in the urinary bladder.A stent helps in clear passage of urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. If your bladder is full then the stent is clear and allowing urine to pass through. An ultrasound scan is required to know if there is any urinary bladder infection or any other cause for not being able to pass urine from the bladder to the exterior.If there is acute retention of urine then you should go to your doctor now and have the bladder pressure released by inserting a catheter. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"i was born with 1 kidney ...enlarged on the left side.last week  im experiencing urine incontinent..before i reached the bathroom..i already passed some urine..and i need to go to the bathroom at least 3 times in an hour to passed urine ...then finally  i  then i had a flank pain on the left that i decided to have a  renal ultrasound.the technician told me that i had a mild pelvietasia...official result will come out after 3 days..I had U & E...and my crea shows 85..my last urea taken last month was only 65.I only had one kidney...thats why im so concern for further distruction..How i would treat this mild pelvietesia and how do i take care of my kidney? thank you so much.
