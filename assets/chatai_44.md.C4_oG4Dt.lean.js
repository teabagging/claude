Side effects of restrictive dieting may include more cravings for food and overeating, lower metabolism rate, bone density can also decrease, intestinal health may also get affected adversely. Vitamin B complex helps in reducing the weight because it maintains our normal metabolism. Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy our body requires for normal functioning at rest. If a person has low BMR due to underlying health issue like hypothyroidism, then it may lead to weight gain because the body is not producing proper energy and the calorie-burning is lower.

She had ascites, which was cured. She has taken proper medication since then. But recently, since the last three weeks to be precised, she was having tremors and difficulty in sleeping. We consulted gastroenterologist here who gave medicines but did not help much with these symptoms. She also has hypothyroid and type 2 diabetes. Since the last two days, she suddenly developed nausea and vomiting and we had to hospitalize her. For now, vomiting and nausea have stopped but she is oversleeping and she still has tremors. Her sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels are normal. And looking at her liver function test the doctor said she has swelling on her liver and nothing more. But I read somewhere about the symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy like oversleeping, drowsiness, flapping tremors, etc and she has all those at present. Am I right regarding this? Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand you must be very upset about your mother's health. The answer to your query is you are 100% right. It can be hepatic encephalopathy (HE). It often presents as altered sleep patterns which means day time sleeping and nighttime awakening. Tremors are characteristically called flapping tremors and sometimes overt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as elevated mood, hallucinations, and illusions. The treatment of HE is simple i.e. to avoid constipation, and use of lactulose a special laxative agent that help to decrease ammonia gas that causes HE. Plus she should be given tablet Rifxamin 550 mg twice daily to prevent her from recurrent episodes of HE. The recent use of painkillers could have caused kidney damage which got recovered and may be a precipitating factor for the underlying development of hepatic encephalopathy. I hope this will help you in understanding her problem. I want that you should discuss this information with her treating physician. Can follow up to discuss more about the long term management of chronic liver disease."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, How do Melatonin supplements work?

Now coming to diet, a soft diet like rice and pulse combination, porridge, with curd, fat-free yogurt, rice water, lemon drink, coconut water, oral rehydrating solutions as recommended by W.H.O. Banana should be given as it is a binding agent. Puffed rice mixed wid curd can be given. After every vomiting and lose morions, ORS should be given. Avoid juices and artificial sweeteners, fruits, raw vegetables because the lining of the intestine villi is damaged during stomach infection, so these things are not absorbed but instead increase frequent passage of stool.

I have been suffering from anxiety and depression for the past 12 years. One day I was driving to college and suddenly got a panic attack all of a sudden for the first time. I was really scared and thought I would die. I thought there was something wrong with my brain, so I had thousands of tests and then brain MRI. All was perfect. During that time, I weighed 80 kg. I was so scared that I was totally on the bed for two years. I gained 40 kg in a year by eating all day. I was scared, fearful, and depressed. I tried lots of medicines, but nothing helped. Then a GP suggested me Cipralex and Xanax 1 mg twice a day. Things started getting a little better. Then I decided to lose weight. I lost 55 kg in two years. At that time I was almost 20 years old. I left the university because I was not able to focus. My father is an industrialist, so I joined him and worked very well for three years. When I was 23 years, I was better enough to make friends. I used to hangout and started taking alcohol weekly. I started enjoying alcohol, and the effects of Cipralex were going away with time. After a year or so, I went into depression mode again. Then I consulted a pschiatrist and he put me on Wellbutrin XL 300 mg, Seroxat CR 25 mg, Xanan 1 mg thrice a day and Rivotril thrice a day. After a few weeks the honeymoon period of Wellbutrin kicked in and the life changed. I was focused and powerful. I just did whatever I wanted to. I started earning money. I mean my dad was happy from my work so he used to give me enough to enjoy life. I became an alcoholic. I got married two years back and have a son now. I used to drink all day long even in the breakfast. I build so much tolerance that I would drink two bottles of vodka every day and night, and 15 cans of beer in a day. My weight has again gone back to 120 kg. By the time I increased my Wellbutrin dosage to 600 mg per day on my own to get that honeymoon effect back, but nothing changed. It is now all where it started, lying on my bed, panicked, fearful and depressed for the past 10 days. I left alcohol 10 days back cold turkey. I had an LFT test and the GGT was around 700. I just do not want to die of liver cirrhosis. I also had a CBC test and it was 99 percent normal as well. Hepititus B and C are negative. I had an ultrasound abdomen four months back and at that time, all of the organs were fine except a little fatty liver. Now all I want is to restart my life. I just want that Wellbutrin feeling back. I have build tolerance to Wellbutrin, so it does not work anymore. I just want to restart life. I want to enjoy with my wife and son. I want to go to work the same way I used to when I lost weight. You can understand well. I have increased the dosage of Benzodiazepene all by myself to cope with withdrawl symtoms of alcohol. Currently I am on Wellbutrin Xl 600mg, Seroxat CR 25 mg, Xanan 1 mg four to five times, and Rivotril 0.5 mg four to five times.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your problem and understand your concern. The doses of Wellbutrin (Bupropion) are towards higher side and dose of Seroxat CR (Paroxetine) is towards lower side, while benzodiazepine is also towards higher side, but it can be gradually tapered to lower side. Once the alcohol withdrawal symptoms decrease, you can lower the benzodiazepine doses. Usually I recommend to my client Seroxat CR 50 mg to manage the symptoms of depression. I would suggest to stop alcohol and continue the same medicine. Of course, increase the dose of Seroxat. Regular exercise is very important, and management of alcoholic liver disease has to be considered. Thiamine in doses of 100 mg three times a day and if required Metadoxine can be used. All these are prescription-only drugs, so you need a prescription for the same. For more information consult a psychiatrist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My wife's fasting glucose is 131.

The doctor indicated that he opened it up wide enough due to the fact that he expected shrinkage. I feel again that my belly button is shrinking to the point of abnormalcy. I did see my doctor twice since my revision surgery and each time he seemed to be satisfied with the results. But, now I have not seen him again for six weeks.

The belly button however if it was not properly shaped during the initial procedure, then it was definitely a good decision to revise it after a few months. Right now, I feel that the skin is still in the healing phase. Given that it was a revision surgery, it will take a little longer to heal than a normal period of two months. Also, it depends upon the umbilical stalk length, that how long it will take for the surrounding induration and hence the discoloration to settle down.

First, I would recommend you to evaluate the ovulatory process with ultrasound examination at 12 -15 days or measurement of progesterone at 21 days. And after that take some medication that induces your ovulation.

I have been having obsessive worries, so please do not judge my rather paranoid concerns, since I cannot get them off my mind. A week ago, during a night out, I received a kiss on the cheek by a male stranger, and also gave him a kiss on his cheek. Initially, I was not alert because I thought the person was a friend of my friend's, but later I realized that he was a total stranger, who was acting weird and asking everyone in the nightclub for a kiss on the cheek. For some reasons, I kept thinking that this weird person had some sort of contagious disease and was just desperate to pass the disease to as many people as possible. About three days later, I started having symptoms similar to those of a cold. I felt tired and had a runny nose. I stopped feeling tired after two days, but the runny nose has not completely stopped until today, which is four days later from the start of the symptoms. From my own knowledge and some researching, I learned that early HIV symptoms include flu-like symptoms. And although I did not have any a sore throat, fever or swollen lymph nodes, my runny nose has been worrying me and making me have thoughts that I may have contacted HIV from the weird stranger. From my memory, when he and I exchanged kisses on the cheek, his lips, and cheeks, as well as my lips and cheeks, did not have any open cuts or sores, so I have almost zero chance of HIV exposure. However, I cannot seem to put my mind at ease, as I have been having obsessive worries for about three days. Therefore, I want to seek consultation from a professional. Please give me some advice, so I can get some peace of mind.","Doctor":"Hello. As you have mentioned, there were no cuts in his and your lip, then 80 % problem is solved. Touch and light kiss do not transfer HIV. Saliva is their least chance of transmission, which is not known or does not have a reported case though. So, this is just a quick response, nothing else. The common cold is very common in your place. Do not worry. Take tablet Montek FX (Montelukast and Fexofenadine) one at night for three to five days. There is no HIV contamination.

Then she started playing with herself and there were vaginal fluids on her hand. She put her hand on my face and close to my nose and wanted me to smell her vaginal fluid. After about 10 minutes, I felt like this thing might be dangerous, so I went and washed my face. I do not know if she had HIV or not but I am very scared.","Doctor":"Hello. When there is no sex intervention and vaginal fluid was touched by her on the face, so it is clearly no penetration as the skin acts as a strong barrier. Kissing has the least chance or nil for HIV but yes, HSV (herpes simplex virus) is common. If any symptoms other than seasonal like a sore throat, common cold, then consult a general physician MD or an ENT specialist. The night sweat, rash all are common, so do not panic. Yet, if you have fear or anxiety, you can go for the test. Once the test results are negative, you are risk-free.  Take healthy food, fruit juice, milk products. The test to be taken are ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kit within 7 to 10 days, RNA PCR on the 15th day, fourth generation CMIA kit test on the 28th day. You can take any of these."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 45 year old male. A month back, I was diagnosed with sleep apnea. I have enclosed my report here. I feel breathless at night while lying down and I was advised it as because of sleep apnea. I have been trying to use a CPAP. For past two months I am experiencing breathlessness on even slight exertion like walking for a few minutes, bending down, etc. My doctor said it may be due to coronary ischemia. I had a positive TMT and may have to undergo an angiography. My chest physician said it as bronchoconstriction. He prescribed Foracort inhaler, Duolin inhaler, Deriphyllin retard and Montek. The unresolved problem I am facing now is a sudden involuntary exhalation of breath. This happens more often at night, from time to time breath exhales in a sudden explosive spurt that almost throws up my body a bit something like hiccups from the stomach. This happens many times at night and disturbs sleep. It also happens the moment I put on my CPAP full face mask. Earlier it was more while using the CPAP and nowadays it happens even without the CPAP. Also my wife says that even with CPAP sometimes I am absolutely still, not breathing while sleeping. My father is a heart patient and he also has COPD. My mother suffered with asthma and now got cured of it. I do not smoke or drink alcohol and I am a vegetarian. In addition to the above tests, my chest X-ray was normal. Five months back I had an echo and brain MRI, which are all also normal. Brain MRI was taken because I had some balancing issues which were then diagnosed as uncompensated vestibular lesion. I also have severe cervical spondylosis. What could be the cause of this sudden aggressive exhalation? Could my breathlessness issue be entirely due to lungs? If so should I undergo angiography? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query and reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) in detail. Please find my observations below. There is a probability of having a parasomnia which is defined as sleep disorders that involve abnormal movements and features like aggressive exhalation, partial awakening, arousal with confusion, sleep terror and related symptoms. This problem is in addition to the obstructive sleep apnea which is there in you. Studies show that 9.5 percent of people with obstructive sleep apnea might have parasomnia. About 20 percent of patients experience improvement and decrease in episodes of parasomnia after CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) and it is persisting even with CPAP in you. At 45 years, getting a CT angiography is suggested. It is a low risk procedure comparable with the cath lab angiography. Doing lipid profile and cardiac enzyme test is also important.

Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. Although I would like to ask some questions before answering your query as many things are missing here like your menstrual history, medical and drug history and most importantly how long you have been sexually active. If you were not sexually active before then it could be hymen rupture. But if you have been sexually active there could be other reasons for bleeding like local minor trauma, laceration or very small tear that bleed.  One sperm cannot be even seen by eye as in one ml of semen there could be millions of sperms and only one required to get pregnant. Better to have one local detailed examination by a gynecologist for any trauma, local tear or injury or any other pathology like a polyp, or any cyst (this can bleed as well if not hymen). If you have been treated for any disease better to have the full treatment. You would have had emergency contraceptives within 72 hours of the event. If you have been having irregular cycle then maybe this bleeding could be part of your cycle. Which phase of cycle event occurred it matters. If late phase near menses, fewer chances of pregnancy (less fertile period). In case of missed periods or even now as well you can have beta hCG ( human chorionic gonadotropin) that can clear situation. Have a healthy nutritious diet.

Without the ability to regulate my pace I felt as if I hit the wall. I felt very lightheaded, slight blurry vision and tingling sensation in legs. When I run the same thing happens every time, so it is not a single occurrence. My resting blood pressure was 132/80 mmHg. Sinus rhythm in ECG was 113 per minute. During the test we exceeded the maximum load of 5% and 111% maximum heart rate for the candidate's age (194bpm). Blood pressure increased to 160/60 mmHg. Base ECG at maximum load does not change much. Blood pressure was normalized in two minutes. When I stand up after sitting for a while, I get blurry, black out vision which is often severe. My breath is quite shallow. I feel tired most of the time and muscle fatigue. The symptoms always worsen when hot or dehydrated. I did the \\"standing up test\\" on my own.

A few sessions of speech therapy are not going to rid you of the problem. Muscle tension dysphonia occurs due to various reasons and can be present after laryngitis or pneumonia as in your case. As an ENT surgeon, I would like to see the laryngoscopy video myself to ascertain if indeed the false vocal cords are producing voice instead of the true ones. Dysphonia plica ventricularis is the grade 2 of muscle tension dysphonia. Dysphonia plica ventricularis is when the false cords medialize to produce voice. Continue the speech therapy and anti-reflux treatment like your ENT surgeon and audiologist has prescribed. The speech therapy is aimed at suppressing maladaptive phonatory mechanisms and learn techniques designed to minimize muscular tension. Do write back to us if you need any further information on this. But at the same time please be patient with this problem to get resolved. Take adequate voice rest and whenever you use voice take care not to raise the voice or use unnatural frequencies.

Again herpes esophagitis can attack the mouth. Sores may develop in the mouth and make swelling difficult due to inflammation of the throat. This pain can radiate to mouth and jaws. Sudden hearing loss can result commonly from viral infections other than herpes are measles, mumps, rubella, viral meningitis, syphilis, AIDS, etc., which can cause sudden loss of hearing. Again bacterial meningitis, Lyme, any tumors in the ear can also be hearing loss. Any type of hearing loss, steroid should be applied immediately.

My height is 6'2\\" and weight is 73 kg. For the past three months, I have pain in the left side of my glans penis. At the same time, I have a continuous pain on the left side of the anus. The pain around the anus is not severe, but it is enough to bother and depress me. Sometimes, the pain increases, but eases if I wake up from sleep. The pain in the glans penis area often increases during erection and more if I masturbate. I am also getting pain in the left side shaft of the penis and in the area between the anus and the scrotum. My glans penis becomes severely red and painful during or immediately after erection and the redness decreases after some time. I have consulted with a urologist. He recommended a semen culture test and the report suggested a heavy growth of K.pneumoniae for which I was given an antibiotic Levofloxacin 500 course of seven days. The pain around my anus did not get eased and so he extended the medicine for 14 more days. But, my pain is still present. For the penis pain, he examined and said that my foreskin is tight, which is causing the pain and recommended circumcision. I agree that the skin is tight and my glans gets swollen during erection and skin is almost impossible to pull down. But, the problem is that during erection the skin is still in its position and I do not attempt to pull it down even then the pain in the glans starts. I remember that around three months back, I masturbated and tried to pull my foreskin down. When I pulled half it got swollen and then I ejaculated. This problem started from that time. So, I am afraid if something went wrong at that time. All other reports are normal such as KUB x-ray, ultrasound and urine routine. I do not know what to do and I am really depressed. Please suggest me something and help me out.","Doctor":"Hi. From your history and findings I am suspicious of chronic prostatitis, which is a longstanding infection of the prostate. It is associated with pain in the perineal region, which is neither mild nor severe. It needs to be confirmed with a per rectal examination in which prostate is painful. It needs to be treated with tablet Septran 960 mg (combination of Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim) twice a day for four to six weeks. Please beware of Sulfa allergy and in which case it has to be avoided. As far as the glans is concerned, you need not worry. It is just balanoposthitis or glans infection with foreskin involvement. If prepuce can be retracted, then it can be left as it is. For further information consult a urologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I wear Essix retainers at night after braces. Recently, I broke my two front teeth and had them bonded. I had to get new retainers and got them from the clinic but my new retainers do not cover my wisdom teeth. I have all 32 of my teeth. Is there a risk of my wisdom teeth hyper erupting?","Doctor":"Hi. The night only wear of retainers will not cause over eruption of wisdom teeth, as during daytime you will have a normal bite. However, you might feel a slight change in bite as you remove your retainers in the morning. It does settle down within a short period. Usually, third molars are not included in the retainers. And patients wear them quite comfortably without any side effects such as over eruption. However, if you feel uncomfortable, you can request the dentist to make a new set of retainers that cover your wisdom teeth as well."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, From the last five weeks, I have had an irritated urinary meatus opening.

I have had two TURPs done about eight years ago with not much success. Anticholinergic drugs do not work Of recent I was going to urinate about nine times at night with an urge to urinate but little urine coming out. I have been to a urologist and the following were the results:  Urine test negative.   Ultrasound with no blockages, prostate normal size, bladder emptying with 20 mL remaining.   Flexible cystoscopy revealed not much blockage in the prostate.   MRI normal after the cystoscopy, I felt burning sensation on the tip of my penis for a couple of days. When that subsided, I decided to have sex after consuming 50 mg of Viagra and while I was erect, I started to bleed. I managed to stop the bleeding.   I did not bleed after that incident but I felt burning sensations in my penis and bladder and it has never been the same as before. I took a course of Nitrofurantoin and later the urine test was negative for any UTI. The burning sensation has not stopped and I am taking Imovane for the last month with Diclofenac for the past few weeks just to fall asleep.

I have been feeling angina for over a month now with the occasional extrasystole, and I cannot focus on my job, I had an ECG done five months ago, and it revealed that everything was going perfect. But I did a new ECG two days ago, and now I am super concerned and can only go to the cardiologist tomorrow. It revealed ischemia in the inferior wall, I believe from what I see, the V1.

Please send the picture of the affected area."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 25-year-old female. I have been struggling with breathing through my nose my whole life. When I was a child, I did not know if others breathed like me or not. I would expand the skin on my cheekbones sideways to open my nasal airways and breathe better for a second. I started investigating the problem maybe four years ago. My health center performed a regular X-ray and reported that I do not have a deviated septum (which I suspected I had). They mentioned I had a slightly enlarged turbinate (do not remember which side). It was too vague, so I tried to ignore the problem for four years. (during these years I have had way too many sore throats and postnasal drip, and I have been tired and exhausted all the time). Now, I am a teacher, and my breathing problem is affecting the quality of my life more than ever.1. I get tired of doing exercise very quickly, so I quit cardio.2. I cannot indulge in mouth-kissing with my husband for more than a few seconds.3. I eat quickly and swallow my food.4. I am fatigued, and I am unable to focus on anything. I feel like I am stupid and simple (while I used to be very creative). I feel tired from inhaling, it feels too tight or clogged in my nasal airways when I inhale. It makes my chest tired because I do not feel like I get enough air in my lungs, sometimes I am so tired that I cry. The exhaling is fine, and it seems to my doctors and me that the air that comes out is more than the air that goes in. My doctor is a bit surprised that I have breathing problems because he used a piece of metal under my nostrils to measure the air that comes out of my nose, and to him, it seemed very normal. Also, it is essential to know that my nose is dry all the time. It is like I do not have mucus unless I eat spicy food or I catch the flu. Other times it just goes straight to my throat. I rarely blow my nose. I have never done any surgery in my life and never had an accident in which my nose was involved. I feel better when I use breathe right nasal strips. I use them during the day at work, and I do not feel embarrassed anymore because I am suffering. When I use Otrivin nasal spray, I got introduced to it by a doctor that I begged for relief. And I became addicted to it for more than two months. I used it almost every day. Then I was reading about it and found out that it is dangerous and addictive and might harm my nose even further so I quit it. Now I only use it once in a while when I have a long day ahead, and I need to be focused or physically active. My recent investigations and doctors. During the last couple of years, I have been to many doctors to arrive at the best diagnosis. At last, one doctor told me that I have a deviated septum and I need surgery to fix it. He also gave me two injections because he said I had an enlarged childhood adenoid, and the injections should shrink it. He did not do a CT scan. I went to two other specialists, and one agreed I had deviated septum and the other thought maybe I need plastic surgery to widen my nostrils. All these three doctors gave me similar medications like antihistamine pills, nasal sprays like Nasonex, both of which I am taking for about a year because of the prescriptions of several doctors. My last doctor had a different opinion. He said that I do not have a deviated septum and proved it with a CT scan. He said I have slightly enlarged turbinates on both sides. He is the one who put a metal under my nostrils to measure the air. He believes that I do not have a severe condition, but I insisted that I do not have a normal life because I cannot breathe. He also gave me antihistamine for one month, Avamys fluticasone furoate nasal spray for two months, saline solution for two months. He told me to wait for 2 to 3 months and see if I improve or prefer to have turbinate reduction surgery. I told him that if I choose the surgery, I would like to go with tonsillectomy with it because of my recurrent sore throats. I searched about the turbinate reduction, and empty nose syndrome scared me a lot as I do not want to worsen my breathing. So I am hesitant. Now I am still thinking, and I thought I would consult other specialists. I will attach samples of CT scan as well. I want to breathe and inhale like ordinary people because I feel it is killing me slowly.","Doctor":"Hello. I need to have a look at the CT to assess how much of a space you have inside the nasal cavities, whether the enlarged turbinates are causing airway compromise, whether there is any adenoid remnant in the nasopharynx, whether there is any polyp or mucosal thickening inside the sinuses. Continue with Avamys, antihistamine and the saline douches. Are you allergic to anything? Have you undergone a skin prick testing to determine what you are allergic to?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter is 12 years old, and she always showed a great deal of anxiety started having a lot of school refusal during 5th grade, so we took her to see a psychiatrist who ultimately diagnosed her with high functioning autism and started her on a Lexapro. School refusal continued, but we managed the school year. When she started 6th grade, she admitted to her school psychologist that she had been hearing voices for about a year. The voices were a group of teens about her age, and they were all very negative. We sought treatment again with another doctor who put her on Risperidone, which failed to control the voices, so she was switched to Seroquel, which also failed after a month. We had a move to another state, so we had to change doctors. The move did not go well with our doctor, and she ended up with a suicide attempt and four acute hospital stays and one long term stay. Her hallucinations are now fully engulfing her days, and they are tactile, visual, olfactory, and audio. She also admitted to an early suicide attempt while she was 10. Her new doctor has tried Abilify, Latuda, high dose Seroquel, and high dose Zyprexa. All have failed. She had also tried depression medications like Trintellix, Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Cymbalta, and Zoloft. Nothing has worked for more than two months. Her current doctor is not willing to try another medication and is telling her to live with her hallucinations. My daughter is 13 and has very little quality of life. In our place, there are minimal resources here, even being well insured and willing to pay out of pocket. I am looking for advice on what to do next. Do I travel out of state, do I visit another type of doctor? It is also important to say that she has been diagnosed with schizophrenia. My husband nor I have any family history of schizophrenia going back about five generations, although I do have mental illness frequently on mine (depression and bipolar). I had a completely healthy pregnancy, and she was born on her due date without complications. She was big at 8lbs 9ounce and 21inches.","Doctor":"Hello. It is common for adolescents with high functioning autism (HFA) to experience high levels of anxiety, especially when they are pushed outside their comfort zone. Many go on to develop hallucinatory experiences like hearing critical voices at this stage when they struggle socially. I presume your daughter had all the relevant investigations like scans and blood tests to rule out any physical causes for her hallucinations. Your daughter has been tried on so many different medications, and you report limited efficacy. In addition to drugs, has she been getting any structured psychological therapy during this period? Modified CBT can help manage voices and other hallucinatory experiences. Try to discuss with your doctor and explore the availability of any skilled therapist with experience of working with HFA kids. CBT can be beneficial but needs patience and may take time. If your daughter is very unwell, she may not be ready but better to discuss with your doctor or therapist to know what is possible? It is paramount that your daughter does not get more isolated. Try to get her doing some educational activity (homework, online classrooms, etc. ). If she likes going online, provide an opportunity to browse with appropriate parental locks and control to prevent her from accessing any inappropriate content. Recovery can be gradual in these conditions. You can contact again if any further advice is needed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I had grommets as a baby, and my old ENT believed that I still had one in my left ear. I have had ringing in my ears, and it is getting to the point where I cannot hear myself think sometimes. Should I see someone new about it?","Doctor":"Hello. Grommet or ventilation tube insertion is done when there is a fluid accumulation behind the eardrum. The reason you would have had this as a child is probably due to adenoid hypertrophy causing eustachian tube dysfunction. Grommets depending on the type usually fall off, and it goes unnoticed unless a long term grommet has been inserted and you are getting yourself checked regularly from an ENT specialist.  Your problem is ringing sensation in the ear associated with deafness can be a result of the same issue for which grommet was primarily inserted. Other causes have to be certainly ruled out. A genuine suggestion would be to get your self examined by an ENT specialist and thereby get to know.

I have never had anything like this before. So sore mouth, sore tongue, and very dry. Is the case that I am short on saliva most definitely. I was recently tested for Diabetes and thyroid, which both returned normal results. I met a nice girl, and we were kissing a lot. It turns out she has herpes on her face. About five days later, I contracted this under my lip. And it was very painful. My doctor confirmed it was herpes. I had not had herpes before. Now in researching. I am wondering is there such a thing as salivary gland infection from herpes? This was when all my problems started. So I am thinking that could this herpes contraction have possibly done something to me and my salivary glands. Right now, I am waking up in the morning dry as the desert. This continues into the day. So something is not right. I am considering Sjogren's syndrome but then happened to stumble upon this salivary gland infection from herpes and thought I better ask.","Doctor":"Hello. Dry mouth due to reduced salivary gland secretion. Yes, herpes may be the reason for dryness affecting the glands. Are you under treatment for hypertension? For salivary flow, rinsing your mouth with warm salt water, sucking on sour lemons or sugar-free lemon candy to encourage.

No, the masturbation is safe to act by a man, and he can enjoy it as many times as he feels. It is not needed to avoid masturbation, and it is not a criminal or an unhealthy habit or taste. All men and women in reproductive age want to relieve sexual desires by natural sex or self-stimulation, which is the masturbation and is fine and harmless. Masturbation is a very common behavior, even among people who have sexual relations with a partner. In one national study, 95 % of males and 89 % of females reported that they have masturbated. Masturbation is the first sexual act experienced by most males and females. In young children, masturbation is a normal part of the growing child's exploration of his or her body. Most people continue to masturbate in adulthood, and many do so throughout their lives. In addition to feeling good, masturbation is a good way of relieving the sexual tension that can build up over time, especially for people without partners or whose partners are not willing or available for sex. Masturbation also is a safe sexual alternative for people who wish to avoid pregnancy and the dangers of sexually transmitted diseases. It also is necessary when a man must give a semen sample for fertility testing or sperm donation. When sexual dysfunction is present in an adult, masturbation may be prescribed by a sex therapist to allow a person to experience an orgasm (often in women) or to delay its arrival (often in men)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have earache for the past two days, not terrible pain but it is still there.

Could you please assess the attached reports and provide a second opinion on the condition and the way forward. Kindly let me know if you need any further details on the same.Few pointers of the routine and habits 1. I do mild exercise. (Play badminton once in two weeks or one week). 2. I do booze (beer) once in two weeks or once in a week. 3. I do not smoke. But I used to smoke 10 years back. 4. I eat non-vegetarian, once or twice in a week. 5. No history of cardiac problems, nor in my family. 6. No abnormal pain in the chest during TMT nor any time during physical activity. 7. Mild gastric pain once or twice in a week. This started about one to two weeks ago, probably due to outside food.","Doctor":"Hello. Although you do not have any symptoms, but your ECG and TMT shows changes. Your echo is also normal. But we cannot neglect your ECG changes which are striking. So it is better to undergo angiography and get it clarified.

Seeing your current report (attachment removed to protect patient identity) there is mild damage to your kidney, and creatinine before four months was also elevated, then it is a slight degree of permanent damage. So the cause of the damage is long-standing bilateral stone can cause gradual damage to the kidney, so it needs evaluation for things, like urine routine, ultrasonography of kidney, test for sugars, blood pressure and if need a kidney biopsy. About workout, you can reduce the frequency of workout but no need to stop completely, if you got a mild degree of permanent damage (CKD), you need to restrict protein intake to 0.7gm/kg/ day, blood pressure monitoring, and kidney stone management.

If you do not have any pain or bleeding per vaginal than there is more chance that with medicines pregnancy has more chance for growth. Irregular gestational sac sometimes can be due to uterine contraction which can be present throughout pregnancy. If this is the case then there is more chance that pregnancy is good and there is more chance for growth. One more reason of irregular sac is also a sign of early abortion. But we can do only these things. Do take complete bed rest. Do minimum activity. Take small frequent meals. Take micronized Progesterone for 2 to 4 times a day 200 mg, Folic acid tablet, and Thiamine or multivitamin tablet. All these will be helpful for growing pregnancy.

Adapalene plus Benzoyl Peroxide gel apply once at night on acne and wash after one hour and do not rub it.

Avoid foods with high glycemic index particularly milk has been found to be associated with increased severity of ane. Also, avoid chocolates and sweets if possible.

But recently I started having it daily. And I always see people harming me and trying to kill me when I have sleep paralysis. I am not able to sleep. I feel like what is going on in my dreams is a reality. I feel like I am in pain. After I try to wake up from that dream. I am unable to sleep. Even if I try to sleep, I again face the same thing. So is it normal to have these types of dreams while you have sleep paralysis at the same time? This is what going on. I cannot figure out. Please help me with this.","Doctor":"Hello. It can be frightening to experience sleep paralysis but generally it is not harmful and can occur in otherwise healthy people. It is common to have hallucinatory experiences like seeing people who wish to harm you when you have sleep paralysis. Do you have any other symptoms? Is there a family history of sleep paralysis? Usually sleep paralysis gets better gradually over time. Follow these simple suggestions as wel 1) Try to get adequate sleep (approximately six to eight hours). 2) Try to have a good sleep routine 3) Avoid heavy meals just before bed time. 4) Have regular exercises. 5) Try yoga, mediation, and relaxation exercises. Since you are reporting regular episodes of sleep paralysis, you need to consult a sleep specialist or a neurologist who can examine you, to rule out conditions like narcolepsy and offer further advice. Sometimes medication may be needed in severe cases. I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 20 years old male. My bodyweight is 48 kg. I want to increase my weight, so now what I should do?","Doctor":"Hello. You need an extra 500 calories a day if you want to put on excess weight in a week. Protein is the key to muscle building. It will help you gain muscle weight rather than fat mass. Good sources of protein are red meat and poultry, eggs, and whole grains. Salmon is high in calories and healthy fats. Best healthy foods help to gain weight fast. Homemade protein smoothies. Drinking homemade protein smoothies can be a highly nutritious and quick way to gain weight. Milk has been used as a weight gainer or muscle builder for decades. You may also include rice, nuts and nut butter, red meats, potatoes and starches, salmon and oily fish, and protein supplements."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am seeing by my top gumline 6 of my teeth have mild abfractions and are changing color from the gumline down.

I went through your query and seen the attached image (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  The image is not clear to determine any specific concerns of yours as color was not visible properly. But as an expert, your teeth looked fine. You need scaling. Do Betadine gargle in lukewarm water.

If it is like that I doubt it to be deciduous can be sure, the image was hazy. Anyways no worry, nothing is dead, so please do not freak out. Stains and calculus.

I had my last period before four months. I had my last sex (unprotected) before two months. I have a white discharge, sometimes, thick, other times watery. Sometimes it is odorless, other times it has kind of a foul smell. I tried having PT three times, and all were negative. What is going on with my body? Some say it is because of my weight gain, and I gain 10 kg in less than a year, I had anxiety and early depression. Someone said it is because of the stress. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to the icliniq.com. The excess anxiety and stress can cause a delayed period. Excess weight gain also can cause a delayed period. So both these factors need to be corrected. You have to lose weight through medication. For behavioral anxiety, counseling will be helpful.  However, thick white discharge points towards candida infection as well. Empirically Clotrimazole vaginal tablet can be used. If the discharge does not decrease, then vaginal swab should be taken for culture. I have given you a possible management option for your case. However, for the pelvic examination, it is advisable to consult a gynecologist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I wanted to understand the bilirubin and sodium alkaline phosphate ranges. I got LFT done for my mother, in that case, itself I want to understand the range. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello. Her indirect bilirubin is slightly high (attachment removed to protect patient identity). And this can happen due to numerous reasons. Most common being anemia, dehydration, mild jaundice, and gilbert syndrome. Further evaluation is required. I would recommend her following blood tests, 1. HbsAg and Anti HCV Antibody for Hepatitis B and C. 2. Complete blood count. Now, as far as Alkaline phosphatase is considered most of the times, it is elevated as a result of calcium and vitamin D deficiency. So I would request for the following tests, 3. 25 hydroxy Vitamin D3 level. 4. Serum calcium. 5. Ultrasound Abdomen. So as such, I do not find anything serious.

Your monocyte count is high and cannot be neglected.The temporary viral infection also can cause high monocyte count. You do not have any symptoms, so temporary mild viral infection might be cause for high monocyte. You have to repeat your full CBC with peripheral smear examination report after seven days. If still monocyte count is high, then you have to consult a hematologist for detailed evaluation. I hope I have answered your question.

I assume all your concerns are based on one tooth. Two scenarios are happening there. 1) The nerve of that tooth might be dead, which is the reason for not feeling any pain and causing discoloration in the same. 2) The nerve is undamaged, and the hole is small with external stains (which causes the discoloration).I would advise you to see a dentist physically and take an X-ray of that tooth, which helps in better diagnosis of the situation.

For example,Urine test: 505 ng/ml THCA.Hair test: 5.95 pg/mg THCA . If there were 32.6 ng/ml cocaine metabolite detected in a urine test, how might that show in a hair drug test? There seems to be a correlation between the THCA levels, but I cannot figure out what the connection might be?","Doctor":"Hello. In the urine, the metabolites are detected as it is directly coming out from the blood. I mean, it gives a day to day excretion of the metabolite, that is directly proportional to the amount of the specific drug or metabolite in the blood. Whereas, the metabolites or drugs in the hair tells the history of any drug or chemical usage. As we know, the growth of hair is very, minimal daily. Certain chemicals or drugs or metabolites can get accumulated in the hair on a long term basis. So, if we could find the THCA (tetrahydrocannabinolic acid) in hair, it is telling the past blood concentration or usage of the THCA. Thus, the hair value may not usually proportional to urine values.

Usually, people who have diabetes, hypertension, liver diseases, thyroid issues will have excessive sweating in feet. Please rule out those reasons. According to naturopathy, excess heat in the body is responsible for such an issue. Repeated cough (respiratory disease), sinusitis, neuropathy, etc. are other causes for excess (indirect) heat in the body.

You can find a counselor in your city or there are many online sites providing the facility. If you cannot do that either, start with journaling, keep a mood journal and start writing what happened and what made you feel bad or when you reacted in a wrong way, what went through your mind.

That this is because the varicocele is not large enough to cause problem for the Doppler to see. I asked the doctor whether I should go for a semen analysis to see if the semen is normal. He says that is a good suggestion to rule out every suspicious of varicocele and my sperm count is normal. I ask him about the swelling close to the testicles, he said, that is normal and I should relax and it will not affect my testicles. Do you think I should be relaxed about this? Is the doctor right?

It is a good option to get your semen analysis done, this will help you to find out if there is any problem with your sperms but will not rule out the cause that is a varicocele. It is advisable to get follow up Doppler at three months interval but I would not recommend surgery just yet, especially, if you have completed a family and you already have children. Surgery is a necessity if your hydrocele increases in size and causes discomfort or a varicocele is found on the Doppler scan of the scrotum, or immediate surgery is advisable if your sperm count is low after ruling out other causes for a lower sperm count. In the meantime, what you can do at home is to provide scrotal support. You can buy it at any pharmacy or if it is not available then you can wear tight underwear. These are just temporary measures until you can get all the tests done. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My query is regarding knee joint and lower back pain.

It nearly had the entire day and the next morning I went to the ER. They did some blood work and a chest X-ray and said I was okay and discharged me.

I saw their lab write-up later on that they posted and the comparison between the two ECGs as written worries me greatly. They did not post the new ECG but based on the little research I did it seems to me like 3.2 potassium could not cause this great of a shift in the ST-T Segment. What is likely going on here?

The tongue numbness is caused by nerve injury or irritation at the time of giving local anesthesia before your tooth removal or even due to the closeness of the roots of your tooth to the nerve bundle. However, this is usually transient and there is a gradual recovery of your nerve function. Since this is the only symptom, there are higher chances of restoration of nerve function. It usually takes six to nine months for complete recovery. There is a small chance that it may be permanent. Also, you can consult your dentist regarding the same. He or she can do a thorough check up of other areas and determine the extent of the numbness. You can also increase the chance of healing by taking a nerve growth factor like Neurobion. You can get it prescribed by your doctor after discussing the problem with him or her.

I have gone through your query and understood your concern. When a tooth decays and when the nerve layer of the tooth is affected, it starts to give out pain and it loses its vitality becoming more brittle. Hence it could have fractured. Also, to save such tooth, root canal treatment will be performed.  Mild pain/discomfort after RCT is quite normal for the next 3 to 5 days for which you would have been put under pain killers. This period is for tooth healing and it is essential that you do not disturb or bite food on that tooth. Once it completely heals, crown procedure is generally performed. Placing a crown over the root canal treated tooth is mandatory to protect the tooth and to prevent further fracture of the tooth. Do visit your dentist for the crown procedure and till that do not eat hard, chewy foods and avoid chewing food on the involved side."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

Yes, it could be inflammation of the esophagus because it has an acute onset. Other possibilities are an esophageal stricture, causing narrowing of the lumen and pain while swallowing. There are various causes of inflammation and stricture of the esophagus, for example, reflux of acid from the stomach, ingestion, secondary narrowing due to a growth of some mass causing compression over the esophagus. One group of motility disorder also causes problems in the esophagus, for that we need barium study and manometry study. In this situation, liquids will cause more problems than solids. So, for that, we need to plan investigations for various etiologies. I suggest you get the following tests done. An endoscopy will be required for the same, and that will give a more clear picture of the esophagus. A biopsy can be taken by this modality, we will do it after the initial reports.

This usually happens in children during tooth eruption, you can continue with PCM drops every 6 hourly for pain and swelling. If severe pain in gums, you can use a pinch of Mucopain gel for local application. Also start a calcium syrup if giving syrup Calcimax P 5 ml twice a day, it would help in tooth eruption."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am getting a cardiac cath this morning. I am currently on Suboxone 12 mg, 6 in AM and 6 in PM. When I asked what they will be using to sedate, they said Fentanyl and Versed. I asked for Profol but got no answer. I spoke to a male nurse, not an anesthesiologist. If the Fenytal overrides the sub will I be in withdraw? Also, are there safety issues combining these medicines? Should I cancel this procedure?","Doctor":"Hi. Usually, for cardiac procedure anesthesiologist will prefer Fentanyl than Propofol because Fentanyl is opioid and it causes good pain relief and sedation and there is a high probability of heart stability and the chances of losing your breath and consciousness with Fentanyl is very less but still you will be made to sleep and remain pain-free. Propofol causes deep sleep. You may lose your complete consciousness, you may lose your breathing and go to mechanical ventilation. So it is always good to go head with Fentanyl and Versed. Your medication will not interfere with the drugs, do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 45 years old.

Earlier, the pain was mild, and she was taking anti-inflammatory and pain killers under orthopedics care. Now, her pain is quite severe, and the pain killer does not provide any relief. We had Doppler study for her legs, and I have attached the report. Please explain the report and which specialty doctor we need to consult?","Doctor":"Hello. I have viewed the prescription and the right lower limb arterial and venous Doppler scan reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The prescription mentions medications and injection given for severe pain and discomfort. The arterial Doppler for right lower limb is showing mild wall thickening of the vessel walls in the right leg and is acceptable for age. The arteries are otherwise showing triphasic blood flow and are normal. The venous Doppler is showing a mild problem in the veins of the right leg, and at one area there is backflow of blood (going to the heart) below the knee posteriorly and is a condition called varicose veins. There is no incompetence of the larger junctions called saphenofemoral junction in the groin and saphenopopliteal junction at the knee. This can be discussed with a general surgeon or vascular surgeon doctor if available, and usually does not need any active treatment at this point. However, the patient can be told to avoid standing for long duration and keep a pillow under the ankle at night to improve the blood flow. Some doctors might suggest wearing compression stockings during the day. For the severe knee problem, an MRI knee will be of help to see if there is fluid collection and effusion or bone and cartilage destruction or ligament and meniscus tear in the knee and if that is causing the problem. For MRI knee, you can discuss with the orthopedic specialist and then get the test done in a place close to you. The x-ray can be normal in some patients, and MRI knee will show the problem areas."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother has diabetics type 2.

In my CTA examination, my upper cervical spine demonstrates some moderate facet arthritis primarily at c2 and c3. It also shows an incomplete fusion of the posterior arch of c1 and mild cervical spondylosis. Also, I have a deformity of the right zygomatic arch related to prior depressed fracture, and I have a small screw in the right lateral zygoma due to the previous injury. Also a mild deformity at the tip of the nasal bone from a prior injury. The paranasal sinuses demonstrate a minimal dependent mucosal thickening in the maxillary antra. This surrounds some roots of some maxillary teeth which extend into the base of the maxillary sinuses bilaterally. Also, mild swelling if the middle turbinate and moderate swelling of the inferior turbinates. Also moderate bowing of the nasal septum. With your knowledge, could any of the above be causing my tinnitus? I do not know who else to turn to or if I am missing something. I am under, 20 mg Prozac per day and 900 mg of Propafenone.","Doctor":"Hello. Cervical spine abnormalities can cause vertigo but not tinnitus. A zygomatic bone fracture can be a cause of tinnitus if it is impinging on the mandible. But that would be more due to chewing and movements of the lower jaw, and sinusitis can also cause tinnitus if it causes otitis media, but then the hearing is also impaired. Have you done a pure tone audiometry?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having panic attacks.

It is painful in some range of motions and have started back at the gym and hurts when under load on an exercise like pec dec. I went to an osteopath who reported below: During an examination, there was pain on lateral flexion of his right shoulder. On observation, during right lateral flexion of the shoulder, his pectoralis looked atrophied and unsymmetrical compared to the left. On palpation, he was very tender on his right pectoralis major tendon and lateral muscle belly. I have therefore diagnosed him with a right pectoralis major tendon and muscle tear.

I am just wondering if not brushing my teeth will affect the stability of the braces.","Doctor":"Hello. I have read through your concerns. Brushing your teeth will definitely improve your oral hygiene and reduces the food accumulation and plaque formation in later stages. If you are not comfortable brushing with braces on, I would advice you to opt for piksters or flossing to remove the plaque that is accumulated overnight. Have a lukewarm saline water rinse every morning to flush the debris out. Why oral hygiene is important is, the plaque can change to hard calculus overtime and definitely disturb the braces and its integrity.

I am wondering if our diagnosis of vocal nodules from vocal abuse actually is stemming from overcompensating to hear at a normal volume.","Doctor":"Hello. Well, the development of speech is definitely related to hearing. Early-onset hearing loss does impair development of speech as it is known that congenitally deaf are also mute. Regarding the other part, vocal abuse is in fact the only cause of vocal nodules.

I suggest you have sexual intercourse around the ovulation time that is between 12-18 th days of the menstrual cycle to achieve conception. Your semen analysis also should be done for primary workup. I hope this will help you. Let me know if I can answer any more questions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I had acne for some time during school period and now have scares from the acne. The scarring left enlarged pores as well. The pores have whiteheads, and my nose has a lot of blackheads as well. My skin is oily in some places like the nose but dry around the cheeks. I was wondering what I should do to get rid off the whiteheads as well as reduce the number of enlarged pores. What treatment should I follow to get rid off the blackheads? I have already used many face washes with blackhead erasing ability, but none of them worked.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your case. The best treatment for acne scar is CO2 (carbon dioxide) laser. No cream will benefit you for the scar. For shiny skin, apply Vitamin C serum at night. For blackhead apply adapalene gel only on blackhead and whitehead with a toothpick in the minimal amount on lesion at night for 20 minutes only. If you take too much, you will have a burning sensation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 33-year-old female. I am generally fit and not obese. My doctor suggested a CT scan for my heart. I am worried about the amount of radiation and contrast dye I will be exposed to. Are there any other tests I can do? And is this test too critical with my other findings? Symptoms started with lower back and pelvic pain, then after a few weeks of abdominal pain, and at the end of my shoulder, sometimes my arms both right and left. I have difficulty in breathing. Pulsating pain in the left side of the body, which moves around. Tinnitus and hemorrhoids on the left side, too. Two episodes of blood in sputum, which lasted for one day each, with one week gap between events back before three months. It did not recur since then. Occasional ketones and blood in urine at the onset of symptoms. Test results: 1. ECG shows incomplete RBBB. 2. ETT shows depression up-sloping. 3. Echo (taken before seven years) shows mild tricuspid regurgitation. 4. Total cholesterol fasting 183 mg/dL. 5. Triglycerides 70 mg/ dL. 6. HDL-Cholesterol 73 mg/dL. 7. LDL-Cholesterol 96 mg/dL.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome on icliniq.com. I passed carefully through your medical history and would like to explain that your symptoms (migrating and pulsating pain) seems nonspecific for any cardiac issue. Also, you have no apparent coronary risk factors (your lipid profile is fine with no known hypertension, you should check your blood glucose level) and your already performed cardiac tests are almost normal. There may be a cardiac CT with a high probability would result healthy without providing any decision making information (you are not in an intermediate pretest probability). Another reasonable and safer diagnostic alternative is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging test (CMR), it utilizes gadolinium-based contrast, which is more benign. You should discuss with your doctor about the issues mentioned above. I hope to have been helpful to you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have an MRI report for my right shoulder. I had a car accident and would like to know if the car accident could have caused the injuries that are in the MRI report. I would also like to know how severe the damage is. I had a steroid injection done a week before the MRI was taken. There is only an image file, not dicom files. I made a mistake while loading the MRI report.","Doctor":"Hello. The three main findings highlighted in the MRI are,  1) Rotator cuff- there appears to be little evidence of a recent trauma with only an intra substance delamination but no tear. And some bursal fraying as adjacent fluid again degenerative is not traumatic. 2) Acromion and subacromial space findings are degenerative and not traumatic. 3) SLAP lesion mentioned could be traumatic and ideally needs to be confirmed arthroscopically as sometimes anatomical variation may mimic the findings. The symptoms that you have mentioned in the arm do not primarily appear to be coming from the shoulder except for the clicking sensation. Is the click painful or only perceived annoyance. Finally, what was the response been to the injection to the shoulder? Was it given intra articularly or subacromial? Have you had an MRI of the neck and has there been any improvement of the sensory symptoms in general. Have you tried Pregabalin?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a semen analysis done two months ago and they found enterococcus faecalis. What causes this? Urologist put me on Amoxicillin and a month later a 2nd analysis showed the bacteria had gone. Just recently they did a fertility test since I am family planning and everything looked good except the round cells. Seems you should not have more than 1 million and I had 11 million. What does this mean towards family planning? Also, does this mean I have an infection again? If so, why did it come back or be there in the first place? What can I do to fix as it stressed on the family planning aspect?","Doctor":"Hello. Relax and do not worry. First of all, why did you have a semen analysis done? For what complaints? Enterococcus fecalis is very rare and may suggest contamination. If other parameters like count, motility, etc., are fine then it is nothing to worry. About round cells (sometimes sperms may also look like round cells). If possible, send me printed report of your semen analysis."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I was just hit on the right side of my neck with a basketball. Part of the basketball hit my chin, so my neck cartilage did not take the entirety of the impact. The basketball was probably traveling around 20 mph, I do not know for sure. As a large object, it probably did not exert that much pressure per area. Regardless, it happened in a fraction of a second. I do not have any noticeable wheezing or any hoarseness right now. However, I have some mild shortness of breath. I do not know whether this is related. Because I also have asthma and silent reflux, I have a pulse oximeter and a peak flow meter, both values of which are normal presently. I have some mild neck pain too. My cough is normal (no blood), and I do not have any difficulty swallowing. Can I wait a couple of weeks to get an indirect nasal laryngoscopy from an ENT in my area, and then depending on the result, symptoms then, get a CT/MRI a week thereafter? Or should I go seek emergency medical care now?","Doctor":"Hello. Normally larynx is well protected by protruding mandible. Most of the impact is received by the sturdy mandible. However, since the impact was on the side of the neck, the laryngeal framework might have received some impact. I would like you to palpate your neck for tenderness and if you can also feel for crepitus of the thyroid cartilage if any. Also, look for any swelling. If there is anything like that or if you develop any hoarseness or dyspnea you may pay a visit to ER. In the absence of these, you can wait and take some analgesics in the meanwhile."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Please help. I have struggled with a chronic yeast infection for at least the past year.

I take an estrogen-based birth control (had yeast infections starting before I was on this) and am mostly gluten-free. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. When yeast infection result occurs positive recurrently then, husband and wife both should be treated at the same time, otherwise, it gets infected to one another. You should keep your private parts clean and dry always. You should wash your vaginal area with Triphala Kwatha twice a day and after drying apply Himalaya Vgel properly. You should take Gandhak Rasayana one tablet with Himalaya Purim one tablet thrice a day after meals. Patrangasava 15 ml twice a day with an equal amount of water after meals.

Now it has stopped. So, my question is why is my endometrium shrinking to 7.7 from 7.9? So my RE said will take a call after two days TVS. So, can you tell me what is going on?","Doctor":"Hello. A change of endometrial thickness from 7.9 to 7.7 mm is minimal and can be due to measuring bias. However, an ET of more than 7 and less than 8.5 mm by mid-cycle is an acceptable thickness for implantation. The medications that you are on are fine and should be continued. There is nothing wrong unless you develop irregular shedding or spots which can justify the loss of endometrial thickness otherwise the likely cause is USG measurement bias. Advise is to get a TVS repeated."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have severe chronic nerve damage pain in my right elbow and arm.

I will request you to share your previous investigations or laboratory and neuroelectromyographic reports to me. Why I am asking about this because of chronic nerve damage due to what and how much nerve damage occurred that we have to clarify. If we can treat the root cause then why should we focus on pain? Still, we gave many options for pain relief. I will suggest Gabapentin 400 mg + Nortriptyline 10 mg once daily for three days, then twice daily. And if still, it is not working, then I will add Duloxetine 30 mg once daily. But, my advise will be to go for a complete evaluation, if not done and if evaluated completely then you can start Gabator NT."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male.

Am I negative for HIV 2 if both tests comes negative after three months of exposure? Please advise.","Doctor":"Hi. The replication of the virus has no relationship in the detection of the virus. If the virus is present in the body, the immune system will detect it, and start defending the body by producing antibodies. This procedure does not need any replication of the virus. It just needs a virus in the body. So, if the fourth-generation test is negative by three months and six months, then you are negative.

Can you please help explain in understandable terms what that would do? I am confused between direct and indirect tests.","Doctor":"Hello.  I am trying to explain to you about the Coombs test. Basically, this test detects antibody-coated red blood cells. The direct Coombs test detects antibody coated on red blood cells. In cold agglutinin disease, the IgM antibody coat the red blood cells. So direct Coombs test is for testing for cold agglutinin disease in which antibody-coated red blood cells can be detected. In this procedure, Coombs serum means AHG is used to detect the antibody. So if direct Coombs test is positive at low temperature (because antibody in this disease bind to red blood cells at low temperature) then it suggests cold agglutinin disease. However, clinical correlation in the form of liver and spleen palpation should be done along with peripheral smear examination report for further workup."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a C-section delivery last month.

Your tummy fat is dissolving which was accumulated during pregnancy. Your uterus is also sinking that is why your tummy appearance is like this. It might take a couple of months to get it normal.

Is it painful? Any discharge from this point? Any bleeding? Is there any history of injury over there? Any fever? Or anything similar anywhere else over the body? As it more likely seems to me as something which is in the healing phase and also may have become purulent (filled with pus) (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I am not quite sure about the diagnosis as I am just seeing it in the picture and not directly. It would be better if you see your local doctor and get a full examination done.

I am a patient that has done well on them in the past and is struggling to mange my ADHD without them. The psychosis happened last year during a period of social isolation.","Doctor":"Hello. You have raised a very pertinent question. Stimulant medication can raise the risk of relapse in psychotic symptoms. If psychotic symptoms were clearly treatment-emergent, generally it is not advisable to try stimulants again.

Never really treated until age 72 (anesthesiologist requirement prior to cataract surgery). Lisinopril 20 mg and Amlodipine 10 mg. Continued until age 76 with doctor altering dosage and frequency as that medication gradually seemed to lose effectiveness. At that point, intermittent racing heart beat and arrhythmia began to develop, accompanied by total loss of stamina (and sometimes near-fainting and nausea) after about five minutes of any sort of physical exertion. Based on his ECG tape, PCP diagnosed that as a-fib and did a cardiologist referral. Cardiologist looked at that same tape and said it is not a-fib. Might be any one or six or seven other things, but I cannot diagnose it when it is not happening. Next time it happens, go right over to your PCP and have them do an ECG, then come back here with the tape. That did not seem to make much sense. Thinking that might have been caused by the long-term use of Amlodipine, the PCP switched medications to Verapamil 180 mg and Carvedilol 6.2 mg. Those symptoms then seemed to go away for a while. Meanwhile, I experienced a ruptured Achilles tendon, and a minor Lacunar stroke (which permanently disrupted the pressure sensitivity of the skin on my left side from head to toe.) When the racing heartbeat and arrhythmia began to return intermittently about a year ago, I then discontinued all medication. The racing condition is now more or less constant, with the arrhythmia seeming to come and go (I can observe this using a mirror to view the right-side of my neck), the lack of stamina now seemingly permanent, a slight swelling of the lower legs and feet, shortness of breath upon reclining, and chronic insomnia. I am reluctant to get involved with the PCP again, expecting the same routine, rushing in for a quick examination (they give him 11-minutes), scheduling a bunch of laboratory tests at the local hospital and maybe another referral to the cardiologist, all with the same ultimate result, since these providers, well-intentioned as they might be, are not really allowed enough time to evaluate the problem and make a studied diagnosis..","Doctor":"Hello.  I understand your concern and would recommend checking thyroid hormone levels for possible thyroid gland dysfunction and continue taking antihypertensive medication. Regarding possible arrhythmia, I would recommend performing an ambulatory 24 to 48 hours ECG monitoring in order to investigate for possible arrhythmia. In the meantime, I would recommend continuing taking baby Aspirin and performing a lot of physiotherapies. Sertraline can help improve your situation too, as it helps increase serot onin levels."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have lost sexual interest in my spouse and I do not get an erection at the thought of making love to her.

I am a female, 18 years old. I started ADD medication in 8th grade. Then I fell into depression and had severe anxiety which I believe the ADD medications had a big contribution to, so I went on antidepressants. I also had OCD at the time. After a year of all the medicines, I went off all of them because I thought that they were ruining my life. Now I am entering the senior year of high school, and with all the applications I have to do for college, I really need to be able to focus. Now, every time I take the medicine, my anxiety gets worse and I feel down, helpless, overwhelmed and unable to do anything I need to do, even though I am stressing out about it, like I am avoiding my fears. I did some research online and I saw an article saying how anxiety disorders can be mislabeled as ADD. I have always had a procrastination problem, not so much focusing. I am very disorganized, forget things easily, restless, etc., but can those symptoms be from an anxiety disorder? I am notorious for not getting tasks completed simply because I am overwhelmed by the idea of it. I want to get them done, but my mind is so scared that it refuses to go near the subject. It seems like every time I take any kind of ADD medicine, my anxiety worsens, and so I cannot do anything like sit down and study. I am overall confused about if I have ADD, an anxiety disorder, or am just a lazy or emotionally weak person.","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, you are right. People misinterpret anxiety as ADD. First thing is that anxiety disorders are much more common than ADD in the adult population. Adult ADD is usually the residual or continuation of childhood ADD. So, if you did not have childhood ADD then there is very less chance of you having ADD. The restlessness of anxiety has a cognitive component in the form of frequent worries, apprehension, etc. So if there is a cognitive component as well then there is a chance of you having an anxiety disorder is more. A detailed diagnostic workup is essential to confirm the diagnosis. You should take a psychiatric consultation again."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

My understanding is that there is little to no peer-reviewed scientific studies to support this claim, but I am still worried, as I am sexually active and take 3 mg of Melatonin each night (and I am on the progestin-only pill). I am looking for a doctor to weigh in on this issue.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern here and you are right that there are not many or in fact hardly any articles or peer-reviewed papers on Melatonin and birth control interactions. But I would like to keep it simple for you to understand. Melatonin is produced during the night to ease the sleep pattern in humans post-sunset with maximum levels at 9 PM and by morning 9 AM, the levels found are almost negligible. So, it is produced by the pineal gland in the dark cycle and metabolized at night by the liver. Now liver also is known to metabolize the birth control pills be it progesterone-only or combinations pills. Hence, if taken together then there is a likelihood of slower metabolism of either compound and thereby prolonged residual effect may be seen on concurrent use of pills and Melatonin together. The effects could be prolonged sleepiness and also Melatonin induced increased progesterone levels in the body causing bloating and noticeable progestogenic side effects. However, the efficacy or effectiveness of the pill is not compromised but metabolism is delayed as Melatonin competes with the pill with the liver. So ideally the better way would be to switch the POP in the morning hours and the Melatonin pill at night 12 hours apart. This would prevent any interference with either action on the body or cause any interaction."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis.

As the urine pregnancy test are all negative after one month post last protected sex and also that you had a withdrawal bleed post Unwanted 72 intake, so chances of pregnancy are negative. You are for sure not pregnant. The presence of excessive creamy white vaginal discharge is likely indicative of vaginal candidiasis and if there is a foul smell present as well, then the likely cause is added bacterial infection with fungal infection (mixed vaginosis). The same can be confirmed by a high vaginal swab culture at a gynecologist's clinic and can be treated with antifungals and antibiotics course for a week. Also recommended is to use Alkaline vaginal washes to keep the vagina infection free."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I just saw your pin about tear drop cells. I am trying to understand the meaning of this. Recently my 4 years old son had a CBC and the RBC was abnormal, he has tear drop cells 1+, schistocytes 1+, crenated cells 1+, stomatocytes 1+, schistocytes 1+, macrocytic 1+, microcytic 1+, poikilocytosis 1+, anisocytosis 1+. Please help me to understand this.","Doctor":"Hello. The presence of crenated red blood cells, schistocytes, tear drop cells and stomatocyte is suggestive of hemolytic anemia. The G6PD deficiency, spherocytosis, immune hemolytic anemia, etc., are some of the causes for that. Microcytes and macrocytes could be due to anemia. It is called dimorphic anemia which might be due to iron or B12 deficiency. I suggest you investigate further with full CBC, reticulocyte count, serum LDH estimation, DCT for primary work up. You can Consult a nearby pediatrician for detailed evaluation."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My baby girl is 7.5 months old and suffering from diarrhea since yesterday.

It is very important to maintain hydration of the child by giving ORS (as per the weight of the child) with each loose stool. It is not advised to use any medications that stop the loose motions immediately in such a small child due to the risk of widespread infection. Give the child the above medications and you should see results in 3 to 4 days. Till then watch for dehydration, lethargy and refusal to feed. If at any point of time you feel the child is dehydrated, please get the child evaluated physically by a pediatrician."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My little brother is 20. He was previously smoking marijuana not sure what kinds in his social circles. This was about a year ago from now. Ever since then he has never been the same.

I am a 46-year-old male. I have been in hospital a couple of times recently, in their judgment I was quite unwell (paranoid about spooks after certain events), diagnosed with schizophrenia (though I am not sure, although I was extremely paranoid), and they put me on a CTO for injections of Paliperidone, which I have been on for the last 18 months or so. 100mg I believe for 6 to 12 months, then 75 mg for six months, and now on the lowest dose that it comes in and have been completely free of thoughts of spooks for nine months, so I am well. But I notice that I seem to be a little zombified due to the effects of the drug, and am worried about Dopamine impact (an important chemical), and frankly, I would like to try to help restore Dopamine to a healthier level. I am not sure that is going to happen naturally, so was wondering about a low dose of a Dopamine agonist like Ripinirole for perhaps a year or so, to get things moving in the right direction. Whether this would actually help restore dopamine function though I am not sure. Also, it can increase the chance of psychosis, hence the preference for low dosage. What I am after then is some brief comment on whether you would recommend this or not (at a glance), or something else. Any comment would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi. Taking Dopamine agonist to restore dopamine level in the brain after giving antipsychotics for schizophrenia is not a suitable choice because of relapse of psychotic symptoms or exacerbation of symptoms not only psychotic symptoms but mood symptoms, these side effects are called extrapyramidal symptoms which can be managed to give anticholinergic medications along with antipsychotics, better to visit your treating doctor to have healthy discussion on this."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have an 80-year-old grandmother who went in for a triple heart bypass a year back.

Getting rid of these fluids is dependent on knowing the cause of its accumulation. She may need to increase the dose or change to intravenous diuretics (to be taken in the hospital). We should check also protein levels in the blood and liver and kidney functions. Follow up with cardiologist. Treating the cause is mandatory to prevent further attacks."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Today, I felt something strange which I cannot understand. Normally, I sleep in the late morning.

It can be due to semen hyperviscosity (SHV). Common in 12 to 29 % of men and can lead to male infertility.  Semen is composed of proteins essential to the coagulation and liquefaction of semen. Hypofunction of the prostate or seminal vesicles causes increased viscosity of seminal fluid- can be diagnosed by rectal examination of the prostate or doing an ultrasound pelvis and scrotum. Infection increasing leukocytes may also result in the development of SHV. Oxidative stress and biochemical and genetic factors also aggravate. Hyperviscosity semen does not have proper movement in the female reproductive tract and can lead to decreased sperm count. SHV is treated with a hypodermic needle, mucolytic enzymes, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents depending on the cause. Share more details- your ultrasound report, blood report or hormonal studies done."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I fell down from bike 10 days back and since then I am unable to walk properly.

This can also be treated non-operatively by physiotherapy and muscle strengthening of the hamstrings. However, this does not fully compensate for the ligament loss. If you still have symptoms of knee buckling after physiotherapy then also it is an indication of surgery. If you do not get operated, then your chances of developing late osteoarthritis increases which may later require surgery.

Please give me detailed information about what is the risk of getting this disease. Also, can this disease be contracted by touching object which could have been contaminated like door handles, etc.? Can it be contracted from the ground or soil?","Doctor":"Hello It is very commendable of you to find out more about this disease. A lot of stigma is associated with the disease and its sufferers. Common public just sees those people as untouchables or a taboo. It is a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The organism is similar to TB bacteria and so their treatments are also similar and run for months together. But the treatment and drugs are not the same. The laprosy bacteria produces lesions in skin, mucous membranes, eyes, nerves and tissues. Gradually untreated lesions spread inside and affect nerves causing their swelling and loss of sensation. Slowly the body resorbs the extremities and thats why you see a lot of untreated patients having loss of digits and toes. You might have found a lot of people with saddle nose deformity also. The transmission of leprosy with what is known occurs after prolonged and close contact with untreated leprosy patients over months. It doesn't spread that easily or fast. You dont contract it from ground or soil. You dont get it if you touch an object touched by a leper. Nor would you get the disease if you hug the patient. There is very minimal to no risk in contracting the disease from patients who are outside. However, avoid prolonged contact with the patients. Wear a mask always when you are outside, considering the current situation. Recently there is some evidence suggesting the disease may be spread by droplets, like sneezes or coughs or bodily fluids. But nothing has been concluded. It is best to avoid close personal contact with a patient and wear a mask to prevent droplet infection. Treatment of the disease involved multidrug therapy for long durations. With adequate therapy the disease is curable.

Based on your symptoms, you seems to have a urinary tract infection. The treatment is a full course of antibiotics which ranges from three to seven days depending on the severity of symptoms. Antibiotics usually give symptomatic relief in 24 hours but it takes minimum three days to clear the infection completely. As you had stopped the medication in between, you most likely have a persistent UTI (urinary tract infection). You will have to finish your antibiotic course and in your case, it is better to take for five days because it is a residual infection. If you still have symptoms after completing your antibiotic course, it would be necessary to further investigate with a urine culture and ultrasound.

I started having intense, sharp, constant pain behind my right eye, right temple area and backside of the right side of my head. It started before three months for once a week for the first three weeks. Then, I started having the sharp pain the every other day. And now, it happens every day. It is a very intense, sharp, constant and persistent pain. It gets very painful during the night-time. I went to get it checked out when it started occurring every other day. I do not have any other symptoms like vomiting, light sensitivity, etc. I just have pain in my head. Initially, my doctor prescribed me Fioricet. She asked me to get a CT scan, which ended up showing nothing. After that, she prescribed Sumatriptan and it had little effect. Then, I had an MRI done. The MRI showed that I had a little bit of sinus on the left side of my head that is near my eyebrow. She said that it was probably unrelated to my head pain and she prescribed me two weeks of antibiotics (Amoxicillin and Clavulanate potassium 875 mg) for the sinus and decided to refer me to a neurologist for my head pain. Once I started taking the antibiotics, my head pain basically went away. 12 out of the 14 days I took the antibiotics and I was pain-free. Two days of the 14 days, I still had pain. When I ran out of the antibiotics, the miserable intense, sharp pains came back. So, I made another appointment to see if I could get some more of the antibiotics. I told her that the antibiotics had a huge effect in leaving me pain-free on 12 out of the 14 days when I took them. She said that was really good and that I probably just needed to be on the antibiotic longer to completely eliminate my symptoms. So, she prescribed me the same antibiotic with the same dosage for the next three weeks. I started taking them for the past two days, but the antibiotics are having no effect on me whatsoever now. My head pain is still very intense. I do not understand the reason. I originally thought I had cluster headaches. Then, I thought the sinuses that showed up on my MRI scan were linked to my head pain since the pain went away when I took the antibiotics. But now, the antibiotics are not working. What is wrong with me? What causes intense, sharp never ending pain on the right side of my head? When it hurts the most, it is always on the back right side of my head. The pain is literally always in the same exact spot. This is the most pain I have faced ever in my life. I have had this for almost three months now. I am only 24 years old. It is so agonizing and exhausting. I have been taking Tylenol every 6 hours every day for three months. I know that is not good for my liver. This head pain is affecting my daily life. I hope my neurologist can make a clear diagnosis when I go and see him in two days. My life has been a living hell in the last three months. I am worried if it is something chronic or something wrong with a nerve or blood vessel. I just want the pain to stop.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your symptoms well. Actually, what you have is cluster headache only. Your symptom profile fits into the classic description of cluster headache. The relief with antibiotics was a mere coincidence. The pain of sinusitis has totally different pattern than what you have. The treatment is Triptan group of medicines as acute treatment. I mean the treatment when the episode of headache starts. Sumatriptan is more effective when given IV (intravenous). Zolmitriptan 2.5 mg is effective as intranasal spray. It delivers 2.5 mg per spray maximum allowed dose in a day is 10 mg. I think when you have headache Zomig spray would be better than oral Sumatriptan. The second treatment is prophylaxis. It can be taken even when you do not have a headache. I suggest tablet Topiramate 50 mg twice a day after food. This is to prevent episodes of cluster. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent.

I do not know if it was because I had to lift a three-gallon bottle for a long stance, or due to my anxiety issues. There is no weakness or atrophy as could be the case with ALS.

The main symptom I noticed was pain and discomfort in my lower right wisdom tooth. The tooth is half in and half out. I scheduled an appointment with my oral surgeon but would like some advice. I noticed yesterday that the lymph node almost behind my jaw on the side of the infected tooth was swollen and painful to touch. Then today, I noticed the lymph node under my chin was extremely large and painful to touch as well. It was not like that yesterday. Because of that, I went into an urgent care and he prescribed me Penicillin and painkillers. I have only taken one Penicillin pill over these past few hours. I started to do more research on the topic and came across multiple reputable websites stating that if you have swollen lymph nodes with pericoronitis to go to the hospital. I am wondering if I need to go this evening or if I can wait until the morning and discuss it with my oral surgeon.","Doctor":"Hi. Pericoronitis itself is usually painful mainly because of food entrapment between the gums and the half-erupted tooth along with inflammation there. The swollen and painful lymph nodes are nothing but indications of persistent infection. It does not mean that you have to rush to the hospital in this case. Once the infected tooth is pulled out and the gums heal normally, the lymph nodes get back to normal. The only case when you should be much concerned is that big swelling of the cheek which is visible on the face. You had mentioned that you had tablet Penicillin and painkillers. This is alright, it helps the infection go down a little bit while you wait for your appointment. But ideally, active dental treatment along with antibiotic coverage would be most helpful. You could as well continue Penicillin for at least five days three times daily and painkillers whenever you have pain. You can absolutely wait until your appointment for the scheduled extraction.

The pain is radiating from the lower back to the buttocks and both legs. There is a tingling sensation after exercise and walking. Before five years, I had a bad episode of back pain with sciatica. I was told that it was a slipped disc but did not get a scan. Since then I have had odd flare-ups, but nothing serious until a month ago. Now, I was diagnosed to have a high grade 1 spondylolisthesis, and the disc as that level is almost gone. It means the bones started to fuse, although there seems to be a small gap on the scan. I was told that it would be better to let it self-fuse instead of having an operation. The exiting nerve roots are narrowed at this level, but no problem with the spinal canal itself. I was wondering how long would take for the vertebra to self-fuse? Are there any disadvantages or future problems? I am in constant pain, and my quality of life is not great because of this issue.

I am a 47-year-old unmarried, not-sexually active, uncircumcised male, 5’10”, 190 pounds. I have a history of ulcerative colitis (which seems to be hereditary). This was corrected 12 years back when I received a total colectomy and pouch replacement (that is bowel removed, and new bowel constructed out of small intestine). That seems all good. For some time (five years), I have experienced a very slight pain or irritation at the base of the glans of my penis. Friction (eg., masturbation) would make it sore, but it was very slight. Some redness in the skin just below the glans, but not always. Did not even consider this a problem (and it might not be the problem, I am just mentioning it). Six months back the glans of my penis became inflamed. This was the start of my problems. No bumps, no itchiness, no scaling skin. Just redness on the bottom half of the glans, and also the tip. It got very sore. If it was never touched, it does not hurt at all. However, it rubs the underwear during the day, and that can be very painful. Not always, but most of the time. The pain can be excruciating. I want to emphasize that the rash has never been itchy. Urinating causes no pain. I consulted my family physician and he did not know what it was but said he could treat it like a yeast infection. So he prescribed some antifungal cream with 1 % Hydrocortisone (Clotrimaderm) and when that did not do anything, suggested the 1 % HC might be getting in the way, so prescribed straight anti-fungal over the counter anti-fungal cream (all the creams I have used twice a day). No help. The 1 % HC did relieve some (a little) of the pain but did not actually fix anything. Thinking maybe the problem was not fungal, but perhaps bacterial, my doctor then prescribed Polysporin ointment. I quite by accident bought the version of Polysporin with Lidocaine. The Polysporin also did not fix the problem, but the Lidocaine brought some relief! The pain was lessened, but as I said, the problem was not fixed. I used Lidocaine for two weeks before going back to the doctor to let him know the problem remained. He then recommended a urologist, so I got a referral to a urologist. The urologist did not know what it was but suggested two possibilities: go see a dermatologist or get a circumcision. My family doctor did not think the circumcision would help, so he referred me to a dermatologist. The dermatologist said the rash was non-contagious and non-cancerous. He prescribed me four creams which I was to try, in sequence one at a time, for a week at a time, and let him know which helped. They were Ketoderm 2 %, Fucidin 2 %, Noritate 1 %, and Hydroval. I tried each of these as directed. None of these helped. The ones with some HC 1 % relieved some of the pain, but the rash is currently as bad or worse than when the problem started. The dermatologist said there was nothing else he could do, and recommended I get another appointment with a different urologist. The dermatologist did a swab and sent it to the lab, and it came back negative. He also had earlier said it was not an STI. As you can imagine, I am not very encouraged. My doctor does not seem to know what is up, and neither does the urologist or dermatologist. Can you give me some suggestions as to the cause and the remedy for my rash?","Doctor":"Hi. Depending on the symptoms you have mentioned, and all the treatment you have taken with no much help, I can list few possibilities though it is difficult to comment without seeing the picture. Since it is bothering you for few months, I strongly feel this condition would need shave biopsy of skin to know the exact nature of the problem so that treatment can be targeted for the cause instead of treating it with antibacterial or antifungal or topical steroids. Hope your blood glucose is within normal limits, if not it strongly favors candidal balanitis which may not respond to only topical anti-fungal but needs oral antifungal medicine.

It has taken some time to pinpoint, but it seems like these behavioral changes may correlate with when I began taking the medication. Prior to starting Levetiracetam, I had two grand mal seizures about 12-15 months apart. I frequently had what were diagnoses as epilepsy-related auras. Since I have been taking Levetiracetam, I have not had any more seizures or auras. I am happy the medication is working, but I am interested in advice about other possible medications or non-prescription treatments.","Doctor":"Hi. Your assumption is right, Levetiracetam causes behavioral disturbance as a side effect. There are two options now, 1. To taper off the Levetiracetam - if you have not experienced any seizure or aura in the last four years then we can go straight away with gradual tapering of the medicine, for that we need to know the last seizure/ aura episode, but with this, there is a risk of recurrence, you need to be cautious and under the watch of someone for few months. 2. Substitute Levetiracetam with Sodium valproate - in this risk of seizure is less, but still, it is there, on the fact the Sodium valproate is a mood stabilizer.

Acid reflux, also known as GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), is a condition related mostly to the esophageal sphincter incompetence. Low to moderate grades of GERD are treated first with antacid drugs, which is the best and the first non-invasive solution. Severe cases require surgery to reinforce the sphincter. As for the pineapple, there are controversial opinions among doctors. Some of them do not recommend it because it is a highly acidic fruit and can worsen the symptoms. While others recommend it as it may have good effects due to Bromelain. You can try it for a week and see how your heartburn goes through. If you decide to avoid drugs and use foods, then I would recommend you high calcium foods and basic ones such as milk, which buffer the acids. Also, you have to eat in small portions several times, avoid spicy, fatty and acidic foods and also avoid late evening meals. Use antacids if these measures fail.

I started my second week of the pack that day. During intercourse I felt pain, which never happened before. On 30th, when I was showering, I saw a rusty brown color discharge from my vagina and panicked immediately. When I continued to wipe my vagina a light brown, tan tinge appeared on the paper. Again on 31st, I saw a brown tinge on the toilet paper. Today, my urine color was brown initially and then became lighter. My period is not due now. I do not want to get pregnant. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. The brown rusty vaginal discharge appears to be one of the side effects of Tri-Sprintec (combination of Norgestimate and Ethinyl estradiol). Irregular periods, unscheduled bleeding and vaginal spotting are side effects during the first few months of starting Tri-Sprintec. Another theory may also explain this unscheduled spotting. 26th of last month was close to your ovulation date on which you had intercourse and 30th coincides closely to the implantation date on which you may have vaginal spotting while implantation of the embryo occurs. But again the above theory is highly unlikely as you have been on oral contraceptive pills for a long time and they cause anovulatory cycles that is no egg will be formed or released. So for now hope for the best and wait for your periods. Stay optimistic. If you do not get your periods, then get a UPT (urine pregnancy test) done.

Upon taking the radiograph, a number of small abnormalities in the pelvis were seen. At first glance, they appeared to be stones, but after taking repeat X-rays, one week later, the small circular spots have not moved at all. A urinalysis was ran and came back completely normal. I suffer from irregular periods but other than that, I am in good health.","Doctor":"Hi. I assume the radiographs were taken to evaluate any calculus, stone along the urinary tract. However, the small opacities seen in the pelvis are phleboliths within the veins of your pelvis and not stones. These phleboliths would not cause any discomfort to you and are asymptomatic. With irregular periods, I would recommend a pelvic ultrasound with KUB also to evaluate post void residue which can cause recurrent sub-clinical UTI. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, For the last 3-4 years I have been getting occasional autophony. This usually occurs during physical exercises like running etc., or when in college or when I am with my friends. It is very irritating to listen to my own voice echoing in the ear and also I do hear my own heart beat and breathing sounds. But, occasionally when I suspect something has opened in my ear, I hear a mild pop sound. I searched in the internet about the same symptoms and found it to be patulous eustachian tube. And I think that is the problem which I am suffering from. I have seen an ENT doctor and told him about my problem. But I think he is treating me for plugged ears and after about a month of treatment, the autophony is coming rarely. If I stop taking medicines the autophony will start occurring more frequently. Now I do not get autophony because I am taking medicines. But a small sensation of heaviness remains throughout the day. And whenever I yawn, the pop sound occurs giving back some autophony and a lot of heaviness which reduces over some period of time like 20 minutes. If I apply a little pressure by closing the mouth and blowing the nose very slightly, I instantly feel pressure on the ear drums and lot of heaviness in both the ears. What should I do, so that autophony does not start again? I also want to get rid of this little heaviness I feel in my left ear.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your entire history and understood your problem. Autophony is the unusual hearing of one's own voice and even breathing sounds. You have two issues:- The treatments offered to you also shows the same thing. Let us understand the problem first. Eustachian tube is the tube that connects the middle ear to the throat. Normal functioning of eustachian tube is essential to maintain proper ventilation of the ear. If it does not function or malfunctions, it leads to sense of fullness or heaviness in the ear which you have been having. Patulous eustachian tube is a condition in which the eustachian tube remains open most of the time. It recovers by itself over a period of time. However, if it persists for a long time, in that cases minimal cauterization of the opening can be done endoscopically. But this is rarely needed. Regarding malfunctioning of the tube, a small procedure called myringotomy (surgical procedure of making a small incision in the eardrum to relieve pressure) and ventilation tube insertion in the ear will help, as you are suffering for a long time. In this, the ventilation tube is fixed in the ear and that serves the purpose of ear ventilation. Till then, you will have to continue steam inhalation at least once a day in the evening for 3-4 months. You will also need to take a decongestant tablet. Take tablet Febrex plus one tablet in the evening for 10 days followed by tablet Montair Lc once a day for one month. Avoid exposure to air blast and cold exposure. For further follow up, consult an ENT otolaryngologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 68 year old male. My height is 5'4\\" and weight is 142 lbs. I stopped smoking at the age of 38. I drink on an average of half bottle of beer a day at most. I do prepare my own food, which is mostly organic. I eat meat, egg, little dairy, vegetables, a fair amount of raw food, seeds, nuts, fruit, practically no sugar and very little flour. I am passing regular stools for twice or thrice a day. I am doing about 10,000 to 15,000 steps per day. Six days ago, I got stabbing chest pain on the left side just under the nipple. It was internal and not external. It has happened occasionally all my life, but very briefly and not often. This has persisted for six days. It seems to kick in with exertion, goes away entirely at night. I am mostly free of it all day today, but a very little exertion brought it back even though I walked a couple of miles with no problem. It comes and goes. It does not really hurt unless I breathe deeply. I can cough and sneeze without making it worse. And, there is no external sensitivity. I went to my dentist this week and my BP was 137/82 mmHg and pulse was 79. That was fairly consistent with what I was getting at several weeks ago. My highest BP was about 150/89 mmHg and pulse was 89 bpm. I am not on any regular medication.","Doctor":"Hi. As your chest pain and heaviness is related to exertion (walking) a possibility that it is of cardiac origin cannot be neglected. A very important feature of stable angina is angina on exertion. The stabbing pain and dull nature, which can better be termed as chest heaviness that starts on exertion like walking or climbing upstairs and goes away on taking rest. Your blood pressure is mostly in prehypertensive state, but your maximum systolic (upper) BP is grade 1 systolic hypertension. Your body mass index is high. Also, you were a smoker till the age of 38. Smoking is a sole risk factor for all sorts of cardiac ailments and especially coronary artery disease. As you have never checked your lipid profile, we cannot comment on your cholesterol and triglyceride level. Your age is in the late 60s and the natural presentation of coronary artery disease starts after the age of 55 in males. In short, your case can be summed up as risk based on the facts of increased BMI, ex-smoker, non-vegetarian and mild hypertension. I would consider it as angina on exertion and associated with on and off dyspnea (breathing problem) on exertion. As you have not mentioned any history of gastritis, heartburn, peptic ulcer, anxiety, lack of sleep, disturbed sleep cycle and muscular sprain (as all of them can mimic the cardiac pain), my suggestion is to get an ECG, 2D echo and treadmill test done. Consult your specialist doctor and take the above medicine. Once it gets confirmed as cardiac origin, then discuss with your doctor and take the medicines mentioned below with consent. Stable angina. ECG, 2D echocardiogram, lipid profile and treadmill test. Angina associated with dyspnea on exertion. Revert back with the reports to a cardiologist online.--->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 30-year-old woman. I am having OCD since I was 12 years old. I have a strong fear of an event that happened a couple of years ago when a psychiatrist told me that I have a borderline disorder and have no fantasy. I was trying to ask her for years to say me the opposite as a compulsion. She refused to do that, I am not sure if it is because she did not want to change her opinion or it is because she did not want to satisfy my compulsion. My mother was encouraging me to do these kinds of compulsions as she thought it is going to get worse. It was a bad thing as she was validating my fears in this way. I just realized these things now so I started to confront my fears about what the psychiatrist said to me. But I ran into another one which is about what if my mother is right and if I am confronting my fears it is going to get worse. What do you think?","Doctor":"Hello. My first question is whether you are currently on medication for OCD or not. If your obsessions are bothering you that much, first you need to start medications because the content of your obsessions is a second factor when it comes to treatment, first we need to focus on not having an obsession which will be possible with medication. Secondly about your compulsion to have a second opinion, what you can do is find a therapist which will help you and teach you techniques to overcome this need. CBT is a great tool in that way . Enabling an obsession is never a good idea, you need to learn ways to cope up with them without acting on it."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am concerned about my only daughter whose age is 3.5 years. She is going to preschool for past one year now. She is well in her studies. She is very mischievous and lively chatterbox in our home. But she cannot mingle with outside society. She is reserved in her school. She does not participate in group activities and remains firmly standing at one place when pressurized to do so. Whenever some outsider asks something, she remains quiet. Even when her name is asked, she did not answer. Recently we went for a high school interview. Madam asked her questions whose answers were known to her but she did not answer a single word. Her father and I repeatedly told her to answer but she did not. In this context, it is to say that I am also a quiet person but that did not hinder me from mingling with the outside world. Her father is also reserved both at home and outside. But our child is talkative at home and quiet outside. Please tell me a way out of her problem.","Doctor":"Hello. From your description, it looks like your daughter is socially anxious and presenting with a mild form of selective mutism. Sometimes, they will be completely not able to speak to anyone in a social setting. Mostly they will be able to speak or whisper to some familiar people. With support, she will be gradually able to become confident and talk well outside the home as well. It may take months, sometimes longer. So we have to be patient in this situation and support her as your daughter also will be anxious and frustrated. We have to remember that she does not do it intentionally but is a result of anxious or reserved temperament. Follow these steps to support your child. 1. Do not make her feel pressurized to talk all the time she is outside. Be supportive. 2. Create opportunities to chat in small social settings. Initially 1:1 chat with a known person in a park or temple. Once she feels comfortable, move to small groups. Be patient. 3. Praise her even if she says 1 or 2 words. Even whispering is okay. 4. Gently expand her comfort zone by mingling with her peers. Most children will get better gradually. If the problem persists or worsens in spite of these supportive measures, consult your pediatrician for an assessment. Sometimes speech and language therapy input may be needed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Testicular biopsy and micro TESA could not find a mature sperm and FSH is high.

Maybe your fiance is suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder. There is an obsessive fear of getting pregnant, which is arising out of this illness. Repeated handwashing is also a type of compulsive act results from obsession.

Factor V Leiden mutation puts you on high risk for the development of thrombosis.  It is a common cause of congenital thrombosis. Thrombus can be resolved by anti coagulation medication.

Root canal treatment usually takes three to five visits. However, pain virtually vanishes from the second visit onwards.

The ECHO report shows as follows, ECHO diagnosis RWMA, trivial MR, grade I LV diastolic dysfunction, no pericardial effusion or clot. Now doctor had advised me to for angiography to see the exact one. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). In ECG, there is RBBB (right bundle branch block), and ECHO shows RWMA (regional wall motion abnormality) and mild LV systolic dysfunction. There is a mild cardiac dysfunction, so you should undergo coronary angiography rather than CT as there is evidence of blockages on echo. We must address those blockages to prevent further decline in heart function. Your medicines are fine, but it would be better if you can request your doctor to add beta-blockers like Metoprolol to improve the heart function. Also, your sugars are entirely uncontrolled, which has played an important role in causing these blockages. So, sugars should be well controlled. Continue to have daily walking or brisk walking. Low calorie and a low oily fatty diet. Also, you should start regular medicines like Aspirin and Statins and have it without default. So overall, it is better to go for coronary angiography. If you do not want to undergo any significant angiography then alternatively you may have CT coronary angiography which if shows abnormalities then finally will need coronary angiography.

I took Monetlukast + Cetirizine once a day and applied Olopatadine optic drops four times a day which did not relieve my symptoms. Therefore, I added Loratadine 10 mg 1 tablet at bedtime. I tried a hypoallergenic diet as well. After two weeks, still, without relief, I added Prednisone 5 mg tablet with a tapering dose for two weeks. There was no significant relief of symptoms. Now, I am still on Montelukast + Cetirizine once tablet once a day, and Loratadine 10 mg one tablet once a day at bedtime. My rashes are getting worse and my sneezing as well. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Regarding the treatment, I suggest you continue the medicines as they are. I would like to know how much of Prednisolone did you start with? Nextly, you must start on intranasal steroids to help relieve the nasal symptoms. Use Fluticasone furoate twice daily two puffs in each nostril twice daily. The brands available in the Philippines are Avamys, Flutiair, Nasoflo, Flusort. If you feel the antihistaminics are making you drowsy, then you may keep the Cetirizine for the evening and take Loratidine in the morning. Apply a mild steroid cream like Betamethasone valerate 0.1% topical cream over the affected skin. The brands available in your country are Diprolene, Diprosone, and Betnovate. Long term solution: You must do a skin prick testing to check what you are allergic to. Skin prick testing is better than blood allergy testing. Both the methods check for food and aeroallergens. Remember that before the testing you should stop the antihistaminics for five days. With such a test we will come to know the offending agent and give you the right advice to prevent that particular allergen. Do revert back for more details. Apply mild soap and wear loose-fitting clothes to avoid friction over the affected area on the skin."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I think that I will become maniac in some days. I am going with periods and tend to masturbate the second time. First time on the first day of the cycle and then now on the third day. My urges have become quite high, and I need help to control it. Even I am going by some emotional distresses, and maybe because of that, I tend to masturbate. I want to control and be normal. I feel very tired nowadays and not willing to work at all.","Doctor":"Hello. Hormonal imbalances may make one's sexual drive higher. Some women do feel increased arousal during periods. First of all, it is okay to masturbate even when you are under some distress. Though for some religious reasons and cultural norms, it becomes not acceptable by society, that is alright. Researches show that there is no negative impact of masturbation physically. However, feeling tired showed that it does not help you get out of your emotional distress, that is a problem. If you do not feel relaxed afterward than you need to channelize your urges towards physical exertion, exercise or increase water intake and improve diet. It is also good to consult some counselor to relieve your stress and learn individualized coping strategies."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My skin is dry in the morning and oily mostly on my nose area.

I stopped the pill two months ago, so my last period was on the very next month of stoppage of the drug. The periods was shorter and had no periods the next month. However, I had brown spotting or bleeding from day 27 up to day 34. I had unprotected sex on the day I was supposed to get my period. What are my chances for pregnancy? I consulted another gynecologist and told her my condition. I did an ultrasound, and my uterus already appears normal (according to the doctor, less visibility of my PCOS condition). I consulted last week, and she prescribed me Provera 10 mg for five days, twice a day. She said the cause of missed period is because of hormonal imbalance or adjustment. She advised me to retake Diane 35 for next 12 months once I get my period. By mistake, I had Provera in the morning and night instead of taking the two tablets before bedtime. She said the Provera is supposed to make my period come. It has been seven days since I started using Provera but no signs of period. I was on medicine for cough and cold for five days. I am also going through emotional stress as of now mainly because of missed period. Could that be a factor for late period? I took a pregnancy test, but the result was negative. I tried two different tests and both came out negative. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) is a condition which has multiple problems. When a woman at younger age group is having menstrual problems so most probably it has been considered due to PCOS, which is a biochemical abnormality existing in the body. You have to take Diane 35 regularly to keep your cycle regularized, and also you must keep an eye over your weight and diet as it also plays a significant role in worsening this condition. You must take a healthy low carbohydrate low fat, high fiber and protein diet and maintain a regular exercise.  Stay away from stress as much as possible. Now, if you have not started periods with 10 mg of Provera (Medroxyprogesterone), you can wait a little longer, and if still, they do not come then you can increase the dose of Provera 15 mg (5 mg three times a day) for five days and your periods will ensue or you can start Diane 35 straightaway to regularize the cycle. You do not need to worry about pregnancy as tests are negative. I hope it has helped you. If you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to contact me."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a DVT with massive pulmonary embolism with infarction before four years. I had a few änxiety or panic attacks since then. Had a heart sonar and ECG done two months ago, which according to the physician was perfectly normal. I stopped taking Bisoprolol on his advice, and started with Alprazolam and Ativan when needed. Two weeks ago, I had an incident where I had my blood pressure shot up to 210/107 and a heart rate of 110 bpm. I went to the ER and had an ECG done as well as a cardio markers blood test is done. The doctor who did the ECG said that it looked like the right side of my heart did not get enough oxygen. I made another appointment with a physician, who now wants to send me for an angiogram. I want a second opinion on the latest ECG. The ER doctor said that a panic attack could also influence the ECG.","Doctor":"Hello. Your ECG is fine (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There is left axis deviation, which is expected in hypertension or with age. Probably this left axis deviation is mistakenly read as Q waves by a physician and thought of right side not getting enough oxygen. So, by viewing your attached ECG, I do not see any immediate need for an angiogram. However, considering your age and hypertension and a history of pulmonary embolism. It is better to obtain echo is not done recently. Also, better to get one stress test like treadmill test or stress echo. BP spike may be age-related combined with panic or anxiety, so you should have BP apparatus at home and monitor it frequently, at least thrice a day for a week. And if most of the BP readings are above 140/90 mmHg then you should have regular medicines for it. You should take low salt diet and do regular exercises as well.

I am 168 cm in height and 68 kg in weight. Since last one month, I have been suffering from intermittent loose motions (yellow colored). There is no vomiting, no fever, or major abdominal pain (except for occasional cramps). Initially, I took a combination of Norfloxacin and Tinidazole for four days, but things did not improve. Thereafter on the prescription of my doctor I took Metronidazole 400 and Dicyclomine 20 mg for a period of 14 days. I also took Lactobacillus tablets for the entire period. During these times I only ate poha, rice, curd, and banana. Also, I took boiled water. It is the fifth day now and I have discontinued the medicines. Despite on such a bland diet (no wheat), I still have at least one to two loose motions in a day. My routine medical tests were done in January this year which was normal. My wife and son also developed loose motion in between for a very brief period. However, they recovered fully within three days. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello. I cannot see any red flags in your symptoms. More likely nothing to worry. It is the function of your intestines that is triggered by some infection and you are facing overactive intestine. More likely it is a functional problem unless proven otherwise. I will advise you to keep things simple. Quit all medications. You already took a few antibiotics. Please follow these general guidelines: 1) Add fibers in your diet like vegetables and Ispagol husk two spoons daily. 2) Keep yourself well hydrated. 3) Add yogurt in your diet. 4) Eat less. 5) More important is to keep yourself relaxed. The best way of doing is by doing a walk, exercise. Please start tablet Mebeverin 135 mg before breakfast and dinner for eight days. Tablet Rifaxamine 200 mg after breakfast and dinner. Continue probiotics. Please follow me after one week. I hope you should be fine, otherwise, I will advise you on some tests."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I only have one sexual partner for almost a year. However, during intercourse, I feel that I am having a pain in my pelvic area and it is a sudden sharp pain. Sometimes it is random or happens during deeper penetration. It feels like pressure and almost seems like it is gas but I am not sure what it is that I am experiencing. A while back, I had a UTI and since then I have been experiencing this at times. Sometimes it does not bother me. I just want to make sure I am fine or see if this is a concern that I need to come in. Yesterday, I experienced the pressure pain on my left side more and it drew enough for concern. I do not know if it is gas or something else.","Doctor":"Hello. It is important in your case to rule out the possibility of pelvic inflammatory disease. Now points in favor are history of chlamydia and UTI in the past, pain on deep penetration and tenderness on the left side of abdomen. These are the sufficient point to evaluate for the possibility of PID (pelvic inflammatory disease). I guess you do not have any discharge per vaginum may be scanty. One more thing is, just try to see if you are having this pain from the beginning from the intercourse or started after some time. Because if it is from the beginning then this may be dyspareunia and not related to PID. But if it has developed later then it becomes important that you undergo evaluation for PID. You will need an ultrasound of pelvis, CRP (C-reactive protein) or ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), vaginal fluid smear. However, the vaginal examination will also be helpful to see whether there is any cervical motion tenderness, which would give a fair idea about the possibility. It is important to rule out PID because it can have consequences later like fertility issues. So if we get any clues regarding it then you will need a course of antibiotic treatment. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 35-year-old male. No episodes of herps except chickenpox in childhood. No Infection of HIV, clinically tested every six months for the last seven years. My partner and I both are not having HIV (clinically tested). I had a bacterial or fungal infection with pus and redness in the genital area. So I have done the blood test. HIV is negative. HSV-1 IgG 4.5 positive. HSV-1 IgM 0.29 negative. HSV-2 IgG 0.45 negative. HSV-2 IgM 0.69 negative. As HSV-1 is mostly non-genital infection. I did not have any episodes of HSV-1 type herps in my life. I never had HSV-1 type herpes anywhere in the body. I am straight and have a relationship only with my spouse. How can blood show HSV-1 IgG positive without any symptoms? Dermatologist says it is due to past infection and not about present infection. Doctor told I should take antiviral dose Acyclovir for 20 days for HSV-1 IgG past infection. Is it useful to take antiviral dose for the past HSV-1 type infection? Will it reduces IgG level in the blood? Is HSV-1 IgG is false positive?","Doctor":"Hi. First understand the situation, IgM indicates recent infection and IgG indicate chronic infection. Since you have both the IgM negative, it means that there is no recent infection. Secondly, about 70- 80% of US population is HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus) positive, it means they are infected once in a life time and antibodies will remain for throughout life. But it does not mean that 80% of US population should start taking Acyclovir. There are no guidelines for taking Acyclovir until you are symptomatic. So do not think too much about this figure.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Healthy otherwise and not overweight. I went to the ER yesterday, and they did two ECGs (did come back with an inverted t wave on one lead. They were not worried), did a chest X-ray, d-dimer (I had a DVT 1.5 years ago when I was six weeks pregnant), bloodwork including cardiac enzymes. All are normal. The pain started about two weeks ago, but was just off and on and would go away fairly quickly. I tried working out about 1.5 weeks ago and made it a couple of minutes until the jumping jack warmup. The jumping motion brought on this pressure pinching pain (not the best description, I am sure), but it is subsided when I stopped. The last few months, I have had intense burning pain in my upper middle abdomen that the doctor suspected an ulcer and put me on Protonix. The pain did get better after that, but I still have many flare-ups of that pain. It seems like when I get the chest pains, and I have a lot of upper abdominal pressure. I have to push down on my upper abdomen to help relieve some of the pain, even though the pain is felt more in the upper left chest into my left shoulder and sometimes arm. The upper-middle back pain is new and is hot pressure pain. The chest pains were off and on but have been consistent for almost three days now, but mostly only when I get up to walk around or stand. Just standing still without exertion brings on this intense pain. Sometimes certain sitting positions will carry it on too. I do not feel short of breath, except when the pressure hits. In ER yesterday my stats were good. BP around 100/60 (my norm), HR around 65, and O2 100 %. My respiratory kept alarming though around 8-9 quite a bit.I cannot help be worried about a blocked artery since that seems to be what pops up with chest and back pain. Also PE, but they were pretty confident I did not have to worry about that with normal stats and a negative d-dimer.","Doctor":"Hello. Unlikely to be related to a cardiac cause. Firstly, cardiac pain typically comes on exertion and relieves at rest and should persist for at least a few minutes. And rest cardiac pain suggest acs, in which pain persists for few minutes, ECG changes and positive enzymes are expected, will not be related to movements and unlikely to persists for two weeks even without treatment. It is likely related to reflux, which can cause chest, back, and arm pain as well. Will come in bouts and persists for a few seconds. However, it is better if you can get a stress test like a treadmill test and echo done to be sure. You should avoid fatty, oily, and high-calorie diet. Have some walk after having food instead of taking rest. Have multiple small meals instead of heavy meals. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. Also, should have antacids prokinetic combination like Pantoprazole plus Domperidone instead of just antacids. May have syrup Sucral O or other locally acting antacids two teaspoon SOS for faster relief. Overall, unlikely to be related to the heart or blocked arteries, However better to get few tests done.

The Amphetamine ones felt as I would expect, but even at the lowest starting dosages, it felt like too much and made my pre-existing anxiety worse. The Concerta, which I was prescribed first, I quit after three days of taking it, as it made me feel sleepy like I had taken a Benadryl. I have gone unmedicated for over a year now, and find myself wondering if I should have explored more brands or doses of Methylphenidate? If Concerta made me sleepy, is Methylphenidate just not for me? Or could it just possibly be the dosage and or brand that was the issue?","Doctor":"Hello. If ADHD symptoms continue to affect your daily functioning negatively, it will be worthwhile to try other options. It looks like you were tried only on small doses of different stimulant medication but were discontinued as you did not tolerate it well. There are non-stimulant options like Atomoxetine (which can help when there is associated anxiety) and Guanfacine (Intuniv). All these medications have benefits and potential side effects which can be managed by your doctor. Also, try behavioral techniques to manage inattention and improve your work performance.

The artist used a new needle, a new tune and a new ink pot. The ink was poured directly into the ink pot from a larger bottle, and he throws the ink out after each tattoo.

He did have me lay down on a sheet which he washes between clients. He continuously applied Vaseline to my skin throughout the tattoo, which had already been used for another client. From any of the above, is there a risk for HIV? Even though the needle was new, is there any chance of infection from the gun grip or Vaseline or even anywhere else in the process?

After 15 days, the muscle aches switched to the upper portion of my legs and I started getting pain in my neck. At the time, I had on and off sore throat and headache. I have not had any fever.

However, there are multiple effective treatment options depending on the grade and severity of the problem. Mometasone is a topical steroid and is to be avoided strictly on the face and for acne as it can harm your skin in the long run. Acne is dependent on hormones hence excess masturbation may sometimes lead to an increase in the problem.

I am ashamed to have sex with my fiance. Will sex be a problem or uncomfortable in future? Is there any solution other than surgery?","Doctor":"Hi. Phimosis is a condition where the foreskin is tight around the glans penis or the soft tip of the penis. I am sure you have not consulted any doctors for the same. I would suggest you get it examined. The problem is that, when you are aroused at the time of sex, the size of penis increases and the skin will not come up at all. The pleasure of sex is when the glans rubs in the vaginal wall. Your partner will have no problem, but you may not get all the pleasure, as the skin or foreskin covering the glans will block the stimulation of glans. Either you will have premature ejaculation (inability to hold back the semen or control ejaculation) or erection problem. Another issue is that if you or your partner forcibly pushes the foreskin back in the heat of the moment, the skin may get stuck and form a tight ring around the glans just like a bangle at the wrist. The skin may not return, blocking the blood flow to the tip, every minute the glans gradually starts swelling and changing in color to purple or bluish. It is very painful and if left untreated, leads to irreversible damage to the glans. The condition is called paraphimosis. Circumcision or removing the skin over the glans surgically is the best and only solution for phimosis. This is a simple, painless procedure done by a general surgeon. It can be done under local anesthesia, with no blood loss and no need for admission. You cannot have sex till it heals. But after that, your sexual time will gradually increase.

I lift weights three times a week and use the stair master for 30 minutes five times a week vigorously. I have had this same routine for the past 20 years. I am 5'7\\" and weigh 160 pounds. My serum creatinine was 1.33 16 years back, and for the past 16 years, it has fluctuated from 1.34 to 1.48. There was one test done last year that came back at 1.2. However, the latest test result was 1.38. All other values are normal. BUN is always around 15 to 20. My spot urine protein was 7 and my spot creatinine was 85. Based on the serum creatinine levels alone my eGFR is low indicating stage 3 CKD. This seems crazy to me. All my blood work is perfect except for the creatinine. My lipids are great, my BP is 120/75, my fasting glucose is 98 to 100, and A1c is always 4.6 to 4.8. I am not on any drugs, I do not take creatine supplements, I do not take any medication. I do not take NSAID. If I had stage 3 CKD, would the urine levels be indicative of disease? Also, how can the creatinine be elevated with normal BUN? If CKD, would the kidneys not functioning increase the BUN at the same time? This makes no sense to me. Since level has held steady for 16 years, is that evidence of no disease? I have been told that higher muscle mass may lead to elevated creatinine, but I do not have huge muscles. Is it possible that the muscle metabolism from exercise is always creating elevated creatinine? Does this sound like stage 3 CKD to you?

I went through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), see basically beyond 40 years of age, there is 1ml/min/1.73 m2 decline in eGFR per year, and that is a normal physiological response because of an increase in age, same as skin wrinkles, since you have high creatinine, but is static and there is no protein in urine, your chronic kidney disease is very slowly progressing. Differential diagnosis, in this case, is chronic tubulointerstitial disease or benign nephrosclerosis, as you told you are not taking any drugs, NSAIDS, gym supplementation. About confirming the diagnosis, it will need a kidney biopsy to confirm it. But whatever disease it is, it is slowly progressive and mostly probably will behave same way for next 10 to 15 years.

Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I have gone through your case. In my opinion, there is two to three differential diagnosis of your lesion. 1. Lichen planus - This could result due to many reasons or sun exposure. Treatment is sunprotection by frequent application of any sunblock. Try to apply sunblock at least 20 minutes before going outside. And use it two to three times a day. 2. Fixed drug eruption (FDE) - Many drugs can cause it. Most common causes are NSAIDS or antibiotics like penicillin. But you have told that you do not take any medicines. Re-evaluate yourself if you have taken any few weeks ago.

One mSv is the limit for the general public. The background is usually within this limit. But radiation workers have a limit of 20 mSv per year, which is also very safe. Also, doses from medical imaging can contribute. But the benefits from medical imaging offset any potential theoretical risks of increased cancer risk. Background radiation is 0.1 uSv per hour, which comes to about one mSv in a year."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My dad has got iron deficiency from the past two years, and we came to know about last week because of that hemoglobin is not increasing.

The attached report is showing hemoglobin level only 7.5 suggestive of moderate degree anemia (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It could be iron deficiency anemia. For such a low hemoglobin level, he needs to be given iron sucrose like injection according to weight. Then he needs to be shifted on iron tablets like Ferrous ascorbate. If still no improvement than stool routine micro examination and occult blood test done for further work-up. GI (gastrointestinal) endoscopy also might need to be done to check for any tear leading mucosal bleeding if present in stomach or duodenum. If he has any clinical complaints than mention it.

You are certainly having mild degree anemia in the attached report (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It could probably be an iron deficiency anemia as you have mentioned low iron and saturation. However, such a mild degree anemia cannot cause breathlessness.

Any other illness like diabetes, hypertension, and, kidney problems? As per reports, it looks like gall bladder cancer. It is locally advanced probably unresectable because of jaundice. I would like to see films and patient myself though. The first step, in this case, to bring down bilirubin by putting PTBD (percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage), which I think must have been advised. If the general condition is good and bilirubin comes down to normal, we can start chemotherapy and also look for the possibility of surgery after four cycles of chemotherapy. Both surgeon and medical oncologist should see a patient decide a proper line of treatment. If the disease is metastatic, then there are no roles of surgery and only chemotherapy is advised. It helps in controlling the disease for the time being. If the condition of the patient is not good, then only palliative care is advised.

But you have not mentioned here how much you are taking and what is the size of cysts. Irregular menstruation depends on imbalances in FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and LH (Luteinizing hormone). Kalarchikai takes time to get positive results. You should take it continuously for three months if you are taking choornam it 3 gm twice a day after meals. You can take Rajahpravartini Vati 1tablet and Nagkesar churna 1 gm twice a day after meals. Quit Rajahprawartini Vati one week before expected menses date.

It was caused by a high school crush and has caused me to hate myself for everything I do because I am socially awkward and tend to mess everything up. I feel like I am a mess and that I made my crush life difficult at least at first, though memories are haunting me.I cry every day, the only reason I am not dead is that I do not have access to a gun. My question is about what happened today. After school I saw my crush near who have missed the school, and she was with friends, when she saw me she came towards me and as is tradition in my country she kissed me on the cheek which was unexpected and caught me off guard, especially since we have been ignoring each other this whole school year.Whenever I have to interact with people I hate myself after it because I do not know what to say usually, and this case was not different either, but it was worse than that (because it happened in front of her). Anyway, I left kind of awkwardly, and immediately I felt this unbearable stress, I wanted to shout but contained myself in public. Still, I made screaming faces, did that thing where I manually can create pressure inside my head and turn my face red like a tomato.I also sweat a lot, and I clenched my fists (not only), with which I would hit my other hand sometimes. It was like waves, I would feel super stressed at times, and then it would let off just a little. I could not hold back my tears. When I came home, I cried hating myself, looked in the mirror, and flipped off myself, told my reflection that I hated him, and I wished him to die so badly. I have never experienced something like this, at least not as strong as this. What happened to me, and how do I prevent it from happening ever again? Because it was awful.","Doctor":"Hello.

There are only limited data of this drug during pregnancy, however considering the effect and side effects this drug can be used in pregnancy. As you have 15-week pregnancy, so the chance of fetal malformations is unlikely as the period of fetal organogenesis is over, so this drug can be used with frequent visits to treating psychiatrist and gynecology to detect early any adverse effects.

Since you have mentioned that you had problems regarding your mental health, though you did not clarify or shared any related symptoms that what kind of questions you experience.

Those emotions may come back as depressive state or behavioral disturbances which you are currently facing. Sometimes one is unable to understand his or her emotional experiences and needs help.

However, if you can attach your report than I can check it. In hemolytic anemia, NRBC (nucleated red blood cell) can be raised. So you need to investigate with full CBC, peripheral smear examination report, serum LDH, and reticulocyte count for primary workup. For joint pain serum ANA, RA factor, and local joint x-ray needed.

I have never been pregnant and never used a contraceptive. Before two years, I felt a breast lump (breast cyst-did does not disappear with aspiration. Aspirate was straw-colored). Got it out a year later. Biopsy showed fibrocystic breast disease with adenosis. As soon as the inflammation subsided, like a month after, I noticed a mass in that same location with the same consistency, firm, mobile. I guessed it was the same cyst, perhaps a recollection. Did the surgery six months later with the mass sent to another pathologist and the biopsy result was the same. Fibrocystic breast disease with adenosis. Two months postoperatively, same location, another one, mobile, firm, and sometimes tender. Increasing in size. No nipple discharge but disturbing. Plus now, I have a nasty scar. I should do a Mammo, but the breast is dense and standing. I feel it would be extremely painful.","Doctor":"Hello. I completely understand how you feel. Let me start by saying that a majority of breast cysts are not malicious, and unfortunately, they do have a tendency to keep coming back. Numerous women leave them as it is and stay on regular follow up to keep an eye on the size and other changes of clinical importance. As far as a mammogram is concerned, it is not as painful as you think it is. There are other alternatives like - Ultrasonography, MRI. I would also like to point out, that post-surgery, there is always going to be some edema which will subside with time. The key is to differentiate it from more malicious lumps.

Like weight loss, backache, headache, anorexia?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 30 years old male. Weight is 107 kg, and height is 5'9. Not under any medications. (Not been on any medication for over a year previous medications include numerous mental health medications, various SSRIs, Clomipramine, and several anti-psychotics, most recently Olanzapine). I tried Lymecycline a couple of years ago and multiple creams for acne in the past. I have a history of mental health problems. I have a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, OCD, anxiety, and depression. My anxiety levels have been chronic for many years due to the severity of my obsessive thoughts and compulsions etc. I think that my poor mental state has impacted on my health. I have had severe skin problems since I was about 17 or so. I get huge cysts that often recur in the same place with large boils. I have some large permanent cysts. I seem to break out at certain times. I also have a condition known as a functional neurological disorder. I will be seeing a neurologist here in the at a movement disorders clinic to deal with this in the near future. I also developed eyelash ptosis, where my eyelash in my right eye keeps growing long. My Ophthalmologist told me that it needs to be trimmed regularly with scissors or that I have to use curlers, as it can impair my visual field. The neurological or psychological aspects may be affecting my other conditions. I have had athlete's foot for the past year.

I walk around in my bare feet in the house most of the time, and when I do go out, I tend to wear crocs.The athlete's foot has become more itchy or burning recently. Also, for the past year or two, I have two fungal nails. My big toes on both feet are very yellow looking at the front of the pins (I have ingrown nails in the past). What I am concerned about is my fingernail. I do not know how I did this? About two weeks ago, I noticed that my middle finger on my right hand was very painful when I touched it. I cannot remember if I pulled the nail, and this has caused some infection, or if it is related in some way to the fungal nail infections on my toes or my athlete's foot.I will show you some pictures, and I would like your advice on what to do next. Due to my mental state, I have not taken good care of my body, but I am trying to address this. My athlete's foot is entirely wrong.

It was initially very painful to sit down (I am overweight, spend a lot of time sitting at my desk, etc.). This cyst is intermittent, but there are times when it can be very itchy. As you can see, I am not in the best shape, but I am trying to address both my mental health and my physical health by starting to take better care of myself, eat better, exercise, etc.The main concern is the fingernail. Do I have an infection? Can it be serious to blood flow/losing limbs, or is this my anxiety and the things I've read on Google. I am quite concerned. I cannot see a doctor for another week or two.

I can very well understand that it must be very painful for you as it is entirely red. You need some oral medication for its treatment. 1.

Spend value time with your wife which would help her get back to her old sex life. If you are worried about your fertility profile get a semen analysis done and look for the concentration and motility of sperms. And also get a random blood sugar done. The very fact that your wife has conceived spontaneously rules out both male and female factors of infertility, so just relax. The possibility of erectile dysfunction with your complaints is less considering past history. Have a trying time for 5 to 6 months. If pregnancy is delayed then consult a fertility specialist.

With regards to oral fluid, it might be a case of possible oral thrush. Get an oral swab culture done to rule out yeast infection and treat it adequately. I can only suggest taking, 1. Probiotics early in the morning for at least 10 days. 2. Maintain good oral hygiene. 3. Get checked by the dentist for a possible bad tooth. 4. Take antacids to stabilize stomach pH. Get upper endoscopy done to rule out stomach issue. This is the only way you can find what you have. Discuss this further with your caring doctor."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have a 28-day cycle my last menstrual was six months before.

First of all, please rule out urinary tract infection by doing urine routine examination and culture sensitivity. There may be many other causes of chronic pelvic pain. 1. Ovulation pain occurs mid-cycle but self-limiting. 2. Endometriosis may cause severe painful periods. 3. Vaginal infection, vaginal discharge, foul-smelling discharge. 4. Pelvic congestion, constant pain throughout starting from a mid-cycle, may stay till periods, reduce after periods. 5. Irritable bowel syndrome, relation with bowel motions. 6.

Changed food habits and life styles, excessive use of different kinds of shampoo and conditioner, hereditary are the major causes. You can prevent them somewhat after changing your food habits and lifestyles. You should apply Keral Neelibhhringadi oil to hair root and do gentle massage with the fingertip for 10 minutes daily at night and wash it with fresh water or Shikakai powder in the morning. It helps to resolve your issues. For constipation, take Panchasakara Churna 3 gm twice a day with warm water after meals. Avoid spicy and fried junk foods.

I have been wanting to get a tummy tuck but I am afraid because in the past when I had my three C-sections, my blood pressure dropped.

So I really want to know if I have a tummy tuck, would it happen again. I also got nausea with local anesthesia, is that normal too?","Doctor":"Hi. By tummy tuck, you mean spinal anesthesia which you have undergone for all the C-sections, right? Note: Even though all your reports are normal, the basic nature of anesthesia is to reduce your blood pressure and heart rate. That is the phenomenon of anesthesia. It can happen to anyone and at any time. So, nothing to worry about it. Your anesthetist can easily manage your BP drops."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 18 years old. I did an 8-week cycle that ended 14 days ago. The cycle consisted of applying a topical DHT gel, exactly 100 mg of pure DHT per week (15 mg per day) for eight weeks. I did it because I read that DHT could improve my puberty and increase the size of the penis. Now I am still small and feel that my hormone levels are lower. The question is could it be harmful to make another cycle or should I stop? Now, that I have stopped should I do a PCT? My wish would be to increase the penis dimensions without damaging my HPTA axis.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned, it appears that you have tried to apply DHT (dihydrotestosterone) to increase penile size.I would recommend that you know what you are doing before you try to use it again. Use of testosterone can cause serious side effects such as heart disease (including heart attack), stroke, liver disease, mental and mood problems, abnormal drug-seeking behavior, or improper bone growth. When testosterone is used unrequited, you may have withdrawal symptoms such as depression, irritability, and tiredness when you suddenly stop using the drug. These symptoms may last from weeks to months. It is not possible to increase your penile length this way without causing harm to your HPA (hypothalamic pituitary adrenal) axis. You must properly get examined and visit a surgeon for same.

At that time, I had water trapped in my right ear but now my ear blockage problem is resolved but my tinnitus problem is not resolved. After this, I went to an ENT and he told me I have a swelling in my left ear. Now he checked my left ear and he told me my left ear is cleaned and fine. But my tinnitus is not going. I have high pitched sound in my left ear. I think I had two to three times water trapped in my both ear within one year. I have normal blood pressure and currently, I do not have any cough and cold. I do not have any problem with hearing loss and I hear low and high sound easily. I do not have any vertigo or numbness on face. After checking my ears, my doctor told me my ear is clean. I do not have any discharge in my both ear and do not have any pain in my ear. I have a fear that tinnitus is due to an acoustic neuroma. But, I do not have any neurological symptoms. I read online. After reading this, I am fearful. I can even manage tinnitus but now I am worried it is a tumor. Is my problem a big one?","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, do not worry and do not go to some conclusion after an internet search. Now coming to your problem, Tinnitus is not a disease in itself but a mere symptom that is associated with varying number of diseases. By definition, it is a sound perceived for more than five minutes at a time in the absence of any external acoustical or electrical stimulus to ear. It may be subjective, when audible to patient only or objective when audible to both patient and examiner. Now exclude the objective tinnitus because if it was the case your doctor must have diagnosed it. Now come to subjective tinnitus. The causes may be as simple as impacted wax, middle ear fluid and eustachian tube dysfunction to more severe ones like Meniere's disease, otosclerosis, noise trauma or acoustic neuroma. Now let us try to exclude them first. Acoustic neuroma mostly is seen between 40 to 60 years, first symptoms to arise is progressive unilateral hearing loss associated with tinnitus after that comes other signs and symptoms like numbness of face, dysphagia and hoarseness in the later stage when the tumor becomes more than 2.5 cm. But you do not have a hearing impairment or other symptoms. For confirmation at least you can get a PTA (pure tone audiometry) and SISI (short increment sensitivity index). Now coming to otosclerosis which starts in the twenties but more common in females and presenting symptoms progressive bilateral (sometimes unilateral) hearing loss with tinnitus. Again for confirmation, you need a PTA. Now Meniere's disease, it presents with tinnitus, episodic vertigo, aural fullness and again fluctuating hearing loss, which is not present in your case. We have excluded the sever ones till now assuming you have written about all signs and symptoms and you don't have hearing loss, vertigo, aural fullness etc. If you have missed something contact me in my email. Sometimes, tinnitus is caused by very simple causes like impacted wax (which is not the obvious cause as your previous doctor must have diagnosed it) or eustachian tube dysfunction which many times gets unnoticed by the doctor. To rule out this at least you need to do Valsalva maneuver 30 to 40 times a day. If it is the cause, tinnitus gradually will decrease in severity. So, why not give it a try for two days minimum. If tinnitus is not subsiding after two days better to do some test like a PTA, tympanometry and a SISI. Hope this will help you and wishing you a faster recovery.

Doctor has recommended me hip replacement. I am really scared of this. Because I did a lot of research on internet about this. I got to know a lot of restriction and risk of dislocation after surgery. What if I somehow avoid the surgery? Is there any chance of natural healing in long term of two to three years?","Doctor":"Hi. Thank you for using this platform. From the information you provided, it seems like you have stage 3 avascular necrosis (AVN). While there are numerous causes for AVN and often there is no identifiable cause, the prognosis is not very favorable once you reach stage 3. This stage is said to have been reached when the femoral head collapses and loses its round spherical shape. Due to the incongruency with the hip socket, there is undue friction during hip movements, and eventually the joint surfaces start getting eroded. Once this happens, it is said to be in stage 4 of osteoarthritis. It may be helpful if you could share your x-ray and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) images with us. Also, has the cause of your AVN been diagnosed? How does the opposite hip look like? Often, the opposite hip may have early AVN and may be amenable to certain procedures to prevent it from reaching an irreversible state like your painful hip. I understand your worries with hip replacement. You are only 25 years old and any hip prosthesis has a limited life of its own with a high likelihood of needing a revision at some point. It may be best to postpone hip replacement for as many years as you can, so long as your hip pain does not prevent you from doing activities of daily living.

My BP went up to 145/100 often in the last month. I got a new medication from my doctor, Irbesartan 150 mg and Metoprolol 50 mg once a day. Now the BP is excellent, over the day 125/85. Pulse around 75. Now, my question is I tried to use Propranolol instead of Metoprolol in the same dosage as it helps my anxiety. But I got a general feeling of sick and dizziness. Propranolol instead of Metoprolol resulted in the same BP and pulse. Is there another beta-blocker such as Atenolol which could help my anxiety and not giving me the side effects as Propranolol?Age 41 years, male, height 175 cm and weight 72 kg.","Doctor":"Hi. Let me tell you very clearly that, Metoprolol is the drug of choice, not just for hypertension but it has shown to have mortality benefits to cardiac patients. It helps for that purpose by : So, I would suggest you carry on with Metoprolol. Now about Propranolol: It is also a Beta Blocker, but it is not \\"CARDIO SELECTIVE\\" but \\"NON SELECTIVE\\". I will explain how it is essential. There are mainly two receptors of Beta Blockers - Beta 1 and Beta 2. Beta 1 is for cardiac reception. So, Metoprolol acts on it and has advantages over non-selective. I suggest you take Metoprolol Succinate extended or controlled release since you are taking it once a day. In case if you are not taking, kindly ask your doctor to prescribe you extended release. I prefer to give Metoprolol extended release in twice daily dosing to have good control for 24 hours. You may continue with Irbesartan or Telmisartan. Another concern is that I would like to know if you have any of the following: 1. Diabetes. 2. Any skin disease. 3. Difficulty/diminution of vision. 4. Any tingling or numbness. Get your Serum Creatinine, Urine for albumin, fundus examination, baseline ECG. Now coming to your anxiety problem. We have to deal with it separately. I do not want you to stop Metoprolol, just for anxiety problem. Tell me exactly what feeling you have? Tell me in case you have any palpitations, and sweating, restlessness, breathing problem. Do tell me if you snore a lot in the night, Also how is your sleep.? For your main query, I will say in one line \\"You should continue with Metoprolol since you are tolerating it well\\".

Also my heart rate was higher earlier but is under control with the use of Prolomet XL. Now the Prolomet is replaced by Tazloc-H 40 mg. Will it be a problem? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Previously, you were on tablet Olmezest (Olmesartan) and tablet Prolomet XL 50 (Metoprolol tartrate). Now you are on diabetic medication and tablet Tazloc-H 40 (Telmisartan). Tablet Olmezest and tablet Tazloc are similar kind of drugs. So, taking one drug is enough. I think you are taking tablet Tazloc-H alone now. It is a good tablet. It prevents heart problems, kidney failure and will make you to pass more urine. Take one tablet after breakfast regularly. You were taking tablet Prolomet XL. We usually prescribe this for severe hypertension or tachycardia (increased heart rate). Since you have both hypertension and diabetes, I request you to buy one blood pressure machine and glucometer. Please check your pulse rate four to five times a day and record. It can be done by using a BP machine or you can check yourself manually. Just put two fingers in left wrist, far left side. See the watch and count your pulse for one minute. It should be less than 90. If your pulse rate is more than 90 per minute regularly, then we can start back tablet Prolomet XL. Similarly, if tablet Tazloc-H is not enough to control BP, we can start tablet Prolomet XL. Your fasting blood sugar (FBS) and post prandial blood sugar (PPBS) are both high. As you have started the diabetes drugs recently, we can check FBS and PPBS after 15 days of drugs and can adjust medications. The maximum dose of the tablet Metformin ER (extended release) is about 2000 mg. So, we can safely prescribe two 1000 mg ER morning and night. True, tablet Metformin ER works for 24 hours. So, we can take up to 2000 mg ER once a day. But, if we take in two doses (500/850/1000 mg) there will be a constant presence of Metformin in blood. So, no need to worry. For urine infection, drink plenty of water. Take syrup Urikind (Potassium magnesium citrate) 10 ml mixed in one glass of water three times a day. Diabetes can cause urine infection and controlling blood sugar will reduce the frequency of getting urine infections.

Also, I had FESS surgery and SMR before two weeks. My current medication is nasal spray Propolis. Is my problem related to acid reflux? Please explain me.","Doctor":"Hi. I have carefully reviewed your case and can well establish the issues you are facing right now. Actually, the chemicals in e-cigarette are very dangerous for the lungs and airways. They cause narrowing of the small airways due to toxic effects caused directly by the vapor and that is why you feel short of breath. Yes, acid reflux is one of the aggravating factors for shortness of breath. In GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) the stomach acid regurgitates and irritates the upper respiratory tract mucosa causing the allergic reaction that may cause shortness of breath. I have seen many patients with the same problem. You need to consult your physician locally to see how can you get rid of the e-cigarette and your physician will guide you according to the personal circumstances on how to leave it gradually. Once you quit, your respiratory tract mucosa will start the heal up process and will be better in a few months to a couple of years depending on the duration of your cigarette smoking or vaping.

Based on your description, I understand that you skin using the pills in early last month, in the beginning of your menstrual cycles and later took it continuously to avoid the placebo pills. See, first thing you have to understand is that , if you didn't start the birth control in the first week of your menstrual cycles it's not effective as a birth control at all as the follicular development already sets in which contains the Ovum (egg). So there is a high chance of pregnancy in such cases even if you start it in the following week. The clots that you described could be possibly products of Conception ( only a possibility) if you had gotten pregnant and had a spontaneous miscarriage. So to confirm if this is the situation or not, please check your home pregancy test. If that is positive then this confirms the likely possibility of a pregnancy. Also if you could share a picture of the clot that you have I can have a look to check the other possibilities of your problem. Please feel free to revert back to me anytime with any further queries or doubts. Also please check your home pregancy test once and get back to me with the result. Have a nice day. - Home pregnancy test - Ultrasound Abdomen and Pelvis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Water is coming from my eyes when I use mobile. Can you suggest me glasses?","Doctor":"Hi. You should try to minimize mobile screen time. Secondly, try to make habit of eye blinking at the regular interval because while seeing screen we stare and do not blink that much. That is why the eye gets dry and to compensate that, your eyes start producing excessive tears in the form of watering. So, reduce screen time and use artificial tear (Tears Naturale drops). I hope you will be okay."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 30 years old. I am planning to get married to a girl who is known to me. We have very good understanding. But, we have the same blood group that is O positive. Since blood group is a factor for having babies, do you think having same positive blood group could create problems for future generation? My father is very concerned about this. He talked with several doctors and they ensured that it could create problem. And they do not want me to marry this girl. I talked with another doctor, she replied me like it is not a big problem. I am in great trouble right now, how could I give clear explanation to my father about this issue. My father told me he knows two couples of same positive blood group who has been married for 10 years without having baby. And doctors could not find any problems for both men and women. But their blood immune system did not match to have a baby. I have these questions:  Do the same blood group create problem? If yes then what basically create problems? Are there any precautions that need to consider for having baby after getting married with same blood group? Are the diseases like thalassemia occurring because of parent's rhesus factors?  One thing to clarify to clarify is that we are two brothers and two sisters and all the six members of my family have same blood group O positive. My elder sister got baby after 8 years and her husband is B positive. And my younger sister, she always gets sick since her antibody of her blood cell might not strong enough to fight disease. My father explained, due to my parents have same blood group; my sisters might got those above explained problems. I will explain my family based on your explanation. Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows: There are two major blood group systems and more than 400 minor blood group systems. The major blood group systems are ABO system and Rhesus system, which are important. In the ABO system, there is A, B, AB and O. While in Rhesus, if it is present, it is positive and if not then negative. If the girl is not a relative then blood group is hardly a concern. If both are O positive, it would not matter. If she is a relative, get genetic tests to rule out any common diseases, which can affect the future kid. This test is called as genetic counseling. Only among close relatives, the immune system behaves dangerously due to reduced genetic pool. To conclude, having a common blood group is not a problem. She can donate blood to you and you to her in emergencies just like your siblings can. No other complications with same blood group.

Facial spasm most common cause is facial nerve irritation or nerve injury. Second can be due to tetany due to hypocalcemia. The third can be due to temporomandibular joint pain.

I understand that you are having constant post nasal drip. Is there any other symptom that is bothering you? Is there any lump sensation in the throat? Any nose block or runny nasal discharge? Any facial fullness? Did you ever have this problem before this month? The treatment given by your ENT appears to be correct and complete considering the symptoms you have told me. But are you using the spray in the right way? Antihistaminic, mucolyte and spray together should decrease the postnasal drip unless there is some pathology inside the sinuses that is producing constant mucus. Please tell us more details of your problem. Continue the same medicines for now. Take a picture of the back of the throat with open mouth showing the details of the mucus drip and send it to us. Please let us know if you are using the spray in the right way. If you are doing everything properly and this is the only symptom you are facing, then probably we need to check the insides of the nose using nasal endoscopy and a CT scan of sinuses.

If someone with a fungal infection swims in a pool, won't it spread to others through the water?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Swimming is considered as a safe recreational activity. But that is not totally true. Chlorination of water is known to kill most of the microorganisms (which include bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites). But there are several factors to be considered like:  1) Type of microorganism (some organisms may be resistant to chlorination). 2) Adequate chlorination (if sufficient chlorine is not added, there could be a chance of acquiring infection).  3) Duration of chlorination (when a microorganism is introduced into the water, the chlorine may not kill the organism right away, some resistant organisms may survive longer in the water). 4) Microbial load (the stage of infection of the infected person is also important, during the acute acute/highly infective stage, chances of spreading infection may be higher).

The most common cause is a nerve compression or pinched nerve. Carpal tunnel syndrome also causes numbness in the thumb. A thorough clinical examination can rule this out.  I would also advise you to get a few blood investigations done like blood sugar, blood uric acid, and ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate).  If your job profile involves keeping your hand in one position for too long it can be a cause. Whether you have any history of injury to the same hand in the past?

I cannot afford to go to the hospital especially if it just ends up going away. Is there anything I can do to fix this?","Doctor":"Hello. Well, the onset of pain with a feeling of bloating, and change in intensity after passing stools suggest it is related to gas. You probably had something last night, or a few days back, which has caused you to this gastrointestinal upset. Well, this does not seem alarming in any way. I suggest you to take Simethicone suspension /or capsule (whatever available OTC pharmacy) 60 to 125 milligrams (mg) four times a day, after meals and at bedtime for two to three days.

The best possible way to find out is to get an X-ray done of the area to find out if there is an abscess related to the wisdom tooth or the RCT treated the molar adjacent tooth.

I have tried laser treatment on my face. After like 14 treatments, the intensity though has reduced, but it is not as expected. There is only a 50 % reduction. What should I do? Should I continue getting laser treatments or is there another ayurvedic way out?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. The condition in which excessive hair grows all over the body is called hirsutism. It is usually a harmless condition but often makes a person feel embarrassed and unconfident sometimes. There might be many causes behind this condition like the production of excessive androgens (male hormones) in a female, PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome), genetic problem or sometimes medication. The first two are one of the common reasons affecting a majority of females. Some other rare conditions include a tumour of the adrenal gland, tumor of ovaries, Cushing's syndrome and hyperthecosis (where ovaries produce excessive male hormone), but these are very rare conditions. Sometimes there might not be any proper cause for the condition. If you have performed all the lab tests including hormonal tests (prolactin, FSH, LH, testosterone) and these are normal then do perform an ultrasound to rule out PCOS because, in this condition, the ovaries produce excessive male hormones which may cause excessive hair growth. In PCOS along with hair growth, some other symptoms also occur like an irregular menstrual cycle, weight gain, etc. But sometimes these symptoms might not be present. If PCOS is present then you have to take treatment for that too for some time and do not worry because you can control your problem of PCOS with treatment. Now coming to your present problem of excessive hair growth, as you have been taking laser treatment, and it has shown a 50 % reduction and you wish to continue for some more sessions then you can go for it according to advise of your dermatologist. Sometimes, laser treatment completely cures the problem and sometimes there are chances of hair growing back. You can try these ayurvedic remedies for hair growth problem: One of the most common reasons behind the hair growth problem is an excessive level of testosterone (male hormone). Start taking one cup of Spearmint tea daily in the morning. This tea helps in reducing excessive male hormone. Take it regularly, it will help you a lot. You will find this tea easily in any nearby ayurvedic store or you can order it online. For removal of hairs naturally, you can try this: After removing excessive hair from the body, take pure Thanaka powder, which is obtained from Thanaka tree also called elephant tree. This powder you can take from any ayurvedic medicine shop. Mix this powder with pure kusumba oil (safflower oil). Make a paste of these two. Massage this paste on the area in a circular motion till it gets absorbed. Do not wash it or wipe it for three to four hours or preferably apply it in the night before sleeping. Repeat this process every day for 100 days and you will see an immensely positive result and decreased hair growth. Along with a reduction in hair growth, this combination is also helpful in making skin more lustrous. If you feel irritated or rashes occur over skin then you can remove it. But usually, this mixture does not have any side effects. Mild buring sensation might be present but if it goes within few seconds then do not worry. You can apply this mixture to the face as well as over the body. You can consult your dermatologist before applying it if you want to, but it usually does nothave any side effect. So, go for it. Do perform the ultrasound and any hormonal test, if not performed earlier, and if PCOS, do take treatment for that too. Try both these regularly and you will soon feel positive results.

I have a small, but firm/rubbery lump under my chin near the front of my neck (sort of the curve where neck and chin meet). It is the size of a large pea. I have been ill with a cold this week and also have generally swollen lymph nodes on the sides of my neck as well, which is typical for me. I have not, however, noticed similar swelling to this pea-sized bump in the past as the location and consistency of it seem a little different. I have, however, felt the same spot in the past for a while. It just feels bigger/more firm this time. Since I have always noticed the spot I am assuming it is a lymph node but my question is: Is it normal for a lymph node to gain this type of consistency? Typically mine swell in a more generalized/puffy way without being able to feel a defined lump. I also have chronic chin acne and been dealing with chronic mild wisdom tooth infections. I noticed this spot at a time where my tooth infections, acne, and cold symptoms were flaring up. So, I have been inclined to think it is due to infection. But, because it is a relatively different finding for me, I wanted to check and see if it should warrant further investigation. I have firm \\"shotty\\" lymph nodes in my groin that have always been there. This feels a bit more similar to those.","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, it is likely related to current infection, either a cold or tooth infection as it is a draining lymph node for both the sites. So, the site may appear unusual to you but it is possible to get enlarged at the site. Consistency may vary with infection, but it should not be stony hard which occurs in malignancies which can be identified very easily. Also, considering your age and other supporting factors like cold, etc., it is likely a reactive node secondary to infection. Also, groin lymph nodes are palpable in a majority of individuals which usually occurs due to noticed or unnoticed infection in lower limbs, genital in the past. So, it is usually not worrisome. The size of lymph node is usually less than 2 cm in the groin and less than 1 cm in the neck region. Also, other than size, the course of lymph nodes is important. So, observe it for a week and if not for rapid increase in size and it decreases in size then needs no investigations. If there is rapid enlargement and change in consistency to a hard one, then get a simple FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) which I am not expecting in you. So overall, it seems to be a reactive lymph node and should observe it for a week. Just check the oral cavity once for any obvious unusual lesion.

Pompholyx generally causes itching of the hands and feet. Since these body parts directly come in contact with external objects on a day to day basis. The substances that aggravate this condition are pollen, chemicals in detergents, paints, solvents and rubber materials. When you have an allergy, it is advisable that you stay away from the allergens. There are chances of blisters to be infected. Hence, do not puncture them. To control itching, I would suggest you to start taking tablet Cetirizine. Based on the severity, you may need oral and topical steroids. Kindly consult a dermatologist for a prescription to the above. Skin irritation that is caused when you are out in sunlight might be because of rosacea or can also be a cause of sensitivity to a particular wavelength. For this, I would advise you to start using a sunscreen with an SPF30 (sun protection factor) regularly. You may also need oral anti-oxidants and photoprotective medications that are prescription based.

My penis is uncircumcised. I also had fungal infections before so do not want my penis to be too moist. At times I use Nystatin powder for fungal infection. I have had bacterial and viral cultures to be sure, and these are negative. First, is there a good way to completely wash off the Vaseline? Even with soap, there is often a mild resident. Second, is there a safe alternative to Vaseline for this purpose which will not affect condoms?","Doctor":"Hi. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. Small abrasions on the glans penis that usually come across during sexual intercourse are healed up at their own. Problem occurs when they get combined with fungal, bacterial or viral attacks. 2. I preferably suggest you to apply K-Y jelly or gel before sex to get lubricated. It is a water based lubricant and has no chemical interaction with the latex of condoms. 3. For fungal infection you need to apply Hydrocortisone or Clotrimazole ointment on the chaffed skin of glans. This ointment will give you ease from abrasions too. You do not need to apply Vaseline especially the days when you will be having a fungal attack too. 4. Using Nystatin powder will make the surface more rough and dries up. That is not good in your case as it may cause more abrasions being dry. 5. Please avoid rigorous sexual intercourse especially in the days when you have fungal growth. 6. To completely wash off the Vaseline you do not need to use anything else. Soap wash with a mild soap like dove is the best option for you. 7. The residual Vaseline you are talking about has nothing to do with latex. It is totally safe and never renders the latex weak. 8. You do not need anything else other than Vaseline to apply on chapped skin (abrasions) when there is no fungal attack. It is a good option and I think it is working well for you. 9. In many of my patients with these issues, I opted in for circumcision and referred them to a general surgeon with very encouraging results.

The wisdom tooth usually has abnormal size, shape, and erupting pattern, which can lead to the inflammation of the surrounding soft tissue or gums. This is known as pericoronitis and often involves difficulty in chewing cheek bites, and ulcers. The most straightforward line of treatment is to go for extraction. Since you have given enough time for eruption, now it's better not to wait. Using topical anesthetic gel (to apply on gums) and lukewarm saline gargle may help you temporarily ease your symptoms.

I went through your complaint and also the photos (attachment removed to protect patient identity) that you provided of the lesion. As far as your history of painful sores on tongue tip is concerned, there can be various reasons. Most common are vitamin B12 deficiency, stress, irritant food or medications, and trauma. These sores disappear after a certain period if the cause is removed, so believe it or not, antibiotics may aggravate them if the cause was any stress or nutrition deficiency. Coming to your pictures, I got a superficial view of the lesion due to low resolution, and I could make out it does not seem to be HPV (human papillomavirus). But if you experience any tingling, difficulty swallowing, jaw or neck pain, hoarseness of voice, etc., then immediately consult an ENT specialist for oral examination. It can be swelling of your taste buds, which can be caused by similar things as mentioned above.

For HIV to transmit there has to be some exchange of infectious fluid like either blood semen or vaginal fluids or contact with infected mucosal surfaces like genital or anal mucosa e.g., during a sexual intercourse. A handjob is absolutely safe as it does not involve an exchange of any of these infectious fluids. Skin is not infectious as the virus is fragile and does not survive on the skin or dry surface unlike genital mucosa, which is moist.

It does not help that the chair of pre-med at my university flat-out told me that my statement sucked (after I had already applied because she did not give me feedback in time).The reason why I have never sought out my depression previously is because of my background, which influences my parents into thinking I am crazy or something is severely wrong with me.

Adolescent myopia is a condition that we come across in ophthalmology, and it is considered physiological, but specific approaches should be maintained and other pathologies to be excluded such as disorders in the macula that might be mimicking myopia.

Every individual has a change rate in refraction differently so every six months you should visit the optometrist and evaluate your refraction and if it does not exceed 0.5D every six months, then there is no need to worry.

On the later stage, we need to look forward to deltoid strengthening exercises, scapular muscle strengthening exercises, and arm strengthening exercises.

However, I did not get any sneezing or cough to date. At present, there is no fever. But after then, my right nostril is consistently producing foul-smelling greenish color mucous, and it is so repulsive as if something rotting inside. I doubted it is sinusitis and took Augmed 625 for three days (six tablets completed). The feverish feeling, body aches, and weakness resolved. However, this smelly mucus discharge, which is nauseating me 24 hours, is not getting cured. I am taking steam vapor twice a day along with Otrivin drops to relieve the congestion. While my left nostril is often transparent and occasionally produces normal white phlegm but right nostril is the culprit here. I am also getting headaches on the right side as if deep inside the skull and right jaw above the molar teeth. I consulted an ENT. She changed my antibiotics to Florenza 325 (twice a day) and also gave Mucolite SR tabs. I have already completed three days of this new regimen. But nothing seems to improve. She examined and said I do not have any visible Nasal polyps. My query is, does this sound normal to you? Does this sinusitis take very long to cure in spite of antibiotics? If it does not seem to be improved in the next two days, what would you suggest as the next course of action? The smelly discharge is nauseating me. I did not notice any blood in the phlegm. I keep blowing out the mucus and more seems to keep forming inside and occasionally drips down to the back of the throat. My tonsils are fine. I have no cough or sore throat or heaviness in the lungs. I am looking forward to the best remedy to get rid of this smelly mucus.","Doctor":"Hello. You defaulted on the course and dosage of Augmentin 625. It was supposed to have been taken thrice daily for at least five days. With the regimen that you made, I doubt if any bacteria would have got killed, but you would have most probably resulted in a resistant strain of bacteria inside your nose. Complete the second course of antibiotics as told by the ENT. If there is no improvement, give the mucus for culture sensitivity and take the right antibiotic. Additionally, take some antihistaminic and montelukast combination. Avoid excess steam if you are in polluted areas. Do not smoke or drink. Drink plenty of warm fluids. Get back to us if you need it.

I had a sexual encounter before 8 months with a professional with a condom. I am 95% sure that my protection was intact. Then I started reading about the HIV symptoms and technicalities of testing online. Five days later, I went to a Dermatology and Venereology specialist and described about the incident. He was confident enough that he advised me not to go for any testing. Although my fear of infection remained. Around two months post-exposure, I felt tenderness here and there like on the back of my head, arms, one lymph node in my underarm was swollen and I developed cold and cough. I started sweating during that time as well. I looked a bit thinner. I got panicked and went to the doctor again. He checked me and was still confident that I am not infected. But for my mental satisfaction, he prescribed me thorough testing which includes HIV1/2, VDRL, HBsAg, HCV along with urine R/E, M/E, C/S analysis. On 74 th day post-exposure I took all those tests and they all came back negative. After lapse of a few days again I felt some skin irritation on theback and burning sensation on my forearms. Although no skin changes can be seen. Again I got panicked thinking that I may be in the window period for HIV. But the doctor remained confident and he adivised me not to go for any repeat testing. But my sense of fear, anxiety, panic, guilt, and impurity continues. On 110th day post-exposure again I repeated the tests but I excluded the urine analysis this time. All the tests came negative again. The HIV tests were fourth-generation combo test both the time. I am on the eighth month post exposure. Still, I feel tenderness hear and there. Recently, I am developing small red blood vessel like dots just underneath my skin on my hand and feet which is staying for 5-7days and going away leaving faint black spots. I again showed it to the same doctor. He is confident and repeatedly asked me to stop worrying. He also gave me anti-anxiety, anti-OCD, anti-depressant drugs. I am also taking sessions with a psychologist. But still, my mind is not free from the fear of HIV and also fear that my wife and child might get infected by me. My questions are, do I need to repeat any test to out rule the probability of HIV? Are there any probability of error from lab test given the fact that I took the tests twice? Do I need to worry about the window period as there is conflicting information available on the internet? Do I need to worry about the phenomenon of delayed seroconversion? Do I need to opt for the tests from a different lab? Do I need to worry about HIV 1/2anymore? How to unroot the fear from deep inside my mind? Any other opinion on my history?","Doctor":"Hi. The chances of transmission of HIV by the given description is almost nil. HIV tests are repeatedly negative and after three months of exposure it is conclusive. You are free from HIV. There is no need for you to worry about seroconversion. You can forget about the episode and lead a normal life. There is no need for any further HIV tests in any lab. Just relax. Do some yoga, exercises, meditation, etc."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

I keep waking up in a cold sweat and feeling like my dream has actually happened.","Doctor":"Hi. Dream interpretation is not a reliable science branch yet. Many types of research have been done on dream interpretation but there are no conclusions yet as to what suggests what. Some researchers say dreams have no purpose or meaning and are nonsensical activities of the sleeping brain. Others say dreams are necessary for mental, emotional, and physical health. Studies have shown the importance of dreams to our health and well-being. In one study, researchers woke subjects just as they were drifting off into REM sleep. They found that those who were not allowed to dream experienced: Increased tension, anxiety, depression, difficulty concentrating, lack of coordination, weight gain, tendency to hallucinate. Nightmares, or bad dreams, are common in children and adults. Often nightmares are caused by: Stress, conflict, and fear, trauma, emotional problems, medication or drug use, illness. If you have a recurring nightmare, your subconscious may be trying to tell you something. Listen to it. If you cannot figure out why you are having bad dreams, and you continue to have them, I can help you figure out what is causing your nightmares and provide tips to put you at ease. In your case, you must be having an emotional issue with your friend and you are stressed due to that. Keep in mind that no matter how scary a nightmare is, it is not real and most likely will not happen to you in real life. Therefore, do not worry about any dreams at all. Worry may further stress you and may sometime make you be obsessive on those thoughts which may further develop into depression. Ignore those dreams. Engage in your day to day activities. Increase your physical activity level so that you sleep well and sound at night. Take care."},{"Patient":"Please give me a meaningful response as i cant aford to reply and i am scared that i am slowly losing my hearing or something.

There are two best available options for CAD (coronary artery disease) at present, one is a bypass, and the other is stenting. Other available options are not high and are only adopted is either is two is not possible. Considering multiple blockages, bypass remains the treatment of choice, however, if not willing for bypass then stenting is another reasonable good option. Sometimes we may not be able to open 100 percent blockages, but in those cases, we can keep him on medications for that as a blockage in the less critical vessel. He may undergo stenting as well, but stenting for such complicated lesions is tried in the higher center like PGIMER, etc. So, overall, if not willing to undergo bypass, then stenting may be a reasonable option and should be tried.

These symptoms can be caused due to a slipped disc. To confirm this and we may need to take up an MRI of the lumbar spine. Also, the piriformis syndrome symptoms are similar, but they are not radiating in symptoms as piriformis muscle tightness may lead to compression over the nerve root and can misguide the diagnosis. Having an MRI scan will be of the right decision. Post which if there is no disc disease is noticed than another differential diagnosis has to be made and treated accordingly. Please take an MRI scan and let us know the reports. I will help you further with the therapeutic plan."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have dry gray spots.

The surgery will entail removing a large amount of the mastoid bone. Of course, with this surgery comes the risk of damage through an incision of the facial nerve. This worries me a lot more than the pain of the operation and hearing loss (even though as of late I am pretty much deaf in my right ear and have been for quite a while now). But If I were to have my facial nerve damaged in this surgery is there chance of repair? Would it depend on the severity?","Doctor":"Hello.  The risk of facial nerve injury even in revision mastoid surgeries is less than 10 %. However, if there is cholesteatoma sitting on the facial nerve or facial canal is dehiscent, there is more susceptibility to FN (facial nerve) damage. Is there any prior facial weakness. Meticulous dissection of cholesteatoma ideally should not damage facial.  Even if there is damage and it is recognized intraoperatively, it can be corrected by various means. So yes there are techniques to deal with FND (facial nerve damage) if it occurs but the best to ensure it is not injured is to identify it and carry out meticulous dissection of the disease and remove the disease or leave the matrix over the facial as situation demands."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My mother has been operated two months before.

If the lines are from grabbing him tight like finger impressions then they should fade and should not cause any damage. However, if you accidentally twisted his arm, there may be swelling or bruises.

I have pain on the right side of the head, neck, and shoulder. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from right-sided head, neck, and shoulder pain. Most head, neck, and shoulder pain is resulted from sprains and strains by incorrect posture or mechanical injury due to daily works. It may result from soft tissue injury (including muscle, tendons, ligaments, etc). Again nerve injury of these area can produce head, neck, and shoulder pain. Displacement of cervical disc can produce same type of symptoms known as herniated or prolapsed disc. Rotator cuff tendons hold your arm with shoulder and rotator cuff tear which is caused by sports or overuse can produce head, neck, and shoulder pain. Inflammation of tendons (tendonitis) or bursa (bursitis) of these areas also can produce the same type of clinical symptoms. Again heart attack, angina, stroke, cervical artery dissection, etc., can present the same type of clinical symptoms. Treatment depends on causes. So you should undergo some investigations like an x-ray of cervical spine, CT scan or MRI of cervical spine, RBS (random blood sugar), CBC (complete blood sugar), USG (ultrasound) of the hepatobiliary system with blood pressure monitoring, etc., to find out the underlying the causes which are responsible for your suffering and then treat them accordingly. For your head, neck, and shoulder pain you can take Naproxen plus and Esomeprazole combination (twice daily) with Baclofen (twice daily) with calcium plus vitamin D combination (once daily). Please inform me of the results after undergoing the investigations and then I will be able to help you further."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

I had a lumbar puncture done and my initial opening pressure was 21 but went down to 19 after a little while. This procedure was done last year, back then I had the majority of my headache in the frontal lobe with symptoms such as vertigo, tinnitus and visual disturbances. Roughly six months ago, I started developing pain in the back of my head on the left side. This pain is absolutely excruciating and goes from the base of my skull up into my head. My quality of life is severely deteriorating due to being in so much pain constantly. I wake up in pain and I go to sleep in pain. I have been prescribed numerous medications from different neurologists over the years and nothing is working. I am currently taking 1000 mg of Sodium Valproate daily.

Stretch marks are formed in areas of a rapid growth spurt or weight gain, due to side effects of certain medications or other medical conditions. Treatment will depend on whether your stretch marks are new or old, color reddish or whitish and the cause of stretch marks. Co2 laser sessions are quite effective.

When anger rises, our animal instinct tries to protect our-self resulting in aggressive behavior. Aggressive behavior happens only when anger goes out of control. Getting angry is fine. But you should make sure that it does not cross the boundary. In my opinion, instead of controlling anger after it is triggered, you should try not to get emotional at all. Understanding the circumstances and correct perception should help you never even start the emotion. Anger management therapy is the management of anger after it got triggered. That should be useless. I could suggest some cognitive behavior therapy method in this aspect."},{"Patient":"i am 40 yrs old .

I welcome you to icliniq. I can understand you must be very upset about your problem. Well the symptoms you mention seem to be occurring due to irritable bowels. The irritable syndrome is a gastrointestinal entity where patient has abdominal pain which change with physiologic activities such as defecation, belching. This abdominal pain can accompany diarrhea, which is called as Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diarrhea (D) predominant (IBS-C) to be precise. The blood test, urine test, and Ultrasound abdomen that you shared are very much within normal limits. So don't be worry at moment. You said stool test contain macrophages, but I can't see any stool detail report among files you uploaded. Well macrophages or leuckocytes can be present in stool harmlessly and does not suggest any diagnosis by its own. I would recommend you to get some more stool test that can determine it clearly. So the IBS usually affects small and large bowel; and it is not uncommon to have concomitant stomach irritation which is called functional dyspepsia. So part of your symptoms such as stomach cramps, bloating are secondary to stomach irritation. You are on lots of medications, many with similar drug class, that does not seem a wise to continue for now.

I had an l5 s1 disc herniation and later diagnosed with severe lumbar spinal stenosis at l4 l5 as well. My back pain is more critical than the leg pain. However, I have persistent calf and foot spasms and cramping (especially in bed and at night). I am able to exercise and lift heavy objects, but not able to walk more than a mile at a time. I believe the stenosis is more of an issue right now than the disc herniation, and my MRI confirms the disc is not as bad as it was years ago. I have done physical therapy, acupuncture, chiropractor, and epidural injections, but, my lower back pain remains an issue (especially when standing and walking for a long time). My doctors recommend a laminectomy, though I am scared that surgery may leave me in worse shape than I currently am. Can I have some advice? Should I go through with the laminectomy, or should I deal with the back pain since I have built a high tolerance for pain and can do most (but not all) activities?","Doctor":"Hello. You are quite aware of the condition and have managed to live with the issue, but as you say, you cannot walk not than a mile, but it does not seem to be your main issue. If you required to walk longer, then laminectomy will be the solution, but you need to get relief from back pain. I will hazard a guess that this is from local instability, faceted, or discal. I will say that because that is usually the reason for back pain in patients with disc issues. Lumbar canal stenosis will not often give rise to back pain. I will recommend that you discuss this with your doctor and perhaps go for laminectomy and pedicle screw stabilization as this will help relieve both issues."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having a revision rhinoplasty and it is going to be under sedation and local anestheia but I am very scared.

During general, anesthesia patients put in a deep sleep like state. Even respiration of the patient also under control of the machine. The patient cannot remember about surgery during the procedure. It may associate with little complications. Local anesthesia is blocking the area the part undergoing surgery. The patient may be awake. He may feel the movement of the body procedure.

Over the past two years, I have got two cold sores that have not completely healed. One was before a year and the most recent one was in February of this year. They are faint but apparent to me and every time I move my lips, eat, have hot food, shower, sweat, or just about do anything I can feel them on my upper lip. I have been to multiple doctors and two dermatologists. I have been prescribed Valtrex, Tacrolimus, and medicines for the pain. I have used many over the counter medicines such as Neosporin, Abreva, Hydrocortisone, Vitamin E oil, face cleansers, tea tree oil, Aquaphor and kept it moisturized and clean throughout. Nothing has worked or even made a slight difference. I get the constant tingling and it is not super painful but I can feel it there as if it has not healed or subdued.

If it is not a cold sore or cannot be healed with what I have been prescribed I nor my dermatologist have any idea what it could be. How I can be rid of it? Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. As per your information and photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I can see there is swelling and some small pus-filled rash and small scars. If it is recurrent then there are some possibilities like herpes labialis, cyclic neutropenia, neutrophilic dermatoses (localized), granulomatous cheilitis. Yes, punch skin biopsy will give a more close clue for diagnosis. Along with it, you need to do Tzanck smear from lip area, CBC (complete blood count), absolute neutrophil count, and ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody). Do you have diabetes or high blood pressure or on any medicines for the same? Or any other complaint? From your detailed information, recurrent herpes labialis or neutrophil (WBC) related skin disorder are more possible. Tingling, and pain indicate nerve fiber involvement which is more possible in herpes virus infection.

Sometimes the heaviness of head becomes extreme and I feel it is spinning even at the slightest movement of neck and it is accompanied with bowel movements. I feel that I may faint and the feeling subsides only after passing normal stool. Since 9 months these incidents used to happen on a daily basis especially during the office hours but now it is happening at the rate of one to two times per week. I did MRI brain, cervical spine and ECG of heart. Everything turned out to be normal except detection of mild scoliosis of neck. In the morning when I wake up I do not feel so bad but as the day progresses my stiffness of neck and heavy headedness increases. Orthopedist told me that I am having cervical vertigo, neurologist told me that I am having posture problems, GP told me that I am suffering from phobic disorder (assured). Now I have a few questions. Am I suffering from any gastrointestinal disorder? (sometimes lower abdomen pains but there is no loss of appetite). Do I have cervical arthritis and can it cause gas problems? Is it possible for intestinal gas to hit the brain? In such cases when bowel is not passed at right time can a patient die? Am I suffering from any cervical spondylosis? Cracking sound is heard when I move my head too much and head spins too. And sometimes it seems as though I am losing balance from ground.

There is no cord compression or central canal stenosis. While at home I do not feel so bad but in confined space of office my head starts to spin, back of head feels tight, I feel my motion is restricted and the balance from ground seems to get lost. Am I suffering from any life-threatening disease?","Doctor":"Hello.

I have been struggling with anxiety due to menopause. My general doctor thought it might be a good idea to switch my medication. She recommended that I go down to 100 mg a week on the Zoloft and then go to Pristiq. The problem is that the with drawl is so bad at the 100 mg I cannot handle it. So I started over going down to 175 mg and then to 150, and it was awful. I was in such bad shape I could not do it. Can I go from taking a select to write into the new prescription?","Doctor":"Hello. As you are having severe withdrawals and discontinuation symptoms even after lowering the dose to 175 mg, I would suggest you consult a psychiatrist in person for evaluation, and then you can discuss with him or her regarding the following, As the reason for the change of medicine is anxiety during menopause, i.e., a new issue besides one for which you were taking Zoloft (Sertraline) (and it was working fine), instead of cross tapering you can go for augmentation. Mirtazapine or Celexa (Citalopram) is a few options to go with adding a short term Benzodiazepine like Ativan to help you with withdrawal symptoms. Also, do practice relaxation techniques like breath relaxation exercises daily as it will help you relax and eases your anxiety. Checking your thyroid status is also necessary.

Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. You have bilateral renal pelvic obstruction due to stones with diabetes with urinary tract infection. The pain in the groin is due to pelvic renal calculi, the pain of which radiates to the groin. The infection needs to be treated with tablet Levoflox 500 mg once a day for 14 days along with injection Amikacin 500 mg twice a day for 14 days (if serum creatinine is less than 1.6 mg/dl) followed by clearance of stones bilaterally. Otherwise, your infection does not get resolved as the pus is due to disease associated with stones. Your stomach upset and pain in the abdomen is due to Nitrofurantoin, which causes gastritis and acidity. Nitrofurantoin is not the right choice for treating such infection. It can be useful as maintenance therapy. Kindly get diabetes treated. Please check serum creatinine checked once you start injection Amikacin. The presence of stones prevents the total clearance of infection.

I understand your concern. Autoimmune responses are the best met with the particular drugs, which your doctor might have already prescribed. Also, get checked your vitamin B12 and blood sugar levels. You can use topical anesthetic gel (like Benzocaine), Triamcinolone, and which will ease your soreness. Apply them alternatively, three to four times a day for four to five days. Check with your doctor if you need antacids, and continue medicines for GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). Sjogren's syndrome involves dryness of eyes, as well as dryness of the mouth.

Firstly you have the problem of acid reflux, digestion issues, feeling like vomiting (nausea) and this is causing the mild pain in the throat if the acid reflex is too much. For this issue, I would suggest taking, cap Omeprazole 20 mg one capsule 30 minutes before breakfast daily for seven day This medication will help improve the acid reflux, feeling of vomiting, and throat pain. Secondly, depression is a common cause of stomach problem. I want to suggest you visit a psychiatrist who will see the requirement of medication or you might need evaluation by a psychologist for counseling. Without taking care of depression, your stomach problem might not resolve completely. I hope this answers your question.

There could be many reasons for this issue. If you always had problems with concentration, and not just while studying, but have a short attention span, it could be attention deficit disorder. If the problem is of recent origin and you are getting stressed out with the burden of studies, it could be anxiety. If you have lost interest in studying and some other activities, it could also be depression.  Besides psychiatric disorders, being distracted by something else which is on your mind or you do not find the study interesting could be other reasons for lack of concentration.

How long have you been taking Mirtazapine 15 mg? It usually takes about four weeks to see any benefits. If there are no side effects, your doctor can consider increasing the dose further to 30 mg once daily. You need to be closely monitored by your doctor while titrating up the dose. You have already been on two different antidepressants, which are SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). Mirtazapine is a different class of antidepressant, so hopefully, you should find it helpful. Does your GP see you, or does a psychiatrist treat you? Discuss with them about having psychological therapy along with medication. Therapy will help to identify and correct any cognitive distortions related to depression. It looks like you fantasizing by creating scenarios to escape from a complicated reality.

I am 17 years old, pretty thin, have celiac. I had dry skin on my face for a while but about nine months ago I immediately started to lose hair, experience uncontrollable dandruff, and my skin became dryer than ever. My individual hairs became thinner (especially towards the roots), dryer, and started to fall out consistently from everywhere on my head except for a small area above my neck. Then came excruciating itchiness and my scalp started to produce a oil with a unpleasant musty smell. Recently, I started to lose more hair in my sideburns and temples but still experience hairloss all over my scalp (I have not had a receding hairline though). Also, in addition to dandruff, my scalp has these strange small yellow substances that are the size of dandruff but don't really resemble it. The hairs that fall out have small, yellow, oily clumps of something toward the roots and I have also gotten several polyester-like thin spirally hairs. Acne has also been bad (even when I've been off sugar, fruits, and grains) and often spreads into my scalp. There is no distinct occurrences of hair loss on my dad's side of the family. My mother's father still has a full head of hair. The only two people who have experienced hairloss in my family are my mother's two brothers. My shower water is iron-rich wellwater and often smells bad gives the skin on my face a burning sensation (even when we use a salt filter).

It only said two times a day on the bottle. I also had 500 mg of Acetaminophen with it. Will I be fine?","Doctor":"Hello. A dose of Amoxycillin at 20 years of age is around 1500 mg per day. This total of 1500 mg can be divided into two of approximately 750 mg or three doses of about 500 mg. You have taken the drug recommended in a whole day in six hours, and this will not cause any harm or side effect because when you take medicine for the first time the drug levels in the body are not maintained fully so if you take the drug in six hours, it will not cause any harm. Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) is a drug for fever, which is usually given with Amoxicillin, and it has no drug reaction with Amoxicillin, so this will also have no effect on your body. In all, I think that you should not worry about this. Do not take any more Amoxicillin today. I hope this will help you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 18 and I rarely brush.

Irregular maintenance of good oral hygiene (like tooth brushing) can lead to tartar or plaque deposits around the teeth and on the gums. This weakens the jaw bones and mobilizes teeth in the long run. Bad breath can also be seldom avoided. However, prevention is better than cure and let me show you how to prevent it: 1. Get scaling and root planing done by your dentist. 2. Maintain good oral hygiene by brushing at least twice a day, along with using a good mouthwash. 3. Follow-up with your doctor at every 3 to 4 months to see how the treatment is working for you.

I am a coronary artery disease patient, with diabetes. Thinking about these issues cause me more anxious. Please help. I am currently on Mirtaz 7.5 and Daxid 50 mg. I have also done sugar, lipid profile, 2D echo, ECG, and TMT.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. First of all, I like to inform you that anxiety disorder is a treatable disorder during current times as a lot of medications are available in this regard. As I can see you are taking two medications for the same but unfortunately dose of both medications is at lower limits. I also feel instead of two medications it will be ideal to have one medication with proper dosage. For example dose of Daxid (Sertraline) is 50-200 mg per day and the dose of Mirtazapine is 15-60 mg for most individuals. In my opinion, you need to discuss the optimization of dose with your treating psychiatrist. As I can see there are issues with stomach bloating and constipation. Mirtazapine needs to be avoided as far as possible. This is because abdominal side effects along with constipation are very common especially among the elderly. There is also a possibility that your medications for CAD or diabetes contributing to the current problem. For that purpose I feel you need to discuss same with your cardiologist. In addition to medications, there is a need for stress management. I can see that you have excessive concern about the ongoing medical illness. First of all, we need to acknowledge that these two conditions are treatable and with appropriate care you can have near optimal life.To smoothen the stress management, I am writing down a few of the strategies that will help you. 1. Diet: Ensure intake of adequate quantity of fiber. Two servings of vegetable salad and two servings of fruits (one preferable citrus fruit). Avoid junk food and fast food especially pizza, burgers, and excessive sweets. 2. Ensure adequate water intake. Recommended intake of water is two to three liters a day. Insufficient intake of water could be a contributing factor in the causation of symptoms. 3. Early morning exercise and brisk walking for 30 minutes at a stretch preferably in the garden will be very helpful. 4. Avoid tea, coffee, nicotine, and alcoholic beverages. If at all you want to drink something, drink fresh lime water. It is very much refreshing. 5. Start your day with a glass of lemon water with two spoons of honey added. Have a good breakfast. 6. Do not take work so seriously. We all have the feeling to excel in our respective fields and do not spend adequate time with our own self trying to understand our own needs. Spend time with your family and friends. 7. While working take frequent regular breaks. I will advise you to take a break of 5-10 minutes after every 50-55 minutes. Close your eyes and rotate the eyeballs for a couple of minutes. 8. Avoid starring for a longer time at the computer screen or TV. 9. Steam inhalation before going to sleep will be very refreshing. It will also benefit. 10. Take multivitamin and calcium supplement. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have low fever since yesterday. My TLC is 7100/cmm. In urine report pus cells are 2 to 4 hpf, epithelial cells are 1 to 2 hpf. Everything else is absent and normal. What infection could it be? What medicine to take?","Doctor":"Hello. It seems to be a typical result. Have you any other symptoms besides low fever? If you have pain, difficulty, or burning sensation during urinating, it may be a urinary infection, and the urine analysis is not done properly. It must be done with the first urine of the morning and the middle portion of the complete amount if you have not other symptoms, it may cause a common simple viral infection. Nothing to be worried about. I would recommend you to have another complete blood count with formula and fibrinogen and CRP included, and a urine test too after a few days. Meanwhile, have a light diet with plenty of liquids and vitamins. Antipyretics are only to control the temperature if it goes high."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother got full body check up. Please check the report and guide us. Her vitamin D, B12, iron are less and it is showing alert in blood test. She has weakness, body swelling in summer, pain in leg, and tiredness.","Doctor":"Hi. I have checked the attached reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Her liver profile, kidney profiles, thyroid reports, iron profile reports and hemoglobin levels are absolutely normal. So liver disease, renal disease, thyroid problem, iron deficiency anemia can be excluded as a cause for weakness. The significant finding include very low vitamin D level and slight low vitamin B12. So low vitamin D level might be the cause for weakness. Following is the treatment for that. She should be prescribed 60000 IU sachet of Cholecalciferol that should be taken once a week for eight weeks. Calci D tablet after completion of sachet can be continued for a few weeks. Advise her for taking sun exposure for 10 minutes at around 9 to 10 AM in morning. She can be prescribed Multivitamin tablet like Riconia Forte or Becosules. Advise her to do light exercise in morning. Check her blood pressure also which has not been mentioned here. If bone pain and swelling are more than local part, X-ray can be done. Whenever she develops swelling, she can be prescribed diuretic medication like Chlorthalidone. At this age I suggest to investigate with 2D echocardiography as well. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further. Best regards."},{"Patient":"HelIo doctor, I have attached the thyroid profile test reports of my mother who is taking Thyronorm 50 mcg currently. I want to know what is your opinion to control the thyroid functions.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned it appears that she is under-corrected for hypothyroidism. You must increase the dose of Thyronorm to 100 mcg once daily and repeat thyroid function test after four weeks and then we will review again and decide on whether there is any further need for dose titrations or not. Besides I would like to ask whether she takes her medications regularly early in the morning on empty stomach and then has breakfast one hour later? Secondly, is she on any other medication for any other condition? Also, does she have any gastrointestinal problem like problems with digestion, etc.? Also, please do a thyroid antibodies test as well, anti-TPO and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have not been able to move the left side of my face properly since yesterday morning. I went to the doctor yesterday, and he said if it did not improve to come back, but I can not get back into the doctor. I have pain under my jaw and now feeling in my tongue on that side of my face either.","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your question carefully, and I understand your concern. 1. Do you have difficulties also in closing your left eye or raising your left eyebrow 2. Did your taste change? 3. Did your doctor prescribe any medication? 4. What was your doctor's opinion yesterday, since he surely did a physical exam? Did he also check your ears? 5. Do you have other symptoms or is just the face involved? In general, if the answer for the first two questions is yes (not smiling properly, difficulty closing the left eye and raising the left eyebrow, if you chew food on the left side, you notice the taste is changed) and the symptoms are confined just to your left side of the face, I suspect a peripheral facial nerve palsy. The management plan that you should discuss face to face with your doctor, 1. Corticosteroid treatment within 72 hours of symptoms onset. After 72 hours, I do not recommend (like Prednisolon 50 mg per day for five days, then reducing the dose gradually over five days in total 10 days of corticosteroid therapy). 2. Artificial tears during the day and eye protection during the night. 3. Nerve conduction studies after 10-14 days. 4. Physical therapy (your doctor might give you a leaflet with appropriate exercises, or you could search on youtube for Bell's palsy exercises. I hope my answer was helpful. Feel free to contact me again if you have further questions or concerns."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 38 years old, male.

The hard lump under your tongue is mostly inflammation which usually gets very hard due to the structure of tongue. The bumps are formed when the inflamed tongue presses against the teeth causing that particular pattern.The inflammation of tongue usually becomes very hard to touch and grayish in color, it will take at least a week or two to return to normal. The acne problem might be due to increased hormonal activity in your body mostly and is not related to the other. I would suggest you to wait for 10 days for the tongue to return to normal.

I am still in pain and the outside of my chin and lower lip is still numb. The dentist told me I would not be in any pain after the procedure, but it is still hurting. I had Ibuprofen 200 mg four times a day. Is this normal to have numbness and to have pain in the tooth?","Doctor":"Hi. As I see this, there are two issues here. Firstly, the pain in your lower left tooth could be due to a couple of reasons. Whenever there is infection of the pulp, the infection spreads beyond the tip of the tooth; it extrudes the tooth out of its socket within the jaw. When this happens the tooth is painful especially when it touches the opposing upper tooth. The other reason for tooth pain could be that the entire infected pulp was not removed. Either way, you need to go back to your dentist. The second issue here is the numbness of your chin and lower lip. This usually happens when the nerve in the lower jaw gets nicked by the needle while giving the local anesthetic. If the damage is minor, the nerve repairs itself and the normal sensation will return. If numbness persists after two to three months, then you need to consult your doctor."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My father is 63 years old.

So, your father needs early evaluation and treatment for his bladder growth. Based on CT scan and bladder biopsy, further treatment can be decided. For small and simple growths, endoscopic removal is possible. For growths which extend into the bladder wall, surgery to remove bladder or radiotherapy is needed. For growths already spread beyond the bladder, chemotherapy may be needed. No point in delaying the treatment. Also, there is no need to panic.

My height is 5'5\\", and weight is 69 kg. I have been suffering from acne, redness and often small, red, pus-filled bumps on my face since I am 14. I visited a lot of dermatologists, but they never able to identify the reason. I have got prescriptions and that never really helped me. The conditions worsened a year ago, and I got them on my cheeks, forehead and nose. I thought that it was a normal acne until I finally visited an experienced dermatologist, who suggested that I had subtype 3 rosacea, sensitive and oily skin. He prescribed me some medicines first, and it gave me huge relief. I got rid of all the acne within 10 days. Three months passed and as the winter season came nearer, they again started appearing all over my face and then gone after some time. I visited dermatologist again who suggested me to take regular peels. I started taking sittings of peeling and after one or two peeling my face started improving and got clear in some time. Peeling worked like magic. It was superficial face peel, but do not know about the acid content and the type of acid he used to apply. He used to say that he was giving me mild peel. I stopped taking peeling as I had to leave my place and shift to the different location due to the job change. It was good for a couple of months until the temperature change. I started getting rosacea symptoms again though at this time rate of acne and bumps was low, still, it bothered a lot. Currently, I am on medication which my old dermatologist suggested. It is Papulex face wash for summer, non-drying cleanser for winter, Fisioativ cream for the night to moisturize the skin and Fix Derma UV protection, which I still apply daily thrice a day. The only thing I notice is that in my case rosacea comes back when there is a temperature change and also some stress. But, peeling is the only real magic for me. Please suggest the best possible peeling solution available. Can I use it at home probably once in 15 days?","Doctor":"Hi.

It results in vomiting, abdominal pain and my left eye gets blurred. I had taken some antacids previously. Eight years back, I had got endoscopy done, but did not find any ulcers. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. Consumption of any food stuff is not related to left arm pain or discomfort. Contaminated food can cause food poisoning and acidity which can result in vomiting, abdominal pain, but it will not cause left arm pain. Some heart related problem can cause left arm pain and vomiting. The pain due to heart problem is mostly exertional pain and it radiates to back, left shoulder, jaw and neck. So, in my opinion you should consult a physician as early as possible and get your ECG done. You can take antacid drugs like Pantoprazole and Domperidone combination (tablet Pan-D) for the time being. You need proper checkup and ECG. Avoid physical exertion, exposure to cold, heavy meals and stress. I advise you to take rest and consult a physician. Acidity or heart related problem. ECG. Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Your concern is correct. Plucking nasal hair can injure or break the skin or nasal mucosa leading to the root infection that may spread to the brain. The triangular area in and around the nose forms the dangerous triangle or dangerous area of the face.

I have dealt with tonsil stones for years, and have typically used my finger or Waterpik to remove them. Last Saturday, I discovered some tonsil stones and used my finger to remove them. Upon not getting everything, I got the Waterpik out (soft rubber tip) and simply moved it gently around what appears to be the cluster of little tonsil stones. As I made that initial gentle move with the waterpik, I felt a little pump feeling as if the waterpik ran into a tonsil stone or something. I tried to see what was going on and continued. However, something started to bleed and continued to the point that I could not remove anything else. The next day, I went in to examine and it looked like the little cluster of tonsil stones were now visible. However, they seemed to be attached to the skin. This worried me because now I thought that the skin had started to grow around the little stones. The area around the stones is also deep/bluish red and hurts. I have gargled with mouthwash and salt water to help kill any germs. I have kept checking it and the \\"little cluster of tonsil stones\\" seems to act more like pus and less like tonsil stones. The rest of the tonsil feels fine as well as the other tonsil. They felt fine before the incident detailed above.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and read every detail you wrote. I must commend you for the detailed and chronological description of your problem. Like you predicted, it does not appear like stones. It is infected tonsils. The tonsil is studded with pus which gets formed in the tonsillar crypts. The stones also form in the same crypts due to calcium deposition.  Probably when you tried removing the stone on Saturday you accidentally introduced some germs and infectious agent to it and the subsequent day you developed tonsillitis infection. That explains the redness, congestion, and pain. Bleeding also indicates a breach of the mucosa which could have acted as a port of entry for microbes. For now, you require a course of antibiotics, some decongestants, gargles, and painkillers. If you were to come to me, I would suggest taking Clarithromycin 500 mg tablet, one tablet twice daily after meals. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent.  You should also take a decongestant like Phenylephrine (or Ephedrine) with Levocetirizine (or Loratidine). Additionally, anti-inflammatory medicines like Trypsin-Chymotrypsin-Bromelain will accentuate healing and repair by the body. You may use Chlorhexidine or Betadine or Benzydamine gargles after each meal, but make sure you dilute the same with lukewarm water.  You may use salt water gargles also. I would like to say that gargles tend to increase acidity if you suffer from it. Plain Paracetamol (Tylenol) would suffice for pain relief. You may take the Paracetamol thrice daily. If severe pain is there, you can try Lidocam lozenges which are Lignocaine lozenges for chewing and immediate pain relief. If the tonsillar stones have been occurring repeatedly then perhaps you can think of removing the tonsils. Tonsils do not serve any function at your age. Rather, the repeated development of stones causes the release of infections from tonsils to other areas of the throat and even ears.  Tonsils mainly function to engage and remove harmful organisms from the aerodigestive tract during childhood. But over the years, it accumulates so many microorganisms that it starts acting as a source of infection.  I would advise that you explore the option of removing the tonsils surgically. Various options exist for the same and latest methods using Coblation are very safe and cause minimal bleeding and can be done as a day-care procedure. Do let us know how you feel and share the progress after starting the treatment.

I have an occasional mild tummy ache and nausea which is relieved by belching. I have suffered from acute gastritis now for several years, although I cannot be 100 % certain why. I tested positive for the h. pylori bacterium two years ago. I have consulted medical specialists in this past week, who have asked me about pain, but I have felt no pain when tested, nor vomiting, or blood in feces, etc. So, it is gastritis, although again, I am not sure what it stems from. There are possibilities though. Firstly, there is the presence of h. pylori. Secondly, a week ago, I accidentally brushed a bottle I was drinking from against my fridge, before drinking from it. I was worried about it because my fridge has not been cleaned in years. So, I may have picked up a bug. Thirdly, about 25 years ago, I had a very severe alcohol problem, although I have not drunk alcohol since then apart from very occasionally. That said, alcohol can be a trigger for gastritis, although not this time, as I have not drunk anything alcoholic for nearly two years. I have Omeprazole tablets 20 mg. I have been told it is advisable to take these for gastritis. Is Omeprazole generally well tolerated? Are there any side effects? Does it clear up symptoms rapidly? Is 20 mg a suitable dose for gastritis? Alternatively, I can take a week long course of Omeprazole, Amoxicillin, and Clarithromycin (triple therapy). I have these medicines at home. Are there side effects to this therapy? If so, what are they? Is it safe to take this? So, this is my situation. What do you advise? Should I try out the Omeprazole or the triple therapy? I look forward to hearing from you.","Doctor":"Hello. You seem to be suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) associated with gastritis. Yes, you can take Omeprazole 20 mg. Once a day would be enough. There are no major side effects. There is no indication for taking triple therapy for h.pylori again. I advise the following for treatment of IBS.

There is no pain. It is a little sensitive to cold and hot. My bite seems fine and nothing feels off about it. So, I do not think it is a high filling. The filling inside my tooth is deep. There is a lot more depth than my other teeth. So my question is, is this something that requires a crown or root canal to fix the pinching problem when chewing or will it possibly go away? Could it be that the filling is too close to the nerve? Also, when he did the filling, he got some of the filling material on my top teeth and I cannot get it off by cleaning it.

Currently, I am taking gastric tablets and medicines to control diarrhea.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern and worry about the severity of the situation. Loose stool along with increased frequency of stool (6 to7 times per day), mucus and occasional episodes of bleeding suggest inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease) involving large intestine. In this condition, an inner layer of the large intestine becomes inflamed. There will be redness and swelling. Thus produce mucus and liquid consistency of stool secondary to poor absorption of nutrients. In severe cases, bleeding might occur due to development of ulcer in the inflamed part of the large intestine. Colonoscopy with biopsy, CBC (complete blood count), stool examination routine and culture. Inflammatory bowel disease. Medical treatment for disease. Surgery might require if no response from medical treatment or progression of disease.

I am being treated with phlebotomy. I have fatigue at times, as well as some thinking impairment at times. Over time I have developed various anomalies in my blood test results, which my doctor explained as normal. For instance, I typically have 1+ Anisocytosis, 2+ Hypochromia and 2+ Microcytes. I have had occasional ovalocytes mentioned as well as large platelets and at times giant platelets. My last CBC mentioned there were a few schistocytes. My question is this: I understand that these are all blood cells that are misshapen due to the PV or to the chronic phlebotomies I receive. Are these misshapen cells a danger in and of themselves, or are they only indicators of a problem? How many weird cells can I have running around inside of me before it is worrisome?","Doctor":"Hi. Based on your query regarding polycythemia, my opinion is as follows: Due to nutritional deficiencies, secondary to excessive RBC (red blood cell) production and also mild dyserythropoiesis (defective development of red blood cells), you can find microcytic hypochromic cells ( due to iron deficiency) and ovalocytes (due to vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency). Vitamin B12 and folic acid can impact other cell line resulting in hypersegmented neutrophils and giant platelets also.  As there is iron deficiency, anisocytosis (unequal sized red cells) and poikilocytosis (abnormal shaped red cells) is seen. More the iron deficiency, more the percentage of anisopoikilocytosis. Schistocytes (irregularly shaped red cells) could be due to marrow fibrosis or red cell trapping in fibrin fragments. The former usually occurs in marrow at a later stage of polycythemia vera. At present schistocytes could be due to dyserythropoiesis in marrow. No fibrin trapping can be thought of. Things that need to be watched are - any reduced counts of red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets. This will occur before increase of schistocytes. Bone marrow fibrosis due to burning out phase will lead onto pancytopenia (deficiency of RBC, WBC and platelets) and schistocytes. As all other counts are normal, you need not worry about schistocytes for now. Schistocytes percentage more than 5% or specifically 10% should be worrisome. It usually does not occur in PV, unless it is late stage and with marrow fibrosis and pancytopenia.

What should I do stop hide this?","Doctor":"Hello. I appreciate you asking your problem. In my professional opinion, it could be an allergic reaction triggered due to your hair dye. What happens is that the dye triggers an immunologic mechanism just below the skin at the level of the hair follicles, which either arrest the growth temporarily or eradicates them. The other possibility could be a condition called alopecia aerata, which causes a similar clinical picture. In either case, the cause remains the same. I would appreciate you sending me a clear photo of your scalp to pinpoint the cause accurately. In the meanwhile, stop the use of any hair dye as any form of preservative in the dye could further worsen your situation least to say permanently. Maintain good hair hygiene and wait for the hair to grow out in about a month. If you still do not get any growth, consider injecting triamcinolone acetonide 10mg in the affected areas of the scalp every 3-4 weeks for as long as your skin specialist feels suitable. Trust me, and the injection is that painful or harmful. We use a 30 to 32 G needle, which is very, very thin. It is an everyday thing for dermatologists, so nothing to worry about.

As there is oligomenorrhoea and your menses have returned after a long time, eight months now, it is essential that the cause needs to be investigated. The likely reasons are PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome), Hypothyroidism), or Hyperprolactinemia. You need to get a complete hormonal profile with serum estradiol and serum testosterone levels with ultrasound pelvis to look for ovarian cysts (PCOS). The bleeding post intercourse is likely due to cervical erosions, which can cause bleeding and hence, a per speculum exam with a Pap smear is necessary as well. The ultrasound can deduce the endometrial thickness and if thick then an endometrial biopsy may also be taken for histopathological examination and learning the phase of the endometrium. In the meantime, you should be placed on antifibrinolytics like Tranexamic acid for controlling heavy bleeding. Obesity itself is a part of insulin resistance in PCOS, which can cause ovulation and hence delayed menses often.

The length of time they stay alive has a lot to do with environmental factors and how fast they dry up. So it is very unlikely for her to get pregnant if she touches your pants and do masturbation. Infections are usually transmitted because of direct skin to skin contact or else with unprotected sexual intercourse unless the partner had any particular sexually transmitted infection.

What can I do for it?","Doctor":"Hi. Masturbation is a safe and pleasure giving procedure. Do not get worried about it. But, doing it two or three times a day is not good. Maintain a frequency of two to three times a week. Excess masturbation leads to social anxiety and groin discomfort can occur. To relieve excess masturbation, yoga and meditation can be beneficial. Please do not be alone in a room. Make short and long-term goals and focus on study. Avoid watching excess porn if you have the habit of watching it. To gain weight, you can take more protein diet and you can go to a gym.

But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Are you married or in a relationship? Do you masturbate? Does erection during masturbation last longer? Are you having any medical disease or are you on any medications? Any history of recent weight gain? What is the frequency of intercourse (in a week)? You can send me answers to the above questions.

Fibula is lower leg bone for that usually they will give anesthesia called spinal anesthesia in which injection is given to your spine at your lower back, that is simple, and pain free surgery can be done and only your two legs will have anesthesia another full body will have senses you can see, feel, talk and everything will be normal after four to five hours your legs will lose anesthesia, and you can start feeling them. If you are terrified and having the anxiety of operation, you can ask for spinal anesthesia and sedation so that you can happily sleep. General anesthesia for this surgery is not a good option because they will anesthetize full body and you will be connected to an artificial ventilator, and it will support your breathing. My choice is to go for spinal or block."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 21 years old. How to control masturbation because I am daily doing it alone, and how to manage my health?","Doctor":"Hello. Masturbation is a natural process which occurs in hands in spite of the vagina. But having sex and inserting penis in vagina is also associated with increased arousal and sexual feelings and a sense of love and affection, whereas masturbation is opposite, masturbation is a self-pleasure technique in which you try to achieve the same sense of sexual pleasure being alone. Remember, all the same hormones are never involved as it does give pleasure, but it is not the same. Along with that, please remember doing anything in excess can harm you. Drinking water is good, but drinking a lot of water without having a measure is harmful. So if you want to masturbate you can do it, go ahead but remember one thing, do not masturbate more than two times in a day to lead a healthy life. I would suggest you masturbate on weekends or regularly like two to three times a week is also a perfect approach. Harmful effects of masturbation are less, and a result very chronicity, for example, masturbation can lead to an increase in weight. You will gain weight more than you have expected. Secondly, you will have less testosterone in your body because you will be draining out all the testosterone due to masturbation so this will lead to loss of libido which means you will have less sexual Desire and decreased sexual arousal with time. I hope that I answered your question if you have any more query regarding this feel free to take the follow-up and consult me."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am a 42-year-old male.

I have attached the previous reports summary. Following medications are taken daily. 1. Tadalafil 1---0--0 2. Dytor 10 mg 1--0---0 3. Dytor plus 20 mg 0---1--0 4. Acetrom 2 mg and 3 mg on alternate days 1--0--0 5. Lanoxin 0.25mg 1/2--0---0 6. Becadexamin and Shelcal syrup once daily. 7. Sea cod liver capsule alternate days. He has severe pain in the feet while walking for some time. He skips taking Dytor and Dytor plus due to frequent urination. What is causing giant platelets in his blood and feet pain? When the leg feels cold, he starts getting pain. His leg has discolored to dark brown and swollen near joints of the feet due to varicose vein problem.Previously he used to snore a lot, and nowadays snoring had been reduced. Latest PT INR report states 18.3 seconds, can you suggest any medication for lowering pain in feet and to reduce swollen feet. Is there any medicine which can reduce blood clots in his blood more efficiently. Can pulmonary hypertension and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulants be stopped altogether? Is there any specific blood test to identify the cause of giant platelets?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to the icliniq.com. Sorry for your father suffering from atrial fibrillation and pulmonary hypertension. I have read your concern and below is the answer to your question. The leg swelling could be due to irregular use of a diuretic pill that is Dytor. So I suggest not to stop this water pill on your own and take it regularly. It will help in reducing leg swelling. The leg pain and aggravating factor for leg swelling is varicose vein. For varicose vein, sclerotherapy, or laser therapy like good options available. The medication will not help in treating the varicose vein. The prothrombin time elevation is due to oral anticoagulation intake. I suggest using Rivaroxaban or Apixaban or Dabigatran like an oral anticoagulant drug that does not need prothrombin time monitoring and less chance of bleeding. So in place of Acitrom (Acenocoumarol), this medication will be better to use. The giant platelet is seen due to platelet destruction. However, all other CBC (complete blood count) parameter is within range.So monitoring of platelet count should be done a few days interval. No specialized testing is needed for giant platelet just now. Some form of infection might be responsible for low platelet count. Platelet function analysis can be done additionally for further workup. For pulmonary hypertension, you can continue with Tadalafil. For atrial fibrillation Metoprolol like cardioselective medication useful in place of Digoxin. You need to follow cardiologist advise for your case and do not stop prescribed medication without doctor advise. You need to continue mentioned medication in my answer. I suggest you consult cardiologist or hematologist nearby for detailed evaluation and discuss all these for your father. I hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 29-year-old male. I have a dark brown complexion.

It is not necessary that every individual responds to glutathione injections. Effects vary from one individual to the other. If there is no response even after 10 doses, then you should stop treatment. It would not be of any use. Glutathione is not permanent lightening agent. An alternative procedure like peels can be considered for face and if necessary for arms. Or Q switched Nd YAG laser for the face it reduced pigmentation.

My question is, does someone's total protein count change significantly based on how much protein rich food they eat? Or does someone's total protein count not change unless they have an illness like muscle damage? When I say total protein count I am referring to what is calculated in a biuret test.","Doctor":"Hi. The protein is digested in our human body but is sometimes excreted when not digested properly or in excess quantity. The term which you are referring to, which is total protein count in blood, urine and saliva has totally different meaning in all the three mediums. Total protein count in blood changes with increased protein ingestion and already present muscle protein or any other protein breakdown inside the body whereas protein in urine or any excretory product is always when the degradation of protein has increased, which can be possible because of higher intake of protein or increased muscle breakdown due to some pathology inside the body.

I did this some month ago also. And since then, my cycle has not been normal, and I am usually very regular. After this, I got on the period before a month and that lastet for two weeks. And since that nothing. I went to a gynecologist, and she said my endometrium was 14 mm, one cyst was cracked some days ago, and my period was just around the corner. That was one week ago. Is it possible that the endometrium has been this way for a long time, and my period is not around the corner?","Doctor":"Hello. As rightly stated by your doctor, looking at your Endometrial lining (14 mm) you should have got your periods by now. But it seems that you are having some hormonal imbalance (mostly less progesterone) which has led to a thickened endometrium but no periods as yet. By taking progesterone, you will get withdrawal bleeding (periods).

Tender breasts are very common during pre-menstrual phases due to hormonal causes, so do not worry for this. The hard lump over collar bone, which is non-tender and pea sized needs to be ruled out that whether it is lipoma or an increase in supraclavicular lymphnode, which is 90 % enlarged in upper respiratory causes. Lipoma is generally not movable, soft in consistency and is very common.

I am just worried about my numbness in the left foot and left arm and the arm and foot sometimes start paining though it is bearable I am worried about it. Kindly suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your question carefully and I understand your concern. Before we say it is stress related (because it might be), initially we have to rule out other causes. I think that a face to face neurological assessment is warranted. A complete neurological exam will show what kind of numbness do you have. Is it also associated with weaknesses or not. Are there spastic or flaccid signs. Are there any other signs that could be elicited during the exam and not felt by you. Depending on the objective signs, your neurologist might order additional examination (MRI, nerve conduction studies, laboratory studies, etc). Regarding the fact that your mother is diagnosed with ALS, I do not think you should be worried. First, ALS are sporadic in 90 to 95 % of cases, which means not inhereted. Also, you have one-sided signs, that also speak against ALS. I hope my answer is helpful.

My endocrinologist is asking me to undergo a bariatric surgery. Kindly advise. Can you explain if it is required and how is it going to help control my diabetes and hypertension?","Doctor":"Hi. Bariatric or metabolic surgeries help to achieve long term remission from type 2 diabetes. These are scientifically proven, very safe and highly effective. They result in long term weight loss in individuals suffering from an excess weight problem, and also lead to long term remission from co-morbid medical conditions such as high BP and sleep apnea. Bariatric or metabolic surgeries alter hormones which control body fat stores and reset set value for fat storage to a lower level. Same hormonal changes are responsible for remission from problems like diabetes. Depending upon your weight, presence or absence of other medical problems, I choose different surgeries.  Sleeve with bypass combination surgeries is more powerful and durable."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Kindly read and explain my MRI report.

She is unlikely to be pregnant as she was in her safe period, day 7 of her cycle when ovulation has still not occurred, so no chances of pregnancy even if there would have been an ejaculation. You may conclusively rule out pregnancy as on date with a serum beta hCG test.

How long should I expect it to be before my symptoms are gone? If the infection is in the prostate, will it take longer to go away?","Doctor":"Hi. Urine incontinence occurs due to uninhibited contractions of urinary bladder and has nothing to do with vasectomy. These uninhibited contractions can occur due to urinary tract infections or neurological causes. In your case, no obvious infection is detected in urine. Staphylococcus aureus is a bacteria seen in skin and presence of this in urine or semen means contamination of sample with skin while giving sample for culture.

It was not sedated but they gave me the local anesthetic spray but after I had my endoscopy I feel like my heart is beating faster than normal and I feel like my nerves or you can say muscle are like twitching or throbbing and I went to some doctor and said I do not have toxicity but I got so curious if I actually have toxicity. So is it?","Doctor":"Hi. Local anesthesia toxicity can happen if the spray is used at high concentrations. Usually, they will have 10 percent Lignocaine spray. They can spray maximum 300 mg of drug but for your procedure, definetly they will use less, do not worry. The other symptoms you had are because of your anxiety, stress because you are not sedated and you are just given local anesthesia, that is why and if toxicity happens, first you will have fits (seizures, numbness over the lips and around mouth)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 21 years old. My problem is related to mental issues in which at the moment when I feel more stress, I will fall accidentally at that place. I take medication from a psychiatrist.

I understand that you are facing some distress in your life due to some factors. I am afraid you have not mentioned any stressor specifically. That would be more helpful in advising adequate management strategies. However, in general, stress damages, both physical and mental health. Therefore reducing stress remedies is suggested at both levels, including behavioral changes. At first, you must need to get proper assessment identifying cause of stress, whether its work-related or some personal issue. It can be done by analyzing thought processes when you have any symptom. Other strategies may help, 1. Deep breathing exercises 2. Walk for at least 30 minutes per day. 3. Workout if possible to release toxins out of your body. 4. Reduce smoking (if you do). 5. Avoid junk and spicy food, soft drinks. 6. Increase water intake. 7. Thought diary or journaling would be also helpful for analyzing and restructuring of thoughts (underlying cause) of the problem. You can also have an appointment with the counselor to help you in assessing and provide you with individualized therapy as per requirement."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have a stiff neck, and some movements cause my neck to spasm and feel like something is being pinched.

The sockets look like they still have the clot but it is white, not red.","Doctor":"Hi. Since you do not have pain or fever or any other major symptoms, there is nothing much to freak about. Coming on to the bad taste and bad odor, it could be due to any deposits in the socket or anywhere else in the mouth. Even a dry mouth can cause it. But if you feel it is really extreme, you can visit your dentist who will irrigate the socket and also find out the reason after a clinical examination. If it is a dry socket, by any chance, a sedative dressing will be given. Usually, dry socket gives these symptoms but along with severe pain by second to the third day of tooth removal. Ultimately, it is not an emergency. You can continue lukewarm salt water gargling and limit the usage of mouthwashes. If pain or this bad taste and odor continues, visit your nearby dentist.

There are companies that decide to show in big bold letters that their ACD-A is not for direct intravenous infusion, while others do not list this in their descriptions. Other companies state that their product is for research purposes only. These are a kind of strange to me as the FDA considers ACD-A to be a safe chemical for even doctors to use. Another strange thing is how some companies state that their product should be stored between 2 to 8 °C while another company states between 15 °C (59 °F) and 30 °C (86 °F).

I understand that it can be very troublesome and scary to have complete numbness in a specific area of the body. From what you have mentioned, it sounds like you do not remember any incident that brought this on. I assume this is something you noticed one day after waking up from sleep, is that right? It may be helpful to know if the numbness is on the outer side or inner side of the foot. Is there any area on the side of the ankle or the leg, between knee and ankle that is similarly numb? The sensations from the outer side of the foot are carried to the brain by nerves that go up to the S1 (sacral) level of the spine, while those from the inner side of foot go to the L5 and L4 levels lumbar. These nerves can be affected by multiple issues ranging from trauma to any location along its track, pressure from certain structures such as disc etc., and general illnesses like diabetes. It is difficult to pinpoint which part of the track of the nerve is affected. I would suggest you to consult a neurologist for a complete physical examination and get the appropriate tests that may be necessary. The treatment would depend upon the cause of the nerve damage."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have swallowed my dental cap while eating. What do I do now? I am very scared.","Doctor":"Hello.

So, when will bleeding start? And is it risky that I cannot handle it by myself at home?","Doctor":"Hello. How are you doing? The first pill dislodges the embryo from the uterine lining and you may have some vomiting tendency, but no bleeding. Then the second pills make the uterus to contract and open the cervical canal and the dislodged embryo falls out. The ideal way of taking the pill is to have the first pill and then have the second group of pills after 48 hours of the first pills. Thereby, you give enough time for the embryo to separate from the uterus. The bleeding usually starts within a day or two of the second pill. It is the second pill, which is making the uterus to contract and the cervical canal to open, that is causing the cramps. You can have any of the painkillers like tablet Meftal spas or Cyclopam or Spasmo Proxyvon two to three times a day. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. The bleeding depends on the duration of pregnancy. If early, like less than six to seven weeks, the bleeding will be like periods. If later than that, it will have few clots and the bleeding will be more than normal but can be handled at home.

There is an increase in neutrophils and relative fall in lymphocytes. Also, there is mild fall in platelet count and hemoglobin.

I will request you to kindly send a better set of pictures limited only to the lesion, as well as describe how the lesion feels to touch whether soft or hard. Also give me additional details like release of any cheesy material upon pressure from the sides, any oozing of pus, firmness at its base, any satellite lesions, any relationship with similar condition in your partner, and finally if you notice that there is any small depression in the center of roof of lesion. I am considering the possibilities of a wart, molluscum, benign skin lesions or sebaceous cyst. Most of the stated problems should be easy to tackle. I will await your response.

Fraxinus excel is the common ash plant. It belongs to the olive family. Plants in same family have shared antigens. If you are sensitive to one plant in the family, you are likely to be sensitive to others also. Hence, the result means that you are sensitive to olive as well in addition to fraxinus excel plant. Being sensitive does not mean you are allergic. Sensitivity does not always result in allergy. Sensitivity means you have circulating antibodies against that particular allergen. However, it may or may not result in allergy to that particular antigen. Only when you are exposed to it in a particular format and quantity, you will develop allergy to it. Skin prick test only measures sensitivity to specific allergens. We need to infer the results based on your symptoms. What do you suffer from? Was the test done to check for aeroallergens or food allergens? The two are different with different symptoms. Kindly elaborate your problems to us."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I had an injury on my knee had lateral damage that was fixed by knee scope. This was successful, however, about two months ago, I twisted the wrong way and my knee got caught in hyperextension.

But my knee is still caught in hyperextension and cannot fix it. I am only 32 years old so I need my mobility but now I am in pain and can barely move any thoughts? Right now I am on Naproxen, and Tylenol.","Doctor":"Hello. From what I can read and understand by the brief history you have given is that there can be damage to ligaments and meniscus in your knee. Can you please elaborate on the range of motion of your knee? If it is barely movable it means that probably some tissue (either meniscus or soft tissue) is stuck causing block to the range of motion. Also are you having hyperlaxity? Generally people who have hypermobile joints tend to go for hyperextension. Also, kindly update the details of your surgery. Was there ACL reconstruction as well? As you pointed high rising patella, patella alta is more responsible for patellar dislocation/subluxation rather than knee hyperextension.

I am currently on Candid-B.","Doctor":"Hello. Burning sensation in the tip of the penis can be due to balanitis, and it causes irritation and itching. If there is any growth, it can be due to PPP (pearly penile papules). Also, check for diabetes, and for investigation, you need to do random blood sugar, and a swab of the penis.

Not a blocked artery as that would cause a lot of severe symptoms. A few details would help to identify the cause like, does it become prominent after vigorous sexual activity, or does it remain prominent throughout the day. Are there other symptoms of erectile dysfunction or discomfort during sexual activities? Also is the area hot and tender to the touch?

It might be possible that your friend is suffering much and could not share online things as before and needs physical and emotional support from you.

Many people who eat too much but still will not gain weight because they have a high basal metabolic rate, which we call it as BMR in medical terminology. Some people eat very little but are fat or obese. The BMR of an individual depends on his or her genetic makeup. You can try having a high protein diet or protein supplements.

In the first time, sexual intercourse intact hymen may break and that causes the bleeding suddenly or afterward it. So it is normal. First sexual intercourse. Take rest nothing else.

What was a response after chemotherapy? 4. Any cytogenetic studies? Neuroblastoma especially if the not high risk is highly curable. As per information available, he will be under the intermediate-risk group. Average five-year survival chance is 90 % in these cases. Usually, we keep patients on the follow-up to see for recurrence. There are no specific treatments to prevent recurrence in a low or intermediate-risk group as recurrences are rare. Transplant and new antibodies like anti GD2 are used in high-risk groups to prevent a recurrence.

Your sperm count is normal it should be more than 15 million, you have an infection, so do blood sugar PP and semen culture and sensitivity test. What is motility percentage? Meanwhile keep away from heat, chemical, smoking zones. Avoid laptop on lap. Wear loose undergarments and keep your testes cooled by pressing them with a wet towel for 5 to 10 minutes daily. Eat green vegetables and tomatoes.  Take Multivitamin, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Folic acid tablets daily for three months.

In comparison to previous scans, there is a new focus of increased signal change in the right temporal lobe medially adjacent to the third horn 2. Inflammatory changes noted in the ethmoid and maxillary sinuses with a large polyp or retention cysts in the maxillary sinuses. Do any of these require further investigation and can any of these be a reason for hearing loss?","Doctor":"Hello.  I have read your question carefully, and I will try to answer in detail. I understand your concern. I would like to have additional information please, 1. Since when you have the diagnosis of MS and for how long are you on Tysabri (Natalizumab)? 2. When was your hearing damaged and did you have the MRI for this symptom or any other new symptoms or was it a routine imaging check-up for MS? Actually, the MRI report did not show up a number of new things. Except the tiny new plaque which we expect from time to time in MS (the definition of MS is distributed in time and space). Also, none of the plaques are active. Regarding the inflammatory changes and retention cyst in maxillary sinuses, you shouldn't worry. Most of them are asymptomatic and incidental findings during head imaging (radiography, CT, MRI) and are not related to MS. However if you have symptoms like headache, frequent infections of sinuses, facial pain, etc., then you could consult a maxillofacial surgeon, to evaluate you for possible surgical treatment.  I would recommend doing regular follow-ups with your treating physician, and I would not recommend an additional investigation. However, a consult with an ENT doctor is advisable for the differential diagnosis of hearing loss, since the hearing loss is an uncommon symptom in MS. I hope my answer was helpful. Feel free to contact me again with additional information, and if you have further questions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Last night I ate a cheese pizza and a chocolate bar. Eight hours later (after fasting) I tested my blood sugar and it came out at 128, and 30 minutes later it dropped to 106, and 15 minutes later it raised to 109 (without eating and drinking anything). My question is, do I have diabetes or did I initially have high sugar because I ate pizza very late at night?","Doctor":"Hello. Usually fasting blood glucose is 126 mg and above is considered as diagnostic for diabetes. However, it is also possible that because of the dinner, fasting glucose might have shown a higher level. So to confirm whether there is diabetes or not, you may have to get a PP (postprandial) glucose level and HbA1c %. If PP is 200 mg and above and HbA1c % 6.5 % and above, then diabetes is considered to confirm. Looking at your weight and height, another important fact is with a BMI of 42.92 kgs/Sq meter you are already in grade 3 obesity. With a significant amount of excess weight. This itself is an invitation for getting diabetes."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 36 years married since a year back, I had a history of six times laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy and my doctor did ovarian drilling twice, and I found AMH low and my period was normal every 30 days with the average amount, I used the ovulation kit for three months and there was no positive result (anovulatory). I want to get pregnant as soon as possible. Please advice for me.","Doctor":"Hello. If you had checked with ovulation kit in the cycle while taking OCP (oral contraceptive pills), they bound to be negative. If the period is regular every 30 days (as you mentioned) and still kit showed no ovulation, it might have given a false negative result which is familiar with ovulation kits, especially if monitoring is not done as advised on it). It is very rare for all cycles despite being regular to be anovulatory (it is ok if an irregular period is anovulatory). Still, considering your age, multiple surgeries, and low AMH, you can go for ovulation induction (initially at least with clomiphene citrate). You need to consult a doctor for a prescription and further ovulation monitoring. Controlled ovarian stimulation with injection FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and IUI (intrauterine device) will give a better chance of pregnancy than ovulation induction alone."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

I have undergone valve replacement therapy a few years ago, and tablet Acitrom 2 OD going on. My recent PT value - 17.40, INR - 1.52. As we do not have access to our doctor, what step we have to take ahead to manage the problem?","Doctor":"Hello. Sorry to hear about your experience. Did you have a history of nose bleed long before the surgery? Or did the bleeding start after you started taking Ecosprin? Have you noticed bruising in any part of your body alongside the nasal bleed? Conditions like nasal polyps, hemophilia, Ecosprin medication she is currently using can cause it. If it started after the commencement of the Escoprin, I advise you to call the doctor that prescribed the Escoprin. There is a need to adjust its dosage or replace it. In the meantime try to apply an ice pack on your nose with your face in an upward direction and buy nasal spray Oxymetazoline it will help with your situation. If your symptoms persist, please go to the emergency so as to physically examine your nose."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, About six hours ago, I started seeing a transparent floater which I had not seen before, and then three hours later, I started seeing light flashes at the edge of my visual field in my left eye. Can I wait for three more days to see my doctor?","Doctor":"Hello. If you have access to an ophthalmologist on this weekend, then get a thorough retinal evaluation with indentation done. The symptoms you are describing are consistent with posterior vitreous detachment, a process which by itself does not cause a decrease in vision. However, it can pull onto retina hence causing a retinal tear in the process. If that is present, it needs to be lasered within a day or two. If you do not have high myopia or have a family history of retinal detachment, then you are low-risk patient and can wait another two days if it is imperative. Physiological. Peripheral retinal evaluation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 65-year-old with a very enlarged prostate (approx 100 ccs). I had periodic hematuria. PSA has vacillated between 2.7 and 5. Blind biopsy negative. I had two prostate MRI six months apart, one designated pirad 1 and the second pirad 2. I am on flow max and Finasteride. Based on MRI and favorable PSA density, my urologist thinks the likelihood of me having significant prostate cancer is low. How likely is it that the MRI could have missed significant cancer?","Doctor":"Hello. With your description, it is obvious that you have a large prostate with lower urinary tract symptoms, which you are on treatment with Finasteride for more than six months. With this scenario, PSA (prostate-specific antigen) should be read as twice the value that is reported as Finasteride more than six months masks PSA by half. In that sense, you have a quite significant rise in PSA. However, two biopsies were negative, with no significant pirad (prostate imaging reporting and data system) value, favorable PSA density proves that there is hardly any chance of you being harboring a significant prostate Ca. However, you need to undergo regular screening for the same because of PSA. PSA alone is not taken as a good predictor of cancer, as it is secreted by tissues other than prostate. In your case, a comprehensive evaluation is clearly in favor of benign disease. Please get back to me in case you have any more queries."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I decided to look at my tongue a couple of days ago, and it seems to be pale or raised on the sides. I am not sure if this is normal or if it is something to be concerned about. I accidentally bite my cheeks and tongue while I am trying to sleep (I sleep on my sides with my arm pressing against my cheek, which presses it in between my teeth. My tongue has felt a bit swollen lately, so I notice my teeth are coming down onto the sides and resting like that for a while before I see. I also started using a new electric toothbrush. Before that, I did not take care of my teeth well by any means. I would not brush for weeks at a time, and then brush once, and repeat. This is a powerful toothbrush I have been using. I am noticing now that there is some pale tissue right around my teeth and then regular, pink gum right below that. I am not sure if that could be pus or if it is from decay. My gum line has receded in that area, and there is decay on those teeth (whitish spots and some yellow). I have a horrible phobia of disease, and I have been finding information on terrible illnesses. Do these things sound like oral cancer or something worse? Or changes from finally taking care of my teeth (it has been about two weeks since starting this toothbrush regimen, twice a day). My mouth also feels dry and feels slightly burn-y in one area (inner cheek), but I even had been brushing that area with the electric toothbrush. It did not burn before that. I also have several nutritional deficiencies, and I have not been able to eat much lately from anxiety (my mom has breast cancer, and I have school anxiety). Could this be HPV or another disease? Or am I just worrying excessively (I have horrible anxiety, but I am also trying to get realistic advice)? Is this just from biting down on my tongue and cheek during sleep and or not taking care of my teeth or from the new toothpaste or toothbrush use?","Doctor":"Hello.  I am wondering where to start at first. So let us talk about your oral hygiene. Maintain oral hygiene properly, and I think you are using a hard bristles toothbrush. An electric toothbrush is not well to develop oral hygiene properly.  1. Do not get anxiety that much. If you feel anxious, then smell something good and relaxing like a perfumeor flower that will help you to get rid of it.  2. Do not get depressed as I read in your description. Meet people and enjoy yourself out in the environment.  3. The sleeping position is needed to be changed. Just sleep in a straight posture without a pillow.  4. For dryness, drink lots of water every day that will cure dryness and also help you to maintain oral hygiene. Drink water, especially before bed to avoid dehydration.  5. For receding gums, I suggest you visit a dentist and consult them to treat them. It is a general condition of gums that happens when we do not maintain oral hygiene. There is no chance of cancer until and unless you are a heavy smoker and drinker and have other bad habits.  6. You are not suffering from anything like HPV. You are fit; need some more oral care and other attention.  7. To correct your teeth, ask the dentist to fix them, and if there is need of replacement, then it is better you replace some teeth if suggested.  8. Do not overthink. It is just a normal condition that happens when we don't maintain oral hygiene. And the tongue and cheek bites will be Cured with drinking Water, eating spicy food and drinks. Eat and drink cold will help you a lot.   9. The teeth are not coming down; it just feels when we wake up. I hope you get almost all your answers.od, avoid extreme hot food and drinks. Eat and drink cold will help you a lot."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I feel my ears plugged from last week, and nothing I am doing is helping.

The symptoms of aural fullness or plugging of ears can occur due to acute otitis media most crucial cause for which is eustachian tube edema secondary to allergic or acute rhinosinusitis. Did you have symptoms of nasal stuffiness, sneezing? Do you have any earache and decreasing hearing? How long have you been taking medicines? What kind of headache do you have?

Then there are lots of options to treat vitiligo with a varying prognosis like, 1. Oral medication. 2. Phototherapy. 3. Surgery. 4. Tattooing. Each procedure has its pro and cons. You have to discuss in details in person with your doctor. With only oral medication, it will not work, need to club another form of treatment in it."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Please see below a report of my interactions with eye doctors in the last 21 months. This piece also includes further information under preambles, and questions, under the problem. Before two years, my optometrist advised that I see an ophthalmologist after examining the back of my eyes. He said my eye pressure was high, and I think 14 or 15. I also told him I had been seeing tiny flashes on waking up since about one month or two. The ophthalmologist, after examining me said my eye pressure was okay, I think it was 12, and he was comfortable with the back of my eyes. He asked me to do a CVF (copy attached). He said the CVF report is ok, the few black spots are nothing to worry about, they may also be false. He put me on Ivyxolotl (Betaxolol hydrochloride) and asked me to come back in six months. Last year I told the ophthalmologist that the flashes had stopped. My eyes were examined, I was asked to call in in 6 months again, and to continue using Ivyxolotl. He said I am a glaucoma suspect. The CVF was repeated. (The copy is attached). Before three months in the same hospital, a different doctor said I have glaucoma as the back of my eyes is cupped. Asked me to repeat CVF, and should continue using Ivyxollol. My eye pressure was 10.Before two months, I did the CVF test but now started to consider getting another hospitals opinion, since it appears this hospital is giving me contradictory opinions. 1st doc says I am not a glaucoma patient but gives me glaucoma meds, 2nd doc says I am a glaucoma patient. (Same hospital). Before two months I sought the opinion of another ophthalmologist in another hospital; After back- of- eyes examination and OCT, he told me, you do not have glaucoma and stop using Ivyxolotl in the meantime. Last month I woke up with a feeling that there is a shaded area in my vision. Second hospital doctor checked for retinal detachment, was convinced that was not happening, asked me to come back in three months. It is reiterated that I do not have glaucoma. Still the opinion that there is a shaded part of my vision, I saw the first doctor, who also reiterated that I am a glaucoma suspect, not a patient. He advised me to continue using Ivyxollol. Eye pressure was 12. Could not communicate to him that I would have stopped using Ivyxolotl, about two months earlier, before the session ended. A grandfather and his brother lost their visions in their old age, and two uncles have also been having problems with their visions. They are in their late 70s. A tennis ball hit me very hard on one eye about 20 years ago. I saw an ophthalmologist then and never had any problem with it since. The problem now is, 1.\\tNot knowing what to do with Ivyxollol since I now have two differing advice from two ophthalmologists. 2.\\tWanting to be sure that what I feel I see from the corners of my eyes when I roll my eyes one way, and the other is normal. Is there a site, or a write-up that can take one through a total spectrum of what is normal for a perfect eye to see? 3.\\tWanting to know if there are other tests I should be doing now since the general advice about eye health and vision is that most problems can be prevented if detected earlier. 4.\\tWanting to know for sure the lifestyle steps or changes I might need to take now to enhance my eye-health at this point. What are your recommendations?","Doctor":"Hello. Unfortunately, I was not able to see any attachments, but I understand your frustration about your diagnosis and recommendations. To start with, all the eye pressure measurements were within normal values but that might be insignificant in case they suspect normal tension glaucoma. The main problem is that suspecting glaucoma in a patient is the best way to treat it if detected before it does irreversible damage to the optic nerve. However and to suspect it, the patient must undergo a set of diagnostic tests, visual field tests, gonioscopy, and the primary test is optical coherence tomography along with measurements of the eye pressure twice a day within three days. The only way I could assist you with proper advice would be to see those tests. As for Betaxolol, I would have monitored you and your eye pressure before prescribing it. The only way to know whether it was effective is to do an OCT while using them now, stop them for three months and do another OCT for comparison."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 58-year-old male.

Is high eosinophils a start of cancer? Please advice, I am quite worried.","Doctor":"Hello.

As you said you have itching on scrotum, fungal mainly involves groin area and typically ring like rashes are present. Itching in scrotum could be something else too. Two common diseases are scrotal dermatitis and scabies. If you have only itching in scrotum with no other skin changes, then it cannot be fungal and you are taking wrong treatment.

A steroid is a medicine used for many dermatological conditions, available in various concentrations and potency. When potent steroids are used on face, it makes the skin thin (atrophy), making it more sensitive. It also makes the tiny blood vessels within the skin more visible which are usually not visible (telangiectasia). When such skin is exposed to sunlight, skin becomes red with burning sensation. In few cases, there can be red bumps and pustules. This is called steroid induced rosacea. Rosacea as such is an inflammatory condition of facial skin with genetic influence, aggravated by the overactive demodex folliculorum mite, which are otherwise silent in normal skin. Rosacea becomes worse on exposure to sunlight. The skin becomes red and hot on eating spicy foods, upon going near a hot flame, during anger and grief.

After reading your symptoms and looking at your photo (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it is suggesting of chronic pharyngitis with chronic tonsillitis. The whitish spots over your tonsils are the food particles that clogged within the tonsillar crypts. These can be easily removed by applying pressure with your finger against the tonsils.

I just turned 20 and as I grow older my body will continue to produce testosterone which will change my body into something more manly and cause me to lose my youthful relatively more feminine appearance. I would like to prevent that by taking testosterone blockers. Can I do this? Additionally, if I take the testosterone blockers, will there be any permanent effects?

But what is important here is do you wish to retain your feminine look for entire life or only for few years? Do you want to have sexual orientation as a male or as a female? The available options are as surgical castration, medical castration and testosterone blockers. In surgical castration only testes will be removed and not the entire genitals and no operation in medical castration but testes will stop producing testosterone. Testosterone blockers will reduce the action of testosterone on the body as long as you take them but once you stop them the testosterone starts showing its effects. Moreover you need to keep taking the blockers for as long as you need the effect and hence if you take it for longer duration the chances to have permanent side effects increases."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Is it safe to take Chymoral Forte once daily for three days in pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hi.

If you have diabetes mellitus, both diagnosed or undiagnosed, it could cause a fungal infection of the foreskin leafing to cracking. If you are not a known case of diabetes, you must get your blood glucose level checked and keep it under strict control. You may use topical antifungal like Miconazole to treat it. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines. Also, you need to keep the area clean and dry. Use lukewarm water to clean and avoid friction until it heals. This should work.

You are most likely dealing with a sebaceous cyst. They are similar to pimple. A sebaceous gland is a microscopic gland in the skin which secretes a waxy liquid known as sebum. It opens on the skin via an opening known as a punctum. When the opening gets blocked, the sebum collected in the gland causes a swelling known as a cyst. It hardens over time to become firm. They are quite common in the genital region. The diagnostic sign of sebaceous cyst is that it slips beneath the fingers and it mostly has an opening. In your case, they cause pain because the skin there gets stretched during an erection. If it causes pain all the time, it could be infected and might need local application of an antibiotic ointment like T-Bact (Mupirocin) or Neosporin (combination of Neomycin, Polymyxin B and Bacitracin) twice a day. You also need to keep the area clean and dry. They are benign and harmless and nothing to worry about. It could have been easier to confirm if you had sent a picture along. You could do an image search for sebaceous cyst and confirm yourself.

Recently, I have undergone emotional stress and strain which has brought on symptoms similar to ones I have had under similar circumstances in the past. This time, however, it is a lot worse. In the past, I have tended to hallucinate, owing to lack of sleep and food. Usually, this would be something like moving patterns or other visuals, and nothing too scary. However, then, as now, I become convinced of things, usually, the identities of people, walking, driving in a car next to me, and for a while, I totally believe that it is this person. Only after a short while will I snap out of it a bit. The worse my emotional and mental state, the more severe and frequent, events like this happen. Recently, I have been pushed into a suicidal mood, something that genuinely is outside of my personality. I give a class at an institution and often times I find myself stumbling over words. It is nothing new, and people tend to do these types of things. However, it is happening more frequently, and twice now, I have heard myself losing the plot of my sentence but was unable to stop. I need to know if these are just the signs of severe emotional stress or maybe something darker. Any help is appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello.

If it happens, my children will be straight or gay?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, even if you have homosexual orientation even then you will be able to make your wife pregnant. No need to worry for that provided your sperms count is normal. Homosexuality does not have direct genetic inheritance. So, no need to get worried for that too.

Symptoms: bowel bloating and pain after meals or sometimes on empty stomach middle of the night, mornings, acid reflux with everything I eat, I eat purely healthy, puree my veggies and small amounts of chicken, eggs, salmon when I can. My stools are loose in the mornings with oil-like substance floating on top of the water, yellowish or green. At times, mucus as well. Discharge looks like white cloudy pieces floating. Feeling fatigue pains, depressed, cannot go to work. Going in for a consultation and testing soon. I just wanted to know what could be going on with me.","Doctor":"Hello. You have acid peptic disease (peptic ulcer) which is usually controlled by PPI (proton pump inhibitor). You are already taking this. If you could not correct dietary practices, you may not get complete relief. You should avoid, chilly, fresh onion, and oily foods (fried items) and non- vegetarian foods. Stomach finds it difficult to digest foods. So, consume easily digestible foods like fresh fruits, fruit juices, sliced vegetables, steamed foods, etc. Avoid tea and coffee which never allow the peptic ulcer to heal. Daily morning take one cup of pumpkin juice on an empty stomach. Do not eat raw vegetables (such as cucumber cut pieces, etc) in large quantities. Eat the same in small quantity after completely chewing into a paste. While sleeping you should sleep in left lateral or supine. Never sleep in right lateral and prone position. You can practice pranayama to balance autonomic systems. You also need to come out of stress situation, because stress certainly increases acid secretion. Do not skip any meals. If required, please undergo endoscopy to see if any ulcer is present. Continue the dietary, yogic, and drug therapy for at least six months. Thank you.

It slightly niggled and chipped further during that time, reminding me that it needed to be fixed, but never actually posed a problem. I finally went to the dentist last year and an X-ray was taken. A decay was present at the roots, and I was referred to an endodontist and a root canal treatment was the suggestion. The dentist did a temporary filling, which fell out soon after. The tooth appeared settled, and I had delayed taking an appointment with the endodontist. Two months ago, I started to feel sensations of extreme nerve pain, when a pressure was put on the tooth, and it was getting worse after a few days. But, it settled again. Finally, I took an appointment with the endodontist. He took an image of the tooth and said that it could not be saved, and extraction was the only option. The tooth was alright except for the occasional jolt of pain. Last week, I was awakened many times at night with a dull toothache. It progressed to the next day. I took Neuropin and Panadol for pain relief. The pain then changed to a throb and was increasing. I had a packet of Keflex with the worry of an abscess. Four days ago, I had sudden numbness from under my left lip over my chin. I rang my endodontist on the next morning, and he organized to have the tooth removed the same afternoon. On the day after the extraction, the numbness was still there. Four days later, I am still numb. I now get tingles a few times a day. I do have the slight feeling of pressure or touch on the numb chin by running my fingers over it. I have read so many horrible things about numbness of the chin.","Doctor":"Hello. Possibly there been some compression or inflammation of the inferior alveolar nerve, which passes through the mandible and then emerges as the mental nerve. The mental nerve supplies the part below the lower lip and chin. If you have pain, severe tingling, pins and needle sensation in the supplied area, then few medications like Gabapentin can be of some help. But, it is the impaired sensation which is bothering you. I suggest you visit your dentist to check if anything further can be done.

The facet joints and uncovertebral joints appear normal. At C4-C5 there is degenerative disc disease with disc space narrowing. There is a broad-based focal disc protrusion extending from the right to the left lateral recess with associated bilateral uncovertebral joint hypertrophy right greater than left causing predominantly right-sided foraminal stenosis. At C5-C6, there is diffuse bulging of the annulus fibrosis. Also, there appears to be a superimposed focal disc protrusion within the intervertebral foramina on the right associated with right-sided uncovertebral joint hypertrophy and to a lesser extent facet arthropathy causing on axial image severe right-sided foraminal stenosis. The patient is status post cervical fusion at C6-C7. The facet joints and uncovertebral joints appear normal and there is an obliteration of the intervertebral disc space.

I have gone back to medication and I am currently on 20 mg of Paroxetine and 10 mg of Fluoxetine, but my insomnia has continued. I was prescribed Ativan (0.5 mg) for sleep, and it sometimes helps, but not always. Even if I take a bit more (I have taken up to .75 total), it does not always help me sleep. My psychiatrist prescribed Trazodone (she suggested I start at 25 mg and if I feel no effect, to take another 25 mg/ go up to 50 mg in one night (but I am concerned about serotonin syndrome from taking another medication that messes with Serotonin). Can you advise if I should be concerned about serotonin syndrome if I take the 25 (or 50) mg of Trazodone? Additionally, should I be concerned about anything else in terms of taking these three medications together?","Doctor":"Hello. Serotonin syndrome is an acute emergency case, rarely seen in common practice. At least not when you have already been taking 40 mg of Paroxetine for years. Also, Trazodone is a safer and better sleep-inducing agent when it comes to being used for sleep. As per my knowledge, in fact, these two drugs are given together in depression/ anxiety with insomnia. Yes, Fluoxetine is an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) known to cause sleep disturbances. So, be careful with it and avoid taking it in the evening or at night at all.

Yes, oral sex could transmit STD (sexually transmitted disease) and they are herpes simplex, gonorrhea or even syphilis. Infections less frequently passed on include chlamydia, HIV and hepatitis A. But, I must tell you that the risks of getting an STD from unprotected oral sex are typically much lower than the risks posed by having unprotected vaginal or anal sex.

I showered that night maybe an hour afterward and used a perfume smelling body wash or shampoo. Whether it was in my head or actual, the next day I noticed an itchiness or rather a need to readjust my penis which persisted on and off for about a week with no other symptoms, visual or pain or burning. A week after the incident, the itch progressed to something between an itch and an occasional burn on the underside of the head of my penis where the ridge of the glans meets, but in total very mild, and I did not think much of it at the time. In the weeks prior and the week subsequent I was traveling with a lot of daily exercises and occasionally limited ability to shower or use shampoo. Eight days after the night out I noticed a small patch of red bumps that looked somewhat rash like in the same small area. To be specific, they do not look like pimples nor are they very raised and do not look to contain any liquid or if they do a minuscule and clear amount. The weird thing is that when these first came about, the itching also stopped, and I have no other symptoms such as discharge, burning while urinating, or other health issues. In days 10 to 12, I have had no such symptoms as well but the ridge of my glans penis around the front side of the head now appears to have symptoms similar to what balanitis may look like from other research, with a slightly swollen and red penis head and a rashy or bumpy looking appearance to the edges of the head. The itching has stopped, and from online research I figured it may be something like jock itch, a male yeast infection or another fungal situation so I began using an antifungal cream yesterday. The original red bumps on the back of the head have faded somewhat and have not blistered or scabbed or popped or shed any skin which I have been vigilant about from reading online. I am wondering if you can shed any light on my situation as I am worried just like any person experiencing STD scares.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case in detail. Well, you need not worry about any STD or fungal infection or jock itch or even about herpes as your lesions are not active right now. There is only mild redness which could be remnant of balanitis or friction. At the moment no signs of any sexually transmitted disease. All you have to do is to maintain a good hygiene. Avoid sweating and friction as much as you can. Wash it daily. Apply antifungal cream for a week so that it smoothe out your lesion in addition to antifungal effect.

In males, recurrent urinary tract infections are uncommon and always indicate an underlying pathology or anatomical abnormality of the urinary tract. It requires complete examination of urinary tract to look for any pathology or anatomical abnormality ASAP because if these problems remain untreated can have long term and serious consequences on kidneys including kidney failure. I recommend you to visit your urologist at the earliest to identify the cause and treat it accordingly. In females, urinary tract infections are little common because of short urethra especially in married females and pregnant women. However, too frequent UTI is also not acceptable and it warrants complete examination of urinary tract to identify the pathology or anatomical abnormality and treat it accordingly. Ultrasound of KUB region will help in identifying problem and urine culture and sensitivity will guide you for the correct antibiotics.

L-lysine has no established role in helping with dizziness. Although there are some studies showing benefits to some extent, in patients with chronic anxiety, especially when taken with L-Arginine. Because there is no reported interaction between the two drugs, you are concerned about alpha-lipoic acid and L-lysine. We cannot say for sure if an interaction exists or not. It may be because no much research is conducted on these two chemicals. Lysine, however, can increase the amount of calcium absorbed in the body, so avoid taking large amounts of calcium supplementations along with lysine. Anti-diabetes drugs have strong interaction with alpha-lipoic acid, and anti-cancer drugs (chemotherapy) has mild to moderate interactions reported. I hope it helps.

I got a calf pain six months ago, though it would get normal in a few days, the pain persists, the MRI shows nothing. The doctors tell everything is fine, but the pain is too much, could not even walk for a few mins continuously. The pain is exactly on the outer part of the left calf muscle where I could feel it in a particular position like a small line. But the sickness spreads over the entire calf.","Doctor":"Hello. It would be nice if you can share the MRI reports with us so we can comment accurately. In general, without the MRI, I suspect this to be a muscle injury, which is healing slowly. As MRI too have limitations, we have to follow the clinical signs and symptoms and treat according to the clinical symptoms. This sounds to me as a muscle injury, due to which there is a muscle imbalance. I will advise undergoing muscle re-education, and muscle balance board training, which can help correct the actual action of the muscle and a proper torque can be applied with the contraction of the muscles.

It shows no new lesions or activity also the lesions I had have shrunken. Is this a good sign? I read if lesions heal, that means the MS is progressing is this right? I have had dizziness for over a year, and it is not going away. I cannot understand it as I have no active lesions, and the ones I did have are healing.","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your question carefully, and I will try to give you a detailed answer.  There are several types of multiple sclerosis, more precisely four,  1. The first type is the commonest one, relapsing-remitting, with temporary periods of exacerbation and feeling well between attacks. 2. The second type is secondary progressing, which means that after some time in the first type, the lesions could get the transition in the second type, where symptoms worsen gradually. 3. The third type is not so common, primary progressive when from the beginning, patients have slowly worsening symptoms. 4. The rarest type, progressive relapsing, with slowly worsening symptoms, accompanied by acute exacerbation, with no remission.  So, periodic clinical and imaging evaluation should classify the type. In general, conventional MRI measures do not fully correlate with clinical standards. Said, someone might have more lesions in MRI and feel better than someone who has fewer lesions. In current medical practice, MRI features that correlate more to progression are, accelerated brain volume loss (atrophy), the formation of black holes (permanent damage of axons), which indicates more degeneration. About half of them will go away, providing the sign remyelination. When they remain, it is a sign of permanent scarring. I hope I was clear in my answer. Feel free to ask further questions any time."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a problem of premature ejaculation. I have been masturbating since I was 14.

I do not think there is an FDA approved screening test for males.Last month doctor removed those lesions using laser, now my doubt is these lesions can lead to cancer? If yes, only penile cancer or this virus can transfer to throat and head and can cause head/neck cancers? Now if I have HPV vaccination, that will be helpful?

HPV spreads sexually and can spread to genitals, rectum, mouth or throat, and condom can offer protection though not complete.The HPV vaccine does offer protection, and you can go for it. There are no provided supplements that can enhance immunity. Your HIV antigen as well antibody titers are within normal limits, and you need not worry about it.

As such there is no indication for surgery at this point of time until and unless your pain frequency increases a lot. If it is happening once in 2 to 3 months for a few days then it is bearable. I do not think surgery is required.  At that time you can apply Lignocaine containing jelly for a few days and it will soothen your pain.

I advice you to take plenty of water to flush off absorbed drug from the body. It is better to get liver function tests done to assess the extent of damage to liver, though risk is minimal in your case. Aspirin and Paracetamol are acidic drugs which can cause gastric erosions, symptoms which you are experiencing. I suggest you to take tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily for 15 days and then once daily for another 15 days. Also, use Mucain gel orally 15 ml thrice daily for 10 days. If experiencing severe symptoms, visit your doctor without delay."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Can you interpret this for me?

There are some lymph node-like structures in the chest area which take up radiotracer, and it will help to study the complete series of images of your scan. A diagnosis of cancer always requires a biopsy. No treatment of cancer is justified without biopsy confirmation. Many conditions, including disease and infections and inflammations will take up the radiotracer as visualized in your scan. Even in cancer, the lymph node decrease in number and size is not predictable. If your recent CT scan shows persisting lymph nodes, then another biopsy might help. Please get a second reading of the biopsy slide done if needed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, There is a gross dilatation of pelvicalyceal system of right kidney with abrupt narrowing at the pelvi-ureteric junction and ballooning of pelvis.

It all started in the last summer. I started to experience constant vomiting after eating, bloating and weight loss. Then, I was diagnosed with a Dientamoeba fragilis infection and given a course of antibiotics. I thought I would get better after this, but that was not the case. I was treated for the bacteria and I still have symptoms like occasional vomiting, a lot of weight loss (15-20 pounds), bloating and abdominal swelling. The doctor did a bunch of blood tests and said he did not see anything wrong. The vomiting stopped, but I still experience the symptoms and not gaining any weight. So, my doctor referred me to a gastroenterologist. I told him about my symptoms, which are as follows. GERD, weight loss, occasional abdominal pain, abdominal swelling and bloating, malnutrition, alternating diarrhea and constipation, and heart issues like racing heart and heart palpitations. My sister has celiac disease. My gastroenterologist has done an endoscopy and said he does not think that I have celiac and he said Helicobacter pylori might be a possibility. I am really worried because I have got a lot of blood tests and everything came out fine, except Vitamin B12 and D deficiency. So, I just want to know if you think that I could have Helicobacter pylori. I am really anxious.

Since then, I have had pelvic pressure, ache, nausea, dizziness, headache consistently. I do have one child.

But this scenario of menses being delayed and often taking 3-5 months post depot Provera stoppage is a common side effect of prolonging depot usage. You can opt for a withdrawal bleed during this cycle with oral progesterone for five days from day 25 to 30 of this cycle and check your bleed, and it should re-establish itself. The heaviness and pressure symptoms are indeed due to hormonal misbalance, which has occurred due to prolong usage of the depot.

Duration of therapy can be up to six months (only if risk if thrombosis high then life long anticoagulant is given). So for this six month while on warfarin you can delay intercourse if possible. The risk of bleeding depends on the following factors that are based on clinical correlation. 1. Smoking history. 2. Abnormal liver function and renal function. 3. CBC (for detecting anemia). 4. History of bleeding and stroke. 5. Recent Myocardial infarction. 6. Old age (greater than 65 years).  INR motoring regularly needed for not crossing INR above three.

In the beginning, I did not want to see a dermatologist because I thought it is hormonal, but the acne was not stopping from popping up on my face and making my face look full of spots and acne. So I visited a dermatologist when I was 16, the doctor gave me two ointments and a tablet. The treatment continued for six to seven months, and my acne was gone and did not pop up for the next year. After this, I started having acne again just like before, so I revisited the doctor and asked him why is it so? He answered that it could happen because of some changes in diet and prescribed me the same tablet and the ointment for two more months. For the two months, I took all the medicine, and there was no acne for one month after the two-month medication. Now acne is coming back on my face. Why is this happening?","Doctor":"Hello. There are many causes of recurrent acne, the food, and dietary type is a factor as too much oil, and less fiber diet can cause acne breakouts. So if you are constipated and are already acne prone, this could have exacerbated the acne. If these are not the cause, then it is essential to check if your menstrual periods are regular as irregularity in the monthly cycle as in polycystic ovarian syndrome is accompanied by stubborn acne. If you are overweight or have facial hair, you must get checked out by an endocrinologist or a gynecologist for the polycystic ovarian syndrome. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hello my father who is 62yrs old has diabetes type 2.. Recently, he started not feeling well. He has stopped eating, basically doesn't want to eat or drink anything.

Recently I was somewhat nauseous, and today diarrhea with a lime green tint. I read about diabetic enteropathy, but this is the first time I feel like it could be diabetic-related diarrhea mostly because I had not had much to eat other than peanut butter and jelly sandwich for breakfast and a juice box for lunch. I was 79 around 11 am, and at 8 am I was 118. The last few days I have been consecutively around 150-to-mid 200's (but mostly in the 150 to 190 range). Otherwise, my numbers are generally stable overall, and I believe my last A1C was 6.8. I had two bowel movements today with diarrhea. I took my blood sugar just a few minutes ago, and it was 290, and going down (I gave myself a shot of Humalog to keep me steady for dinner). I was just a little worried because of the article I read on diabetic enteropathy. It is treatable by just keeping the blood sugar tighter, and I was a bit scared if it might be fatal. I assume it is, but I do intend to keep things better regulated after this. I need to be a bit more at ease after what I read. I did not want to contact my doctor if it is something I can fix with regulation.","Doctor":"Hello. Diabetic enteropathy is not diagnosed after a single episode of diarrhea. Usually, it is chronic and intermittent with regular bowel movements in between. Constipation can also be present. Diarrhea can occur during the night. There are other causes for acute diarrhea-most commonly infections, food poisoning, or adverse reactions to medications. I suggest you wait and see how this whole thing pans out. As long as there is no blood in the feces and no abdominal pain or fever, I would not worry about some serious underlying condition. Tighter control using insulin is possible but can be difficult due to hypoglycemic episodes. However, if you cut down on carbohydrates and reduce the dose of insulin appropriately, you can achieve lower HbA1c levels with fewer hypoglycemic episodes. I suggest you go through these articles about this. Also, if you can afford or if your insurance covers it, try getting a CGM (continuous glucose monitor). I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any other questions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I want to clarify something regarding a recent incident I had. I was smoking shisha at a shisha lounge.

So please clarify this for me.","Doctor":"Hello. There is a chance that you could acquire HSV1 (herpes simplex virus) from the waiter if he has it. HSV2 is familiar with genital herpes, not the mouth. Unfortunately, blood tests are not sensitive enough to know whether you got the virus or not. In all cases, if you start to show the symptoms which can take few days up to two weeks which are blisters around the mouth, you need to follow-up with it, and appropriate treatment will be prescribed.

Does this mean I have problems, and what does it mean?","Doctor":"Hello. Raised plasma levels of LH or Leutinizing Hormone indicates a premature ovarian failure in women less than 35 years. And in a woman above 40, it indicates perimenopausal status (if she is still menstruating) or menopausal (is she has not menstruated for a year). However, one needs to be transparent with regards to the day on which the blood sample was collected. If it was received on day 12 to 16 th day of your cycle, then this could be an ongoing LH surge before ovulation. But if it is on day 2 of your period, (the day on which test should ideally be done), then it gives a status of your ovarian functionality. Please share your reports if possible and mention the menstrual day of collection of your blood sample."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I had stomach pain after which my report was confirmed as gallbladder stones. What is the further procedure? Please let me know all the details, including the cost.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome back to icliniq.com. The mere presence of gall stones does not mean that your abdominal pain was from the gall bladder. Many people have gall bladder stones which do not give them any symptoms. When the gall bladder gets inflamed or when a gall bladder stones block the bile duct, you get symptoms like pain, fever, and jaundice. So, we need to ascertain whether the gall bladder stone was responsible for your abdominal pain or not. If it appears that the stone was the cause of your pain, then surgery can be considered. Laparoscopic surgery (keyhole operation) can be done, and many hospitals have doctors trained in this. The cost of the procedure varies from hospital to hospital. You should, however, first make sure that the abdominal pain was directly related to the gall bladder stone. Please upload the copy of the scan report, and also indicate in which part of the abdomen you had pain. The gall bladder is located under the right rib cage margin. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having pressure, pain, and tightness in the right side of my head and forehead. And I have numbness in my right leg (lower leg).

I did my annual check-up, and I found ALT and AST are 192 and 142, which are elevated. I had an ultrasound, and I found fat from marked to moderate on my liver. Lipid profile results are in the optimal level, CBC and kidney results also fine. There is no sign for hepatitis as all result for A, B, and C are negative. What will be the reason for having this elevated result for ALT and AST, and what should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. Certain prescription and over-the-counter drugs may also cause increased liver enzyme levels. In studies, we have seen that Candesartan (Atacand 8 mg) that you are taking, can cause deranged hepatic function and also inflammation of the liver (hepatitis) to some extent. That is why this drug should be taken cautiously if the patient is a regular alcohol consumer. It interacts with the alcohol and may cause significant liver issues. In the setting of having no viral hepatitis (A, B, C being negative in screening) and a raised ALT (alanine transaminase) and AST (aspartate transaminase). I would refer you to see a hepatologist in person for detailed investigations. He may go for more sophisticated studies of liver including but not limited to ultrasound of liver (elastography studies) and thorough blood work related to liver health that may screen and detect a lot of factors of liver health. Also, keep an eye on liver enzymes and go for serial follow-ups with your Liver doctor (hepatologist) in future too. This way, you may be able to keep a check on liver cancers and or and other issues related to the liver. Liver cancer has many risk factors, and one of them is liver cell damage. AST is released when liver cells (or heart cells) are damaged. So, a raised AST may be a sign of liver cell damage. Further probing is warranted here. ALT is also raised in cases of liver (and or kidney) issues. I hope it helps.

I was immediately taken off my birth control, Levlen ED which I have been on for 17 years, this is what the doctors believe is the cause, I was placed on Eliquis (Apaxaban) medication, for one week (7 days). I was taking a double dose (10 mg in the morning and 10 mg at night) and then 5 mg in the morning and 5 mg at night (to continue for three months), a blood test was conducted with normal results in blood, liver and kidney, but showing an increase in white blood cells. The doctor said should be due to having the clots. The questions I have (which I have also spoken to 2 doctors) is around travel, three weeks after diagnosis, I have travel plans, both doctors said I should be fine to travel on a plane as I am already taking the blood thinner medication, wearing compression socks (15 to 20 mmhg) as long as I ensure I am standing and walking around the plane, I would like some advice. How does high altitude affect DVT? And is it fine to do this hike or is high altitude and exercise a risk? Is my risk of PE very low? Both doctors have told me I can go on this trip, but I am wondering if I should change my plans around these remote areas. I am not sure of what percentage of my type of DVT turns into a PE. Will my 2 cm or 9 cm clot be dissolved if I started medication a month before? Is there any other precautions I should be taking?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your query thoroughly and checked your attached ultrasound as well (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Below is the answers of your questions as per my opinions. 1. You can travel by aeroplane for visiting any place. You have to take care in wearing compression socks and you have to take medication regularly. 2. It has always been controversial opinion whether high altitude carries risk for thrombosis or not. Let me tell you that in books high altitude are not written as main causative factors for thrombosis. But as per my knowledge high altitude can lead to physiological changes in blood and red blood cells count and hemoglobin can be increased, so indirectly it carries little risk of thrombosis formation. 3. So if I would be your treating doctor than I would not suggest you not to travel to high altitude because we cannot take even less than 1% risk also. So as per my opinion until three months of completion of therapy do not go to such a remote high altitude area where you cannot get medical access. 4. You are right. Clot will mostly dissolves in one month as you have been given best medication for that. But minor clot can remain and it might take more than one month to dissolve completely. Your high leukocyte count could be due to clot. So finally although risk of pulmonary embolism is very low, I would not suggest you to go at high altitude where medical facility is not available. It depends on you to take the final decision."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Or just shaking it after urination is good enough? I honestly do not wipe, and I never had a problem.","Doctor":"Hello. There will be secretions under the foreskin, which is called smegma. These get infected in men with an immune-compromised condition such as diabetes. In others, keeping the undersurface of foreskin clean once a day while having a bath is enough. It is not necessary to pull back foreskin every time you urinate. Even shaking the penis after urination does not affect smegma. In normal persons, cleaning the undersurface of foreskin once a day suffices."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have been dealing with an uneven bite since my last invisalign treatment 4 to 5 years ago. My bite feels slanted and the right side of my teeth do not touch initially when biting down. Overall, my teeth look fine other than the slant in my bite. I was wondering how long would treatment take and how much would treatment cost.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. I appreciate and thank you for nice pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Yes, the bite is (open) irregular, uneven and some of the teeth are still rotated or tilted. To conclude the result is not as expected.  Usually, if at the end of treatment, if the desired outcome is not achieved, further extension is implemented immediately (with the financial aspect as agreed upon at the time of consultation). However, if it has been pretty long you have seen your doctor (and you have accepted the result), he may charge you right from the square one. You said your right face seems swollen (picture not included), which is, in most such cases, a tender, and a full, thick muscle which gets spasmodic due to improper bite. Muscle relaxants may help for time being, but definite treatment is mandatory to address and resolve this aspect permanently."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have recently noticed that my hair crown looked a bit strange.

How can I wean off this antidepressant medicine?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, excessive sweating can be caused due to Veniz XR (Venlafaxine). Sweating is the most common side effect of Veniz XR. Daytime sleepiness itself is a separate side effect. Veniz XR causes drowsiness and excessive yawning. As you have been taking Veniz XR for the past six years, so it is more likely to result in side effects. These side effects are caused by autonomic activation. This medication can be weaned off successfully. However, it requires gradual tapering. I can assist you in weaning off this medication.

It goes from the right to the left, and it stops two millimeters before the next tooth. I was scared, so I asked many dentists before going to an actual appointment myself.They said it was fine, that it is only on the outer layer. Then, I went to an actual dentist myself, and they did an X-ray test on it. Nothing appeared, and said I would be fine, but gave me no further details.

It is one of the most common complaints in routine dental practice. The fracture (hairline crack) might be only in the superficial structure (more likely in enamel than in dentin) of the tooth and not in the pulp (since it does not hurt).

Initially, my bilirubin got high, but when I stopped drinking, it became normal after one month, but still, I feel my liver has become weak to digest things daily, especially the dairy products.","Doctor":"Hello. There are no medicines or supplements that can support the liver. The liver does not need any help if it is healthy. Just avoid things that can damage the liver-like excessive alcohol. Difficulty in digesting dairy products may be due to lactose intolerance and has nothing to do with the liver. Milk contains lactose, which is a carbohydrate. To digest carbohydrates, our intestines produce an enzyme called lactose. Some individuals produce very little, or no lactose and the lactose is not digested.Further downstream in the intestines, the lactose gets digested by the intestinal bacteria which results in the release of some gases as byproducts. This causes flatulence, bloating, and diarrhea. In such cases, avoid regular milk. You can use lactose-free milk. Some individuals can tolerate milk products like yogurt and cheese, which have low levels of lactose. Butter and ghee have zero lactose and will not give any problems. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Are Halloween colored contact lenses safe? Do people who need prescribed contact lenses be using them?","Doctor":"Hello. Ophthalmologists do not recommend colored contact lenses. However, they may be used occasionally for not more than a few hours. The reason is that compared to regular glasses, most colored lenses have a lesser tendency to allow oxygen to pass through to the corneas, thus causing damage to the corneal cells. This problem does not depend on whether the user is a prescription lens user or not. It depends on the quality of the lens and a few biological variables of the person using them.

It is difficult to make a comment over the possible petechiae (dark spots) over your vulval region. However, bleeding or spotting per vaginum post vaginal pain is likely to be your start of menses but as you had sex 12 hours back so due to rise in endorphins and progesterones post sexual activity the bleeding would have stopped. The cause of vulval spots could be frictional injury during intercourse or foreplay, now exhibiting as local small petechiae hemorrhage or hematoma.

Especially when these are closed ones like father-child, siblings, etc., they left marked emotional pain through in life if left unhealed. I am afraid you did not mention anything about my mother. Her role here is also important to understand the core problem. It seems she is also one of the victims. As per your query, it is drawn that your father has extreme anger issues and needs help, but without having insight and motivation, it seems impossible to sort out. Sometimes when children and partner communicate the effects of such behaviors to the concerned person, he or she may felt embarassed and try to resolve and change his behavior. However, in the present scenario, you are suffering a lot, and abuse has damaged your physical and psychological capacities in the form of eating disorders and aggressive, depressive thoughts. Thoughts of killing the abuser come in to avoid the pain you are currently in, but it, later on, converted into extreme guilt and shame. Following suggestions might help to minimize the damage. Consult professional counselor and have regular sessions to channel out your concerns and catharsis as you have much to say. Remember there are a lot of things in the world which you cannot control at some stage of life and then you have just to let go and keep moving on until the time comes when you can at least control the harm if not change the situation. So my advice is to complete your education, protect your siblings, and wait till the time comes where you can protect yourself. You need to find relaxing things around you so your anger issues can be healed such as physical excercice, walk, healthy diet, hanging out with friends. Do journaling as venting out your feelings, look for positive aspects of your father's behavior, every person has both elements. Hate the behvaior of the person, not the entire person.

My 3 year old son has wheezing and respiratory problems. Also, once he was admitted to hospital for sepsis. He is using the Foracort inhaler twice a day and Zincovit syrup once a day. Can I boil a few tulsi leaves in water and store that water in a copper thermos flask for my son? Kindly reply.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. Our elders and seers advise us to take water stored in a copper vessel, and scientifically it has been proven too. Copper has antibacterial, anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties. So, you can take water stored in a copper vessel and give it to your little one. After storing water at least for 8 hours, you can consume it. According to ayurveda, this water is known as Tamra Jal, and it helps in balancing all three doshas and has many benefits. Remember one more thing that the copper is not innately utilized by our body, so too much of copper intake can be detrimental. So have some precautions like buying a copper vessel which is made of pure copper and consuming this water twice or thrice a day is sufficient. Now coming to your kid's current respiratory tract problem, rather than storing tulsi based water I would advise you another decoction which is more effective for your baby. Take two to three tulsi leaves, some ginger, a pinch of black pepper, cardamom and some amount of fennel. Boil it in water and when half water remains give it to your baby with honey twice a day. Make fresh decoction every time you use it. All these will help in curing respiratory problem soon. You can also make a fine powder of all these and can give it with honey twice a day. Give him half teaspoon of this powder, as far as decoction is concerned 5 to 10 mL is sufficient. If Tulsi leaves are fresh, then add their juice to the powder. Use this regularly for one to two weeks, and you will soon see positive results. Along with this, I suggest syrup Septilin (Himalaya) half teaspoon twice a day with lukewarm water for two weeks. It will build more immunity in your baby and help to get relief from the infection he previously had. Take some precautionary measures like if you feed him with a bottle, boil the nipple and bottle every time before use. Try to change the nipple every week or after 10 days. Try to change his bottle after one or one and a half month. I am telling you all this because he got sepsis. Try to train your little one for having liquids with the help of sipper and glasses. As frequent bottle use also leads to infections rapidly. As he is having foracort inhaler two times, give him plain water steam twice a day. No need to cover your baby. Just take him in your lap and give him steam for 5 to 10 minutes as long as he is comfortable. Steam will help him a lot. Give him healthy and homemade food. Soon he will be completely fine.

Now, I have another problem. My appetite has become very poor, and I cannot eat most of the things I used to eat before. This became an issue even before the Bell's palsy problem. Ater that, it became severe. While I was taking steroids, I could eat well. Now, the type of food I can eat is becoming fewer. I cannot eat spicy food, which I love. It seems to me ingredients like lemon or tomato make things more difficult. There appears to be a major problem with taste. My mouth had a strong metallic taste, and I still feel such a taste in my mouth. The saliva produced is very little, and when eating anything, I have to sip water to eat that. I have to get up three to four times to go to the toilet in the night as well. I am not sure about the new problem. There is an inability to eat most things because they taste horrible and lack of saliva or very little production of saliva. Is this related to Bell's palsy? Or is this a symptom of any other illness? Should I see a specialist? If so, what kind of specialist? Or is it something you can assist? Should I get any tests here?

Please, can you help me and maybe encouraged me.","Doctor":"Hello. The virus can not permeate through the intact condom. The amount of protection given by barrier contraceptive (condom) is not only​ for HIV but also for other sexually transmitted infections. Research has ample evidence to suggest that condom forms a valuable part of HIV prevention.Only certain body fluids like blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, rectal fluids, vaginal fluid, and breast milk from a person who has HIV can transmit it (CDC). When there is unprotected sexual intercourse, the virus enters through cuts and sores or directly through mucous membranes​. Mucous membranes are found inside the rectum, vaginal, penis, and mouth. Your risk of contracting HIV when consistently and correctively using a condom, and it did not break while sex, is non-existent. So, relax and enjoy your protected sex. Another thing, there is no harm in knowing your HIV test, for this, you can get HIV rapid test at an accredited lab.

Now coming to your skin query. Well, ideally, the best would be to let me have a look at your scratches by posting well-focused pictures of your scratched or abraded areas, or come for a video-chat. Otherwise, I would suggest simple remedies as of now which would definitely expedite the healing of any post-trauma scratch mark: 1) Apply a cream containing an antibiotic, preferably containing a healing substance. There is a tube called ENZOMAC (containing antibiotic mupirocin and healing agent bromelain) or you may use SOFINOX cream (containing antibiotic fusidic acid and healing agents). Apply any one of them twice a day for 7-10 days. 2) If the above mentioned tubes are not available, then you may use separate antibiotic cream twice a day and a healing cream twice a day, example: T-BACT (containing antibiotic mupirocin) cream/ointment or NADIBACT (containing antibiotic nadifloxacin) cream/gel twice a day as the antibiotic and for healing - PLACENTREX gel can be applied one hour after applying either of the above mentioned antibiotic creams. 3) Avoid using a medicated soap or face wash and also avoid a scrub. Wash the scratched area with a mild moisturising soap or baby soap. 4) Keep that area completely protected from sun exposure. Preferably apply a sunscreen lotion with SPF of at least 30, two times a day on the entire face and other affected areas. First coat of sunscreen should be applied half hour before anticipated exposure and second coat after 4-5 hours. 5) Just in case if your scratches are deep, you should take oral vitamin C 500mg twice a day for 10 days (CELIN 500 or LIMCEE 500) and a zinc containing multivitamin capsule once a day (ZINCOVIT or BECOSULE-Z) I hope this helps you.

As you do not want to undergo a surgery, in Ayurveda, Kshar sutra procedure is performed for fistula in the anus. It is a procedure where a medicated thread is bound at your fistula site and after some days your treating physician will change it. Ultimately this thread will cut down the fistula tract as well as will also help in its healing. Along with this, your doctor may also prescribe you some medicines and you have to take treatment for avoiding constipation also. According to the condition of your fistula, he will let you know that for how long you have to bind this thread. Usually two to four weeks is the time period but time may vary according to patient to patient. It is a cost-effective treatment with minimal side effects and minimal chances of reoccurrence.

For delaying the cycle, it's better to take tablets at least 10 days before, otherwise a week before is also alright. Everyone responds differently. I suggest tablet Primolut N (Norethisterone) 10 mg daily if starting 10 days before the menstrual date, but if starting after, you can have 5 mg three times a day. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. It depends on how long you want to delay.

I have been drinking a bottle of wine a day for weeks and not eating healthy. Five days ago, I woke up with a pounding heart pain in my chest. I now have a wide range of symptoms with pain in my left and right arm, pain in my left shoulder, muscle spasms in my left shoulder, a tight feeling in my chest, pains on both sides of my body, shooting pain in armpits with headaches for five days straight, dizziness today, fullness, feeling of indigestion, my arms and legs feel weak and I have a sore back. I went to the doctor and he sent me for blood work and a chest X-ray. I did not get a call back so I assume that is fine. I had an EKG and Holter monitor just over a year ago. I am on 20 mg of Citalopram for anxiety. I am also taking a month's break from fertility treatments. The fertility doctor says my thyroid is a bit high at 6.3 so he is sending me for further testing. I am worried if I am having a heart attack.","Doctor":"Hello. Well, none of the symptoms warn me of any serious heart issue. When we see the whole scenario, there are different aspects of your health that may have caused this recent accentuation of the issues. High levels of the thyroid have a direct impact on heart rate and its functions as a pump. It also has an impact on overall body functions, for example, digestion, overall well being and mood, energy/power of the body etc. Thyroid drives our body to do daily work. Malfunction of thyroid causes many of the symptoms you observed recently. I know you are on Citalopram 20 mg. Sometimes there is a need to readjust the dosage of medicine. You should consult back your treating physician if there is such a need. Medication side effects may also have contributed to your recent symptoms. When someone goes off of fertility treatment this also contributes to this wide range of symptoms like you are observing. It is due to a change in hormonal balance in the body. But this is temporary and once you are back either on medications or your body's own mechanisms kick into maintaining hormonal balance, you would feel better. Taking alcohol at this stage can be injurious to your health. It also may contribute to the symptoms like you are having. But heart disease is least likely the cause of such issues. If your labs are all normal I am not worried much about it being any serious issue. For a headache, you may take Ibuprofen as needed. Keep taking a healthy and balanced diet. Keep a routine of a workout as it would give you more energy. Follow up with your thyroid doctor is very important. Thyroid issues also contribute to fertility problems.

I have read and understood your problem. The fluid that male organ secrete during ejaculation is called semen. Semen is a visible liquid. It contains millions of invisible microscopic male counterpart of female eggs called sperms. It does not matter if your semen is more watery, the sperm count in semen should be normal and that can be detected by semen analysis, which is done at a pathology laboratory. Erection problem appears to be due to stress or anxiety. So, do relaxation exercise. However, to exclude other cause you need to do some blood tests like sugar and hormones. Stop smoking if you smoke. Check your BP (blood pressure). If you are taking any medicine or nutritional supplement on regular basis then it may be due to side effect of that.

Your total WBC (white blood cell) count is only mildly elevated, and it is not raised to an alarming level. You have been prescribed a steroid course for sore throat.

You have to do it regularly and you can see the change within a month. If the foreskin is excessively tight, then massage or any other thing would not help you. All you need is a surgical visit. Surgical Method (Circumcision): The surgeon will do a mild procedure known as circumcision. This procedure will cut your excessive tight foreskin in one visit and it is a daycare procedure and completely a safe procedure. It will not interfere with your urination or with your sexual activity. By birth or sometimes excessive masturbation.

Before proceeding, I would like to emphasize that this is very important to me as I have undergone several tests and I have been advised to consult a dietician or nutritionist to follow up my symptoms. I am doing this as in my country there are few, if any, nutritionists and dieticians. The only doubts that came out of previous examinations with gastroenterologist are IBS subtype C suspect. The bloating is the most frustrating thing that I have battled recently, even more than the anxiety disorder which I had a couple of years ago. I am active in gym and it has not made a lot of difference to my bloating issues in the past. My blood examinations are totally fine with a slight elevation of cholesterol at 6.2. I am on Venlafaxine and have no other medications that I take. So lets jump to the question. I have recently undergone a wellbeing examination in a clinic, with the help of a follicle sample from my hair. I received the results, and found some pretty interesting feedback. It appears that I am intolerant to the following: β-Lactoglobulin at 87%, Chamomile tea at 91%, Earl grey tea at 92%, E211 (benzoic acid), E403 (alginate ammonium alginate) at 94%, E479 at 90%, E903 at 96%, Soya bean at 95%, Mango 100%, White sugar 97%, Berries at 84%, Rye at 98%, Olive oil at 96%, Indian saffron at 96%. As a recommendation from the report from the clinic, I have been suggested a regime of 90 days of not eating for the following: Salmon, Berries, Cow Milk, Prawns, Mango, Potato, Cod, Clams. I have also been recommended to increase the intake of K2 and D3 vitamin, as well as arachidonic acid and oleic acid. There is also a suggestion that I should increase the intake of amino acids like alanine, carnitine, phenylalanine and taurine. Finally it is recommended that I decrease the resistance of bacteria and fungi with different sources of food. For your information, I would like to mention that my body is very selective towards high fiber foods. Some of which, for example avocado, make my bloating worse and cause a very bad flatulence for hours. After this lengthy description I would like to know what kind of diet should I follow? What do you recommend I should strictly take out of my diet? I have an addiction to chocolate. Is dark chocolate included in that list of ingredients or potentially harmful? Are cheese, yoghurt and other dairy products harmful as well? How about fruits and red wine? Are they also prone to bloating in my case? My word, I should be allowed to eat something for the sake of my soul.

You should take yogurt among dairy product. You can take roti, toasted bread, rice, oats, cornflakes, cereal product. Take apple, banana, pear, sweet grapes or fruits whatever you liked but taking after any meal. Take plenty of water. Sleep atleast 7 to 8 hours. Do meditation regularly.

I saw your query regarding our disc prolapse resulting in back pain radiating down the legs. I need to ascertain this after examining you and looking at your MRI films.

I used to be a brilliant student, but nowadays I fail in my exams even if I study for the whole night. My father and brother are not getting a salary, so we have to spend money with care. My sister, who is very close to me, is getting married, so she is about to move. Everything is going down, and I cry all day and feel so bad that I cannot even express.","Doctor":"Hello. Because you are facing so many stressful events like father and brother not getting salaries and sister getting married, this condition is known as an adjustment disorder. If you are feeling persistently depressed for the last two weeks, feeling hopeless, then you might also be having depression. For this condition, you may take an antidepressant such as Escitalopram 10 mg one tablet at night. From Psychotherapy point of view, you have to learn specific coping strategies. 1. Since you are only 21 years old, it might not be possible for you to contribute much financially towards the family. 2. Lower down your expectation level, and do not take all the load on your shoulder. 3. Every problem has a solution, sit with your father and brother, and discuss options with them. Whether they can do some part-time jobs? 4. Great people see opportunities in adversities. Take this as a challenge and motivate yourself to do something in life. But do not try to control the present. Some things will be better with time. 5. Your sister getting married is not a problem, it is part and parcel of life. Accept it."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 22 years old, and I have no trouble in getting an erection during masturbation or foreplay. However, when I try to have sex, I cannot maintain a tough erection while during foreplay and masturbation. At some point, I feel getting softer. I have an erection right up until the end of penetration then I start to go limp. I once had the head of my penis inside her, and I accidentally removed it, and my erection was quickly lost, and without removing the condom, it is hard to get it back.","Doctor":"Hello. You have mentioned two essential things while describing your problem. Number one, you can achieve a proper erection and number two, you are a virgin. Keeping these facts in consideration, I would like you to know that you do not have any erectile dysfunction. The problem appears to be related to the unconscious and conscious anxiety that a person has typically while having sex for the first time. When a male is getting ready for his first ever sex he is preoccupied with the thoughts about the outcome of the forthcoming sexual act ,e.g. whether you will be able to maintain erection during sex, whether or not the partner will notice my weaknesses and lack of experience, whether the experience is going to be satisfactory or not, whether or not you will be able to last long, whether you will be looking good or ugly without clothes, etc. Such thoughts increase anxiety, and insecurity, which ultimately results in loss of erection while penetrating. Getting comfortable with the partner will help. Viagra although does not help in psychological erectile dysfunction still it is going to help you by maintaining a solid erection during penetration and thereby will boost up your confidence."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering from unsteadiness, muscle tension, mild fatigue, anxiety and depression. I have been diagnosed with GAD. My doctor prescribed my Clonazapem 5 mg and Escitalopran 10 mg. Is it fine to take half of each tablet? Will it cause any intolerable side effects? I do not want to take medicines. My doctor said that it is mandatory. She said CBT will not work for me. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I think for a 71 Kg young male the chance of side effects with recommended dose is very minimal, but at the same time I do not think this could be the final dose. Your doctor is right in saying take 5 mg of Escitalopram and this is the minimal effective dose for first time anxiety problem. Since you are already taking Xanax (Alprazolam) I assume that you have this problem for a longtime and it is possible that there will be required to increase the dose in the near future. You also mentioned heart arrhythmia. In that situation we need to be very slow. First, start with 5 mg than 7.5 mg or 10 mg as there are problems encountered by those who has a heart problem. I do not mean there is a serious risk, but caution is warranted. In case if you develop side effects, then there is some possibility of headache, gastrointestinal disturbance and giddiness, which are most common. Regarding the suitability of treatment, I do not find any fault with prescribed treatment as Escitaopram a SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), is used for definite treatment of GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) while Clonazepam helps in initial management of anxiety till Escitalopram takes over.

Before starting this, your resting pulse rate should be more than 65 per minute or get it prescribed from a local doctor. This will one to two to acts and gradually increase the dose.

I have reviewed your question. I am sorry you are experiencing neck pain. Nearly 80 % of people will experience back pain at some point in their life. If your pain is muscle related, a hot bath may help loosen you up and give you some temporary relief. When you say that you heard a pop and now you cannot move it, it tells me that you will most likely need to see a chiropractor for relief. If you were my patient, I would perform a chiropractic examination and would most likely recommend chiropractic adjustments. Since you are not my patient, I recommend that you go back to a local chiropractor for treatment and proper care. Once they perform an examination, your chiropractor may want to order X-rays to confirm a diagnosis, but I would suspect that he or she will recommend a trial of care to see how you respond to care. Until then, ice may help with some of your pain. Make sure you ice for 20 minutes and then take it off for at least 40 minutes. Repeat this as a need for pain relief until you see a chiropractor.

Including chlamydia, ghonnorea, trichomoniasis, yeast infections, and bacterial vaginosis. But each time they have come back negative. I am not sure what else to do. I have been to multiple doctors but have accomplished nothing. Currently, I am experiencing dryness, loss of libido, and irritation.","Doctor":"Hello. I would like to have a few more clarifications. 1. Have you checked your blood sugar levels? Do you have any family history of diabetes? If so, then correction of your blood sugar levels should be the first test. The discharge you mentioned seems to be of candida. Even though your trial is ruling out this fungus, the symptoms you specified seems to be of candida albicans. 2. Your ideal body weight is 57 to 62 kg for a height of 157 cm. Are your periods regular or bulky or too less? Any hormone level imbalance controlling periods can release lots of vaginal discharge. This can be resolved only by reducing your body weight and getting regular periods. 3. Are you sexually active? If your partner has any infections or is diabetic, you can have the same disease. Your antibiotics course would have removed infection partly. He too will need medication to resolve problems fully.

You had negligible to low-risk exposure in this scenario. Mutual masturbation and playing with tits involves no risk. I guess there was no discharge from tits. If there was no discharge, again this was a negligible risk. You had traumatic oral lesions, which was a source of risk to the other person.If you do not know her HIV status or if she is HIV infected, in both situations, your concern of HIV acquisition is unwarranted as HIV cannot be transmitted by touching. Because of no to negligible risk, PEP is not warranted in this scenario.

It is a widespread issue, and many people whole eat from outside get food poisoning if the food was contaminated. You are taking the very best step of hydrating yourself. I would advise taking plenty of fluids (as you are already taking) plus ORS (oral rehydration solution) or Pedialyte to rehydrate yourself. Keep an eye on the symptoms, and if they are severe enough, you should rush to a healthcare provider or a hospital. The time you need to seek medical attention would include any one or many of the following five severe symptoms, 1. High fevers (over 102 degrees of Fahrenheit, when measured with an oral thermometer). 2. Blood starts coming in stools. 3. You take fluids, and they cannot go down the stomach due to severe and frequent vomiting. No liquid is staying inside the gastrointestinal tract, and you may get dehydrated in that way. 4. Symptoms of dehydration that you can feel by yourself, e.g., dizziness on standing up, decreased urine volume and dark colored urine, very dry mouth and throat, and no sweating. 5. Diarrhea lasting more than 72 hours from the time of its onset after the food poisoning. You got this stomach cramps (pain) in a timeframe of 30 minutes to an hour after eating the food. This refers to the possibility of food poisoning caused by a germ named Staphylococcus aureus (commonly abbreviated as staph). And this type of bacteria affects the foods not cooked adequately after handling. These foods can include but not limited to sliced meats, puddings, sandwiches, pastries. I hope it helps.

He was very active, nothing rash or other symptoms. He was playing as usual. But second day night he got again fever not exceeding 99.5 F. Third day morning again we did a FBC. It shows WBC 5000 mm and platelets reduced to 136000. The baby had no fever since last night. He is very active as usual. I want to whether he has a problem or not. His Hb level is 13.2. Others are according to the reference range.","Doctor":"Hello. Most probably it is an upper respiratory tract infection due to a virus, which is very common in children less than 5 years old. As the child is active, playful, and I assume he is eating well. The normal WBC count is from 4000 to 11000 and platelets from 1.5 to 4 lacs. It is slightly below normal in your child. If he is having other symptoms like excessive cry, irritability, vomiting, shivering, it is better to rule out malaria and dengue as these can be severe in children below five years. If there are no symptoms, I mentioned you could wait and watch for a couple of days. If fever is not subsiding, it requires complete evaluation by a pediatrician. However, as long as the kid is active, playful, and eating well, no need to worry. I hope this information helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son is 5'6 in height. He is 17 years old and wants to be taller. We want to try growth hormone. Is this possible? Kindly suggest the treatment.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query, and from what information you have given me, it appears that your son has short constitutional stature and not growth hormone deficiency. Well, but it depends on many factors such as the mid-parental height, ethnicity, nutritional status, etc. Since he is below the third percentile for age for boys for height, I would suggest a proper work-up to rule out hormonal deficiencies such as, 1. Thyroid function test. 2. IGF-1 (insluin-growth fractor) and IGFBP-3 (insulin-like growth fractor binding protein). 3. LH (leutinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) routine tests like CBC (complete blood count), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation arte). 4. Liver function test. 5. Renal function test.6. Urinalysis, and X-ray of left hand and wrist. If the hormone analysis comes out abnormal or in other words, there is a deficiency of any of the above hormones, and then I would suggest MRI pituitary gland. Because short constitutional stature is not a disorder but a variation in normal growth, therefore, medical treatment is not usually necessary.So I would not suggest any hormonal treatment as it will not benefit him at this age as his bones have matured by now. Although some studies do suggest the use of testosterone injections or patches to achieve growth and sexual maturation if necessary. Growth hormone is not recommended if any of the above tests turn out to be normal as it is associated with a lot of adverse effects. I hope my advice is of some benefit to you."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Please help.

What risks may I face? I am panicking. If she is negative with HIV, virus A, B and C and syphlis and all salmonella and typhoids and no mucus and blood in her anus. Am I still at risk of the diseases mentioned above? If not since her results are clean, am I at risk of catching other STDs like herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, mycoplasma genitalium, trichomoniasis, human papilloma virus (HPV), HIV/AIDS, crabs or pubic lice, bacterial vaginosis, molluscum-contagiosum, mucopurulent-cervicitis, lymphogranuloma-venereum. Please tell me if there is any medication to take in order to prevent all this from happening.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. But the risk of acquiring a STD is not there if your partner does not have any one of the diseases you mentioned clinically or sub-clinically. There are STDs like herpes in which subclinical shedding can lead to herpes, but that is more common in vaginal sex. I do not think you need to worry too much at this point if she is negative for tests. Some STDs take time to become positive in blood. So just to be careful please repeat HIV, HBsAg, HCV, VDRL after three months. Molluscum, HPV, pubic lice usually spread if there is active lesions, which I suppose were not there, so no need to worry. Just repeat the tests I suggested after three months and there is no such medication to be taken when all the tests of the partner are also negative. Prophylactic medications can be given if the status of the partner is not known sometimes.

PAI mutations (plasminogen activator inhibitor) could result in abnormalities in blood clotting disorders. This actually poses no bar for taking Folic acid in pregnancy state.

When I stand, I have the pain in my back. This symptom appears only in the evening. It never happens in the morning or afternoon. I have taken X-ray and analytics. The results are:  SV 1 spina bifida. There is a mild tilt of the lumbar spine to the left side. ESR for the first hour is 42. The second hour is 79. ASO: Negative. CRP: positive 15.2. RF: Negative.  I took medicine to cure sedimentation rate for only a month before two years.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms (local back pain when laying) could be related to the spina bifida. I do not think that there is any bulging disc or nerve compression. Anyway, I would recommend performing a lumbar spine MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) study to examine the spine better. I would recommend performing physiotherapy to improve your situation. Local warm packs can also be helpful too. For more information consult a neurologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My hands and legs are very weak for the past two years. The doctor diagnosed that I have AIDP or Guillian-barre syndrome. He gave me some medicines such as Methylcobalamin and other supplements and in the acute 12 IV injections of Cobalamin and I am recovering but I think very slowly. So please tell what is the best thing I should do. My MRI was clean. Thyroid, sugar, and calcium were normal. NCV showed motor weakness, sensory weakness. I do not have any kind of pain.","Doctor":"Hello. AIDP or GBS is an autoimmune disease. Which can be primary or also can be secondary other autoimmune diseases. As you are telling that you are recovering, it is a good thing. There is no medicine for rapid recovery after six months. Only medication available is for stopping the progression of weakness in the acute stage (IV Ig or Plasmapheresis). At this stage, you need regular physiotherapy and it takes a few weeks to a few months for recovery. Few patients do not have a complete recovery. Also, you should get further test for detecting any secondary autoimmune disease ANA, C-ANCA, P-ANCA, serum ACE level. Sometimes, chronic demyelinating neuropathy can present as acute presentation. For that need to see NCV graphs and if suspected, may need nerve biopsy. 1.NCV all four limbs (to be reviewed). 2.ANA, C-ANCA, P-ANCA, serum ACE levels. 3.Sural nerve biopsy. 4.CSF examination to look for albuminocytological dissociation. 1.AIDP (acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy). 2.Acute presentation of CIDP."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am just now noticing these patches on my skin and would like your input.

Initially, she got eczema kind small red rashes for which we applied Corticosteroid and later we observed whitish patches developing on those spots. Initially, the GP thought it could be tinea versicolor and suspected it could also be vitiligo. He referred us to a skin specialist and initially, the skin specialist thought it could be hypopigmentation and after a month, in the next appointment, she thought it could be vitiligo and started with Tacrolimus and Corticosteroid cream. Even before we started applying this Tacrolimus, we saw some repigmentation in some areas but it was slow repigmentation. We were confused as is it vitiligo or not and also as we are applying strong creams for a 6-year-old girl. Any long-term issues? We want to have a second opinion. I live in a city where it is very difficult to get skin specialist appointments. They give for every three to six months. Could you please help us in diagnosing the skin patches and treatment? I can send in the photos. I uploaded the photos:  They all are on one side of the body (right side). On the hand, it started four months ago with a small white patch and gradually increased to the size and then we are seeing some repigmentation slowly very slowly to normal skin color. On the chest also, it started around the same time this year and not increased and stable. On the neck, it started early last month and it is not that whitish (like little less brownish).  As said, the doctors diagnosed differently (postinflammatory hypopigmentation, tinea versicolor and finally vitiligo) so far and we are confused. Could you please look into this and help us? In all these spots, we applied Corticosteroid last year for eczema (hand, neck, chest and back) at the same spots where the white patches started and then grown big now. The only spot where we have not applied Corticosteroid but observed white patch is on the eye. We started seeing a white patch on the right eye as well from the last three weeks.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your history and clinical photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity). From the present situation, it looks to be vitiligo. Since it is on one side of the body, it can be called as segmental vitiligo also. Tacrolimus is the right medication. Wood's lamp examination helps to diagnose vitiligo. Yes, in some places, there is repigmentation which is a good sign. Did anyone in the family have vitiligo?

I have not ventured out in the sun for these two months. But, I really do not like it when everyone asks me what happened to my cheeks. Can you please tell me the way to get rid of it?","Doctor":"Hi. The white spots you describe can be due to various causes. It may be due to a fungal infection called tinea versicolor which usually occurs in the summertime, or it may be an allergic reaction to the sun. I suggest using an antifungal cream like Clotrimazole 1 % cream twice daily. Consult a specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent.

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I have done canine impaction surgery just before two weeks. The stitch and the removal after the surgery have caused a cut on my gums, which now separates the point at which the gums above the central incisors meet. The point that I am mentioning is right below the frenulum. My dentist said I am having class 2 labial frenulum and that it might result in gum recession and the formation of a black triangle.He added that it might prevent my gums from joining back together. I did not have any bad experiences with my frenulum until the surgery. I am afraid to undergo this surgery. Moreover, I do not want to undergo this frenectomy. All I want is my gums joining back. Please let me know whether I need to undergo this frenectomy. If yes, let me know when would be the right time to do it. I am planning to wear dental braces after two months.

I have evaluated the image, (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and you indeed have a high labial frenulum, and it can cause problems which is not a wrong advise. If you are planning for getting braces done, then it is appropriate for you to get the frenulectomy done now so that complete healing will take place by the time you proceed for the braces. So my suggestion is that you should continue for frenulectomy. Also, it is a minor surgical procedure that can be very well done under local anesthesia and is a routine procedure, so need not to worry about it.

Had second or last child eight years ago. Afterwards, had multiple infections (mastitis) and was on antibiotics almost the whole time I was breastfeeding. When I stopped breastfeeding, I started getting bad, daily headaches, lost a lot of weight quickly, post-partum depression. Diagnosed with Hashimoto's and chronic migraines, depression. Started anti-depressants, preventative and rescue migraine medicine, and Synthroid. Even after getting my depression managed, and thyroid fixed (at least the TSH was where they wanted to see it) I continued to have fatigue, daily headaches and low level anxiety and depression. I also developed symptoms of feeling like I was going to faint when standing up and racing heartrate, was diagnosed with POTS, working memory was non-existent and felt like I could not focus on anything, never knowing what to do first, I was like deer in headlights diagnosed with ADD and put on stimulants. I also have irregular periods and PMS is pretty bad. I feel like there is a hormone imbalance. All of these medical treatments have worked to a certain extent but there has been no discovery of the root cause and symptoms are just a bit better. They never go away. Last week I had a blood test still trying to get to the bottom of my chronic symptoms. My thyroid came back a bit skewed. I am always tweaking this as it is very sensitive to medication change and my cholesterol a bit high, also normal. My query is: There are blood markers that do not point to disease and I am not concerned that I have a scary illness lurking, but, I believe an imbalance that could be contributing to my overall health and symptoms. I am interested in looking more deeply into red blood cell information and how my liver, kidneys, blood is processing and fixing an imbalance. Some blood test results I would like you to look at and try to piece together: MCV and MCH run high. Hemoglobin and hematocrit run a bit low. Platelet count and RBC, C02 and bilirubin run low. Some Vitamins came up high which I found strange because I take a very standard multivitamin but only have for a few months. B6, B12, folate, folate RBC all were high. My appetite is not great so I worry I am not getting enough nutrients. I guess that is why I found it strange. And finally, I am curious about my iron numbers. The most recent ones were not out of range but iron higher end and ferritin lower end. I have probably had four blood tests in the last few showing either iron or ferritin out of range changing between high and low or normal. Because I do not take Iron supplements and do no't get that much iron through my diet, my doctor ran a hereditary hemochromatosis test a year ago- that was negative. He could not explain the fluctuations but said I should look into it. I would be so grateful if you could analyze and let me know if you notice a pattern to my blood work that makes sense. Could it be some type of anemia or liver function issue? Anyway, I hope I can at least get closer to the source of my symptoms.","Doctor":"Hello. Sorry to hear about your health problem. Kindly answer the following questions to guide you further. Did you have fever anytime in these last few months? Do you have weight gain or weight loss problem?

I was on Trileptal 300 mg, Wellbutrin 300 mg for past 16 years and now on probiotic, steroid inhaler, and antibiotics.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your medical history carefully and understood your concern. The low immune system makes you more prone to get an infection. Sinus infection is difficult to treat sometimes. A sinus infection can be complicated by lung infection especially when severe nasal congestion. With regards to bronchitis, from what you are explaining, it seems you have been suffering from acute asthmatic bronchitis. That might require a few days to months to completely recover. That is why inhalation medicines are also required. Bronchodilator like Salbutamol is needed to ease coughing spasms especially those you experience in the morning.
