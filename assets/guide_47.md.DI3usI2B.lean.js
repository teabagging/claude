Samuel here. I've a brother who was beaten by a dog over three weeks ago but nobody knew except him. Now, he's extremely sick and in dire condition. He gets so irritated when he sees water or is invited to drink. Doctors said that it is clearly \\"Hydrophobia\\" (Rabies) and nothing to do as it's long over due. Is there anything that can be done to cure? Any hope for him to get well? What will be his next fate?","Doctor":"Hello  Unprovoked infected dog bite is dangerous and if no precautionary measures and immunization is taken then it may lead to development of Rabies and consequent hydrophobia. Diagnosis in most cases is made on the basis of clinical history along with history of dog bite. Its very sad to say but so far there is no cure of Rabies Hydrophobia. Best you can do is prey and provide him symptomatic treatment. Recently in United States a study was done on mice and it was found that ketamine (anesthetic medicine) has potential to inhibit virus. This result in introduction of induced coma in treatment of Rabies and so far 2 patients have been saved by this treatment. The treatment is named as Milwaukee Protocol. Hope it helps you.

Present medication- Admenta 10mg (memantine hydrochloride) twice daily, Stamlo beta (Amlodipine+atenolol) in the morning and stamlo 2.5 mg in d evening. His BP is under conrol but mental ability is deterirating day by day. What should be our next line of treatment?","Doctor":"Hello  Alzheimer's dementia is most common form of dementia in elderly. Hypertension is also very common in advancing age. You have mentioned that his BP is under control of medicines but his mental abilities are deteriorating day by day. He is on Admanta 10 mg twice a day. His progressive deterioration of mental abilities is due to psycho pathological changes of Alzheimer's disease. Other medicine like Donepezil can be added to his prescription. It help in slowing the progression of dementia. If he is getting aggressive and violent any antipsychotic drug in low doses can be added to his prescription like Resperidone. It will not only decrease abnormal behavior and aggression but will also decrease the progression of dementia. So I would advise you to please take him to a good Psychiatrist for proper evaluation. Thanks Dr. Seikhoo Bishnoi, MD"},{"Patient":"I have a dog who had 7 puppies inside our home.  We put them in the laundry room about the size of a restroom.  After the puppies got 2-3 months old they were pooping and peeing at 1st on puppy pads but as they grew there was so much excrement in there it made my eyes burn and took my breath but while in there I kept the door shut and the longer i stayed in there the more difficult simple tasks became and I had an episode where I stayed in there at the end of a long day of going back and forth I stayed shut in there for 3 hours because i became confused and too tired to move. Can that cause confusion and hallucinations and after 911 came and ran oxygen for a while I cleared up and  I want to know can being shut up in there with no fresh or moving air cause that?  Can it cause further damage?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. Unless you have been in a completely closed room, totally shut off from any air supply for a few hours together, it sounds improbable that the incident of staying in that room could have caused you hallucinations and confusion. Moreover, it again sounds improbable that spending some time in that room would have caused you to become immobile for 3 hours, so as to not be able to get out of that room. There are two things which are concerning to me. Firstly, your hallucinations, confusion, etc. which needs further evaluation. Secondly, such a scenario of harbouring such unhygeinic conditions inside your house and your behaviour of shutting yourself inside that room for hours also seems concerning to me. Please see a psychiatrist for a detailed evaluation and psychological assessment. Wish you all the best.

When he was a teenager he was put into a mental hospital because of his panic attacks. They treated him poorly and gave him a very powerful medication that had unwelcome side effects and did not help. Because of this he refuses to see a doctor. He has been on social security/disability ever since and has not been able to hold a job my entire life. My father avoids most social situations and any situation where he may have to speak to someone and answer questions, in fact, I must be careful speaking with him, because even discussing the possibility of a job interview or a doctors visit can trigger a panic attack. He even gets incredibly irritable, nervous, anxious and angry if a stranger like a tax consultant or insurance broker or someone will be coming to the house later. I have noticed that when forced to be social, a few beers is all it takes for him to act pretty much normal. He is still a bit shy, but no panic attacks, and he will even tell jokes and perhaps even make friends. This tells me that the condition must be treatable (although obviously not with alcohol). Other symptoms include shaking his feet a lot and vigorously rubbing his hands together. He also would spend a lot of time pacing around the house drinking coffee. Now that he is getting older I am extra worried about his health since he is afraid to see a doctor so I am looking for somewhere to turn. Do you have any advice?","Doctor":"Hi friend, Welcome to Health Care Magic There is no alternative to Psychiatric consultation... family and friends must convince him... A bad experience, once, is no excuse to avoid it. If one is hit by an auto-mobile, it is no excuse to avoid auto-mobile for ever - as a matter of fact, he should look for and catch one (say, an ambulance), to go the hospital for treatment. Psychiatry is well advanced and he has an excellent chance of improvement. Discuss with local social organisation or his friends methods to convince him / if necessary compel him? Wishing speedy recovery God bless Good luck"},{"Patient":"Hai sir ,  I am sai koushik , A Mechanical graduate from a university of kanchipuram. I am a 2012 passed out and from that time,I am trying for job through government exams.   I have one to many problems, I will explain you here briefly.Thank in advance for solution.I am an average student for my school but scored around 65% in 10th and 83% in intermediate finally, I finish my BE with 84 %. I usually work hard in learning but subject's leave from my mind much more faster than the time that I spent for reading. People told me that I am mugging up and suggested me many procedure's in reading. Another good point those idea's helped me in getting good score in my curriculum. I went to gate coaching and studied hard each and every topic almost for 10 month in count of not less 16 hours in a day. But unfortunately in this gate exam the subject which left for the god, kicked me out form the qualifying list. I got almost 30 bit from that stream (out of 6o bits ).  Until i get result's, I enjoyed well like watching tv,social network sites and many more..once after getting,I had applied for another govt.exam ISRO which is usually tough. I try to study but am unable my environment changed completely.I addicted to porn 100% and tried and got tied of comming out of it.Now my time reached peak my parents asking me to join in Mtech through managemant cota but i don't want such a study. I want to join in ISRO and I am trying to study but when i open a book In the morning's almost 2hours time i can concentrate but later mind stop and start thinking about food,porn,messaging,many more other than studied. I got only 29 days left for the exam. I can say surely that if i studies for like before 100% i will join in ISro.    when i open a book i get following thoughts after 1 hour \\" make a paln and study(I am following plan ie,making a plan rest of the dAYS and leaving and next make an other ), food, think of 10 mins break which will turn into 10hours break ,fight my brother , etc    please suggest me something","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to Health Care Magic I have read your elaborate and detailed description of symptoms. There is no shortcut in studies. You are spending more and more time in watching pornographic materials, messaging, TV, social networking sites etc. Loss of concentration and inattention may be a problem that is significant but this is happening because of your mind which is diverted on different side. Memory problems are common in Dementia but that is a disease of elderly. Poor concentration may be seen in depression but other symptoms like loss of interest in activities, sadness etc are also see. So please concentrate on your goals and don't waste your time in useless things. If problem persist then visit a psychologist for counseling.

I intend to say things that arent the words that I was going to say, and cant verbally speak things that I wanted to say. And when I speak, my head somehow hurts and I get hot (gets sweaty and red) sometimes depending on the crowd. This may be because I am nervous but when I speak to my family and friends, I cant say things properly and they intend to not understand. Once when I was reading the text out loud to the class, the words/ numbers that I said was wrongly interpreted even though I know how the numbers and words are said. Please tell me if this condition is normal or not?","Doctor":"Hello  You have problem of headache, redness, sweating while speaking to crowd. You are not able to speak properly. You become nervous while speaking. The symptoms are most likely due to some form of anxiety. Also called as social anxiety disorder this can happen in any individual, but as it is causing distress to you so there is a need for treatment. Many good drugs especially propranolol can be used for episodic control of anxiety. The drug is usually taken 1-2 hours before any important presentation or viva. And for cure of illness many medicines are used as SSRIs as escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertaline etc. The drugs are needed to be taken for at least 3-4 months and you will see improvement. Along with drugs Behavior Therapy and Assertiveness training is also needed to supplement medicine therapy. Visit a Psychiatrist for evaluation.

There were other instances I can mention but don't want to go on if I am totally wrong.  YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. It is difficult to make a specific diagnosis of Dissociative Identity Disorder based on the limited information that you have provided. More so, when the information is based on a retrospective recall by a third person. Merely a history of odd behaviour and a lapse of memory does not amount to a diagnosis of a DID. Such complex psychological disorders have to be diagnosed by a professional, based on a detailed history from reliable informants, such as close family members, and also a detailed psychological assessment. So, it is better not to speculate and make unecessary conclusions or give diagnostic labels to a person who is no more. Wish you all the best.

It is so sad to hear about your husband. I have gone through your available history. What you are having is adjustment disorder with depressed mood. Diazepam is very good drug for sleep but it has its own potential hazards including addiction. There are some non-addictive sleeping pills available like zolpidem which has very low addictive properties. You can ask your doctor for that.

I recently lost my health ins and wasn't able to continue some othe meds I was taking but was concerned greatly with the Vyvance side effects so decided to stay on the Lexapro and drop down and off the ADHD med. I was experiencing migraines and irritability with the vyvance and now I look back and see how intense those side effects were but am torn because I am having such struggle with completing daily tasks and overall decrease in my career and home life.The most troubling is I have gained almost thirty pounds in just three months off the drug and haven't changed my activity level that much or diet with the exception of the extreme fatigue it is more difficult to excersize and even have more joint pain am stiffness.Any recommendations would be helpful. Thank you -Sarah","Doctor":"Hello  You have some symptoms of adult ADD and also symptoms of depression and anxiety. Vyvanse is a stimulant drug and it improves inattention and other symptoms of ADD. On the other side as it is a stimulant drug so it has side effects of headache, irritation, intense stimulation etc. Escitalopram (Lexapro) is a SSRI drug and it is used to control depression and anxiety symptoms. It is not commonly used in ADD symptoms. You have gained 30 pounds weight in three months after starting this medicine. Escitalopram is known to cause a little gain in weight but it not so significant. Most likely increase in weight in your case has happened because of improvement in symptoms and consequent increase in appetite. I would advise you to start exercising daily and also improve you activity levels, it will come under control. Thanks Dr. Seikhoo Bishnoi, MD"},{"Patient":"Hey Doc, Hi !

However, I would take your doctor's advice and give it serious thought.  Please take the doctor's suggestions.  Your HbA1C should be less than 7.0 and the lesser it is the better you have had your glucose under control.  It is a long term indicator of diabetes control.  If you have worsening of any of your psychiatric conditions either, fibromyalgia or depression, please see a psychiatrist and get a second opinion on medications.  Also RLS and sleep disorder need attention from a qualified sleep disorder specialist although a psychiatrist can help with these conditions as well.  I hope this helps.

I have had normal periods, been to the doctor, nothing reassures him. During the Christmas time his grandfather died, his mom was having mentally ill spells again, etc. He had a lot going on, but I still can't explain his irrational fear of me being pregnant. It's better to worry than be naive about me not getting pregnant, but nothing I say to reassure him that I not, helps. Nothing. Severe anxiety runs on his mother's side, as well as his brother. He doesn't really worry as much about other things, just about me being pregnant. He worries a great deal more when his mom calls him, or if he has any contact at all with her.

Initially I started to feel like “pressure” inside my stomach after waking up in the morning and had panic attacks as a result because I didn’t know what was wrong with me. During such panic attacks I used to feel nervous and nauseous, then lie down feeling very tired. The reason why I had those panic attacks was because I always have phobia about cancer.  After a few weeks of not eating (because of feeling of early satiety) and as a result losing some weight I started to feel better. I saw a doctor and told me there is nothing to worry about. I had full blood test and an ultrasound to check my bladder and it returned normal. Since then, my main complaint has been belching a lot. I started to realize that I was not able to eat because of the belching problem and the problem got worse as my stomach shrank and got smaller because I was not eating. The intensity of my symptoms seems cyclic. Some days/weeks I feel better and some other days/weeks I feel worse. There has been general trend towards getting better in the recent few months. But the problem of Belching a lot which I have never experienced in the past of my life still remains and sometimes makes me feel I cannot eat as much as I used to. My symptoms also exclusively occur during the first half of the day and especially during the first three hours of the day as I always feel my stomach is heavy and that I cannot eat. Then I belch for several times in the morning until my stomach feels better and I can have my breakfast. My energy in the morning is also very low.In 90% of the days I feel like an entirely different person during the second half of the day (from evening to night). Although belching continues throughout the whole day, my stomach does not seem to feel heavy and I can eat large meals especially at dinner. I also feel at night a dramatic increase in my energy (although this is still not like the explosive energy I used to have in my body in the past). But I can say I am normal at night and sometimes very bad in the morning. I thought that perhaps my stomach is accumulating gas during the night while I am asleep, and once I release some gases in the morning I feel a little bit better. But my energy also increases in the night. The energy pattern reminds me of the “adrenal fatigue syndrome” which is associated with stress. In fact I am stressed most of the time because this low energy and heavy morning stomach sometimes prevents me from being productive at work.I also had bad sleeping habits. I sleep at 3 AM and wake up 11 AM. I can only start to feel better at 1 AM when I have my “breakfast”. I have my lunch at 5 PM and dinner at 11 PM. Sometimes I cannot have that “breakfast” and have my lunch at 3-4 PM then dinner at 10 PM. Sometimes (but rarely) I have acid reflux.  It is not heartburn. I just feel some acid went up to my mouth. I do not have sternal pain etc. I don’t think I have GERD.  Sometimes (also rarely) I feel like very brief and short burning sensation in the lower abdomen. I think the location is very low to be the stomach. My stools are normal most of the days but tend to be somewhat loose. The appearance of stools is normal. No blood, or mucus whatsoever. I don’t know if it is IBS but I don’t think so because I do not have a spasm in my colon.I am aware that digestive problems can stem from stress. In fact I am a stressed person and I tend to worry about the smallest details. But I have always been like that since I was born. I tried using Lanzoprazole for 4 months (last year from April to August 2012). I am not sure if it really helped because as I mentioned, my symptoms are cyclic. Some days/weeks I feel better. I have not been taking any medication since August 2012). The most bothersome symptoms are morning fatigue and belching and morning heavy stomach (which prevents me from having my breakfast. I also have an important and persistent symptom which is odorless flatus. It seems a lot of this gas in my stomach passes to the lower end. Since It is odorless I believe it is CO2 or Nitrogen. I don’t think my problem is aerophobia because I don’t chew quickly I don’t chew gums etc. But antacids didn’t really help so I don’t think it is CO2 either. Belching and the heavy stomach feelings are not associated with food because I sometimes belch immediately after I get up from bed after I wake up. On the bad days, I belch before, during and after meals. In fact I feel a little bit better after I have breakfast. It is like food promotes the expulsion of these large bubbles of gas inside my stomach. I also almost always belch after I drink little water in the morning (after I wake up).It is noteworthy that two years ago (about the same time when my symptoms started) I used to work in a lab where a colleague of mine was doing research on multiple strains of H.Pylori. I don’t know if I got that one at the time. I had a urea breath test and the test strip turned somewhat yellow (indicating the presence of Urease) but the instrument showed a negative result. I understand that about 70% of people are infected though. I just feel I am not what I used to be. I have just recently arrived to Austria after I won a PhD scholarship. I need my full energy and health in order to be productive and not let my supervisor and professor down. It makes me feel stressed when I feel I lack the energy required. I also want to eat freely whenever I want to and wherever I want as before. My symptoms might seem silly or trivial and I never had some alert symptoms as nausea or vomiting or blood etc, but the morning symptoms are very annoying and disturbing and they affect my academic performance and productivity. As I said my symptoms are cyclic. For some periods (weeks) I belch 30 times during the day. Other periods I belch 10 times or less and never even notice it. But morning fatigue and the inability to eat breakfast in the morning is obvious on the bad days.  It is also noteworthy that I feel much more energetic after I eat (perhaps because I am still underweight). But my weight never exceeded  80 Kg when I was healthy despite how much I used to eat.I started to eat better recently (in the past few months). But this doesn’t seem to be a result of reduced bloating or gas but rather because my stomach got bigger and can now accommodate both food and gas. So I now eat more and my weight has in fact increased and I started to get used to it. But still I feel I am nothing close to what I used to be in the past. I used to have unbelievable amounts of energy. The low energy now is probably associated with the fact that I do not eat the quantities I used to eat. I used to eat 3-4 meals a day when I was healthy. Now I eat 2-3 meals a day. With the onset of symptoms (about two years ago) I was eating only 1 meal per day (in the evening).","Doctor":"Hi Bassaml7, Forum ,Considering your abdominal problem,concern that having major illness like cancer though no medical finding or doctor supported it,and having major concern about normal bodily functions with disturbed your routine,work efficiency definitely indicates that you having \\"Mental illness \\" ,most probably hypochondriasis.This can episodic with change of symptoms over periods.Due to certain neurochemical changes this kind of illness occurs,usually diagnosed by doing thorough investigation first to rule out any other illness (which done by you and your doctor assured you that nothing major physical illness you have with certain test result done by you are normal.)This illness can be treatable.So visit to nearest psychiatrist in person who after thorough evaluation and going through your investigation treatment will guide you further.Hope this helps.Best regards."},{"Patient":"i have small testies,they are not capable to make sperms, so what shold i do make them enlargeage 38 height 5.5","Doctor":"Hi, You can't enlarge the size of testes.

Low thyroid level may be a reason behind such symptoms. Thyroid function tests are advised in such cases. Other possibility that may be aggravated by low Vit B12 and thyroid levels is Depression.

Recently I've been having dizzy spells, I feel at times for example I've stopped the car but its still moving, I've been also experiencing pins and needles in my hands on and off and had 1 near faint! I'm wondering what it could be? I hate visiting the dr as I feel a fraud going thank","Doctor":"Hello, and thanks for visiting Healthcare Magic! Two of the symptoms that you describe (the dizziness and the episode of almost fainting) could very likely be caused by the same problem.  The list of things that can cause a near-fainting episode (referred to by doctors as pre-syncope) is long.  Two of the most common are dehydration and arrythmias. Dehydration is caused most frequently either by not drinking enough, or by losing too much water.  This type of loss can occur from diarrhea, profuse sweating (as in exercising in hot weather), or other reasons.  There is no set amount of water that everyone needs on a daily basis.  You should drink when you feel thirsty, or if you notice that your urine is dark in color (it should always either be clear or a very pale yellow color). Arrhythmias occur when the heart does not beat in its normal rhythm.  Some arrythmias are benign, others can be more dangerous, and some can even be life threatening.  One of the first things a doctor will do for any patient that has fainted, or almost fainted, is an EKG.  This allows us to determine if the electrical activity in the heart is abnormal, as would be seen in an arrhythmia. I recommend that you make an appointment with a doctor to be examined for this problem.  The 'pins and needles' in your hands are likely unrelated, and it's difficult to say without asking you a great deal more questions what could be causing this. I hope I have given you some useful information, and wish you the best of health. Sincerely, Dr. Kinney"},{"Patient":"I've had back surgery two times on my L-4,L-5 and S-1 disc fuseing them .

You need to not worry about having to deal with them forever.  You will get better but it will take time.  In the meantime you might need some of the other sedatives which might help get you through the side effects.  I would like you to see your psychiatrist you trust as soon as you can.  I hope this helps. Take care and have a lovely day!"},{"Patient":"So I'm a extreme  anxiety person. and I freak out about things that arnt even possible.

Currently on viibryd 40mg. at supper time & 10mg zolpidem tartrate at bedtime.  She has been experiencing a hallucination of a strong feminine odor usually starting at midday, progressively getting worse toward evening.  Also having severe jaw pain.  With all this she also gets thoughts of hurting herself but says she tries hard to get those thoughts out of her head.  She has had numerous hospital stays because of suicide attempts.  She has had lots of ECT's but doesn't want more of those because of how they affect her memory.  She works part-time.  Has an employer who has been extremely understanding of her very complicated illness.  Currently living with my husband & I cuz she also is raising her 4 yr. old son on her own.  Current psychiatrist is quite unavailable to discuss much with us, just wants to do ECT's and not be bothered.  Frankly, if she & her son did not live with us, I don't know where she would be.  We live on pins & needles, trying to be loving & understanding but we're not perfect & get easily discouraged ourselves.  Continue to hold onto our faith in God's guidance.  What is your comment about this situation???","Doctor":"Hi there ~ I understand that you have some problems and that these disorders are taking a toll on you life.

Erectile dysfunction(ED) in a patient of on treatment for depression could be either part of depression itself or medication induced. If its part of depression itself that is ur ED problem was there before start of treatment and still continued - can be treated by increasing dose of medicine or adding another medicine to this. If its medication induced  that is ur ED problem is newer,developed recently - then it requires gradually lowering dose of ongoing medicine if it permits.If lowering dose will create problem then adding another medicine which counteracts side effect of same i.e. Cyproheptadine,L-methylfolate or adding another antidepressant will help.

Most patients are willing to take medicines once their symptoms are under control and they realize that they need help to control these symptoms. You can discuss with his doctor about the option of increasing the dose of Lithium if you think that his symptoms are not under control. Once he started responding to medicine his doctor can explain to him the sign and symptoms of Bipolar illness. Please feel free to discuss further if you have any other doubt.

Its important to know that when you diagnosed as having depression that means certain neurochemical (serotonin) changes in the brain causing this trouble.When its in initial phase i.e. milder one can be controlled by Yoga,Meditation,Motivating books. But when there is significant change in that neurochemical indicated by disturbed sleep  and affecting your routine then - correction of that pathology first and continuing other method along with this later is only solution. Remember medicine takes 3-4 week time to starts its action and minimum of 6-8 month for permanent improvement when there are less chances of recurrence. Though you start feeling better within month of treatment (Giving false impression that I am all-right and can take care of myself without medicine),that was just a symptomatic one and not due to correction of underlying pathology.So after stopping of it within few month you started having problem again. So please consult to your psychiatrist again and restart appropriate treatment,continue it regularly till advised by him. Hope it helps.

Stress is known to cause hair fall. Rash is very rare as  a symptom of stress except in a case of psychogenic itching and self injury. You should consult skin specialist for the rash and itching and cold soar. You should use stress management techniques for control of stress. stress is known to have some impact in pregnancy also. You can do Relaxation techniques like yoga, meditation or self motivation. If it is not controlled, you should consult psychiatrist. thanks."},{"Patient":"So earlier today while I was minding my own buisness on the computer, this suddern day dream/flash back kinda thing happened. I was sat there and then all I could hear was the scream of a woman who sounded like she was being dragged away, and someone in my face who kept saying It s all going to be okay, I will all be fine, just stay there . This was all I could think about, I was wrapped in this thought that felt like a past experience, when I know nothing like this has ever happened to me before. This boilin hot feeling started happening on the inside of my chest, not painful, just extremely hot, and it kept happening. If I tried to hunk of something else, all I could hear was this screaming that brought me back. I was completely glazed over, i wasn t doing anything at all. And then I just cracked, I curled into a ball on my chair and just started crying, and couldn t stop, it was like I was hiding, I felt just petrified, curled up in a ball. After a few minutes, I got control again, and just put some music on and tried to forget about it, but it has been a shock to my system. I ve had minor panic attacks in the past, but non of them were this bad.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for using health care magic. I have gone through your available history.

Still I would like to tell you that usually Psychiatrist don't label an individual to have some personality disorder in his/her teen years. Personality usually develop at around 18-22 years of age. Yes mood disorder like depressive disorder or bipolar disorder may present in teen years. Abnormal temperament may be a finding only. Still if the problems are causing distress to you and affecting your social and occupational functioning then please visit a Psychiatrist for expert evaluation.

I am addicted.  I am no longer taking narcotics.   BUT I am thinking about seeking a masters degree in education, and I know I suffer from some flavor of ADHD.  are there any non amphetamine or on-addictive drugs to help attention deficit sufferers?","Doctor":"Hello  You are taking on prescription pain killers for pain in neck. You are having symptoms of ADHD and you want to avoid the inattention and hyperactivity. You don't want to take amphetamine or any addicting drug. There are a lot of other drugs for problems of inattention. Atomoxetine is one of them. It is a non addicting and non stimulating medicine and is very useful in ADHD. Apart from this Modafinil can be tried to improve focus and to get rid of problem of inattention. Before starting any drug please visit a good Psychiatrist.

His ataxia, speech & swallowing problems along with a cough have seem to gotten worse in just the past few months. Can he possibly have a remission of these symptoms or are we on the road to more difficult problems. He has alot of drive & a good attitude but the balance problems & fatigue are discouraging. I just don't know what to expect for the future. Does anybody know for sure what course this will take and how soon?","Doctor":"Hello  In your questions you have mentioned OPCD and it is not clear that it is OCD or OCPD. But still from available history I can assume that its OCD. If his problems of cough, swallowing has started occurring again and he is feeling fatigues along with balance problems most likely the symptoms are reoccurring again. OCD is a disease in which there is waxing and waning course. It is characterized by periods of exacerbation. I would advise you to take him to his psychiatrist and get him evaluated. OCD is associated with depression in about50-60% of patients so kindly don't ignore and visit a psychiatrist.

I had panic attack every day for a week  my dr prescribed me a low  doss of Xanax  it has helped with the panic attacks, but sometimes at night my head feels weird like I could have a seizure or something. then last night I was really tired and dose off and woke up because my legs were shaking real bad but when I woke up they quit what do you think this is?","Doctor":"Hello, Many patients also report nocturnal (night) panic attacks and in a few minority, panic attacks occur only at night. It is very much likely that what you experienced at night was also a panic attack. You should discuss with your doctor about taking medicines daily if you are taking it only as and when needed. Also instead of Xanax (Alprazolam) which is a short acting benzodiazepine, you can ask your doctor to prescribe you Clonazepam which is a long acting benzodiazepine and hence can control your symptoms for much longer duration. A  low dose of Clonazepam .25 or .5 mg prescribed by your doctor to be taken  at night should be helpful in my view. Ideally, if you are experiencing multiple panic attacks which are severe in nature, in that case your doctor should consider the option of starting an SSRI antidepressant like Sertraline or Escitalopram for few months at least. SSRI antidepressants are currently the first line medicines for treating anxiety disorders. Kind regards Vikas"},{"Patient":"Is my daughter showing enough symptoms for me to take her to get diagnosed for autism or aspergers syndrome?I don't remember if she had a speech delay nor tantrums but she used to bang her head on the floor if she's upset or didn't get what she wanted (all her siblings did.) but she was smarter than kids her age when she was 3 and was a fast learner and did academically well, sh even speaks another language fluently! but I've noticed that she's socially awkward and i thought that she's just too shy and i have to give her a push to go befriend kids her age, she barely talks with them and she's horrible at small talk and when I ask her 'did you have fun with them?' she shakes her head and tells me she doesn't want tot do that again, ever.she has bizarre interests like Spiders, Spider-man, arachnids or rare unusual stuff like names or Cyprine for example, she told me she like its name and that is a precious stone and she also likes some gruesome and/or gross stuff and a normal interest like art, drawing, photographing, comic books, cartoons.. she can go on and on about color shading, blending, smooth lines, rough lines, thick lines, shapes..etc.things that made me suspicious:she notices car plates and tells me if one had a cool number like 0000 or 9000 or something like that, she notices patterns, details, smells, sounds and spaces out a lot she told me she goes to her 'world' that she made, is it normal? she also plays the same strategy game she played 7 years ago on the internet, she locks herself in her room and just plays it or watch a movie or something. the way she acts is selfish and lazy and she says inappropriate things and when i scold her she knots her brows and say 'but it's fine.. why is it inappropriate?'she also gets angry or scared if someone yells or if there's a lot of loud noises and hates parties. she takes a while to register some things i tell her (like instruction or if i was being sarcastic.) she'd be perplexed then she realizes what i meant and find most jokes 'Not funny.'. also she used to stutter and find it hard to pronounce some words or express herself which often made me mistake her for lying..she's introverted but has a few close friends who share some of her interests. i just want to know, should i get her diagnosed or am i over-thinking?","Doctor":"Hello  You have mentioned that your daughter has symptoms of poor social interaction, she spends her time in playing indoor games, she is intelligent than others in some domains, she can notice unusual number plates and she doesn't like that her routine get disturbed.

I find I am getting muscle cramps and trembling on ocasions. Should I stop taking statins? I see my doctor in a weeks time., another doctor prescibed them for me, i went for a heck up at the hospital and they could not find anything wrong with me.  Blood test and ecg both normal.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic. Myopathy or muscle tenderness is a side effect of Statins.  Compared to Simvastatin the incidence of myopathy is less with Pravastatin.  The symptoms of myalgia present as intense muscle pain and fatigue. You have not mentioned the details of blood test. You should have tested  your serum creatin kinase (CK) and liver enzymes like AST and ALT. Simvastatin increases the serum creatin kinase (CK) levels in case of myopathy. If serum CK values are 10 times higher than the upper normal limit, then the myalgia is attributed  is  to statins. Statins also result in liver damage. although uncommon in the dosage you are taking.  It is better to measure the serum values of ASTand ALT every 3 to six months. You should discontinue Simvastayin  if both CK and liver enzymes are elevated. Otherwise, if only CK is elevated, then you can substitute Pravastatin instead of Simvastatin. I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"I am 26 years old .I am suffering from stomach problem since last 3 years.

I'm not sure what you mean by \\"a few anxieties\\" which he is having difficulty with. However, dopaminergic anti-parkinson's drugs are not advocated in the treatment of schizoaffective disorder since these can cause worsening of the psychotic symptoms. They also have no significant role in the treatment of anxiety symptoms. Schizoaffective disorder is a psychiatric disorder where a person has coexisting and prominent psychotic symptoms as well as mood symptoms. The treatment is usually with anti-psychotics and mood stabilizers.

Bad shakes (tremors) and increase heart rate (palpitation) are symptoms of anxiety. In the start of treatment, symptoms of anxiety can occur off and on as medicines show full effect after 3-4 weeks. Due to that at the start of treatment medicines with immediate effect on anxiety (like temazepam in your case) are given to control anxiety symptoms. If you are taking treatment for long time, then there need to reevaluate your case for poor treatment response, in such case it is better to visit your psychiatrist. Wish you all the best.

She recently diagnosed with Lymph-node TB in UK and is currently under medication. Doctors haven't confirmed TB as the reason for uncontrolled flow of Urine however we will have further tests after TB treatment. I just want to know from experts whether any such cases have been diagnosed with similar symptoms and wanted to take some advice.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for using health care magic. i have gone through your available history. In psychological cause of urinary incontinence, it happens only during stress or occasionally. If she has persistent symptoms, it is advisable to go for urodynamic study to rule out urinary tract pathology. You can consult good urologist for the same. pelvic floor exercises like kegel, can be of some help. I dont think TB lymphnode can be a cause of urinary incontinence. thanks. i hope she will be fine soon"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,              A year ago,when i was swimming with my friends in a well,I got hurt in the right scrotum by hitting in the water(while attempting to dive from some height say 15 to 20m high).It's paining slightly now n then...8 months ago,i consulted a doctor,he told no problem...but still it's continuing the same pain.I have no idea of which doctor to contact n get treatment","Doctor":"Hello, There can be injury and inflammation, doing an ultrasound scrotum will help you diagnose.

Thanks for your query. Anxiety and stress can manifest with not only psychological symptoms but with a variety of physical symptoms. Since his check-up, blood tests and his EKG were normal, I don't think there is anything serious to worry about. Regarding the nose bleed, some people get nose bleeds during cold and nasal congestion. If your boyfriend has been getting such symptoms on and off in the past, then you needn't worry much. But, if this is his first episode and the bleeding was prominent, then it is better to have this problem checked by a doctor. Wish you all the best.

The symptoms of trembling of the hands, rapid beating of the heart, etc. appear to be anxiety-related. You also seem to be having a problem with controlling your emotions and have engaged in self harming behaviour multiple times.

There are good psychological therapies which can help you control your emotions and your dysfunctional thoughts, and teach you better coping and stress-management skills. Sometimes, medication may also be beneficial in such cases. Wish you all the best. Regards, Dr. Jonas Sundarakumar Consultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"Hey, I have problems with my ex.

I have trouble with memories creeping in, and if I m not fond of these memories even if its unwaranted I get the overwhelming urge to shake violently if I m alone. If I m around people they manifest with eye clinching and then rolling them up or to the side until the urge passes. As long as i m engaged in conversation or there is a lot of noise around these urges come maybe once an hour sometimes not for weeks. Everytime I think I m done with them they come back. However one constant is they are always accompanied by a memory of me doing something or saying something, typically very vivid almost as an unwanted day dream. They could be memories from 10 days ago or 10 minutes, and typically are as simple as me saying something to someone and it not coming out the way I wanted, and regardless of the response it got I get that urge to have a pseudo-seizure. My best guess is its psychological in nature and just a stress factor. Possibly, because they happen more frequently when I m alone and it is quiet enough for my mind to drift uninvited, they are just my mind keeping itself awake and getting my body involved by going through pathways that are associated with something other than pleasantries. Maybe its just that the memories were not formed properly and it causes me to remember them differently then I would have liked to which stresses my brain. Anywho I m no doctor so I m interested if anyone could tell me whats going on. I don t want this urge to have a pseudo-seizure to become too strong to control in a place like work. Good to note that the eye clinching did not start happening until recently, probably the last year or so, while the shaking in private has gone on for more than 10 years, so there is a trend that its growing harder to control.","Doctor":"Hello, welcome to Healthcare Magic. Your repetitive movements and thought process appear to compulsive behaviour to decrease anxiety related to obsession. Obsession and compulsion are seen in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Pseudo seizure is not apparent from your history. OCD is a type of anxiety disorder and frequently associated with generalised anxiety disorder. If these disorders are not treated early they can lead to depression because of distress and dysfunction. You may need assessment and treatment with psychiatrist to treat your OCD. It is not clear if you received any treatment in past. As you are having multiple symptoms then combined treatment in form cognitive behaviour therapy and drug therapy will be best in your case. In drug treatment two types of medicine used. For immediate relief of anxiety symptoms benzodiazepines group of medicines are used and for long term relief most commonly SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are used. SSRI takes around 3-4 weeks to show its effect and cognitive behaviour therapy also takes weeks to show its effect. Wish you all the best.

We have her on 30mg of Ritilan and she seems to be coping well with school but her social behaviour seems to be getting worse. She is battling to keep friends and the little girls have even started ganging up against her which is making her behavious worse and she cannot control her outbursts.

It is common and it might become less with time, however it might be a good idea to give her medications and have her be seen in therapy for family sessions so that she learns to listen to parental figures including teachers.  Making friends will be hard for such children and with comorbid ADD it is even harder to find and make friends.  I am hoping that her ADD is adequately treated and it is under control.

It is not advisable to take xanax for long time, because of its high abuse potential. If used for long time and then stopped suddenly it may result in severe withdrawal syndrome of restlessness, anxiety, irritability, seizures etc. As you have mentioned you have no xanax now and you are having tightness of extremities, just starting xanax again will not help you at all. This will land you in mess again. You will become dependent on xanax again. As you mentiond you were also diagnosed with depression and you were on duloxetine. Depression is a mood disorder and is episodic illness. Currently you are off drug. I will advise you to first of all visit a detox center for deaddiction of xanax and then take opinion regarding depression. Taking xanax again will only harm you. thanks Dr. Seikhoo Bishnoi"},{"Patient":"I have been having anxiety attacks followed by palpitations, night sweating, fear, insecurity etc. This happens on certain days, especially 10 days or a week prior my menses.

I get 387.00, and then just 200.00 in food stamps, I have no license & i have no car, And remember i am extremlly sick around 95% of the time and am unable to even leave the house by myself, and as of now i have 3 different doctors i have to see each of them once a month and 1 of them is 4 hrs out of town just to get my monthley meds from eac one every single month, and i live in a small town so there is no local trainspertation here, so i struggle continuesly every single months to find a ride to go to just 2 of places in town to be able to get my meds, that i must have, and the 3rd place i have to go is 4 hrs out of town to make sure i have all the meds i need on a daily basis to keep me healthly as i can be, and not only that, then after all three different appointments which are already spread out through the month, then i have to be able to make sure that i am also able to pick them all up!!!!!

After a while he started to just state out into space not responding to anything. Then he would try to stand up but couldn t. He was on the verge of fainting a few times. He said he hadn t eaten in the days but didn t want eat. He then started dating that he felt that he was gonna die, that he felt it, and those around him were in danger. He kept reaching got his razor blade saying that he had to die and that he was sorry. He then got a phone ca ll and after he hung up and seemed more calm but days he might hurt himself if left alone and he left. What happened?","Doctor":"Hello  He is showing symptoms of anxiety, restlessness, emotional turmoil, crying spells. He is smoking pot for two years. These features are common in some susceptible individuals who smoke pot. Also as you have mentioned that he felt he would die, or he felt that those around him are in danger. He is showing bizarre behaviors. He is also suicidal. These are psychotic features seen with pot or cannabis. If not stopped at this state he may land up in some psychotic disorder. I will advise you to take him to a good psychiatrist for treatment of anxiety. Motivate him to stop taking cannabis. For immediate relaxation medicines like Etizolam, Clonazepam etc can be used in consultation of psychiatrist. thanks Dr. Seikhoo Bishnoi"},{"Patient":"Extreme fatigue , chest tightness, body feeling heavy, dry eyes , unable to concentrate, comeback pain for last 6 years.

Throughout the day I am tired and fatigued. I tend to feel somewhat better with abit more energy after 5PM most days. Prior to bedtime I take 1 .25mg Alprazolam tab and then another half tab of .25mg. Maybe this is why I feel tired and unwell in the mornings? Too much Alprazolam?

That is the reason why we did that. But now she is avoiding me... she don t like my presence, she told me that I am always scolding her, I didn t gave her peace after marriage, I know I am over caring, but she told me that I am doubting on her etc etc. I loved her so deeply.., I can t bear while she is talking with any other boy or if a marriage proposal comes in her home. I feel afraid always by thinking all these things. I am from a middle class family and she is from a rich family, also she is post graduated now I am feared about that she is avoiding me because of all these reasons. sometimes I feel inferior about myself... that I am not suit for her. I have so many family problems and office tensions. Now I got promoted as Project Leader but I can t work properly... I am always gloomy, I just act as a machine in my office. I feel loneliness , she never try to understand me, I know some where in her mind there is a soft corner for me. But she have such a mind that she don t like to express love, love is a thing that we need to kept in mind. But in my point of view love is a beautiful feeling but without expressing love is nothing. I am crying most of my nights by thinking about her. I don t know how to make her happy. I told her that I am going to leave her because I can t bear avoiding. Sometimes I think about suicide but later I think about my family, my mom, dad...I am the elder son in my family and I have my responsibility towards them. I don t know how to manage all these situations. She never tried to understand me. Two days before she told me that she is in her village and will come back after three days. I can t call her while she is in home. But later I realized from our mutual friend that she is in college, and she told me lie that she is in home. I asked her why you lied... her reply makes me hurted more. She don t like my presence and she don t like to hear my voice. so I told her I am leaving her forever. I know that is not possible for me... but some how I managed one day by switching off my phone. But when I switch on my phone I got 6 blank messages from her that makes me writing this. Also I know I can t live without her. I don t know she loves me or not but her words... I can t forget. How can I disturb the person who don t like my presence. I don t know if I did write or wrong. Please suggest me... help me to overcome this situation.","Doctor":"Hello  You have described your problem in detail. The problem is only due to misunderstanding. A lot of cognitive distortions are there which should be corrected. Assumptions should always be avoided in a relationship. You have mentioned that you are caring and over loving. You have also mentioned that you don't like her talking to any of male friends. Just ask your self is it really care and love or something else. She is a different individual and she also need her space. You are intruding in her space and this has resulted in a vicious cycle of doubt and fights. This is the reason she is avoiding you. She is saying that she didn't get peace of mind after marriage. But due to continuous mis trust she has started avoiding you. She just want peace of mind. I will advise you to go to a Counselor for proper counseling. Then request her to come along with you for Couple Therapy for strained relationships. Talk to her about restarting the life. Decide to change yourself. Don't feel inferior work had so that you can win her again. And also don't threaten her with suicidal threats. This will affect only you and no one else will be affected. If you both are ready to continue again then reach to a amicable state by talking to each other. thanks Dr. Seikhoo Bishnoi"},{"Patient":"Hi... I am a 17 yr male, ht. 5'7'' ,wt. 55 kg.

I have cut out wheat, dairy, meat, and a few other foods, and it hasn t helped at all. I had my blood tested for Celiacs and it came back negative.

From the description that you have stated, general fullness of stomach in absence of clear cut physical diagnosis can be related to stress.

I was on holidays on a cruise and got sick on the last day of the cruise with possible food poisoning . My husband and son did not get sick. I had extreme nausea , diahhrea. Once I got home the nausea did not stop in fact it got worse and worse. This started in January 16th 2013... Then I got pain in tummy as well and ended up in hospital 3 times. I have lost 6 kilos and started getting anxiety as they said blood work was fine. I finally had an endoscopy and it showed mild gastritis and small hernia . I always vomit in morning and nothing comes out.lack of appetite. I feel sick and sore in tummy every day. What I also started noticing is that I am getting so tired it is hard to function and last couple of weeks I ve been crying all the time and feel like I have fallen into depression . I feel so exhausted , and emotionally empty even towards my family who I love so much I feel so empty with everything. I m on ppi and painkillers when needed but wanted to ask you why or how could I get depression all of a sudden and it all started from this gastritis 8 weeks ago as before then I was soooo happy. I m scared that I won t be the happy me again and feel joy again. It s very frightening . Lucky for me my husband supports me and tells me its not be but my body .. I still feel sick every day some days worse than others. I m getting more blood tests and stool tests done as well. Your help would be appreciated . Thankyou. I m 37 years old","Doctor":"Hi Carmen, Sorry to hear that you are very depressed and going through this phase , but , lucky for you, you have got a very supportive husband. Even though there is no clinical correlation between gastritis and depression, I have seen a couple of patients where the disease starts with gastritis and they end up feeling depressed despite being on proton pump inhibitors. You will feel better once you take active steps to come out of this situation. Continue your medications as per your doctor's advise and try to do the following: 1. Sign up for yoga classes , if you have a good instructor in your area. Yoga and relaxation techniques are of great benefit to cure anxiety and depression. 2. Regular exercise 30 minutes a day for 5 days a week. 3. Listen to music, Read good books... like Robin Sharma's \\" who will cry when you die\\" simple book but it will make you fall in love with your life. 4. Eat healthy food. Keep a food diary. Avoid foods that seem to worsen your symptoms. Avoid spicy and oily foods. Have you been tested for H. pylori infection?

I started masturbating at the age of 15 and now whenever I see a girl my semen just comes out within seconds. I have worse condition of PE. Please suggest whet shall I do to get rid of these conditions. Thanks","Doctor":"Hello  Your sugar levels are in normal range, there is nothing to worry. You have mentioned your hands and feet are cold most of the time. You are feeling low. Tremors are also present. First of all just to reassure you, Masturbation is a healthy practice. It has nothing to do with your symptomatology. Every adult male or female after attaining puberty masturbate. So it has nothing to do with your depressive symptoms. But continuous thinking about masturbation and beliefs about its effects are producing stress in you. It has increased the anxiety in you. Due to this you are feeling low and you are having tremors. You have mentioned that on seeing girls your semen just comes out. It is most likely not semen, it may be precum, which is lubricating fluid secreted on getting erection. I will advise you to divert your attention by reading good books, exercise daily, practice yoga daily. If problem increases visit a Psychiatrist for episodic control of anxiety. Medicines like Fluoxetine Paroxetine will not only cover depression, but will also help to delay ejeculation. Thanks Dr. Seikhoo Bishnoi"},{"Patient":"My mother past away February 10th.

She shot herself in last month and your father has witnessed it. It was a married life of 34 years. So its natural to have such of grief reaction. Grief reaction like low mood, crying spells, not accepting incident, de realization etc is considered as normal to some extent. But you have mentioned that he replays the incident in his head, he is loosing his mind. This is not normal. Try to talk with him and explore if there is any suicidal intention. Closely watch him and give warm supportive care. It has been about 40 days of your mothers death so such levels of grief are not acceptable. He may develop Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I advise you to take him to a Psychiatrist ASAP for immediate control of his symptoms. You have mentioned that you are also feeling low to some extent.

I have been to the Northwestern Clinic/ Hospital since age 2 y.o.s. Frankly, I m tired of being a human tutorial. My problem now is that I can t find a doctor who has even heard of Sticklers, therefore they choose to start all over again with medical treatment. Not one doctor has contacted my two latest geneticist or opthamologist, all of thise doctors could easily explain Stickler Sydrome and the treatments that work. The doctors in question whom a I ve seen have been Medical Director of NIH, Harvard, Duke and other such institutions.

Ideas like your chest is going to burst if you wouldn't do things in a particular way. This is called magical thinking. You have also sleep pattern in 30 to 90 minutes pattern. Also you are having costochondritis for 2 years. From available information I can say that most likely these symptoms are due to OCD. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is a anxiety disorder. It is characterized by obsessions and compulsions. Obsessions are intrusive ideas or thoughts which dominate the mind, individual tries to get rid of them but is not able to do so. These are invariably distressing and although the individual is aware of that these are purposeless still he can't control them. Compulsions are behaviors which are done in response to obsession to get rid of anxiety. In your case thinking that chest is going to burst is obsession and doing things in particular way is compulsion. These cause severe anxiety in individuals. I will advise you to visit a good Psychiatrist for expert opinion. Medicines like SSRI as Fluoxetine, Fluvoxamine, Paroxetine, Sertaline etc. are used in higher doses for OCD. Other medicines as Clomipramine are also used in OCD. Behavior therapy like exposure and response prevention is other modality of treatment.

Cymbalata is duloxetine and is used in depression, anxiety and fibromyalgia etc. When ever any drug like duloxetine is started a rebound increase in anxiety occurs along with irritability. But these side effects go after 1-2 weeks. Your complaints like paranoid, irritability etc. may occur with asenapine as during initial phase of therapy with antipsychotic drug, subjective and objective restlessness, irritability occur, which is also called akathesia. Although this type of side effect is common with typical older antipsychotic drugs and newer drugs are devoid of such type of side effects. Still there is a risk and we can assume that the symptoms are due to asenapine. I advise you to visit your psychiatrist and take opinion regarding the problem. Proper dose adjustments will help.

I am gaining weight significantly and also previously I had no pschiznphrenic episode off late I started experiencing hearing sounds and severe stress on mind. Does Sizodon causes all these side effects? Is sizodon a right treatment for me","Doctor":"Hi there, thanks for asking. Sizodone can help for decreasing the sounds you are hearing sometimes. You are true about the side effect since it changes the metabolism and causes weight gain. The best way to deal with this issue is to have more physical activity. You may also change your diet a little. The dose that you mentioned is very low, however and has the minimal side effect. You can ask your doctor to add some medication which does not change your weight, like the medications from the class of new antiepileptics. Then your mood will be better under control. wish you the best health."},{"Patient":"i am 38 year old man and oflately maybe from last 6 months having erection problem during intercourse. i am masturbsting 2 to 3 times a day, but excitment doent last long during intercourse and not able to have proper sex please suggest some treatment or whom should i consult in pune or any test needs to be done.","Doctor":"Hello, As per your history, it may be due to performance anxiety.

After doing this ,you have to undergo evaluation by a psychiatrist for ascertaining the diagnosis and finding out other coexisting psychological problems.Most anxiety disorders are easily treated by medications,a form of non drug treatment called cognitive behavior therapy(CBT) or a combination of both. In CBT  treatment ,you are given extensive education about the physiology of anxiety and relaxation training to get control over your anxiety .In a deep relaxation state you are trained to artificially induce panic attacks by active visualisation and imagination techniques and you do it regularly,first under supervision and then independently everyday at home.Gradually you get control over your panic attacks and the frequency and duration of panic attacks diminishes.The sessions continue until you can no longer invite panic attacks finally realising that these attacks are harmless.But if you have other psychiatric problems like depression, medications are likely to give better results."},{"Patient":"sir,i had anxiety problem a few years ago...doctor gave me a medicine(i dont remember its name)...i took it for few months and my prob was solved...1 month before i was suffering from body disorder and remained upset with myself always...doctor prescribed me rexipra 10..i am having it for past 1 month and i feel i am perfectly fine...then why it is said that rexipra has side effects..... AGE:-20....WEIGHT:-50KG....HT:-5 8","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. Rexipra is Escitalopram - an SSRI anti-depressant. Now, SSRI anti-depressants are the most commonly used medication in the treatment of a variety of anxiety and depressive disorders. They are relatively safe, but like every other medication can have side effects. Now, just because a medicaine has a list of potential side effects, it does not mean that every one will develop them. Usually only a minority of the people develop any significant side effects. So, in your case, if you don't have any side effects and if your symptoms are well controlled with Rexipra, I would advise you to continue the medication for as long as your doctor advises you.

I am on iron tablets and Vit D .... still struggle with tiredness and depressive tendencies .... ?","Doctor":"Hello, welcome to Healthcare Magic. It is difficult to comment about cause of hair loss and eye irritation in your case. But one thing is clear from your description that your weight is very less. Malnutrition can lead to hair loss, dry eyes and depressive symptoms. In your case, it is better to get investigated for low weight. Same time start healthy diet and weight monitoring.

I have been getting cold sores since I was a baby, and I am now 32 years old. My cold sores have suddenly increased in frequency during the past year or so from about 4 times a year to being chronic. They are no longer isolated to only my lip, sometimes appearing under a nostril . I originally got them only on one side of my lip. Now I get them on both sides, occasionally the bottom lip as well, and may experience several outbreaks recurrently. When one has nearly healed, if under great stress or if I have a cold, another will start to appear in its place. I am wondering which type of specialist to consult about taking an oral tablet/capsule for the first time, since creams alone are not sufficient or practical in this case. I have hashimoto s disease and bipolar disorder , and take medications for both, so I don t know if I can see my endocrinologist whose practice also deals with immunology in order to address this.","Doctor":"Hello, welcome to Healthcare Magic. As you are having recurrent cold sore, then there is need to find cause of frequent recurrence. Cold sore outbreaks may be influenced by stress, sunlight, sunburn, fever, dehydration, or local skin trauma. You already have bipolar disorder which increases stress in life. So, control your thyroid condition and bipolar disorder under control to prevent frequent recurrence of cold sores. For medical treatment of cold sore, you can visit dermatologist (skin specialist) Wish you all the best.

Thanks for your query. There can be a variety of causes for having a sensation of pins and needles on your legs. There can be medical causes like peripheral neuropathy or psychological causes like anxiety / stress. Since you have had an evaluation by a neurologist, it is unlikely that your symptoms are due to any neurological or medical cause. Such sensations and pains are commonly seen in anxuety disorders. It is important to understand that anxiety can manifest with not only psychological symptoms, but with a variety of physical symptoms also.

This is a condition where there is no underlying meical cause for the pain, but rather the cause is psychological. When a person is unable to cope with an emotional stress or conflict, sometimes the emotional distress gets manifested as a physical symptom. It is good that you are able to realize that your symptoms occur only whenever you get emotionally hurt. I would advise you to see a psychiatrist for a detailed evaluation and further treatment (which will mostly be in the form of counselling). I would also suggest that you try relaxation exercises like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, etc. Wish you all the best.

This will include a detailed history (from the patient and other informanta) and a proper psychological assessment. There are certain mental illnesses where medication is necessary.

There acould be a few possibilities for the electric shock-like sensations which you are experiencing: 1) Anxiety-related: anxiety can manifest with a variety of physical symptoms and such strange sensations are fairly commonly reported. 2) Due to the withdrawal effects of meth. 3) Due to some other medical problem - like a peripheral neuropathy. These sensations are not fatal, but it would be a good idea to see a doctor to have an evaluation, to find out the likely cause.

As if a mass apocalypse would suit me better than the world we live in. I feel superior to most everyone i meet. When i meet someone i can look at as being better than me, I instantly loathe them for it. I almost seem to be completely devoid of emotion, save for anger and resentment. I guess i feel emotion, i just dont feel im processing it properly, for example I ve gotten fairly good at replicating emotions such as love and happiness and remorse, by mimicing what I ve seen in others/media, I ve gotten so good at this I m having a hard time differentiating between the real and the feigned emotions. I seem to be completely incapable of letting go I ll hold a grudge indefinately. I crave the attention and praise of others.

Thanks for your query.I understand that you are going through a difficult time due to your multiple problems. Your symptoms like inability to experience emotions properly, problems in relating to other people, etc. can be due to various psychological causes - such as mood disorders, personality disorders, past psychological trauma, etc. A comprehensive history and a detailed psychological assessment is needed to estabish a likely cause.Since your problems are quite complex and you do seem to be a lot of distress, I would advise you consult a psychiatrist for a detailed evaluation and further management.

I am afraid of the consequences of entering into formal psychiatric care on the basis of one negative episode after what has been an intensely difficult year (2 close family bereavements, a relationship break-up, change of job and the achievement of a new academic qualification). I am and always have been interested in and aware of my own emotional health and have never been afraid to confront any problems or issues in my life. I am currently attending a counsellor who has given me tools and resources to assist me in maintaining good mental and emotional health, but because I am attending a counsellor and not a psychiatrist , my family think I am trying to avoid my issues and want me to have a psychiatric assessment.

Thanks for your query. Stress and anxiety can often have physical effects and manifestations. Hyperacidity and stomach ulcers are often triggerred by excessive stress / anxiety. So, it is likely that the burning and pain in your stomach is due to your stress. Even though Ensure plus is a safe nutritional supplement, still taking too much of it would not be a good idea. Sometimes, if taken in excess, the flavouring agents, vitamin C, iron, etc. can cause gastric irritation also.

So increase in dose from 15 to 30 resulted in paradoxical insomnia. Kindly visit your psychiatrist and ask for addition of some hypnotic like Benzodiazepine as clonazepam, or zolpidem for some time.

I have been to a doctor one time for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and was prescribed an SSRI that lessened the compulsions and tics, but caused me to have anxiety attacks . I stopped the medication and never went back. The problem now is that along with the tics and the Obsessive- Compulsive behavior , suddenly my head has occasionally been involuntarily jerking to the right so hard that it causes severe nerve pain in the left side of my neck that goes away after a few minutes. The pain is so intense at first that it causes me to cry out. The other tics are nearly constant, and occur more frequently with any kind of stress . They are rhythmic drawing of the letter x on each of my fingers with my thumbnail, flexing of the muscles in the back of my thighs in a specific order, and blinking. Those I can live with, but the sudden, violent head-jerking is causing me some concern (not to mention it is VERY painful). Could all these tics be associated with OCD or is there a possibility that they are caused by some other condition? Thank you so much for your help.","Doctor":"Hello amweeks1202 Welcome to Health Care Magic The tics like sudden blinking of eyes, flexing the muscles of thigh, drawing letter x on fingers etc. are associated with OCD. In most of cases of tic disorder symptoms of OCD are found. The sudden jerking of head to a particular side is also a part of OCD and tic disorder. SSRI medicines like fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine etc. are very good medicines for OCD as well as tics. OCD is a disorder of anxiety disorder spectrum. Any SSRI medicine when taken, during initial phase of therapy causes rebound increase in anxiety and this is the only reason you stopped to take medicines. The anxiety usually last for few days only. Over all the SSRI are very good medicine and are effective in OCD as well as Tic Disorder. So don't afraid of anxiety, visit your psychiatrist again and start medicines again for proper relief. thanks take care Dr. Seikhoo Bishnoi"},{"Patient":"I got 6 or 7 atacks of uncounsiousness on early mornign near about 6 to 8 am only, while i wake up my hands and legs nurve are stichhing and i feel tiered.

Please help me and advice me what i have to do ?","Doctor":"Hello sandeep Welcome to Health Care Magic The sudden onset attacks of unconsciousness especially in morning are alarming. They may occur due to following possible reasons- One thing is hypertension, kindly get your Blood Pressure checked as due to postural hypotension in a hypertensive person sudden fall may occur. But it doesn't occur repetitively. Other possibility is Seizure Disorder. In epilepsy or seizure multiple loss of unconsciousness may be observed even without typical movements of extremities. In most of cases cause can not be established and MR scans and EEG come normal. Start of Anti Epileptic Drug is advised like Valporate sodium, carbamazepine, phenatoin etc. These are to be taken for long time  (usually at least 3 years as per guidelines). You were on valporate chrono 300 twice a day and you are now taking 300 per day. Valporate in a lot of people during initial phases of therapy may cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness as side effects. Due to this appetite ultimately decreases. But decreasing dose against the advise of doctor is not advised. The problems of lack of understanding, confusion, memory loss etc don't occur with valporate at 300 per day. It is therwise safe drug. So as per my opinion kindly visit a good Psychiatrist and take advise on epilepsy and the clinical symptoms you are having, don't stop medication abruptly against advise.

My question is whats going on and is this something that requires medical attention being its occured more than once?","Doctor":"Hello kriscarlo Welcome to Health Care Magic Anger outburst followed by sudden fall, flaccidity in body etc. are the symptoms that should not be overlooked. As the episode occurred about years back so there is no need to visit a doctor for that but if such symptoms occur again I advise you to visit a doctor and get your EEG done and to take expert opinion. Such episode may be due to excessive stimulation of sympathetic system during anger and sudden hypotension leading to fall. Or it may be a sign of seizure disorder as sudden fall, passed out, limping of body etc are symptoms of seizure disorder.

My friends think that i m bipolar, i don t think i am. Thank you for reading","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. Having alternating periods of \\"mania\\" and \\"depression\\" can be indicative of a Bipolar disorder. However, there can also be other possible psychological causes for such mood fluctuations, like certain types of personality disorders, etc. A detailed history and psychological assessment is required to make a definitive diagnosis. ince your problems seem to be causing you a lot of distress, I would suggest that you have a detailed evaluation by a psychiatrist, so that appropriate treatment can be initiated.

I am kind of good in social situations, but when meeting new people, and i think highly of them as in if they are high status people, i either avoid the situation or become really nervous when speaking.

I love meeting new people and such, and at night time when i go out to party, i dont get this problem. but in school, (im 16 years old), i cant socialize and talk to new people because my nerves get the best of me.

The problem which you have described is indicative of social anxiety. Though you have mentioned that you are able to meet people and socialze, there seem to be certain specific social situations where you become anxious and nervous. The best way to deal with this problem (other than going for therapy) is  not to avoid such unpleasant social situations and to slowly keep exposing yourself to them in a graded manner. You can also learn and master relaxation techniques, so that when exposing yourself to such situations, you can readily deploy them whenever you become nervous. As you keep practicing this, with every step forward you will be able to gain more confidence and overcome your nervousness soon. Wish you all the best.

Thanks for your query. The \\"silly\\" thoughts which you have described are termed as \\"magical thinking\\" and is often seen in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The other irrational thoughts relating to symmetry are also likely to be obsessions. However, a detailed history and a psychological assessment is required to make a definitive diagnosis of OCD. Hence, I would advise you to consult a psychiatrist for a detailed evaluation. If this diagnosis is confirmed, then there are effective treatment options in the form of medication and psychological therapies, which can help you overcome these unecessary thoughts.

The last panic attack was the worst I have had, my face, chest , legs and arms got numb. I could not breath and afterwards its usually my lips the only thing getting swollen, but this time my eyelids and my lips got swollen and they are taking a long time to go down. I am just concerned because I am scared that I have some kind of anxiety disorder and not even know it. What should I do and am I over reacting?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. It is common to have a lot of strange sensations in the body during a panic attack. Numbness of the hands and legs, difficulty in breathing and chest discomfort are well known physical sympoms of anxiety. However, swelling of the lips and eyelids, which is persistent, is very atypical and not a symptom of panic attacks. So, I suggest that you have it checked with your doctor, to rule out any medical problems which could be causing this. Wish you all the best.

They are usually brought on when she has all focus on her. Could it be the Levlen she was a happy go lucky girl full of confidence now she s a mess and living in fear of having another panic attack.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. Levlen is a hormonal pill and it is possible to have side effects such as mood swings or anxiety symptoms as a result of the medication. However, it is unsusal to have full blown panic attacks solely due to the medication. It is possible that the anxiety / panic attacks could be an independent psychological problem also, such as an anxiety disorder. You have also mentioned that these symptoms are more when she has a lot of attention on her, which could again point to an independent psychological cause. I would advise you to take her to a psychiatrist for a detailed evaluation and further treatment. Wish you all the best.

I am not depressed, and am perfectly content as long as my routine or daydreaming isn t disturbed. It seems like I m always daydreaming or deep in thought or having hypothetical conversations-brilliant, life-changing things that I believe would dumbfound people if I could communicate the same way in person. It s like I ve forgotten how to socialize. I ve always been shy, but still socially adept and somewhat extroverted after warming up to people. Now I feel resentment toward my own mother when she interrupts my solitude. I even suspect she may do things on purpose like that because she likes to see me uncomfortable. This is the only situation that makes me cry. Otherwise people say I look blank, and I don t feel very strong emotions other than satisfaction or paranoia . I find myself talking to my reflection, saying she s evil! (about my mother) after she sabotages my peace. Sudden noises and movement make me jump and get anxious also, even if I expect it. If there s even the slightest sound in the house when I m alone I check to see if anyone s there or trying to come in. I also call out Who s there? when I know my mom s at work. But I m nervous she snuck in somehow. I feel like I m anticipating abuse, but she doesn t abuse me. Somehow I get into the moments in which I don t trust her anyway. Same with friends. I think they re all coming together to gang up on me and make me feel like a fool because they secretly all get together to deceive me. This isn t all the time, but it s a lot of the time. It used to really bother me, but one day I just stopped caring about friendships. I am the happiest, most peaceful, most creative, least bored I ve ever been when I m 100% alone. Whenever I have to talk to someone it makes me feel like I m running out of time for something important. Everything feels rushed. I cut them off a lot. I can t really under stand them, so it s a waste. If my mom isn t extremely concise I just zone out and can t process any of what she s saying. Most of what she tells me, and some of my own thoughts, I forget. This happens a lot mid-sentence for me. She complains because it takes me so long to answer a question. I can t help it. I ve developed a slight stutter too. I don t know what s happening to me. I ve been paranoid since high school, but the fear of people, noise anxiety , aggression and absent-mindedness is very recent. I m unsure of what to do, but my mom is getting sick of my behavior. She thinks I can simply choose to be social and not freak out at everything. Why would I choose this? I can t be around people. I just can t. Most of this started happening after I had to withdraw from college and move in with my mom. I swear I m not depressed though. In fact, when every once in a while I have 30-minute fits of mild hypomania or childlike giggly-ness where I sometimes feel less intelligent and kind of in a trance, but very happy. I don t have long periods of true mania or hypomania though. My moods are generally quiet.","Doctor":"Hello Madraniandabird  Having suspiciousness, social withdrawal, magical thinking, fear, increased aggression and restlessness may be a sign of severe problem.

Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder that is characterized by various clinical symptoms like delusions of prosecutory type, hallucinations like auditory, suspiciousness, social withdrawal, severe social and occupational dysfunction etc. So as you are having a lot of such clinical features please discuss with your mother regarding the problem and visit a psychiatrist for expert opinion ASAP. hope I cleared your doubt.

Thanks for your query. This brief description of your brother's problem is insufficient to make a definitive diagnosis. You have only mentioned some anxiety symptoms but his previous diagnosis and treatment seem to be corresponding to a psychotic disorder. The medication which he has been prescribed is also a combination of an anti-psychotic (sizodon) and an anti-depressant (serta). So, I would advise you to discuss and clarify his diagnosis with his psychiatrist. Most psychiatric disorders, especially, psychotic disorders require regular and long term treatment. Often it is only possible to control the illness and not cure it altogether. So, please advise him to take medication regularly and go for periodic follow-ups. Wish you all the best.

But the loss of consciousness is not there. If loss of consciousness is there we can think of some seizure disorder. Due to hormonal change in a menstural cycle, seizure may get precipitated and mere loss of consciousness may be only presenting feature. As you are on Oxcarbamazepine and Clobazam, these both are newer safer drugs for seizures with almost nil side effects. Your MR scan and EEG are normal, because in most of the cases the seizures are idiopathic in origin with no cause found on investigations. But as per my opinion at least pay one visit to a psychiatrist to rule out PMDD.

This thing is occurring in out of proportion. It is also called Social Phobia or Phobic Disorder. Individuals with social phobia usually have problem in facing public, in presenting seminars, in asking question in class or in group discussion, in expressing themselves to any person of higher status, some times they face difficulty in talking to female colleagues also. They can't face new people. In any of situation shakiness, restlessness, palpitations, sweating, dryness of throat are seen. But treatment is available for this problem, both psychological and medicinal treatment are available. Combination of these is best for early recovery. - Psychological management includes, Relaxation exercises, breathing exercises, yoga, meditation, assertiveness training. Try to practice the presentation at home alone again and again, then gradually present in front of some close friend, increase the level by presenting in front of small group. Make small goals in small steps and gradually proceed. - Medicines like Benzodiazepines like clonazepam can be taken in low doses for episodic control of anxiety. Some medicines like Propranolol are very effective in social phobia, they are taken just 1 hour before any presentation and help to diminish the signs of anxiety. Before starting any medicine kindly consult a good Psychiatrist.

I understand that you have been going through a very difficult time since childhood - with your depression, suicidal attempts, drinking problems, other negative life events, etc. Since you have had a miscarriage and have irregular and painful menstrual cycles, it is important that you have a proper gynecological evaluation done. There can be a variety of causes for miscarriage and it is necessary to find out the probable cause, so that adequate preventive measures can be taken for your future pregnancies.

Although smoking pot don't cause physical dependence but still a lot of withdrawal symptoms are seen for long time, like easy fatiguability, stress, low mood, irritability, change in sleep pattern, crying spells etc. So best thing to avoid these symptoms is you can take OTC non opioid analgesic drugs like Ibuprofen for muscle fatigue. Have tea or coffee at least 2-3 times a day. The symptoms will go in some time. But the main problem is that you have become dependent on Xanex. Try to quit this drug also, as although it is a good anti anxiety drug still it has very high abuse potential. Best you can try is to taper the drug slowly over a month.

Thanks for your query. I understand that you are going through a difficult time due to your multiple psychiatric problems. The medication which you have been started on recently is a combination of an SSRI anti-depressant (Lexapro) and anti-anxiety medication (Xanax). It is important to take the medication as advised by your doctor striclty and not make your own treatment decisions. (By the way, Lexapro does not work on dopamine - now, this is why it is important to follow the advise of qualified specialists, rather than make such wrong assumptions and try to make your own decisions) SSRI anti-depressants like Lexapro may take about 2 weeks to bring about their beneficial effect and so, you will have to wait for some more time till you see significant improvement. Wish you all the best.

This would not affect fertility in IVF because they would not affect the sperm count itself. Decreased organisms and erectile dysfunction can also occur with the other medication but again this would not impact on your chances of fertility with IVF. If you were attempting to conceive without IVF , these side effects would impact on your chances of fertility. It would be important to consider whether your husband is psychologically ready since he is now being treated for anxiety and stress. He may need some time to sort out any present issues. I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I ve been to the hospital twice in the past three days and all ecg s have shown an inverted t-wave...None of the doctors seem to be concerned (Although family doctor didn t even mention the inverted wave) and said the test was perfect. All doctors didnt seem to be too concerned??? I am a 30 year old female, dont smoke or drink heavily. 140 lbs 5 7 so I would say healthy weight. I ve been having horrible panic attacks the past few days which I what brought me there in the first place... I have been reading that they could be a sign on an upcoming heart attack which is making me panic further....Anyone have any thoughts on this? All my blood results eg, cardiac enzymes were all normal... Also, 4 months ago I received radioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism so should be going hypo by now, could this affect the results? Now I feel like my life is ending at 30 :( I can t fathom leaving my baby girl!","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. Non-specific T wave changes do not indicate a cardiac abnormality and you need not worry about this. You have mentioned that you have had multiple ECG, cardiac enzymes and evaluations by multiple doctors - who have all told you that you don't have a heart problem. Having treatment for hyperthyroidsm doesn't mean that you would become hypo-thyroid and so, this is unlikely to be affecting your results. I think that these excessive worries and fear of dying are due to your anxiety problem. Since your symptoms seem to be quite prominent and causing you this much of distress, I would advise you to seek professional help. Please see a psychiatrist for a detailed assessment and further treatment. Wish you all the best. Regards, Dr. Jonas Sundarakumar Consultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"I am a 61 yr old Male. I was admitted to hospital for myoclonus , chorea and ataxia . drs pointed it to chronic b12 deficiency & I was treated accordingly with Inj. Vitcofol (7 injections alternate days) and following that Inj. Optineuron (3 injections alternate days). I also had Vit D deficiency. Was given Vit D3 60,000 IU a chewable tab once a week for 4 weeks. I was also prescribed Lonazep 0.5 for anxiety and my sleep disorder . It dint help much, so dr asked to add Stressnil 0.5 mg in addition to that. I was given a drug called Haloperidol when my dr was treating me for chorea, but it led to difficulty in swallowing ( dysphagia ) due to the effect of which I lost my ability to even swallow my own saliva for over 3.5 days and gradually my swallow reflex has returned back. Every day they gave me phenergan and in 3.5 days i felt better.Today I felt a mild numbness in my left thumb and my dr has asked me to stop Lonazep 0.5 and instead take Tab Stalopam 10 mg once daily at 8 pm. My question is : Is this a safe tablet ? In addition to the mentioned medications, I also take Telmikind 40 mg for bp, Ecospirin 75 mg (as my brain MRI showed small vessel ischemia Grade-I) , Tonact ( Atorvastatin ) 10 mg & Dutas-T for my BPH (prostate) problem. I am very apprehensive about starting Stalopam. Why is the new tab prescribed & would I suffer any side effect because of this new tab ?","Doctor":"Hello mr.vaithi  Chorea, ataxia and myoclonus may occur in severe vitamin-B12 deficiency. Haloperidol is given to treat these symptoms. In a number of persons who are started on haloperidol, Dystonia of muscles observed, dystonia of muscles of throat caused Dysphagia in you. So haloperidol was stopped. As you are on heavy dose of vitamin supplements. Clonazepam or Lonazep is given for episodic relief in anxiety, but there is risk of dependence. Stalopam or escitalopram is added to your prescription for relief of anxiety associated with your illness. It is a safe drug and there are no significant side effects reported with this drug, start with low doses and increase gradually over 1 week.

I understand that you are going through a difficult time due to your anxiety and insomnia. There are a lot of other sedative medications available.

Since you say that these problems such as short-temper, mood swings and difficulty in handling stress have been long-standing, it is likely that these may be part of his personality.

Thanks for your query. To answer your question directly, no panic attack \\"physically kills\\" an individual. No anxiety disorder, including panic attacks, requires a \\"defibrillator\\" to bring back the patient to life. The facts which you have mentioned that \\"her heart stops\\" and that she becomes \\"legally dead\\" are totally inconsistent with a panic attack. However, you mention that she has had tests and has been told by the doctors to have \\"severe panic attacks\\". It is not possible for me to give you an exact diagnosis without a detailed history and a proper evaluation / psychological assessment of the patient.

Sometimes, even though there is nothing in my mind, I feel there is like a wall that keeps me from focusing studying. I was diagnosed with ADD last year. I also was diagnosed with depression and anxiety . I started by taking Adderall , Klonopin , and a medication for anxiety that causes sleepiness. I felt much better, and I could concntrate easily at that time. However, I started sleeping 14 hours a day, so my psychiatrist stopped both Adderall and decreased the dosage ofthe other medication that I don t know its name. She then gave me Concerta and abilify in addition to Klonopin. I felt as good as I was, and could easily concentrate. However, the same problem with sleeping came again. At that time, she stopped the medication that I don t remember its name and Concerta. She gave me wellbutrin and strattera . She gave me a low dose of strattera, and was planning to increase it later. After a month, I moved to a new city, and I told my psychiatrist that since I started using strattera, I didn t feel any improvement, so she stopped it. Since that time, about six month ago, my new psychiatrist has changed the dosage of each medication except wellbutrin. She said that I might not have ADD, but anxiety and depression are causing it, so she haven t gave me any ADD medication. She also says that medications conflict with each other. My concentration has not improved since that time, and sometimes, it decreased. I actually think that what I have is ADD and it makes me worried becuase I cannot study. I feel like I don t have anxiety or depression. How can I know if I have ADD or not? Do I need to find a new psychiatrist ? since my current psychiatrist has not helped me for 6 months.

Usually in simple terms it is said that child with ADD is said to be on foot only, he can't sit still and usually can't wait for turn. But as you have mentioned that you were able to study even continuously for 5 hrs, and you are complaining of inattention so as per my opinion we can think of other possibility as- - as inattention may be a manifestation of depression, in depression individual fails to focus on one thing and usually have other features like decreased interest, energy and low mood. - as a part of anxiety disorder, in severe anxiety states there may be inattention. so try to consult with doctor about these possibility also.

Means, by medicine we can treat it but can not ensure cure . So even after treatment there are always chances of recurrence. I hope I have answered all your query. For any further assistance you can ask again Thanks"},{"Patient":"Whenever I get too nervous I start to get shaky, physically as well as my voice, and my eyes start to tear up.

You should learn to love yourself, life is  a gift to you given by God, you should honour God and take much care of yourself. Anyone may treat you in their way, reject you. But you should never neglect or deject yourself. 3. Learn to highlight your qualities, skills, good nature and enjoy life. 4.

Often multiple sessions and history from different caregivers is necessary. Many of your child's symptoms could be indicative of a childhood obsessive compulsive disorder. But like I said before this can be confirmed only after a detailed history and psychological assessment. If this is the diagnosis, then she may need to be started on medication.I think her psychiatrist is doing the right thing by assessing her properly before making any decisions regarding starting medication.

The BP meds susoxone and Muscle relaxer is everyday no if ands or buts. I recently (last 2 weeks or so) began using Adderall recreationally but turned daily quick. within days. I feel addiction in my mind as the night sweats/anxiety/and sleep probs began last night (my sayed I had an attitude from day 1). I took 4 mg of buprenorphine (Suboxone), 4mg tizanadine and 600mg of ibuprophen and one of my wifes .5 mg klonopin and seemed to be comfortable but awake with thoughts. Then this morning I took some addy and I was on my way. Im scared as I have an addiction to begin with and have just in the last hour flushed the remaining adderall I have which was 6- 30mg XR which i was taking by opening the capsules and swallowing the beads. I nevertook more than 50 mg a day though. Should I expect bad DT s. Im sure nothing like opiates but should I expect hell? I honestly think Im over worrying but I dont like the feeling.

I can do the mental as long as I know Im not so far gone and the physical part will me manageable with what I have. Tahnks. Please do not judge me. Just honest advise or nothing at all. God Bless","Doctor":"Hello ceedubbya27  It seems that your are very anxious due to your problem. You want to quit the drug but there is a lot of anticipatory anxiety and beliefs associated with drug in you. As you have motivation to quit so it will be very easy to quit. In suboxone, buprenorphin and naloxone are in fixed drug form. I am not clear whether you are taking suboxone or buprenorphin plain. As in suboxone naloxone which is a anti drug so it counteracts pleasure effects of buprenorphin so its not so pleasurable. But buprenorphin alone is pleasurable and addicting so you have to quit it. Yes there is chance of withdrawal syndrome but serious Delirium Tremens will not occur. Quitting buprenorphin is easy if done with proper replacement like with naloxone combination and methadone replacement, and then gradual tapering so consult a good psychiatrist and take expert opinion. Secondly adderall is a stimulant drug which is highly addicting, it produces pleasurable effects but abuse potential is very high, but there is very minimal risk of withdrawal best you will suffer is flu like syndrome. So pal try to quit and you will improve, it will be very beneficial to you for management of Mitral Stenosis also. Thanks Hope I cleared your doubt.

It is one of disorders that is very difficult to treat but treatment options are available and treatment is also successful. Both medicinal and non-medicinal (psychological) treatment are available, and combination of two results in best outcome Medical treatment is based on use of SSRI medicines (Fluoxetine, Paroxetine etc.) or Clomipramine. These drugs are used in higher doses for OCD. And the medicines are safe also with no major side effects. In addition to this benzodiazepines like he is taking (lonazep) are used for control of anxiety. But these are with abuse potential and individuals tend to become dependent on them. So they are usually prescribed on SOS basis only and these are controlled drugs. Non medicinal treatment includes- Behavior therapy, which is best treatment of OCD. Thought stopping techniques, exposure and response prevention, desensitization etc. are modalities of treatment used. So as per my opinion- - combination of treatment is best for OCD and you should consult your psychiatrist for proper addition of medicines if symptoms are not in control - Psychotherapeutic treatment is best if used with motivation. - as far as plan of baby is concerned, as per my opinion there is no harm to baby from your husbands side. thanks and take care"},{"Patient":"I am 41 years, 170 cm, 75 kg.

I have had every test been to specialist several times feels like a waste of money they cant find anything wrong. I feel like I have a soccerball in my tummy. I have had 2 children natural and all went well. I am starting to become depressed because of this. I take a multi v, Fish oil, Magniessium and vit C. Any help would be appreciated.

There could be a few possibilities for a constant bloated sensation in your tummy. - Acid peptic disease - Gall bladder problems - Irritable bowel syndrome - Anxiety You have mentioned that you have had multiple tests from many specialists and everything has been normal. In such cases, the possibility an anxiety-related problem should be considered. Since, you say that you are also feeling depressed because of this, I think it would be worthwhile to have a consultation with a psychiatrist for further evaluation and advise. I would also suggest that you try relaxation techniques like deep breathing, yoga, meditation, etc. Dietary modifications - avoiding oily, spicy foods and taking more of green leafy vegetables and fresh fruits - can help.

At age 13we noticed changes in his self confidence etc... we took him to the Dr had him evaluated after many Dr visits and the put him on anxiety medicine and anti depressants. Sad to say he continues to go downhill more and more. We have tried treatment at mayo clinic, many psychiatrists and no help to make a short story out of the past 8 years. Now he rarely gets out of bed because he says he has so much physical pain. Can you please give me a direction to try.

Thank you","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. I'm sorry to hear that your son has been doing badly despite treatment. In such cases, where multiple trials of medication fail, it is a wise thing to re-evaluate the case completely and re-examine the initial diagnosis. With the very little information you have provided about your symptoms, it is not possible to get any definitive direction about the diagnosis. I would suggest that you try to get an independent, unbiased second opinion from another psychiatrist. You can also try psychological and behavioural therapies, in adition to the medication.

Since seeing her, my head feels like its rushing or expanding periodically. Last night I started hearing this scratching noise. I thought it was in my fan but realized when I went into the other room that it was actually in my head. I am really stressed right now and this is worrying me greatly. Am I going crazy?","Doctor":"Hi there, thanks for asking. You have a careful observation. The most probable thing is that the symptom you mentioned could be tinnitus happened as a side effect of the medication you are using (Celexa). Tinnitus could be intensified with with stress and anxiety. There are some ways to decrease or eliminate it such as avoiding caffeine, not adding salt to your food, not using so much canned food and decreasing the stress level. Tinnitus may also be sensitive to red wine and old cheese (some people report it). It is very good that you are paying attention to the possibility of other mental illnesses as you have in your family. I suggest that you notice to the factors mentioned and also with managing your stress level see if it is controlled. You can ask your doctor to check your blood pressure since it could also contribute to tinnitus.

Thanks for your query. I understand that you must be going through a tough time trying to deal with your depression. Now, most countries have specific protocols which determine the necessity of companion animals. Usually, companion animals are provided only when the person is having a significant disability due to the illness, and is unable to manage his / her activities of daily living without external help. So, this decision is entirely upto your treating doctor. I would suggest that you try psychological / behavioural therapies for your motivation problems, in addition to your current anti-depressant medication. Wish you all the best.

Your son needs treatment from a deaddiction center for alcohol and then rehabilitation.  He has to make his choices - alcohol or flight school in the navy.

I have a friend who is a mother of 2 & had been physically abused by her mum since she was a baby. This friend has been pulling her hair (literally) from her head, brows, lashes & has anger outbursts, is suspicious, fears her husband will leave her etc. She was prescribed Citanew 10mg, Tryptinol 25mg for a week & then 50 mg after that & Tab Dosik 1.5mg. She says that she is not functional now & is always sleepy. Is there something that can be done for her without the meds or should there be other help along with the meds?","Doctor":"Hi there, thanks for asking. Pulling hair from the head and eyebrow is called trichotillomania and it is often accompanied with anger bursts as you mentioned. Citanew and Dosik are good medications for such a condition which are commonly prescribed by doctors. I am sure that her doctor has prescribed Tryptonil for a special reason. In most of the time it can cause sleepiness during the day, since it remains in the body for long hours. She can talk about this issue with her doctor and she may decrease or discontinue Tryptonil to see if her sleepiness is improved. Her condition may become quite satisfactory after several weeks with just Citanew and Dosik. The response time for trichotillomania (pulling hair) and its related symptoms is longer than depression and is almost like the time needed for obsessive compulsive disorder (about eight weeks). I wish the best health for her."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 16 months old. From the age of 4 months she has a habit of crossing her legs & giving an internal push, like some sort of exercise. Earlier she used to do it lying on her back. Now she does it lying on her stomach . Many times she does it standing as well. Her legs will be crossed and she takes support of the wall or chair to do her exercise. If not stopped she continues it upto 10 minutes or more. Till 13 months this behaviour was sometimes triggered by lonliness, drowsiness, attention grabbing. Sometimes she used to start it if her demand was not met. From the last 3 months she does it without any reason also. If we ask her to stop doing the activity and get up, she listens sometimes. All other behaviour are normal. She is very active, likes to play, go outdoor, mingle with other children. She also understands what we tell her. Please let us know if this is something to worry about & when we can expect this behavour to stop. Do we need to give her any specific treatment?","Doctor":"Hi there ~ I am sorry that your daughter is doing all these behaviours and is sometimes becoming a public embarrassment.  I think that she might be having some obsessive compulsive behavior which makes her do it in places that she shouldn't and this is a cause of concern.

You have started experiencing burning sensation in hands and redness and altered bowels, needle like sensation. It is a part of Anxiety spectrum illness but you need not to worry as treatment is available. there are two modality of treatment for anxiety disorders and if its in beginning state then response is also very good. - first is non medicinal treatment which include Relaxation exercises, deep breathing exercises, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, biofeed back etc. In these modalities individual is taught to relax himself by own. Individual is made learn to control his involuntary system which is responsible for anxiety. Once individual become receptive he is progressed to other modalities as Behavior Therapy etc. - second is medicinal treatment in which anti anxiety medicines are used to bring individual to level that he can start practicing first modality of treatment. drugs such as SSRIs, SNRIs etc are used which not only cover anxiety part but also improves mood. Mild levels of sedatives are used to relax individual in special circumstances. These are used for short period of time.

Changes in personality Swearing or behaving in a way that you normally wouldn t (loss of inhibitions) Losing interest in life (apathy) Difficulty with planning and organising Being irritable or aggressive Weakness in part of the face, or on one side of the body Difficulty walking Loss of sense of smell Problems with your sight or speech they all apply to me but i have been in therapy for a while and diagnosed with depression , anxiety, bipolar and they even checked me for schizophrenia as i hallucinate and hear voices. Could this be linked and should i be worried?","Doctor":"Hi there, Thanks for asking. You have a careful observation. Change in personality (and also aggressiveness as you mentioned), as well as change in smell, may be induced by tumors (benign or malignant) in front part of the brain. Weakness in one part of the face and on one side of your body are also important focal signs which may contribute to a mass effect (like benign tumors) or vascular event (like shortage of circulation to your brain). It is necessary that a full neurologic examination will be done by your doctor to see what issue might be responsible for your problem. Headaches due to a mass are often more prominent in the early morning. Vascular problems are often seen in hypertensive people who may also have high cholesterol level and diabetes. It is useful that your ESR level be checked to assess any possibility of inflammatory problems. I wish the best health for you."},{"Patient":"I have been on Cymbalta for 9 months now 60 mg.

I heard about Vybrid and how it works for him. I am already overweight and cymbalta does continue to help with pain but no longer the depression . Would Vybrid be good for me. I need to feel better I am not functioning well with day to day I am not suicidal at all just want to feel better help!","Doctor":"Hi there ~ I am sorry you are going through a lot with your depression.  There is hope however since there is room to go up higher on Cymbalta to a 120 mg daily dosing in divided doses of 60 mg each in the AM and PM.  Please try this for 2-3 weeks and you might see improvement.  Vybrid is a new medicine of an older generation medicine that is useless almost, i.e. it is old wine in new bottle.  I have not had much experience with it however it does make you drowsy and you need to be cautious.  I would suggest that if the higher dose of cymbalta is not helping, you might want to switch to wellbutrin if you have not had a history of seizures in the past.  Also try other things like psychotherapy, yoga, meditation, dhyana and daily physical exericise.  They have proven evidence in treating depression in medical studies. I hope this helps.

I am just trying to find out if some of these behaviors are also common amongst people who hoard. One of the recent complaints that my friend has expressed is that once his mother gets an idea in her head about something there is no convincng her otherwise. He expressed that she told his sister that she had hid some money in her basement and is now unable to find it. She is convinced that he has gone into her home and taken the money since he has a set of keys to her home. The hoardind she does would make it impossible for anyone to enter the home and go into the basement to find the money without literally removing item by item just to get in and move around. A second incident has occurred where again she gets an idea in her head and no one or nothing can convince her otherwise. Almost like a paranoia","Doctor":"Hello gemini671 thanks for your question Hoarding is one of important symptoms of Obsessvie compulsive disorder in a significant strata of population, compulsive hoarding is very anxiety provoking to patient as well as to care givers. It is characterized by inability to discard items and individuals suffering from hoarding tend to store the items and they even some times do not let others to know this, due to fear of embarrassment. It is a part of OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE SPECTRUM disorder. Mostly the patients of hoarding also show other features of OC disorder like orderliness, cleanness, magical thinking, compulsive hand washing, obsession of doubt etc. In more than 50% of cases depression is also associated. And in a few cases paranoid ideation may be seen as your friend is observing in his mother. It may be persecutory delusion against any one or some times other delusional ideas like she is having. Her fixed firm belief about money is part of associated psychotic symptoms. In rare cases of Psyhcosis hoarding or obsessions or compulsions may be presenting symptoms thank frank delusions alone. Best thing to resolve it is first of all try to reassure her, once she is ready to talk then try to give her evidence to contrary and see whether her belief is still fixed? If she is a little shakable and ready to accept that she might be wrong then further strengthen the evidence. If thats not possible then take advise of some good psychiatrist for further management of her psychotic symptoms thanks, all the best hope i solved your query kindly rate"},{"Patient":"My mother 87 has been diagnosedd with lewy body dementia .

Please give me your opinion Thank you so much.","Doctor":"Hello David* thanks for your question Lewy Body Dementia is really a serious condition in elderly. Your mother is feeling low, having paranoid ideation and is constantly upset. I hope she is not having much motor symptoms or there are under control. Wellbutrin xl in 300 mg is a very nice drug to control low mood and other behavioral symptoms but you can discuss with her attending doctor to start SSRI drugs like Sertaline in low doses which are more potent thank bupropion (wellbutrin). How is her sleep? If she is having good sound sleep (5-7hrs) then there is no need to stop zopliclone as stopping will worsen the condition and may cause rebound insomnia and will worsen behavioral problems. Regarding her paranoid ideation I think her doctor is not giving proper prescription as you can discuss with him to start some low dose Second Generation Antipsychotic drug like olanzapine or clozapine (last modality) which are comparatively safer in Lewy Body dementia. So as per my advise kindly do not stress on stopping drug instead ask the doctor to review prescription to start more potent medicines and to start medicine that cover paranoid ideation thanks hope i solved your query kindly rate"},{"Patient":"hi, ive been feeling so out of place and not interested in anything.

While this is not healthy by itself, I plan on taking 75mg of benadryl to counter act the vyvanse so i can sleep tonight.

Benadryl is not a good medication for sleeping, although it is sold over the counter as sleep aid. Benadryl can change heart rate as well as vyvance can do. The arousal induced by vyvance will maintain and it is useful to take advantage of some relaxation method like meditation as they do not have any side effect. Vyvance is usually taken in the morning in order not to cause insomnia at night. The dose should be increased gradually in order to minimize the side effects and there should be a reason for it taking (it is usually prescribed by doctors for attention deficit disorder, etc). Otherwise, the side effects would be more than benefits.

I started taking webutrin but only lasted days on that due to the side effects. I am now taking citrolopram mg again for the past six weeks and have tremors and chest pain when i wake up every morning. It then turns into a major panic attack. Then i find that i have to take klonopin to take the edge away. I want to change to a different med than celexa and have heard that klonopin is the answer. What do you suggest?","Doctor":"Hi there, thanks for asking. You are right about clonopin. In the first few months of start or restart of the pharmacotherapy, clonopin or another medication from its class should be added to the treatment. Citalopram is a good medication for treating the panic attacks and you may use another medication from its class like escitalopram, paroxetine or even fluoxetine instead of citalopram. I understand that citalopram may have some side effects on you or even you may have become bored about using the medication. Wellbutrin is not an appropriate medication for panic disorder and can increase the attacks. I should say that management of panic disorder includes the combination of medication and talk sessions. When you talk in free association about the issues currently happening around you with a psychotherapist and get gradually some feedback, you will be able to discontinue gradually the medication without any problem.

This tiredness leaves me to be unmotivated and sometimes depressed. I went to my GP and he prescribed me Anti depressants. This was about a moth ago, I have not taken the tablets as I feel these are just a cover to the real issue, I think I was prescribed these as I had a real hard break up with my ex wife and needed them at that time which was 6 years ago. I do intend to go back to my G.P. I hope this is enough info for you. Kind Regards Trevor","Doctor":"Hi Trevor, thanks for asking the question. Sleep sex without recollection in the next day is a parasomnic behavior which may also be seen with sleepwalking and talking during sleep. It can be triggered and intensified by sleep deprivation, stress or drinking alcohol or using illicit drugs. It happens during NREM, stages 3 and 4 of sleep so a medication which restricts these periods like clonazepam could be useful for such a condition. Some cases are related to epileptic discharge so it would be useful if your doctor evaluates you for that aspect as well. I wish you can get rid of it soon because its management is easy and its impact on your life is great."},{"Patient":"i recently had a breakup..and its really difficult for me to move on...coz we had a good long 6 year relationship...and everything i do reminds me of him....though i have changed my city,and m trying to keep myself busy. we are now just friends..and he calls me sometimes....but i m unable to remove my feelings for him... what should i do....???","Doctor":"may i ask why did you break up? why the continued friendship.

From your history, many of the symptoms are suggestive of depression. In depression head scan usually come normal. Depression usually occur neuro transmitters imbalance in brain, primarily involving serotonin, due to that medical treatment is effective in treatment of depression. For that you can consult nearby psychiatrist. Dizziness in cold may be due to thyroid hormone problem, so also get your thyroid function test done. Thyroid problem also increases chances of developing depression. Wish you all the best. Regards, Dr Ashish Kumar Mittal www.99doctor.com"},{"Patient":", Hello my name is AAAAA. One year ago, I was diagnosed with severe symptomatic fibromyalgia . At the time I was in my third semester of nursing school,exhausted and depressed. I was out-of-state, away from family, gained over twenty pounds and felt really alone. Now, I have graduated, returned to my home state, but I still feel a lot of the symptoms and I was wondering if better nutrition along with regular, intentional exercise would ease my symptoms, and pain. Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Hi there, thanks for asking. The reasons for feeling exhausted are quite diverse. In some cases it is due to thyroid low functioning or other endocrine problems. It may be related anemia. It could also be related dysthymia which is a chronic feeling of low mood. With less probability, it could be related to liver or renal problems. It could be fibromyalgia if you have tender points around your elbow or on the sternum. It is appropriate to ask your doctor to investigate about all the possibilities. If no abnormality is found in the laboratory investigations, you can take advantage of some talk sessions for breaking the chain of events which bring for you exhaustion.

Every psychiatrist can treat the problem you mentioned and it is very important for you to restart the medication as soon as possible. Paranoid subtype of schisophrenia has the best prognosis among all the subtypes of schisophrenia. When your situation becomes stabilized, the dose of the medication could be lowered enough to avoid any short term side effect (like tremors, rigidity, dry mouth, overly sedation) and also potentially long term side effects (like change in metabolism or irreversible movement disorders). They may even discontinue the medication in its own time.

Hypothyroidism can bring increased weight, and also slow heart beats. It could be also related to sleep apnea, because it is common in obese people (your BMI is 35.45) and it also could lead to slow heart beats. Other symptoms of thyroid hypofunction are change in your hair and skin texture and also constipation and loss of concentration and may be low mood. Other symptoms of sleep apnea are fatigue during the day and also being sleepy all the time, probably lower mood than normal. If you have allergy, deviated septum, enlarged tonsils, TMJ problem or you go frequently to washroom in the night or you have headache in the morning, this could be more likely.

My doctor said yes and to do it cold turkey but I was on 25 mg once a day and it made my anxiety very high. So I went back on with the 12.5 2ce a day.","Doctor":"Hi there, thanks for asking. Your doctor is right. You can discontinue the medication if you do not have any stressful situation in the family now. Metoprolol is a medication which does not enter into the brain so much and the most part of its effect is on the peripheral system, like heart and vessels. It means that it controls the manifestations of the anxiety over the body and so it brings a peaceful situation for your brain since it does not feel any alarm from the body. When somebody is under stress, any change in this medication could lead to the anxiety rebound, otherwise he/she can not to take it.

Many medications could lead to low potassium as well. Lithium can cause it and it is used for bipolarity. Many anti hypertensive medications can cause low potassium level. If you and her doctor cannot trust on her not to drink alcohol, she may take a medication like disulfiram to avoid drinking.

It appears that you have been suffering from some kind of phobia since 6 months. It is good that you have realized that the fear you experience is not reasonable. Sometimes fears and phobias arise due to some incident in the childhood, the fear may develop and present as phobia in adult life. Don't worry, just learn to take control over the things that cause your heart to beat. Avoid staying alone at night, try to challenge the negative thoughts that cause you restlessness. Meditation in a regular way will help you get relaxed. Yoga and breathing exercises will help you stay cool and take control over the fear. However, if you think things are not improving, talk to a counselor/psychiatrist. Probably you may be suffering from some type of personality disorder that needs immediate attention, the type and degree of the fear and phobia should be assesses and treated accordingly. Treatment in time will help you stay healthy both physically and mentally. I am always there for you.

Last year, when you went to the hospital for chest pains, the doctor suggested that it was anxiety. I hope that you have been getting treatment for anxiety. Unresolved and untreated anxiety will get worse. It can cause physical symptoms, too. Chest pains are one kind of physical symptom. Muscle aches and pains are another. This happens because the muscles get tight due to anxiety and begin to ache. Most common aches are in the lower neck, between the shoulder blades, and legs. Sometimes the pain seems to be coming from deep inside the bones. I would strongly suggest meeting a psychiatrist for a full mental health assessment and planning treatment.

Panic attacks can occur several psychological and medical conditions, which need to rule out in your case after examination and investigation. It is important to see a doctor to rule out the following possibilties: -Panic disorder and depression -Hyperthyroidism -Hypoglycemia -Stimulant use (amphetamines, cocaine, caffeine), so stop use if present. -Some Medication withdrawal -Mitral valve prolapse, a minor cardiac problem that occurs when one of the heart’s valves doesn't close correctly. Medicine like alprazolam and lorazepam are good medicine for panic attack but these are used for short duration only, due to risk of addiction on them. Long term treatment depend on the cause of panic attacks. Wish you all the best.

On my opinion his psychosocial disorder comes from two factors; your mother and his disability. Your mother seems to be the one encouraging this by trying to isolate/protect him and making him feel different, this causes him to actually realize that he has a problem and is different from other people he may meet. Given his age, integrating him directly to the society without prior psychotherapy from a psychiatrist might result to more issues in public. My advise is convince both your mother and brother to meet a doctor. Be diplomatic and do know that your doctor's decision is best for your brother and society. If your brother get to spit or behave abnormally towards another individual with little patience, you might not be happy find him in a much more worst state. So getting him to a doctor is paramount.

Anxiety that you are going to have a heart attack and die are also common.  They are also fearful of having such thoughts at night and do not get enough sleep.   Gastritis may worsen with this condition as stress and gastritis as well as hypertension are related.  Seeing a good psychiatrist who can take care of your medications is helpful.  I recommend that you do so at the earliest. Take care and have a nice day !"},{"Patient":"I just bumped into this sight, My daughter was in a horrible motorcycle accident last March. She suffered a severe traumatic brain injury . She is living at home with her 8 yr old son, but has alot of trouble with depression ,anxiety, and just dealing with everyday issues. They have her on prozac & zyprexa , just switched the zyprexa to geodon . She also has asthma, was a smoker. has not had anything since the accident, but wants to smoke really bad, but her lungs are not good, takes inhalers. Is there somewhere on her for her to chat with others like her?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. It is not uncommon to have psychiatric disturbances following a traumatic brain injury. Often medication are required to treat such psychiatric disturbances. She is currently on a combination of an anti-depressant (Prozac) and an anti-psychotic (Geodon) medication. I'm not sure why there has been a change fro Zyprexa (also an anti-psychotic) to Geodon. However, it is advisable to continue the medication as prescribed. Smoking can not only worsen her asthma but it can also result in other lung and systemic diseases. If she has difficulty in staying quit, it would be worthwhile to consult a pschiatrist for professional help regarding the same. Motivational Enhancement Therapy and if necessary, certain medication can be helpful in preventing her from relapsing to smoking. Wish you all the best.

Thanks for your query. The symptoms you are describing are classic of panic attack.

A good strategy is to encourage him to lose weight. It can help for improvement in apnea. it should be at least 15 to 20 pounds to be effective. Honestly his BMI is very high and it makes the effectiveness of the CPAP lower than expected. He should also know that the CPAP pressure should also be adjusted during sleep assessment every one or two years to be effective.

Zanax and Wellbutrin are not a good choice for the illness that you are suffering.  I feel i.e. you have to see a doctor to make sure that your stresses are relieved with the right kind of medications.

I understand that you are going through a difficult time with your depression and suicidal thoughts. Since your depressive symptoms appear to be persisying despite taking medication, it is very important that you let your doctor know about this, so that further management plans can be made accordingly. It is common to have hopelessness during depression and have thoughts like you won't ever get better. But, please remember that this is just a passing phase and you will soon be able to come out of it. I would also encourage you to keep taking to someone close to you - a close friend or a relative - so that you can share your thoughts and feelings.

The doctor prescribed some pills but it got worst since I began taking the pills yesterday.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. You have mentioned that all relevant tests were normal, and a heart problem was ruled out. In such a case, and taking into consideration the acute stressors which you have been facing recently, it is very likely that your symptoms are due to an anxiety disorder. It is important to understand that anxiety can manifest with a variety of physical symptoms, including chest tightness / pain, palpitations, difficulty in breathing, etc. I would also like to let you know that certain anti-anxiety medication (like SSRIs) can casue an initial and treansient worsening of anxiety symptoms, before befoming fully effective in controlling the anxiety. So, I would advise you not to worry about this and continue the medication. Also, practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing, yoga, etc. can also be of good help. Wish you all the best.

I have been on pregabalin in the past but suffered too many side effects. My Fibro Fog is really bad and I forget what I am talking about mid sentence and find it embrarrassing. I also was diagnosed with bi-polar many years ago but they later said that it was just depression I had. I am finding it hard to differenctiate what condition is causing what at the moment but I feel depressed (majorly depressed) I cant get motivated to do anything I have removed myself from most social interaction as possible. I also am a comfort eater but have gained over 4 stone in last 18 months. I do not overeat as such but have to have chocolate every night and its becoming like a drug/habit and this in turn doesnt help my depression or self worth. I feel trapped, desperate and alone and as I am a single parent I am too scared that if I admit to having had manic episodes a great deal this last year that it will go against me with regards to my abililty to look after my 2 sons aged 11 and 9. It is this paranoia that prevents me telling my GP the truth about my feelings etc. I had a 2 year court battle with my ex-husband for residency on the children which I won but the fact that he contested my ability at first then later changed his mind. He was a mentally abusive man who like to play games, mind games and I am fearful of EVER telling GP the truth.

I need HELP but dont know who to turn to.","Doctor":"Hi There, thanks for asking. Fibromyalgia is a disease which should be controlled in parallel with control of depression and also sleep. Tramadol may enhance your anxiety level so it is not a good option for fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia induces more alpha and beta waves in sleep, so the patients find a shallow sleep and this aggravates their mood as well. If you ask your doctor to manage your sleep and also your mood, your pain would also be managed. talk sessions can be really helpful for the cases which there is no certainty about the type of depression (depression or bipolarity).

You have not given a clear description of your symptoms, but from your statement that \\"I don't know what is happening in my mind for 10-15 seconds\\", it is possible that you could be having a seizure disorder, which could be the reason for the psychiatrist starting you on anti-epileptic medication.

Many psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, have a high chance of relapsing. It is possible that your symptoms could be indicative of a relapse of your previous psychiatric problems.

If his symptoms, like irritability, anger outbursts, negative thinking, etc. are of a recent origin and different from his usual self, then it is likely that they could very well be symptoms of an underlying mood disorder. On the other hand, if these problems are rather a part of his 'usual nature', then it is likely to be unhealthy personality traits. Whatever be the cause, if it is causing significant problems in your family, then it would be worthwhile to consult a psychiatrist for a detailed evaluation and further treatment.

Nightmares can be caused due to sleep deprivation, sleep disorders, tension, depression, anxiety, stress, post traumatic stress disorders. It can also occur due to intake of some medications, drugs, narcotics,etc. Don't worry, it is the first time it happened to you. Just stop taking any drugs, alcohol that may trigger nightmares and cause you restlessness. Avoid taking snacks late night as it has the tendency to increase metabolism and activate the brain cells and neuro transmeters. Try to sleep on a comfortable mattress.

The dose backs to the clinical improvement. The medical treatment for OCD is usually long term, but if the clinical improvement is reached, the dose can be decreased to the minimal level. if you wish to discontinue the medication, you should take advantage of behavioral therapy for your compulsions. The advantage of behavioral therapy is that does not have any possible side effect and also its positive effect (when is achieved) is life time, because it is a skill which you learn. Its concept is easy and it needs several weeks to practice. You can ask your doctor to guide you to the person who can work it with you.

I was raped when I was 12, my family was already in the midst of my brother being institutionalized at a State Mental Hospital after slicing a man;s throat and being diagnosed with schizophrenia . I have three siblings he is the oldest almost 10 years older. My parents were always visiting him so nobody was around to talk to. Also I was afraid to tell anyone for fear of how much more turmoil it would cause. When I was 19 my father was killed in a skydiving accident. I became involved in an physically abusive relationship and than became pregnant. I have severe asthma and was hospitalized for two weeks when I was seven and a half months pregnant and had an abruption and went into DIC. We lost Nicole and I couldn t even go to her funeral. I became more entrenched with drugs and drinking and left my husband. Even though emotionally I didn t detach. Finally I helped my sister get out of KC the town we grew up in when her husband had been diagnosed with AIDS from using dirty needles and was caught robbing a store.My mother a friend and I brought her and her 2 children who were 3 and one and a half to michigan were my mom was living . Eventually she went back to her husband and I decided to stay. I met a man and had two children and married him. When my son was five and my daughter Liz was 3 we were in a car accident while I was driving and my mother was killed. I always rationalized in my own mind that there are so many people who have been through so much worse. My father taught me that you have to be strong. Don t show your weaknesses. You can get through anything, but you know what I can t anymore. I don t sleep. I hurt all the time both physically and emotionally. My asthma hasn t been under control for years. I m always angry not just mad like on the edge. I ve tried to commit suicide twice, obviously not successfully, but it is always in the back of my mind. My family thinks that if you need to see a counselor you re crazy. In fact they actually say that when they are trying to hurt me. My husband has a problem with drinking but won t do anything about it. I ve been on SSI for five years and only make 398 a month because I ve never been able to stay a a job for very long because I become ill. So according to them I really don t do anything to help the family, even though I do all of the housework, cooking etc... My asthma has gotten so bad that I have had to have a port put in because my veins are shot from all of the steroids. I don t know how many times I have heard things are so much better when you re not here. Please help. I don t know how much longer I can hold on!","Doctor":"Hello....... Thanks for your query. I understand the multiple stressors you have faced and the devastating effect it has had on you. I would suggest that you seek professional help from a psychiatrist/ clinical psychologist to assess for depression/anxiety disorders/ adjustment / other stress related disorders as well as assess your range of coping skills. This can be followed by appropriate antidepressant/ anxiolytic medication and psychotherapy as appropriate. Hope you find my suggestions useful.

Stress and anxiety can manifest with not only psychological symptoms, but also with a variety of physical or somatic symptoms. However, a mole or an itchy skin lesion is a dermatological problem and is unlikely to be the direct result of stress. You will need a proper physical examination to determine the nature and cause of your skin lesion. Irrespective of this, it appears that you are going through a lot of stress, and so, it would be worthwhile to seek professional help for the same. There are effective psychological therapies which can help you aquire better stress management techniques and coping skills. Wish you all the best.

Last year he started behaving normally after some treatment and now the problem is he is forgetting what happened after every 30 min to 1hr.

It is possible that post accident the person has developed organic personality changes. A CT/MRI would be advisable at this stage. Also assessment of cognition would be helpful for management.

He had to have total knee replacement and the surgeon has told him he won t be able to return to work. He has applied for dissability but because he s only 47, he was turned down. We have a lawyer and feel he s doing a good job. My husband feels like he should be taking care of his family and of course, staying inside all day certainly doesn t help. Our doctor has tried him on Celexa (29 mg) and Effexor (150 mg). He had 1 refill left on the Effexor so he started taking it again. With all the medicines out there, we don t know which might be best for him. He has an appointment next week with anothe doctor to get a second opinion. He has been on Metformin and Lesinopril but has stopped those since his weight loss from close to 270 down to 217. He s such a wonderful person and am not giving up on getting him help. He just gets very frustrated trying different meds. Any advice you can give will be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance. I m sorry I can t pay this since I am the only one working. But thank you anyway.","Doctor":"Hi there ~ I understand that not being able to work can be handicapping in a lot of ways for a lot of people.  In your husband's case, I am sorry that his disability petition was turned down.  If effexor had helped him before, it would be prudent to go back on that medication until he sees a doctor.  However please watch for any side effects, most commonly gastrointestinal (nausea and vomiting) and increase in blood pressure.  Celexa is also an effective adjuvant medication for depression.  I am glad that he is working on making his day better.  I hope he is eating at regular times and sleeping well, not too much not too little.  Activity makes depression better, so the more he does with his hands the better he would be with his depression.  I would not bother too much about the weight loss.  Please wait for the doctor's appointment to see what the doctor says. I hope this helps.  Take care and have a nice day !"},{"Patient":"My daughter was diagnosed as a manic depressive when she was 15. She was placed in an unit because she tried to commit suicide .

As you have symptoms for years then possibility of ADHD need to be ruled out too by examination by psychiatrist.

My investigations were motivated because I want to stop taking interferon beta and find an alternative method that is based on a natural basis. The long-term study results from last summer that were on interferon-beta, have not had a positive outcome: (MS Society - WWW.WWWW.WW / NY Times: WWW.WWWW.WW . After 4 years of taking Avonex, I still experience serious side effects that have been fought with Celebrex and Ritalin. There are also positive side effects, because I do not get ill as often as I did. After weeks of research, I reached the following conclusions: I understand that a vitamin D deficiency is a component for some diseases and one is MS. Vitamin D increases the interleukin (IL) 10, and simultaneously reduces the IL-6 and IL-17. It retains these two cytokines in balance. An increased IL-6 creates plaques in the brain and IL-17 is responsible for the autoimmune system. Should the IL-17 be too high, it upsets the immune system and it begins to attack its own cells. Interferon-beta is mainly focused on the IL-17 and neglects the IL-6. I also struggle with the herpes virus which is designated as vIL-10, and this fits into the same receptors that are intended for IL-10. Vitamin D is as you know, created by sunshine and after a 30 minute long sunbath in the summer time, you can have up to 20,000 IU in the body. So I think that a 10,000 IU per day cannot cause toxicity . Vitamin D is dependent on vitamin K , zinc, magnesium and boron, to activate it. I would like to take the following orally: - Vitamin D3 - 10,000 IU - Multivitamins per day which includes, among other things: o Vitamin K - 20 - 60 micrograms (mcg) o Zinc - 11 - 15 milligrams (mg) o magnesium - 100 - 120 mg o Boron - 150 mcg - Omega 3 to 1272 mg - Omega 6-928 mg - Omega 9-475 mg o A balance of Omega 3 and 6 is wanted If the above values are too high, or if there is something missing, please let me know? I will continue taking interferon, but I would like to stop it as soon as possible.

One thing that you may have noticed yourself is that you are focusing too much on labs.  One way to reduce your anxiety is to distract yourself from thinking about your condition too much.  If you start acting like you have no symptoms you probably will end up not having any problems.

I am almost 20 years old and two years ago i went to a doctor to try and get some answers. i found that i was noticeably more hyper than any of my friends, i couldn t stop talking, i would get in these weird moods where all i would do is think about random things, i would tap my foot or leg, feel rushed when there wasn t a need to be rushed, and i would always snap on my parents, sometimes for no reason. i went through perscriptions of concerta , adderall , and vyvanse , just recently upping my dosage of vyvanse to 60 mg. my question is, is it common to feel extremely irritable and angry towards people i care about when i accidentally forget to take my vyvanse? this has always been a question i have. i always feel much more calm and relax and not easily angered or upset when i take my vyvanse consistently.","Doctor":"Hi There, thanks for asking. That is true, you should take Vyvance regularly in order to avoid to be jittery or irritable. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder has another component which is \\"impulsivity\\". Many boys who have attention deficit hyperactivity also have impulsive behavior. For example, they may become aggressive toward their friend and they feel remorse soon after it. Vyvance is not only useful for your hyperactivity, but also helps you to manage your behavior. On the other hand, drug level fluctuation may change neuronal function and it is better to be used regularly.

This is called anticipatory anxiety and may lead to precipitating another panic attack.

I recommend that you get an electrocardiogram done, and if there is anything suspicious a cardiology referral is in order.  I hope you are using relaxation strategies to control your panic attacks.  You should see a psychiatrist to have your panic attacks treated with medications and get appropriate therapy referral. I hope this helped.

It is natural, because motivation needs time to be built and it should be related to your needs. Your good self esteem also helps for persistence on what you decide to do. For working on your self esteem, you may focus on your physical appearance or some achievement and also you should keep in you mind that the goals you set for yourself should not be too far from your standing point. Then you can pursue them in a steady pace.

Maladaptive mechanisms to deal with one's depression would involve diverting yourself by using substances that just reinforce the addiction cycle and make your psychiatric condition i.e. depression worse.  Alcohol is also a depressant and could make depression worse by itself.  You also have been having blackouts which indicates that your body is physiologically and physically dependent on alcohol.  You need deaddiction treatment and I think that you may need to see a psychiatrist and a substance abuse counselor to help you get over your depression and alcohol/nicotine dependence.  I hope you seek help as soon as you can.

It appears that you have not had any prior experiences with death in your family, close or extended, nor do you have any friends of friends who died.

You are saying in the first sentence that you were released from mental health hospital with enough medicines. Since you needed admission in M H hospital, I assume that you had a psychiatric illness requiring hospitalization. Most of the disorders need a treatment for more than one month. If you stopped your medicines because of some adverse effects, your doctor may be able to change your medicines to those without adverse effects. It may not be proper to re-start the medicines in the prescribed dose as many medicines require gradual increase in dose after stopping.

I had extreme swelling of the leg from mid-thigh all the way to my foot from the beginning. I did everything I was told to do, but the swelling is still there, though not nearly like it was. I have had what I thought was fluid on my knee since shortly after the surgery, but I was told the swelling would go down. I went in for the yearly checkup and was told the swelling could be scar tissue . When I disagreed with the doctor, he said that it was fluid that needed to be drained. He aspirated it, sent the synovial fluid to the lab, and told me there was no infection, but that he suspected rheumatoid arthritis . I went to a rheumatologist who told me there was no RA, but very possibly I was experiencing an allergic reaction to the components of the implant. I was not given any information at all about the implant that I received. I called the OS and was told that they don t even keep that info in my file there at their office, and the MA, I felt, proceeded to send me on the proverbial wild goose chase. I suspect, after doing a lot of research, that I could be having a reaction to the metal. How do I find out exactly what implant was used in my knee? If I need to have another TKR, do I dare use the same doctor? What about insurance? I have been made to feel that I just haven t worked hard enough to get this knee in shape, etc.... I can t even walk very far because of the popping in the knee. It doesn t really hurt, but it is so uncomfortable and causes me to walk differently and makes my back hurt. It s a domino affect. When I ve mentioned that, I was told that when the knee sets itself or when the swelling goes away that the popping would stop. I just do not know what to do next. Any advice will be considered. I am very depressed and confused and upset and frustrated!!! Thanks!","Doctor":"Hi there ~ Your being upset, confused, depressed and frustrated is understandable.  The surgery that was expected to make your life better did not actually turn out to be so.  However, you need to look the life before and after surgery.  You describe everything after surgery and how your knee should have been and how you should have walked, etc,.  However you do not mention what you expectations were and how your life or your problem knee was before surgery.  It is very possible to feel depressed, however you need to reconcile with the fact that the surgery and the consequent improvement is gradual and it should have been alluded to by your surgeon.

Thanks for your query. I understand that you must be quite concerned by your child's behavioural problems. From the description of his problems it appears that he may be having some obsessions and compulsions. He also seems to be coming out with depressive thoughts and ideas. However, in young children, these symptoms may be more complex than what is obvious and expressed. So, your son definitely needs a detailed psychological assessment in order to arrive at a diagnosis.

I am sure you must have had the idea of having imaging done to know what the indentation is about.  In any ways, the whooshing sounds in ears and dizziness are classical symptoms of vertigo.  You need to see an otorhinolaryngologist (ENT doctor) to make sure you do not have any serious condition and to have yourself treated. I hope this helps.  Take care."},{"Patient":"My husband survived a TBI over 20 years ago. He had very little rehab afterward. He seemed to have differences in his personality afterward, but nothing huge. However, over the years I have noticed more and more little things developing. Over the last year he has been to a neuropsychologist and told he had serious deficits from his injury. His behavior had gotten out of hand regarding sexual inappropriateness and he has no impulse control . Over the last month he is acting like a whole other person. He is distant, seems depressed. wants to be left alone, and is not sure about being married anymore. What was once my loving husband whom always showed me affection, is now cold and unfeelilng and doesn t want to come home. He is currently taking 20mg of Adderall to help his focus, but it keeps him up most night until 3 or 4 a.m. He is very easily aggitated and has had some extreme violent outbursts. Is he having a crisis of some kind?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. A recent onset change in behaviour or personality could be due to the following possibilities: - Related to the brain injury  - frontal lobe injuries can typically present with personality cahnges, disinhibited behaviour, emotional lability, sexual inappropriateness, etc. - A superimposed of underlying psychiatric disorder which could be the cause for the recent worsening. For examples, psychotic disorders, mood disorders - like a hypomania or mania. If his agitation and inappropriate behaviour is quite troublesome and difficult to handle, there are medication (such as anti-psychotics or mood stabilizers) which can help him calm down.

In case of OCD, SSRIs are treatment of choice but the main point is adequate dosages and adequate duration. If you are changing medicines without reaching adequate doses or duration, you might not get results. I advise you to discuss all this with your doctor and have faith in him as it often takes long time to treat this condition. Psychotherapy and relaxation exercises are also required along with pharmacotherapy. Sometimes in resistant cases, ECT may help.

No stroke but am experiencing a strong pulling sensation on left side of body and in the nerves in my head and neck to the point of extreme discomfort. Pulling sensation in the groin area. When walking still noticed uncoordination at times with feet. Am continuing to lose weight even though eating healthy. Have done research and know something is out of balance with sympathetic and para-sympathetic nervous systems. Am on Cipralex (10mg.) and Lorazapam (.5 in am and .5 at night).

Cipralex (Escitalopram) is an anti-depressant / anti-anxiety medication and Lorazepam is an anti-anxiety medication. These are not harmful to the nervous system. They are used commonly and can be effective in controlling anxiety. It is likely that your symptoms are predominantly anxiety-related. It is important to understand that anxiety can present with not only psychological symptoms but also with physical or bodily symptoms.

Physical aggression may be the symptom of a more severe underlying psychiatric issue that needs to be addressed immediately.

I have never known him to breathe like this. He felt nauseous, and had a sharp pain behind the eyes whenever he coughed (he has a small dry persistent cough for 2 years now). The next day he went to the doctor and she said he had high blood pressure 160/100 both lying down and standing, he has always had low blood pressure till now, and she thinks this may be caused by the varnish he had been coating the floor with. A week later his BP had gone down to 140/100. I cannot find any internet information which link a mild fever to high blood pressure. His fever has cleared up, but the high blood pressure is still there. Possible background risks may be exposure to ticks recently, a moderate drinking problem (about 1.5 litres of beer daily) and a family history with heart attack (only 1 case, his grandmother at the age of 65) a problem with blood in the stool for twenty years now, that comes when he is stressed, and then goes again.","Doctor":"Hi there ~ All that you mention in your history for your husband, including exposure to ticks, an alcohol problem, family history of heart attack, physical stressors and recent chest pain along with exposure to varnish and his inherent non-modifiable risks of being a middle aged male are contributing factors to his hypertension (high blood pressure).  I believe that using relaxation strategies like breathing exercises - pranayama, yoga, meditation, regular scheduled activities as well as exercises are helpful with the high blood pressure.  These are non-medical interventions.  Modification of lifestyle including diet is one part and using medications is another.  It is always helpful to seek the expert advise of a qualified doctor or your family practitioner with regards to any persistent problems. I hope this helps.

Your husband seems to be having problems with mania which is common is bipolar disorder.  I am thinking that your husband gradually got worse over time and assuming this, it is easier to put someone on medications and try to wait and watch for results.  However, symptomatic treatment is recommended in acute and subacute cases and anger management or sleep management might be of initial use before going on to titrate the dose of the mood stabilizer, in this case Arip MT.

Drowsiness is a side effect of the medication and using any other kind of sedative including alcohol is best avoided.

Anxiety management is first of a your personal decision , and you see if you decide to live and be happy in life with yourself, most of the symptoms will degrade on their own. It would be advisable to spend more time with your loved ones, avoid isolation and maybe involve your self in some physical activity or group activity that you enjoy. Answer if not well managed could lead to depression. Drugs are available for anxiety, but proof to be generally ineffective when the patient himself is not motivated. It could be advisable at some point in time to discuss with a psychologist and a psychiatrist, but the key of the treatment depends on your personal effort to motivate yourself, avoid isolation and take your drugs as prescribed in case they are by your physician or psychiatrist.

Stomach pain and diarrhea when initiating any medication is common and usually goes aways in a week or two.

Or please let me know how to deal with it. I really love her but because of this we are facing lots of problems. I havnt told her about this to her. Is it advisable to let her know that she is showing symptoms of paranoid personality disorder. Kindly help","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. I appreciate your concern regarding your girlfriend's psychological problems. Firstly, I would like to mention that a diagnosis of \\"Paranoid Personality Disorder\\" is a clinical diagnosis and has to be done by a psychiatrist or a psychologist after a detailed history and psychological assessment. Merely exhibiting symptoms of being mistrusting or extra-cautious may not warrant the labelling of a personality disorder. In case, a diagnosis of a paranoid personality disorder is confirmed, then treatment is often challenging. It requires long term psychotherapy or sometimes, medication, and is usually not curable. If you feel that your girlfriend's symptoms are causing major problems between you, I think that the best way to tell her is that since both of you are having difficulties, it would be a good idea to seek professional help to sort out the difficulties. The psychologist or psychiatrist can then assess her to see if she has any symptoms of a paranoid personality disorder. Wish you all the best.

I understand you have suffered a great loss. And the grief can take over everything in your life and make everything else seem less important. But, it is how we deal with this grief and come out smiling and successful is when we can say we have won one of the battles that life forced us to face. Before anything else, I would like to ask you one question. How far did your mother go to make you happy as a child? How far out of her way did she go to get you something that might have brought a 2 second smile on your face? Did she do things on a daily basis to make you happy, to see to it that you don't get hurt? I am guessing, always!! What was the purpose of this? Well, there can be only one. To see to it that you are happy always, that nothing should sadden you. Right? Well, if she were given a chance to ask you for something before she left, what do you think it would be? She would want you to always be happy. Always smile. There is a famous saying in my part of the world, \\"When I am gone, do not cry. Think of me, and all the beautiful memories we shared, and smile\\" I am sure she would want you to be happy always. And I am sure you can do that for her. Face your grief, don't just think about her passing away. But, think about all the times she was happy when she was around. I know this is not going to be easy, but this is something you will have to do for her. Why did she love you so much? Why were you so attached to her? It is because she kept her child (you) before everybody else, and you will have to do the same. Without her, your family wouldn't have lasted a day, in her prime. Follow the examples she has left for you to learn from. Your immediate family needs you. And you need to prove to everybody that, although you may never fit into your mothers shoes, you certainly are her daughter, and will live life with the same principles and love for people, that she had. Dealing with grief is greater than just losing a loved one, it is how you show your respect for the departed and how you register every lesson that person has taught you during their life time. I am sure you would want to make her proud, and better than anybody else, you know how to do that. My condolences and best wishes to you and your family. You can always write back to us/me for any assistance you need. Best wishes."},{"Patient":"i have severe ocd ( germs ) and severe depression and anxiety..i have been put on just about every psych med there is..my dr. had just put me on viibryd and it made me very ill, flu like symptoms, i take meds for my stomach issues nexuim and promethazine and was wondering if there are any meds out there that would not upset my stomach nor have alot of side effects?

Dividing the medication and using controlled release tablets is one option.

Could this all be down to her depression or does she have a mental illness?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query.Depression is a form of mental illness. It can present with various psychological as well as somatic or bodily symptoms. In addition, from the description of your mother's symptoms such as phobia of germs, obsession with cleanliness, etc. it appears that she may also be having an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).Both depression and OCD are treatable conditions and usually there is a good response to anti-depressant medication. There are also effective psychological therapies and counselling techniques which can help her overcome these problems.

When driving, he screams at people who drive too slow, complains about the bad traffic, picks fights with waiters who try to overcharge him (causing me a lot of embarassment) and cusses all sorts of vulgarities. He says that when he gets angry it is mainly because of people who have bad ethics , otherwise he would have no reason to get so angry. My boyfriend is not a regular bully, he is a highly-educated professional who just has problems controlling his anger. However, he should take a good look at himself when he is angry. His face is beetroot red and his eyes dart around and he screams as loud as a volcano erupting. He won t let the matter rest until I talk him out slowly. When I am out with him, he gets jealous and glares menacingly at any men who looks my way for more than a second. I will tell him to stop but he continues. Only when I threaten to walk away will he stop his nonsense. But of course, a few days later, his bad attitude and anger management issues start again. I have known him for 5 months. He likes being by himself, doesn t have too many friends and spends most of his time working and working on his doctorate. He plays squash (which many think of as a violent game) and is an otherwise active and healthy 39 year old (I am 24). He has not been verbally abusive towards me, but I fear that it is a matter of when. Why is he like that? What can I do to help him and myself?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query.If your boyfriend's anger irritability and poor frustration tolerance has been of recent onset, then underlying psychological problems like stress, anxiety or depression have to be considered.If they have been long-standing, without any other psychological problems, then they are more likely to be part of his personality.If you feel that his anger problem is prominent and causing inter-personal or social difficulties, I would advise you to ask him to get professional help. There are various good psychological therapies and counselling techniques which can help with such problems. Also practicing relaxation techniques, learning stress-management and coping skills will also be beneficial.Wish you all the best.Regards,Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"i have been in a relationship married for 15 years. he used to beat me first then he used to say sorry. but i felt that sometimes its my fault because i too shout at him sometimes. however, last couple of years it got worse, he stop me seeing my frineds, calls them prostitues. and also i have to get home if i go anywhere before 9pm initially then it became 8pm. if i come home about 5 mins then he wont open the door then i had to bed. Last incident i had was he was cleaning the kitchen, then he found some dirt which i left on the kitchen board from the bread toaster. he told me that i have not cleaned, i said what the just leave it i will clean when i can. for that he came and hit my neck once, he was not satisfied, he hit me so hart i thought i burst my ear drum... and head was aching for few days. After that one day i went to colleage for a short course i told him i have cooked everything that i will be home late, for that he was not happy he told me not to come so i went to hostal and then move out following day. he didnt ask me to come home immediately but after 1 week when he realised that i am not going back he start to beg now i have bought a house, but i talk to him, its been a year and 4 months since i left him. Somehowe, now we talk and he expects me to come home. i told him lets go on a holiday and see how you behave then will decide. when we went to america last month he was not very different, but a bit tolerent. he says he has changed, and i wind him up thats why he behaved like that. he asked me for no reason whether i am blind.. anyway he went for some therapy for 9 months... last year i was very sure of what i want to do.. which is devorcing him.. now i am confused.. should i give him a chance. most probably i m feeling like this because i am lone, i bought a house on shared owner ship and living here and have some problem with the house too.. Dr. what do you think i should do, will this kind of people change?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome, Thanks for your query. First of all, physical abuse cannot be tolerated no matter what. If it happened once, I advise people to over-look it. But, anything more than that is serious business. Yes men are usually frustrated with work and responsibilities, but there is no excuse to treat another human being that way. Now, I hope your hearing and head is fine, I hope you do not suffer from decreased hearing or headaches or any symptoms after he abused you physically. If so, please get yourself checked. I understand he has made an initiative to try to correct himself, that is the first step after realization, and I am happy he has done that. But, it is still not safe enough to be around him. Please do not go back to him just because you have problems with your house, or financially, it will never be worth it. Try to sort your financial and residential issues, without even thinking about depending on him. Take as much time as possible to trust him. Do not jump to any conclusions, you have suffered enough. Also, observe his behavior without telling him about your observations. Meet and talk to him more often so you can learn more about him and make an informed decision about returning to him or not. A man who has done so much wrong to you cannot do anything worse, as this is the worst. So do not settle for any behavior less than good behavior just because it is better than his previous behavior. I personally don't think such people can change much, but we should give him one chance. Do not move in with him till you are completely sure about him and his behavior, because it will be very difficult to get out again. Also, if he really has changed, learn to let go of all old memories of him and his behavior. If you do not do this, you can never be happy with him. Please be very careful with everything you do. You have a million choices out there, and you are always the best judge, do not take anyone's word for it. I wish you a happy life, and lots of luck. You can always write back to us for any help you need.

Everyone's physiology is different.  However, if you feel that it is unusual for you and that it is causing you discomfort in any and every situation, I would recommend that you see an endocrinologist first since it could be hormonal.

Thanks for your query. Your symptoms such as increased irritability, lack of sex drive and fatigue may be indicative of depression. You have mentioned that you have been on anti-depressants before and have stopped them on your own recently. An abrupt cessation of antidepressants can sometimes cause a worsening of depression, and this could be a probable reason for your prominent symptoms now. Since these symptoms seem to be causing you significant distress and dysfunction, I would suggest that you seek professional help. There are many other treatment options available like trying a different class or combination of anti-depressants or trying psychological therapies like CBT. Wish you all the best.

Thanks for your query. Zyprexa (Olanzapine) is commonly used anti-psychotic medication which is used in the treatment of a psychotic disorders, severe depression, etc. You seem to be suffering from multiple medical problems which are unrelated to the side effects of Zyprexa. Pancreatitis, oesophagial varices, liver failure, intestinal blocks, etc. are major medical problems which are indicative of a serious systemic illness in your body. So, your problems are very likely to be due to an independent systemic disease and not due to the side effects of Zyprexa. You will need a thorough medical evaluation to find out the possible causes of your serious medical problems and further treatment needs to be given appropriately.

It is quite possible that you feel sleepy after meals as is normally the case.  However sleeping late like in your case and waking up early may result in less hours of total sleep time which may result in daytime sleepiness.  It is also quite possible that you may be able to undo this by sleeping early and waking up at the same time.  You would just need to put behind all those things you were doing closer to bedtime to an earlier time and start winding down early to go to bed.  If this, and relaxation while trying to sleep are still not helping, you may need to consult a doctor.  I hope this helped.

Sometimes medication can lose their efficacy if used irregularly. 60 mg of Fluoxetine is a good dose of the medication.

Thanks for your query. It is likely that the symptoms which you are experiencing are anxirty-related. It is important to understand that anxiety can present with not only psychological symptoms but also with physical or somatic symptoms. Shakiness, burning or tingling sensations, breathing difficulty, etc. are symptoms which are commonly seen in anxiety disorders. It is possible that you could have had a panic attack initially and the present symptoms are residual symptoms of anxiety. It is an unlikely clinical possibility that your symptoms could be due to mercury toxicity. Wish you all the best.

Thanks for your query. 7 tablets a day of Xanax is definitely excessive and indicates that you have developed an addiction / dependence on the medication. You must remember that long term use of benzodiazepines, like Xanax can result in \\"tolerance\\" to the medication - which means that progressively higher and more frequent doses will be required to produce the same effect. So, increasing the dose is not only dangerous but will just push you into more dependence. I would advise you to consult a psychiatrist for further help in coming off the Xanax, and planning other treatment strategies to tackle your chronic pain. Wish you all the best.

I mention this because my fear is that this could be herpes whitlow and I bite my nails often and the skin around them as a compulsion to reduce stress for my OCD . The bumps do not pop easily and when they do the skin sort of deflates and goes red. The liquid is clear like water. When popped they disappear after a couple of days and stop irritating within a few mins. I never thought you could get herpes on the hand or I would have fought harder not to bite my hands! I do not care about my health but rather the effect I could have on my wife or more specifically and children we decide to have as I know herpes in any form can kill babies! And that you can pass the virus on even when not having an outbreak! Not so bad if it s oral or genital but you use hands for everything! Can I hold hands? Again, engage in foreplay? Hold children? Suck food off my fingers? This is crazy? Why didn t I know about this and why is herpes called an STD when you can get it on your hand from a coldsore and give it to yourself through masterbation! I m really stressed and upset. I am also due to start training to be a mental health nurse soon. If i have herpes whitlow can I still be a nurse? Or will I infect others? This is crazy I can t belive you can get something this contagious on your hands!","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. There are two major varieties of herpes - genital and non-genital, and both are contagious. It is possible to get herpes in the hands (herpetic whitlow). However, it is also possible that the lesions in your hands around the nail could be from the reccurent irritation caused due to excessive biting of your nails and the surrounding areas. Since, these you seem to be extremely worried whether these lesions could be due to herpes, I would suggest that the best way forward would be to get yourself tested for the same. So, please consult a dermatologist for a proper physical examination and further investigations. Wish you all the best.

Inderal (Propranolol) is a medication which is prescribed for an increased heart rate as well as to reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety like palpitations, tremors, etc. Both thyroid disorders as well as smoking weed (cannabis) are known to trigger or worsen anxiety problems.

Thanks for your query. I understand your concern with depressive symptoms. Sertraline is a standard antidepressant that is prescribed to alleviate depressive symptoms.

That helped alot and during the summer I was like my old self again and couldn t be happier as I though it was all behind me. Since I started university this year I have been having panic attacks and just general periods of anxiety before assignments are due in and exams. Last week through exams I was sick every one of then, I would barely speak, and my firends said I looked like I had seen a ghost, I have been talking sleeping tablets occasionally when I m so ehausted I just need to get knocked our for one nights good sleep. The incident this week has left me pretty shaken up as I had a panic attack straigt after a running race (I felt anxious all the way down there in the car), I had to run and pretend I was being sick as I couldn t bear everyone seeing me like that as its weird. Since then I came home to my uni flat and have scratched my hands raw, it wasn t until today when one of my friends saw the slashes and scracthes and likened me to one of her friends that was also a cuter that I realised what was I was doing to myself (there are so many scars on my left hand now) Now I have been about to stop crying since, and when I do for lectures my throat feels really tight like I can t breadth, I feel like I m gripped in this massive fear of waiting for another panic attack. After my lecture at three I took a sleeping tablet so I could just sleep all afternoon that to feel like this any more, but I know this is silly and I can t carry on like that because I went through a period of social withdrawal all the way though sixth form and I was known as the weird girl who doesn t leave the library. I don t want it to get to that again as I love my sports clubs. I don t know how to stop feeling like this and to stop cutting myself before it gets any worse.

In your treatment it is better to stop alcohol, as alcohol itself increases anxiety and medicines do not work 100% in presence of substance use. After stoppage of alcohol rivotril can be tapered slowly, but do not stop it suddenly. Till that time do deep breathing exercise, yoga and meditation to decrease your anxiety to some extent.

Agressive behavioural change in the elderly can be due to various causes. Some of the common causes are late-onset psychosis, depression and dementia. Certain types of dementia like frontal lobe dementia can present with a predominant change in behaviour, without any significant impairment in memory initially. Your mother will need a detailed psychological assessment in order to find out the probable cause of her problem. It is not advisable to start medication on your own since they can have untoward side effects, especially in the elderly. Relicalm is an anti-psychotic medication which has to be prescribed only for specific indications in the appropriate dosage.

After a HORRIBLE trip using a gravity bong, i made a pact with god that if he let me live i would never smoke again..And i didnt until a year ago. A year ago (im now 17) ...i was suffering from extreme depression . My new boyfriend at the time, now fiance, smoked weed everyday all day and after convincing me it would heal all my problems i decided to smoke. Everything was wonderful and life started to seem better and i fell in love with smoking weed until recently. In september i got strept and it went downhill from here. It was a normal day (besides the strept)..I smoked and i had a panic attack (heart racing, irrational thoughts, thought i was going to die, ect.)..Not sure what the cause of the panic attack was, i smoked again the next day and it happened again. I decided to wait until the strept was gone to smoke again thinking maybe it was because my immune system being weak. So after a week of waiting, i smoked 2 hits and here came the panic attack. I than decided i was done smoking weed for good. THe panic attacks were to much to handle and extremely scary. The last time i smoked was 9/25/09. I do not miss smoking and dont crave for it but im having constant panic attacks and insane anxiety. Everyday i wake up and it seems to be getting worse. I went to the doctors yesterday and they gave me 2 month samples of lexapro which is an anti- depressant and is supposed to helpwith anxiety attacks . I took my first dose last night and WILL NOT continue taking them. IT was awful, the anxiety and panic attacks were increased by 100. My doctor told me it takes a few weeks for your body to regulate and not to give up, but i cannot deal with these symptoms for a few weeks., Since stopping, my world view is completely off. I feel disconnected from the world. I am here, am able to talk and function but the way i see things is just weird and that scares me the most. I just want to feel normal...and i feel like the way im seeing things is wats offsetting my attacks to begin with. Ill start to think about why im seeing things the way i am, and than my heart starts racing and than its a full blown attack. After reading ALOT on this, i know im not alone and that has actually helped me remain calm all day today. How long is it going to take for my brain to get back to its normal state and for me to start seeing the world normally again? IM going to start excersing and eating correctly and i think that will help alot (one less thing to be concerned about). I appreciate any similar experiences with weed causing anxiety and having panic attacks/distorted views after quitting and of course any advice on what i can do!","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. Cannabis (Weed) abuse is associated with a variety of psychiatric problems, and anxiety / panic attacks are indeed very coomonly reported adverse after effercts. The feeling of disconnection from the world (termed as \\"derealization\\") is also another symptom frequently associated with cannabis abuse. Cannabis can also result in an \\"unmasking\\" or triggering of underlying anxiety-related problems. Lexapro (Escitalopram) is an SSRI medication effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders, but like your doctors have mentioned, some people can experience a transient worsening of anxiety in the first 1 to 2 weeks. There are other anti-anxiety medication which may not have this side effect and can help you. There are also many psychological therapies which can help you deal with the anxiety.

So I went to sleep early to rest it off. An hour and a half later I woke up and vomited, and I did so two more times after that. That night consisted of waking up many times sweating so much my clothes and sheets felt wet, other times parched and thirsty as heck, and a sensation I can only imagine would be labeled delirium . It was borderline hallucination , and I couldn t get up and reach my cup of water, not because I wasn t able to, but because in my own mind my sheets wouldn t let me. It was a bizarre sensation with strange colors in my vision as well. Since then I haven t had an appetite to eat and I have a constant sloshy feeling in my stomach that makes me feel like eating would only make it worse. It s probably noteworthy that I had an upper respiratory illness clear up about a day before. Also two days before that my wisdom teeth were removed, so there s that as well. The pain has yet to subside and I ve lost nearly 10 pounds. It s now Sunday, 4 days after that illness and I still feel no hunger at all. I m just wondering if that is my body saying take it easy or not. I ve had a stomach bug before and it usually improves immediately after I vomit. This is just been a constant uneasiness sense then.","Doctor":"Hi there ~ You seem to have had a bout of food poisoning during the night that you had some fast food.  I would also think that you may have had food laced with some kind of hallucinogen by the description of visions that you mention, although this could happen in electrolyte imbalance that happens commonly when you have that much vomiting and are not replacing it with an isotonic solution.  I would avoid the fast food that you had but would also consult a doctor if the problem persists.

They may be related to stress and anxiety.

If you upload a good quality picture, that can help me in differentiating the two. You have a feature to upload the reports/image by yourself at the right side of the query page, please utilize that so that I can answer your queries better. Allergic pimples will be filled with clear fluid or no fluid at all. This need not any treatment if asymptotic and will resolve its own in a few days. Anyhow, an antihistamine like levocetirizine and steroid creams will speed up recovery. Pimples from folliculitis are usually filled with yellowish fluid/pus. If this is not associated with pain/surrounding edema/redness, this just needs draining the pus with a clean needle and applying antibiotics creams (like mupirocin or povidone-iodine). Otherwise, we will need an oral antibiotic too, for which your doctor will guide you. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Ivan R.

Now, it is good that you have been able to recognize your symptoms early and have sought help. It is important not to avoid social situations or eating outside due to this fear or anxiety, since this avoidance will only end up reinforcing the fear.I would suggest that whenever you get such anxious thoughts, you can practise relaxation techniques like deep breathing or try distract your mind from such thoughts. If you learn to counter the anxiety using these techniques, without avoiding or escaping from such situations, then soon the fear and anxious thoughts will subside. In case the problem is persistent or worsening, please seek professional help from a psychiatrist.Wish you all the best.Regards,Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"Hi I m 19 years old and when I was younger I ve had an Irregular period but as of now I ve been pretty normal.

Thanks for your query. Masturbation is considered as a part of normal human sexual behaviour and is very common among young males in their teenage.

Thanks for your query. Depression and anxiety may have both conscious and unconscious origins. Hence you cannot always pinpoint a reason. It is encouraging to note that you have improved with medication. What i would suggest is to consult your psychiatrist to prescribe a long acting benzodiazepine like clonazepam that would tackle the problem of intermittent nocturnal awakening associated with night mares. Also avoid consuming carbonated drinks/tea/coffee post sunset and keep your place of sleep comfortable. Hope you find my suggestions useful.

However, they are becoming more frequent (happening daily for 4 days now). With the first day having an extreme attack of skipped beats in a row which threw me for a loop while I was at the supermarket. I have been diagnosed with anxiety but for some reason these seem different. It is not so much my heart racing like an anxiety attack it is a skipped beat. Also, I don t have a panic when they are happening like an anxiety attack. I also do not feel dizzy or pass out or any other symptom but complete discomfort! Also, the only other symptom is that I feel like belching when they skip a beat (I know that sounds crazy). I am 46 years old and believe that I might be in the stages of perimenopause. My menstrual cycle, although pretty regular, only lasts a day now. I also seem to have pms all the time! I think I have about 1 or 2 good days out of the month. My husband has said I have PMA (pretty much always!..lol) I did go to a physician for the skipped beats and they happened when he listened to my heart (for about not even a minute). I am on meds for BP ( atenolol ). The doctor told me to up my dose to 50 mg (I was on 25 mg). It hasn t done anything for the palps at all! Also, my blood pressure wasn t high on my normal dose that I was previously on. I am also on Xanax for anxiety. I do take the xanax when the palps are happening and it doesn t help either. The doctor did order some bloodwork and I do have to return to see him after I get the bloodwork done. However, at this time, I do not have health insurance since I started a new job and cannot afford for all sorts of expensive testing. I do have a stressful job working for a family law attorney and have been doing this type of work for over 20 years. Your input would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance! Regards, Laurie","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. It is possible that your palpitations could be anxiety related. Especially, the perimenopausal period is a period where hormonal imbalances can also contribute to changes in mood or an increase in the anxiety levels. It is important to understand that anxiety can present with not only psychological symptoms but also with physical or somatic symptoms. Shakiness, dizziness, fast heart rate (palpitations), etc. are symptoms which are commonly seen in anxiety disorders. However, considering your age and since you mention that you sometimes have \\"skipped beats\\", it is also important to rule out a cardiac cause. So, I would advise you to have an ECG done to rule out the possibility of an cardiac arrythmia. For your anxiety symptoms, in addition to the medication, I would suggest that you try relaxation therapies, like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, etc. Avoiding excessive stress and adopting a healthy lifestyle with regular food and sleep habits and regular physical exercise is also essential.

Help?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. It is important to understand that anxiety can manifest itself with not only psychological symptoms, but with physical symptoms also. It has been found that anxiety disorders are associated with certain neuro-chemical imbalance in the brain and this can cause the person's sensory threshold to get lowered and he / she can become 'hypersensitive' to sensory stimuli, and therefore have a variety of strange symptoms. The underlying anxiety also causes a person to become more worried about these symptoms and soon this worry / anxiety itself then starts worsening the symptoms more. Since this problem seems to be causing you a lot of distress and affecting your school performance also, I would advise you consult a psychiatrist for a detailed psychological assessment and further treatment. There are effective treatment options - in the form of medication or counselling / psychotherapy which will help you overcome your anxiety and its related problems. Wish you all the best.

Thanks for your query. From the descripion of your sister's psychiatric problems, it appears that she may be suffering from a psychotic disorder, probably schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic pschiatric illness where the patient can have hallucinations (like hearing voices - the \\"talking to self\\" is actually the person's response to hearing voices), delusions, deterioration in personal, social and occupational functioning, etc. In addition to the anti-epileptic medication (Oxetol), she has been put on an anti-psychotic medication (Residonia Plus). If her psychiatric symptoms are still not controlled, then you have you go for a follow up, to see if medication has to be increased or changed. It is important to understand that since this psychiatric problem is a chronic one, treatment can only control or decrease the symptoms, and not cure the illness completely. So, regualr medication and follow up is a must continuously. Wish you all the best. Regards, Dr. Jonas Sundarakumar Consultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"Gud night sir, i am from Kashmir.

Thanks for your query. From whatever little clinical information you have provided, it appears that your brother may be suffering from autism or an autistic spectrum disorder. He also seems to be having a significant level of mental retardation (which is commonly associated with autism) and many behavioural problems. Childhood schizophrenia is a very rare psychiatric disorder and has a presentation similar to that of autism. In fact, before the clinical entity of \\"autism\\" was established, most of the children with these symptoms were termed as childhood schizophrenia. Currently, this trend has changed and children with these symptoms are diagnosed as having autistic disorders. Unfortunately, both these disorders are not curable and these persons have to be on medication and need additional support throughout their lives.

They worked great for me, and I had a great work out, great focus. However, at the end of the day, ( 7 hours after supplment) I had a really bad headache . I would love to continue taking this supplment but I m worried about serotonin- syndrome . Please advise?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. Acoording to the manufacturer's information, Detonate supplement contains Dendrobium Extract (Stem), B-Phenylethylamine HCL, Tangerine Extract (Fruit), Caffeine Anhydrous, Green Tea Extract (Leaf), Green Coffee Bean Extract, Asian Ginseng (Root), Black Pepper Extract (As BioPerine®) (Fruit). Among these ingredients, many are stimulants which act on the sympathetic nervous system and increase the body's metabolism. In addition, Ginseng is a herb which is supposed to have serotonergic properties. Also, it is possible that these supplements can contain other ingredients which are not mentioned in the label. Now, 80mg of Prozac (Fluoxetine) is a high dose and you have to be very careful while taking other medication or supplements along with it.

Regarding the medication, both Prodep (Fluoxetine) and Serta (Strtraline) are very similar medication - both are anti-depressants belonging a category called SSRIs. Clonotril (Clonazepam) is a sedative medication with anti-anxiety functions also.You must understand that any medication which you take can have some side effects, and the doctor's decision to give the medication is because the benefits of the medication will far outweigh the possible side effects.

They know that am doing all those rituals like washing hands etc and taking long hours of bath because i feel that am dirty.They know the reason why i behave like this but they do not accept that am suffering from a problem. They scream everytime and say that one day i\`ll definitely kill them with the way i behave. Am really fed up and i feel my life has become like hell. My parents always scold at me and they say all this is in my mind and i must know how to fight with it. I wanted to consult a psychologist without letting my parents know about it but since am not working i depend upon them and i was waiting for the day when i get a job to start a treatment. I always cry when they scream at me and now they have started to keep a watch on me when i have a bath etc but i feel more stressed with their attitude. Yesterday my mum was so angry with me that finally she contacted a psychologist.She did this only to make me fear but actually am happy that finally i\`ll be able to go and consult a psychologist. But what is making me worried is whether the psychologist will understand my problem?Will my parents understand me after that and try to atleast support me?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. I understand that you must be going through a difficult time trying to deal with your obsessive-compilsive symptoms. I'm sorry to hear that your parents are not being understanding and supportive to you regarding this. Unfortunately, many people have a poor understanding of psychiatric disorders and some even have a negative attitude towards them. Anyway, it's good that you have got a appointment with a psychologist. Don't worry, psychologists are well-trained professionals who will be able to explore and ascertain your psychological problem. They will also be supportive to you and advise you and your parents on further management of your problems. Once your parents are able to understand the nature of your problem and that it requires professional help, I'm sure they will be more understanding and supportive. Wish you all the best.

Marriage is a relation which needs tons of understandings. We take it for granted that its going to work but it takes efforts for it to work. If its doesn't work, then there is not much an option than to take professional help. You can discuss with both the partners and convince them for a marital therapy.

It can be some personality disorder but then she needs to be examined by a psychiatrist. We don't know the exact age of your sister. that would have helped us in providing you a better answer. If it is adolescence, then children at this age do exhibit this kind of behaviour but it is actually very transient and will reduce as she grows old and becomes more mature.

Yes anxiety can present with many types of physical complains including abdominal pain. However abdominal pain can also have many different reasons . So firstly you should get a USG abdomen done to rule out any organic cause. If not then then you should treat yourself for some psychological causes. If USG is normal you should contact a psychiatrist who can involve you in some talk therapy to ventilate your guilt and make yourself think rationally. Hope I am able to solve your query.

Thanks for your query. Unpleasant dreams and disturbed sleep can be frequently associated with stress. You seem to be going through a stressful period currently, due to the loss of your job. So, it is quite possible that your sleep problems are being caused due to your stress. The night sweats can also be a manifestation of night time anxiety / panic attacks. However, there are also a few medical conditions which can result in freqent night sweats like hypoglycemia, certain infections, hormonal imbalances (such as in menopause), etc. The recent worsening of this sweating could also be due to the flu and the associated fever and chills. So, I would suggest that you try stress management and relaxation techniques in order to tackle your stress. If you are feeling overwhelmed by your stress and the related symptoms, then you need to seek professional help from a psychiatrist. There are effective treatment options available - in the form of medication or counselling / psychotherapy which will help him overcome your stress-related problems. Wish you all the best.

Your CXR is normal or NRA-No radiological abnormality seen in roentgenogram. The shortness of breath is due to Hyperventillation Syndrome which is an accompaniment of Anxiety Neurosis.

In your history you have not actually mentioned your most important Vital Parameters- Pulse Rate//Resting Pulse Rate., Blood Pressure and Respiratory Rate. These are very important to differentiate between Anxiety and Hyperthyroidism.In addition to CXR, you should have undergone Thyroid Function Tests /baseline blood and Urine Tests and a resting ECG in 12 leads. If all the above are Normal, your Anxiety Neurosis will be confirmed., Pls take a consultation with Psychiatryst for \\"Talk Therapy\\" or Psychotherapy to analyse the root cause of anxiety and then \\"Medicine Therapy\\" or Pharmacotherapy as decided by your Psychiatryst. Avoid hot //spicy//oily// food. Take over the counter antacids. Walk for 15 mins after food. These will help to regulate Hyperacidity which may cause above type of pain in Acid Peptic Disorder(APD).

Thanks for using healthcare magic for your queries. I can understand, whats going in your mind. Even in a single country, there are many sub-cultures and you should always expect some variation in them. You did what was good when you were young and you felt good about it. it was a selfless behaviour. One can always control oneself. Expecting others to behave in the way you want, is now a selfish thing. Only the fact  that they are not behaving the way you do, doesnt make them wrong. Please try to understand that its only your behaviour, feeling and emotions are under your control and nothing else. If you dont think so much about these facts, may be you will change your feelings and mood as well. Try getting yourself involved in some hobbies or stuff that you always wanted to do. Spend some time with your family. If these things do not help you, you should seek a Psychiatrist to discuss these issues in detail.

You require a thorough psychiatric evaluation for an independent depressive illness and may require anti-depressants or psychotherapy (eg cognitive behavioural therapy) for the same. In addition you need to remember that stress can precipitate migraine attacks and you need to learn stress management techniques from a psychologist. Hope you found the information useful.

First and foremost you should get a thyroid test done to evaluate its levels. In case if they come normal then in that case there is possibility of you having a depressive episode or anxiety disorder. However a final diagnosis can be commented on only after a detailed knowledge about your symptoms. You should meet a psychiatrist. You will benefit with antidepressants and behavioural therapy that he would suggest. Hope I am able to solve your concerns.

Thanks for your query. You need to know that attention deficit disorder always has its onset during adolescence and on many occasions also associated with hyperactivity symptoms. Poor concentration might be feature of other disorders like depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. It may also be due to plain lack of interest in what is being done or specific learning disability. Hence, i suggest you undergo a thorough psychiatric evaluation for the above said disorders following which appropriate psychotropic medication or psychotherapy can be initiated.

Thanks for your query. Effexor (Venlafaxine) is an antidepressant medication and your symptoms appear to be withdrawal-related. When taken for prolonged periods and stopped, antidepressants can cause withdrawal symptoms and rebound anxiety or depression.

I understand that you must be going through a difficult time with your symptoms. It appears that your symptoms seem to be predominantly anxiety-related. Moreover, you have mentioned that the EKG  was normal, thus ruling out a cardiac problem. Vyvanse is a stimulant drug which can cause or worsen anxiety problems, and this could be contributing to the recent worsening of your anxiety. It is important to understand that anxiety can present with not only psychological symptoms but also with physical or somatic symptoms. Fast heart rate (palpitations), chest discomfort, vague tingling sensations,etc. are symptoms which are commonly seen in anxiety disorders. There are effective treatment options - in the form of medication or counselling / psychotherapy which will help you overcome these anxious and worrisome thoughts.

I am hoping a massive codeine OD will do it and I know roughly 500-800mg of codeine can be fatal so I am aiming to take around 1200mg if I can get my hands on it. I know it is selfish but I honestly don t know how I can continue living feeling the way I do. These few days home from the psych ward were supposed to be good for me but all it has done was remind me why I wanted to die in the first place. I don t want to hurt my kids by dying either and they are the only reason I am still here but I feel having me the way I am will only hurt them more. I did not choose to fall pregnant, both my children are the result of rape, and I continued my pregnancies because I do not believe in abortion and I love my kids with all my heart . I just don t know what to do anymore, I don t know how to live.","Doctor":"Hello....... We consider active suicidal thoughts as a psychiatric emergency. My advice for you would be to contact your local psychiatrist or suicide helpline immediately and try to ensure you are  re-admitted to the psychiatric ward. Treatment and alleviation of depressive symptoms require time and the symptom relief would only be in a graded/phased manner. Wish you speedy recovery.

It usually results in an adjustment disorder though on occasions it can be severe, what we refer to as acute stress reaction. You would have to get over this initial phase of anger or depression over the next couple of months following which if required (if these symptoms persist), we would recommend appropriate medication or psychotherapy measures. At this juncture  supportive psychotherapy by a (clinical) psychological counsellor might be appropriate for you.

Thanks for your query. I understand that you are very upset and disturbed due to your daughter's decisions. But I would also like to let you know that the role of a psychiatrist is not to influence or change anybody's individual decision. If your daughter is a major and has made an independent, thoughtful and strong decision, (which may be against you), then it not the role and not ethically right for any doctor to influence the person according to your decisions or preferences. But a psychiatrist can do a psychological assessment to see if she is making any rash or misinformed decision without a clarity of thought and accordingly help her have a clear and patient thinking before making the decision. The decision is ultimately still hers. If you would like to consult me, I come for visiting consultation at V.K. Hospital Purasawakkam, Chennai (Phone: 044-26426922). Wish you all the best.

Thanks for your query. Tancodep is a combination of impipramine (antidepressant) and diazepam (sedative). Sudden discontinuation of the medication is not advised as it can result in withdrawal symptoms which can be characterised by irritability, restlessness and poor sleep. I guess your cardiologist might have discontinued the medication considering it's poor cardiac safety profile.

It could be infatuation that is normal for this age which would require sorting out the issue with help of a few common friends or the person concerned (your boyfriend) himself.

Now, this group of medication is used to treat anxiety as well as sleep disorders.

There are also other non-addictive anxiety medication, which can be taken safely for long duration.

The treatment of depression is said to be successful only if all the symptoms of depression remit. There are plenty of different drugs available for depression and anxiety and if you find relief on one drug, then you should continue with the same drug. The most common reason for the relapse of your symptoms while on treatment is generally an ongoing or new stressor. You also should evaluate yourself for thyroid. One should also consider adding psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy along with the medication as research has proven that a combination of therapies is always better than any treatment alone.

One year before we consulted a doctor in Delhi he prescribed: Symbal 20 mg Frisium 10mg, twice Clobazam , once at night Olanex, twice, 2.5 mg in the morning and 5mg at night Nitrosun, one tablet day and half at night Liberum, 5mg day and 5 mg at night He was better under medicine, however still was experiencing the attack. I was not comfortable with so many medicines. November this year again went to Delhi and consulted another doctor. After polysomnography test he prescribed him Depran 10 one tab. at night and Zapiz, 0.25 mg whenever he is in bad mood ( the later does not help him much). When he takes the medicine at night, he is feeling okay till next day evening, and then his mood is decorates and experience the same attacks. However, still he has difficulty with sleeping. I would appreciate if you honorable online doctors can advise him. Can he continue Nitrosun, which is a sleep medicine whit his medicine? Worth mentioning that I trust fully the doctor that we consulate, but he is far away from us ( in a second country) that difficult to reach him frequently. Appreciate your advice Best regards Gh.M Salem Email: YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for consulting healthcare magic. Salemsahab, from the history you have narated, your son appears to have some kind of seizure disorder. That can also be confirmed by getting and EEG done. The drugs mentioned in your first prescription are right, but i should say that they are too many. He probably doesn't need these many drugs.  If he has some abnormal EEG findings, starting him on a single anti-epileptic drug such as carbamazepine or leveteracetam will surely help him. if there is good control of his epileptic attacks, his mood symptoms and sleep should improve automatically. I understand that the distance is the problem. hope you get a good psychiatrist nearby who can consult you frequently. Thanks."},{"Patient":"i have two questions i have this weird tight sensitive felling in the top of my stomach , like in the muscles and i have really bad axciety always making things worse than what they are.

I think I might have bipolar disorder ... but don t know if I m just making myself think I have the disorder but I actually don t. So, I ve been through a really though life. I ve never met my father, he lives in USA and he replies rarely to my messages on Facebook, my stepfather cheats on my mother and live us and my siblings without money, my grandma died in January and I was really close to her and I left Italy and relocated in UK only five months ago and I miss my friends , and here I don t feel accepted . My mood swings very easily...it can change like three times in a day or more. I can wake up happy, then I don t know how some bad thoughts come in my mind (for example, I imagine someone that I care about dies) and I m depressed and want to cry for hours. Then, everything came back as before, and I m normal. Or it can happen that I wake up happy, then I get to college and I start thinking that I m not good enough, that the others will always be better than me. And I stop talking for all day until I come back home and I m normal again. Then some days I can be very active and like jump around the house, sing, laugh. The thing that worries me the most is that I see things that are not real. My biggest dream is to become a singer and every night I pretend to be on a stage with my band and sing to an audience. That s not the big problem, my mom said she did that too when she was little, everybody does. But the problem is that those people, those places ... become real. I can see clearly those people and spaces, I can interact with those people, touch them, talk to them... I can even held long conversations. I remember the first time I saw a person that wasn t real ... I was 12 years old. It was a famous person, and idol of mine (even now this happens) and this person was watching everything I was doing... but it wasn t creepy. He was just there, standing by my door. And since then everywhere I go I feel that someone is watching me. That year I even started thinking about suicide . I thought about it two or three times. I ve self-harmed but I never went too far. I was just pulling my hair, biting my arm, scratching my wrists and veins with a scissor but I never bleed . Only scratches.. but I had the thoughts about ending my life. Now I don t think about killing my self, but sometimes I feel so disgusting, so fat, so ugly, so stupid, so not good enough that I hurt myself. Last time I scratched my wrist too much and I also burned the skin on my arm because I did it too strong. I m also suffering insomnia from three weeks apart. I can t go to bed before 5 am and I m super active in those moments, I never feel tired. Then I go to sleep and I sleep only two hours. And when I wake up I m super energetic, like someone that slept eight hours or longer. And this alternates to days when I sleep too much. I ve also lost interest in thing that I ve been doing for years. Okay, my passion was always singing .. but at 11 I started playing the clarinet and piano. I ve been studying it since last year in Italy. Then I move to UK and I started college. The first two months were brilliant. I got all Distinctions and Merits and I loved going to school. But then I don t know why I just started hating it ... my passion for singing became even stronger and now I don t even practice the clarinet anymore and I do a lot of absences. In three weeks (I go to school three days a week) I ve been going to school only three or four times because I didn t want to go because I don t like it anymore. I don t want to do it anymore. I want to sing. And play the piano. I think that in clarinet I suck even if everybody says the opposite. But I don t enjoy it anymore. I don t know if this is...maybe a normal thing for a teenager? Thanks in advance for your reply and sorry for any mistake I made, English is not my first language! Angela","Doctor":"Dear Angela, Firstly I would like to appreciate your efforts in writing and describing your problems in such details. One thing that is clear from your write up is that you are surely having a problem which needs psychological help. Its too early and foolish to make a diagnosis with this much of information and moreover, more vital information will be available when some psychiatrist will interview you about your problems. You certainly have some problems with your cognition (thoughts) and you need to be put up into a Cognitive Behavioural Therapy by an experienced psychiatrist/ psychologist. Personality disorder also appear to co-exist. Harming your self is of the biggest crimes, and you should always seek help whenever you get an urge to do any act of that sort. Please visit a psychiatrist who will interview you and start you on some sort of psychotherapy sessions. I hope I answered your concerns."},{"Patient":"Hi, I take 5mg Ramapril a day for high b pressure, yesterday despite that my b pressure was 172 over - 80 -or ninty not sure which!! so have to have ecg etc next week, my question is ---- I am so anxious since she told me I could not sleep last night (Isuffer from anxiety anyway) so, can I take KALMS ?as I can feel my pressure is not good!

At this point he really sh?? me up.That evening he was watching a vampire movie with lots of blood and guts. He does not sleep well. His bedtime routine is sleeping between 1am and 3am. He gets up for half 8pm. He s got a lot of stress . He speaks jiberish whiles sleeping and makes sudden movements. Once he was having a nightmare until I woke I m up, asking him if he was ok. I think I saved him from his nightmare. Can you please help and give some sort of explanation. Thanks kera","Doctor":"Hello Seethalkaursingh, The problem you have tried to describe, doesn't appear to a nightmare. Its more closer to being a night terror. Please understand that such complains are very common and increase at the time of stress. People generally don't discuss them as they don't cause any problem for themselves. Epilepsy / seizure disorder is another concern and he should be investigated by an EEG.  There are many unanswered questions in your write-up. But one thing is for certain that your husband surely need some help from a psychiatrist. Please ask him to visit one who would like to explore many his areas. Hope this answers some of your questions."},{"Patient":"hi docktor , my name is jagpal..im 18. n so i have been loving this girl..for 5mtnh..n she was playng wit me all the time..i love her 100 per. truely i nvr cheat o lie to her..she left me bcuz i found out that its was love triangle..so i cried to her..n i did so many thing to make her come back..bcuz i juz love her so much..i tried to comit sucd .n it nvr hapnd..i cut my self..alot of time..its already 9mthn without her ..n im still in the pain..i cant sleep ..i will get angry very fast.i will start punching my self for no reason.i will get very agresive.i can see her every where ...which ever girl look like her ..i will scrd..i cant breath when i think about her at night..!!! .can u help me what wrong with me..n what is the way to over come ...pls tq","Doctor":"Dear Jagpal Dave, Hi! The best part of your problem is that you really want to solve it and come out of it. From the description that you have given, it appears that you seem to be suffering from an adjustment disorder bordering on depressive disorder. If you leave the previously mentioned medical jargon, you have developed a psychiatric condition, a minor one though, which surely needs some psychiatric help. A supportive psychotherapy will surely help in relieving your problems. I recommend that you should soon get hold of a psychiatrist and start seeking some help. There is no reason to delay, if you already have made some suicidal attempts. Hope I am able to solve your concerns."},{"Patient":"Hello. I have Emetophobia .

What would you recommend me to do to relieve some of my fears?","Doctor":"Hi Anna, Fearing that you will become sick by staying with sick people cannot be termed as emetophobia, as emetophobia is more of phobia about the vomiting, the act of vomiting or feeling nauseated. The problem you are having is more of negative thoughts that we frequently encounter in conditions such as depression. First and foremost, you did not mention, since when are you having this problem. If this problem is due to a depressive episode, the symptoms can be controlled by taking appropriate medications like SSRI and also cognitive behavioural therapy will also benefit you,wherein you challenge your automatic thoughts.

I understand that it must be difficult to deal with depression at a young age. Though symptoms such as palpitation and diziness can occur due to anxiety (which often co-exists with depression), yet it is important that you have a proper evaluation done to check for any medical problems. Palpitations or dizziness, especially on exertion, can sometimes be due to certain medical conditions like heart problems, anaemia, etc.  So, it is important to rule out possible medical causes before concluding that the cause is likely to be psychological. I'm sure that your doctor wil keep this in mind when you go for a check-up.

Depression is a mental state characterized by a pessimistic sense of inadequacy and a despondent lack of activity. It is an emotional disorder, and nothing to be ashamed of. But often, people who are in depression are suffering from pessimistic thoughts about themselves. These pessimistic thoughts lead to even further depression making a cycle that gets hard to stop.

Your symptoms are likely to be anxiety-related, and don't seem to be typical of specific medical problem. Now, it is important to understand that anxiety can manifest itself with not only psychological symptoms, but with physical symptoms also. If you are having recurrent such symptoms or having difficulty managing your anxiety / depression, then I would advise you review with psychiatrist for further treatment. There are other effective medication like SSRI antidepressants which can help you with both your anxiety as well as depressive symptoms. In addition, there effective psychological therapies like CBT (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy) which can help you deal with your problems. Trying relaxation techniques, like deep breathing, and engaging in regular physical exercise can also be benefial in controlling your symptoms.

I have tried many different antidepressant medications . I have recently read about brain scans/imaging technology and trying to find the closest place to me to be treated. We dont have that technology in XXXX. Do you know of any resources to help me find a place with this technology?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. I'm sorry to hear that your anxiety and depression problems are persisting despite trying different anti-depressants. Though a majority of people respond well to anti-depressant medication, there can be a smal proportion of people who do not have an adequate response. Usually in such 'treatment-resistant' cases, the management approach first involves investigating for any causes for treatment resistance. Common causes include recurrent or ongoing stress, personality issues, or even certain medical causes, like thyroid problems, certain vitamin deficiencies, etc., which can cause treatment resistance. These complicating factors have to be looked into and treated appropriately, in order to improve treatment outcome. Don't get frustrated or dejected since there are still many treatment options available, like trying a combination of anti-depressants, thyroxine supplementation, augmentation the anti-depressant / anti-anxiety medication with other psychiatric medication like an anti-psychotic or a mood-stabilizer, etc. When medication is ineffective, psychological therapies like Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) can also be effective. Regarding, your query about brain scans . imaging techniques, you must understand that these are only diagnostic instruments and have no therapeutic role. However, there are certain treatment methods like Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), which can be effective in treating depression.

I previously suffered panic attacks. Have had chest x-ray and EKGs & Heart ultra-sound and all is recorded normal. 35years old, smoker, take 10mg Citalopram & 2mg Diazapam daily. The chills in my legs concern me. Any advice please? Thanks Tom","Doctor":"Hi there, Thank you for writing to us. With the symptoms that you are mentioning i.e.\\" intermittent cold chills on my left thigh and lower leg leg (no pain), this is sometimes accompioned with upper left arms numbness/neck and left shoulder pain\\" with your history of GAD this all goes in favor of the diagnosis of GAD and panic attacks. The great thing is that all your tests have been normal. The chills in the legs that concern you could very well be due to panic attacks or anxiety and these chills happen due to narrowing of blood vessels in the legs and hands. This narrowing of blood vessels is due to increased amount of adrenaline in your body as a result of the increased anxiety that you are having. So this is nothing serious or anything to worry about You should discuss these symptoms with your psychiatrist next time you visit him/her. Kindest Regards"},{"Patient":"PTSD vs bipolar.

Depression comes and goes Anxiety stays","Doctor":"Dear Rachelwesson, Hi! I totally understand your concern for your health and its obvious that you are suffering a lot. To comment, whether it is a bipolar disorder or not, we need to have a detailed history of you and the same is lacking in the information given by you. We agree that there was a significant stress in your childhood, but the same can predispose you to depression, PTSD as well as anxiety disorder. Although you are taking \\"Valium\\" its more of a cosmetic relief and you may land up with benzodiazepine dependence and hence it will be always wise to start you on some form of SSRi medications. The other best option will be to consider psychotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy.  basically you need to see a psychiatrist for a detailed history and evaluation , who would like to run a few psychological tests on you, before he starts you on either psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. I hope this answers your concern."},{"Patient":"i ve been diagnosed with depression and bipolar 1. i ve had this diagnosis for years. i want to know, i have this feeling in my heart , sometimes it ll feel like it bursted into a million pieces, or that its sinking, sometimes it ll feel like a hole/empty space and sometimes i feel like its not even there. can it have anything to to do with my diagnosis and is there anything i can do about it. i am suicidal and i m afraid of what im capable of with this feeling persist.","Doctor":"Nic !

I usually hear them talking about me at night or hear him speaking poorly of me when I am in the other room, and in reality he is very passive/aggressive so I consider the possibility of it being true, however every time I ask my mother swears I am hearing things and they never speak of me. I have been on Zoloft since I was 18, I am now 30. My father had me put on it because I was fighting with a friend and sad, now I have been on it for years. I used Vicodin and other opiates, never heroin though, for roughly 10 years off and on, and only became a daily user toward the end which resulted in a rehab stay for 90 days the beginning of 2010. I also used meth for 10 days between rehab stays, a mishap with another client there. The first stay was 44 days and the second I made the entire 90.

When I visited my doctor out here in Vegas, I was in rehab and put on Topamax in CA, she changed me from 2-25 mgs to one 50 mg a night. Three weeks later I hear voices.

Only there are 2-3 things in total that I repeat but sometimes it increases. Other than this I have some other symptoms as well. I have unstable digestion system, sometimes constipation and sometimes I have to go to washroom little after my meals. Also now I am feeling like I am unable to concentrate. I am a student and I m 22. When I try to focus, it looks like stress on my mind is increasing. Look like everything is being stuffed into my head. Also, I am getting slower and slower day by day. Now when I look back, I remember this slowness started around 6-7 years ago. And I really did not noticed it then. I remember that was the time when it started taking me more time than usual for daily tasks and I remember that was the time when I started reaching a little late at school. From them I can see it increased now. Now I take lots of time while eating and bathing. Late in university class on almost everyday. And all this increasing my stress and I tried my best now to do thing quickly but nothing helped so far. My face also doesn t look fresh. I look sluggish and people say you look in some deep thinking all the time. And yes, I can notice it myself that my mind doesn t stop anytime. It keeps on thinking about different things. Whenever I lay down and free, it started working in one direction or another. With this I have lots of hair dropping everyday, and many of them getting white. I also have continuous big pimples on and around my nose. I use to masturbate even before adolescence . Last night I had a wet dream and lots of liquid flown out. After that I had a very painful tingling sensation(like my penis is going to blown out) and my penis remain fully erected, probably stronger erection than normal. This happened to me earlier 3-4 times in life. The painful tingling sensation goes away when I sleep again after wet dream and when I wake up in the morning everything is normal again. But I have noticed that whenever that happens, I get some really big reddish pimples on or around my nose. When I wake up today, I can see a few on them on right side of nose. I looked swells from right side and really hurts upon touching and do not have any liquid yet. But I said this happened to me earlier so I can say that it will be having liquid(blood etc) after a few days. I m not a native english speaker so please forgive for any English related mistakes. I would really appreciate your help. Could you please tell me what is the problem with me. Edited: As I said earlier, I have problem concentrating. I also forget about things especially names etc... When I started to think about certain things, I keep on repeating my thoughts.... and start thinking or doing sometimes from the start again...... Also I got very angry and flare up on slight things when I am hungry, and when I take meal then everything is again normal......and I also notice that I get tired fairly quickly as compared to my age, especially when I am using my mind.

The current symptom profile is suggestive of mild Generalized anxiety disorder in you. You are always on a tight side, and seem to worry a lot and remain preoccupied with your somatic symptoms. you seem to have an irritable bowl which is common with generalized anxiety, hence your bowl habits tend to be moody. The wet dreams followed by pimples on nose are unexplainable and I recommend you to consult a dermatologist if the swelling persists and becomes troublesome. Do not worry as there seem to be no symptoms of depression or OCD currently. You may benefit from a course of Low dose anxiolytic agent ( say a Low dose SSRI with pregabalin) along with daily practice of Meditation / Muscle relaxation exercises. You may need some initial training in learning formal procedure and may consult expert for it or there is enough genuine material on net to learn meditation techniques /  relaxation exercises."},{"Patient":"I am from Chennai.

Because of my hospitalization, Child Protective Services removed my then 3 year old daughter from my care as I was incapable of correctly taking care of her at that time. That made the whole situation worse. The only thing that truly kept me alive and going is the fact that I have another daughter who needs me and it wouldn t be fair to lose her mommy like she did her sister. She is now back home with me which is wonderful but it makes me very sad to realize that Kylee IS gone.. and she is not coming back. The one year mark is quickly approaching and I am very, very worried about ruining Mackenzie s Christmas. Given the fact that Kyky passed away one week before Christmas.. It is going to be very hard for me to deal with. I have also been diagnosed with severe & chronic PTSD with anxiety . I think back on the accident SEVERAL times a day and see images I d much rather forget & no matter how I hard I try they will not escape my brain... it gets to the point where I have to go to my bedroom and scream in a pillow and frantically cry. I also struggle with not knowing whether or not she was hurting... ( she was alive for one hour after the accident ). I freaked out and nobody would let me near her (nor did I want to see her like that) ) so I stayed away, hoping that she would somehow pull through. I very much regret that now. I wish I d held her and talked to her and told her I was there. How do I live with regret and these images and the guilt of It s my fault! if only I had done this.. or that? I am her parent.. I am supposed to protect her from any and all harm! ... They had me on Ativan for a couple of months and then took me off because they were afraid that it was preventing me from grieving. It has now been almost a year and I will grieve for the rest of my life but I would really rather find some help to ease the pain. Do you think it is time for some medication and if so, what would you recommend? Can you also inform me of any coping strategies . Any help is greatly appreciated. God Bless. 3","Doctor":"If there is hypnotherapist nearby, you may contact. To accept the situation in your deep unconscious mind, as I think you need to relive the event in hypnotic regression.

There are many other newer antipsychotics these days which are effective with less significant side effects like olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole etc. Acute psychosis consists of episodes of psychosis having onset within 2 weeks and with proper timely treatment, can be treated with short term treatment easily. However long term treatment is required in recurrent cases (as in your case). Schizophrenia is a chronic illness which requires usually long term treatment, perhaps lifelong.

There are several options available, both in the form of medication as well as psychotherapy for your depressive and anxiety symptoms.

Few people, especially in Tamilnadu, India (who are very much devoted to some god) - when they do their spiritual rituals - suddenly they dance little violently for about a minute and then they fall unconscious. In few minutes, they wake-up and become normal. I do not think they do it purposely, there are no materialistic benefits for them. People understand that incident as: the spirit of god entered into that being for that few moments. 2. Kundalini, the energy that is present at the root of the spinal cord for all human beings, (for more information on this topic please refer in WWW.WWWW.WW . When I do meditation , in strong feeling connection towards guru (bakthi), there is an upward force, I do start with body shake and then start levitating, especially in the presence of my Guru.

He tells me he can get his clutter under control when there is normal stress , but he gets so stressed at times that his clutter piles up and his house doesn t get cleaned. Obviously I don t live with him but we are good friends. He said if he knows (acknowledges to himself) that it (clutter issue) will never get better that he will lose hope. What advise can you give on this, as we are very close yet I don t think I could marry the man. It is not my style to have clutter everywhere and when I cleaned for him before a few times, it went right back to the way it was, if not worse. Thank you.","Doctor":"Adderall - Used for: Treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy (sudden and uncontrollable attacks of drowsiness and sleepiness). It may also be used for other conditions as determined by your doctor. Adderall is an amphetamine. Exactly how it works is not known. Adderall affects certain chemicals in the brain that may affect attention span and behavior. Adderall and dextroamphetamine is a central nervous system stimulant. It affects chemicals in the brain and nerves that contribute to hyperactivity and impulse control. Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (L-lysine-D-amphetamine; sold as Vyvanse) is a psychostimulant prodrug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes. As opposed to Adderall, which contains roughly 75% dextroamphetamine and 25% levoamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine is a single-enantiomer (dextro) amphetamine formula. This pure formulation may reduce side effects, but certain individuals exhibit a better clinical response to the mixed isomer preparation. ADHD persists into adulthood in about 30 to 50 percent of cases. Those affected are likely to develop coping mechanisms as they mature, thus compensating for their previous ADHD. Along with taking medicine some sort of BEHAVIORAL THERAPHY is also needed. Then he will be far better than now. Best of luck."},{"Patient":"hi..my mother is 47..she has sleep disorder for past 16 years now for which she took medicines on and off..now for last two years she is on regular medicine by a psychiatrist .she has been taking clonazepam ,paroxetime,mirtazepine and zolpidem(sos)..She is hypertensive..now i think she is losing her mind.None in our family wants her to take medicines regularly..please guide me sir. i want my mother to lead a healthy long life..","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting your query.

The idea of your family not wanting her to take medicines is wrong. Please think for the benefit of your mother. Psychiatric illnesses are usually chronic; they persist for years.

I did see a neurologist in 2007 for neck pain but after filling out the paperwork she sent me on a wild goose chase of a sleep study, MRI of my head and an EEG - all of which showed nothing. I was diagnosed with Chronic Lyme Disease w/coinfections in 2008 after being misdiagnosed with other conditions over a twenty year period. I am alarmed at the frequency as of late. In the past I might have three episodes per year but in the last few months, since moving to the new building, I have several per week, sometimes more than one per day. Any suggestions would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query.

He has been advices to take Clozapine 100mg to 300mg. however, when we have administered him 100mg clozapine, he is not able to even do any activity for more than 5 minutes. he is drowsy, tired , does not even want to step out of house.. Another doctor on seeing these symptoms reduced the dosage to 50mg daily and added joykem & parkin 2mg to it. all these medicines have not cured him and seems have dangerous sideffects. Earlier Oleanzapine was been adminitered to him (before clozapine for nearly 5 years).Dr can you please advice as how much time dosuch patients take to be perfectly ok ? and whether these are right medications to be given?? The problem faced by patient is: Not been able to concentrate, to continue his course beyond 1 year, carry out daily work like bathing, brushing etc.,taking initiative, thinking maturely. He does not hallucinate or hear any voices. He does not want to talk also","Doctor":"I dont think only for those above symptoms he need too many drugs like clozapine, parkin(trihexyphenidyl), joykem. There must be some other features of psychosis. A detailed mental evaluation is needed. Any way the drug is right for psychosis but symptoms are not verifying the diagnosis. Please go and consult a good psychiatrist. Or you may give a detailed history and course of illness otherwise it is very difficult to comment on the medicine."},{"Patient":"I have a friend who is going thru a stressful time. His best friend was in an accident & may die. He has been visiting the hospital & spending time with the friend s parents. He says hes trying to be strong for them but that he is a mess & will go to therapy next week. What im curious about is that he says he cant talk without wanting to vomit . I have had anxiety attacks etc & I have never experienced this nore ever heard of it. Any idea what could cause it? He has told me that he used to be very anal. (His words) he has also said he has OCD .","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. I'm sorry to hear about your friend's difficult situation. I hope his therapy helps him to manage his stress. Now, regarding your question, anxiety can manifest itself as psychological as well as physical symptoms. The physical manifestations of anxiety can vary widely and can literally present with symptoms of any system in the body. Moreover, when the mind is anxious / in a state of arousal, there can be a heightened perception of sensations and stimuli, which would otherwise be ignored by a non-anxious person. So, it does make sense that your friend's nausea sensation could be anxiety -related. Please encourage him to see a psychiatrist for a detailed evaluation and management.

It is likely that your symptoms are due to a psychological cause - probably a depression or anxiety-related problem. Moreover, it's clear that you are quite stressed out and are in significant distress.  Also, since you've had a recent history of depression for which you discontinued medication permaturely, you have a risk for relapse of symptoms.

Welcome to Healthcare Magic and thanks for your query. It is very unlikely that you could have Multiple Sclerosis when your MRI brain scan is within normal limits.

The doctor prescribed Serta tablets. I would like to know if it is OK for a 16 year old and if there could be any side effects","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. These symptoms could be indicative of an emotionally unstable personality disorder or even a psychotic disorder. Your daughter needs a detailed psychological assessment (which will include a detailed exploration of her symptoms as well as past, personal, social and childhood history, plus a mental state examination) to make a definitive diagnosis. Serta (Sertraline) is an antidepressant medication which is relatively safer when compared to the older antidepressants and 50mg is a low dose. However, this medication will usually take about 2-3 weeks to take full effect and there can be a mild increase in anxiety symptoms due to the medication in the first few days. Sertraline has been approved for the use in children and adolescents, but some studies have shown that SSRI mdication can cause a slightly increased risk of suicidal ideation among this age group. This doesn't mean that these medications should not be prescribed. In fact, the benefits which these medication provide clearly outweigh this mild risk, but it's just that patients should be more cautious.

Anxiety may not be the case with you - random and no relation, as you say. It may be Mitral Valve Prolapse , anomalous pathways and so on. Proper treatment needs proper diagnosis. First thing to do will be to see a cardiologist and get examined - especially during one such episode.   In this situation, we start with routine ECG, ECHOcardiogram, blood tests (cell count, sugar, thyroid).  If there is no clue, we go further - 24 to 48 hour ambulatory ECG monitoring (Holter).

It at first only originated in my left hand (starting probably 1 month ago) but now my palmar veins in both hands are for the most part always enlarged. They are very agitating and at times, tender to touch. They occasionally cause numbness/ tingling in my fingertips. My capillary refill is greater than 2 seconds.

The first test several months ago was 5, but this time it is 4.72  He's in very good health, excellent body weight, exercises regularly and eat good.  My question is.  He's a self employed graphic designer and sits A LOT at his desk.  To the point he complains about his tail bone hurting.  He doesn't have much meat back there he says....My question is.Can sitting for long periods of time irritate the prostate and cause his levels to be high.  He has NO systems and his office exam was fine. He is 54 years old.","Doctor":"Hello, There have been several studies showing any manipulation like a digital rectal examination could elevate a serum PSA because it would squeeze on the prostate however the increase is very minimal around 0.5 that could last for 3 days after the rectal examination. With your husband case theoretically, it would or it may increase the PSA because of his prolong sitting. Whether it would cost the increase in the abnormal levels it's really hard to say. I suggest your husband gets a free PSA and a total PSA ratio and that will determine if you need a biopsy or not. multiparametric MRI of the prostate can also be an option prior to deciding whether you need a biopsy or not. In the end, only a properly done prostate biopsy would say if your husband is currently harboring prostate cancer or not. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

She used to blame her state of affairs such as short hair/ skin infection , menstrual problem and other aliments on some of our close relatives. she does not do daily tasks such as cooking, cleaning the house, washing clothes, leaves all of them too her mummy (aged 59 yrs). She started getting depressed somewhere in 2004 when she failed to perform to her expectations on XII Std scoring only 52% thereby denied getting admitted to some college. BCom Correspondence Course of Delhi University she took up; result was the same, got compartments in the I and III Yr course. She did complete the course after much pursuasion with a gap of one year. Simultaneously, she tried to pursue Company Secretary Course, completed only Foundation Course and in the first yr after that, the assignments which sent was returned to her advising her to focus on the questions in it and reply accordingly. From then on, she felt quite dejected. She did apply for NIIT Computer Course without our concurrence, forced mummy to shell out cheque for tuition fee, but after delivering it to the institution, stopped attending classes. v told her there was no need to apply because vr already having computer; she did not listen to us. She has been applying for job at times but without confiding with us. She used to venture out voluntarily for interview but failed to get anything. Thereafter, she did join a 2 yr course in South Delhi Women Polytechnic but after completing a successful one year, she remitted tuition fee for Rs 8,000/- by forcing us to part with for the 2nd yr but after a day she decided to stop attending once for all.

But for that you need to visits a near by psychiatrist and get the required prescription. As far as your desire to give her medication with her knowledge , than you need to admit her in a institutional setup as in her illness patient consider them self absolutely fine and think that there is no need of treatment. Another question you asked is about her marriage. Mostly people advice that get such people married and change in place will make a difference. But I would suggest you to think many times before taking such step, as marriage does not cure such illness and it may even act as a stressor and aggravate it. Also you should let the other party aware of her condition pre marriage because after marriage they will eventually get to know her condition and you may have to go through a lot of legal hassle .

He takes the things very lightly. His confidence is at the bottom level and is totally confused about his future mission and objective. He is totally undecided what to do in his life.

Thanks for your question...I appreciate your interest in helping children with hyperactivity problems. The first step in dealing with a hyperactive child is a comprehensive assessment. This is because the causes of hyperactivity are really varied and further management depends on the probable cause. The causes could range from a normal variant of child behaviour to disorders like ADHD or underlying intellectual / learning disorders or behavioural disorders or even a manifestaion of stress. Evaluation is best done taking into account the child's behaviour in multiple settings, like classroom, among peers, at home , etc. Assessment should also include the parents to look into the parenting methods or look for any stressors at home. Similarly counselling and therapy should not only involve the child but the parents and sometimes, class teachers also. Behavioural techniques using positive and negative reinforcement, social skills training and providing a structured environment for the child to practice his / her skills can help reduce hyperactive behaviour. In certain cases, prompt referral to a psychiatrist for a clinical evaluation would also be important.Wish you all the best.- Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"since sep 2011 signal was connected to my brain WHEN I AM IN INDONESIA,everyday that is roming mostly inside my brain and body.unknown reserchers are reserching on my body with that signal.i don t know from where they are connected me,i don t know from where signal is connected to me.they got whole of my brain private data and they are showing on my retena(PICS,GRAPHICS,VIDEO),THEY ARE PLAYING MUSIC,SPEECH BY HEAR,I AM LISTENING WITH MY HEAR.THEY GOT 100% OF MY BRAIN PRIVATE DATA WITH THAT SIGNAL.AT FIRST DAY SIGNAL IS ROTATED INSIDE MY BRAIN GOT FULL OF PRIVATE DATA.THEY REMOVING,EDITING,COPYING MY BRAIN INFORMATION.SOMETIMES THEY ARE SCOLDING,COMMUNICATING WITH ME BY MY HEAR USING SIGNAL.I GOT SOME OF DATA FROM THEM,SIGNAL NAME IS SESMA GRAPHIC SIGNAL .THEY ARE DOING MUCH RESERCH ON MY BODY WITH THAT SIGNAL .I AM GETTING PAINS WHERE SIGNAL IS ROMING INSIDE MY BRAIN.I AM GETTING TOO MUCH TROUBLE WITH THIS BRAIN HACKING TACHNOLOGY WIRELESSLY BY USING SIGNAL.I AM NOT USING ANY BCI DEVICES.I NEED ASSISTANCE FROM YOU.TOO DANGEROUS TECHNOLY IN THIS WORLD.PLEASE HELP TO ME.

These include  Physical problems, such as injury to nerves or loss ofblood supply to the penis. Other health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, anxiety, anddepression. Side effects of certain medicines. Stress. Drinking too much alcohol or smoking. The exam, lab tests, and sometimes mental health tests can help find out the cause of the problem. Treatment is based on cause and includes avoiding tobacco and drugs and limiting alcohol. Also, talking about the issue with your partner, doing sensual exercises, and getting counseling may be beneficial. Finding and then stopping medicines that may be causing the problem. In some cases, you can take a different medicine that doesn't cause erection problems. Taking prescription medicine that can help you get erections. These include pills such as sildenafil (for example, Viagra), tadalafil (for example, Cialis). In most cases, this is sufficient for treatment but you should just be patient and do necessary tests.

He was in the hospital for an hour and sent home to be watched for 3 days. Two days later he set fire to his room and tried to kill himself. He is now in the hospital lock up room and hears voices. No alcohol or drugs in his system at either time. He has been depressed before all this happened and won t tell his parents why. Are the voices and attempted suicide from the accident alone?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your question... Since you say that he had been depressed even before the accident, it is more likely that his current psychiatric symptoms are related to the depression. When depression becomes severe, psychotic symptoms can appear (like hearing voices, false beliefs, etc.) Moreover, since he was well enough to be sent home after the accident, it is unlikely that he would have suffered from any significant brain damage. Depression can be caused due to neurochemical imbalances in the brain and need not be stress related always. So, it is notsurprising that he did not reveal anything to his parents. With appropriate medication and close follow up he should be able to come out of his depression.

You have been taking a combination of medication - including a sedative, anti-depressant and mood stabilizer. Your current symptoms may be due to two possibilities - discontinuation / withdrawal effects of the medication or recurrence of your underlying psychiatric problems. It is definitely not advisable to suddenly discontinue medication without the advise of a doctor.

Yesterday a young cousin of mine got injured pretty badly. I was the one who cleaned his wounds and applied antiseptic lotion to them. I even checked closely whether the wounds needed stitches or not. Till that instant was completely OK. But when i was walking him up to the Doctors Clinic, suddenly my head and my stomach started spinning badly and my vision became extremely unclear. I almost vomited a couple times and felt that i was gonna faint but finally somehow managed to reach the clinic where i became better after lying down. Everyone says that Im suffering from Blood Phobia but that cant be right because when i was cleaning his wound and checking them, i didnt feel any bit uneasy or disgusted. And i myself have had bad history of injuries in my childhood when i easily used to watch the doctor stitch up my skin. So what was this nausea all about?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your question...Phobia is a type of anxiety disorder where there is excessive and irrational fear of something, leading to avoidance of that fearful stimulus / object. In your case, the appearance of your symptoms seem to be corelating with the incident of closely obseving blood / injury and so is likely to have been the cause of your nausea. But still, in order to technically qualify for a diagnosis of blood phobia, you need to have had persistent such aversion to blood / injury, along with avoidance of such situations (...which you say is absent). It could be that the straining of your eyes to closely observe / clean his wounds along with fatigue may have caused the nausea. However, if these symptoms keep repeating again in similar situations, then it is more likely that you have a phobia.Wish you all the best.- Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"Hi my name is hashim i m 39 years old i m suffering blood pressure since the age of 20 doctors recommended me blood pressure tablets along with anti depressant and relaxent.

Thanks for your question... It is possible that your symptoms could be manifestations of anxiety. However, headache associated with nausea / vomiting and visual disturbances may be indicative of a Migraine. Moreover, the stabbing pains in your chest also seem concerning. So, I suggest that you have a proper evaluation done by a doctor, including a thorough physical examinations and basic lab investigations. Relaxation techniques like breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation technique, yoga, etc. can all help in relieving stress. In addition, you can seek the help of a psychotherapist to guide and help you learn better coping skills, stress management techniques, etc. There are also certain specific forms of psychotherapy like Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) which can be quite effective in dealing with anxiety, stress and negative thoughts. Wish you all the best. - Dr. Jonas Sundarakumar Consultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"Hey, I really need help. I self-harm and though I don t want to, I feel I really need to stop.

Standard treatment includes counselling, and medicines like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine etc. But these medicines may take 6-8 weeks to provide a relief. For an interview you can not use anxiolytics like alprazolam as they will make you drowsy. A better alternative is propranolol (market name-inderal) 10 mg before the interview, (but if you have any other medical illness then it should not be used without consultation with doctor). Inderal will be very helpful in relieving stress of interview by stopping symptoms of nervousness.

At certain times during the day I begin to feel out of touch with everything, as if my perspective has suddenly changed. A very common trigger to these feelings is observing a spacious room, however this feeling comes on frequently at any time of the day for no specific reason I can determine. Soon after experiencing this feeling, I begin to worry that I am going crazy or that at any minute I will begin to hallucinate or lose my mind (For the most part, going crazy or losing my mind are the biggest and only worries I have during these episodes). It is as if I have become overly aware of my thoughts. My mind becomes consumed with these worries and I am unable to concentrate on anything other than these thoughts. Watching TV or going out with my girlfriend often takes me out of these episodes; however the thought of being thrown back into this unfamiliar state of mind haunts me almost always. For the past 2 weeks or so these episodes have been effecting me for the majority of the day however the feeling of anxiety, in my opinion, seems to only be a result of these feelings and worries I get while being affected by these episodes. The symptoms of anxiety that I do get however are as follows: shortness of breath, perspiration of hands, feelings of being trapped in this state of mind, worry, and once and awhile insomnia . Depression is often a result of this as well. Some physical symptoms that I assume are related to all of this is diarrhea for every bowel movement the past 2 weeks, headaches , and exhaustion. The most concerning physical symptom to me however is that I have been waking up every morning with what I can best describe as pressure in my head, a slight headache, and light headedness; these feelings subside progressively as the day goes on. Apart from these symptoms I am physically healthy, I eat very healthy for the most part, keep myself very well hydrated, and work out frequently. I was just hoping someone on here would be able to give me an idea of what I’m dealing with and let me know if it is in fact only anxiety.

Paxil (Paroxetine) is a medication belonging to the class of anti-depressants called SSRIs (others are Fluoxetine, Sertraline, Citalopram, Escitalopram,etc) - basically the newer generation anti-depressants which have been found to have relatively lesser side effects. Usually, the decision to prescribe medication for depressive symptoms is based on the severity of the symptoms as well as the patient's preference. In your case, you seem to have been dealing with depression for quite some time and also seem to have anxiety / panic symptoms as well. I quess your doctor has made a decision to start you on medication as the symptoms are prolonged and may have been causing you significant distress.As far as Paxil goes, it is a medication with proven efficacy for depression, panic disorder and certain other anxiety disorders also. Now, just like any medication, Paxil also has a few side effects - usually these are minor and tend to disappear within a few weeks time. Some of the common ones are gastritis, temporary increase in anxiety (which subsides with time), some sexual side effects, etc. But remember, just because the drug info gives you a list of possible side effects, it doen't mean that you are going to experience all of them. I am not sure which side effect that you have read about is scaring you or whether you are actually experiencing any... One more thing is that usually people tend to get very worried about the \\"Black box warning\\" (which comes with all SSRIs, including Paxil) regarding the possible adverse effect of increasing suicidal ideas specifically in children and teens. From my clinical experience as a psychiatrist, I can tell you that though this means applying caution when prescribing them to young people, most psychiatrists find that in adults, the benefits of treating the depression usually outweigh the small risk involved. (because untreated depression itself is a huge risk for suicidality and a other morbidity)So, if your doctor felt that you needed medication, it may be a good idea to continue them, without getting excessively worried, but do keep a eye out for any side effects and report them promptly to your doctor.All the best.Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"Hello Dr. I am 33yrs old married women.

The aggression is usually after mild stress, and aggressive episode usually followed by regret. It usually starts in early adulthood and decreases with middle age.

I can understand your concern for the symptoms from which you are suffering. It is good to learn that you are aware of your condition and interested to get well. You are unable to detect the taste of food since a few days, this is a medical condition called ageusia. It can be due to some problem in your olfactory organ. Most of the time people suffering from ageusia have associated smell problems. If you are unable to smell your food properly automatically the food  will taste bland. You need to be examined by an Otolaryngologist or ENT specialist and get a general clinical examination done to diagnose your problem if any. Maintain a good oral hygiene. Use an antiseptic mouth wash after and before each meal. Change your brush buy a new brush with soft bristles, do not forget to floss your teeth. Get your dental problems treated if any. Be cautious if food tastes bland you will slowly start losing health. Change your lifestyle. Eat what you like. Make food colourful, presentation should be good. Use spices, visit restaurants for a change, visit supermarkets to chose your own food, you can consult a doctor and take some enzymes to trigger your taste and appetite. You should also eat papayas they will help your liver function well and trigger your taste buds. Sugarcane juice is equally good. You should have a few blood tests done to rule out any diseased state of your liver. Liver is the main organ of your body. Take fiber rich food, keep bowels clean. Stay well hydrated with soups, juice, water and re-hydrating fluids. Take dietary supplements and vitamin E after consulting your doctor. You are already acquainted with your wife's problem, it should not affect you. Visit libraries, friends, coffee shops, brisk walk in the mornings. Eat well and stay fit. Have a nice day, take care.

But nowadays the problem has deteriorated such a way that his attitude has become a problem not only for my mother but for us also. My mother is reeling under a psychological pressure. We feel very sorry for her plight she is sustaining from my father. My father suspect every one. Every man in the bus, in the train, in market or say whenever they are out of the house. Even do not spare the neighbors who are officers with me. He passes shameful, vile and unbearable sarcastic remarks to my mother who is at the age of 58. My father suspectsthe the servants of the house that they keep evil eye on my mother. Oh, it is intolerable for all of us, leave our mother aside whose life has become just like a hell who rarely visits out of house due to her husband suspicious attitude. She does not spare the lelations instead. He doubted my my mausa ji and one of my cousin brother. He can doubt anyone But it is high time when my mama ji, mother s younger brother visited us. We all were sleeping in common room. But after some days my father was suspicious to this relations. He was sitting while keeping an eye on the bed where brother an sister were sleeping on common bed. In common room there is single doublebed over which my mother and mama slept while other members were adjusted otherwise in the same rooom. Thus he suspected the conduct of my mother Age of an opposite male does not matter for my father. He may suspect a boy of 18 years. Some times I doubt, if I continually sleep for a couple of days with my mother on same bed, he could doubt our relation too. It needs mention here that my father even suspected other boys or the relations or friends of my sisters when my sisters were unmarried. He was suspisious in the same way as he teats my mother, whenever the members of opposite sex was staring at my sistes or trying to be intimate with them. This is the history and your precious advice is sought for. Thanking you. Prithvi Pal Singh aged 42 years.","Doctor":"Dear prithvi by now you should have noticed that your father is ill and is suffering form a psychiatric illness called Senile Psychosis. In this condition every thing around him looks suspicious and you have to remember that the experience of suspecting others is actually real to him because his mind is no longer able to differentiate from reality and imagined world that he is living in. This usually occurs due to excessive production of a neuro chemical called Dopamine. hence he needs medication urgently some times in the thought of unfaithfulness he may try to attempt suicide hence i advice you consult a psychiatrist near your place about his condition get medication for him and put in his food with out his knowledge if does not like to visit a psychiatrist. We also have to evaluate your father for any tumors in the brain hence a CT scan would be good idea, along with tests to make sure he does not suffer form dementia(forgetfulness)."},{"Patient":"Hi, i know a young man of 29 years who had been musterbating for a long time.

While studying for 1st year B.Tech and parallely preparing for MBBS entrace exam in1996, one day morning i have lost my control and my heart started beating very fast. i could not concentrate on my morning pray. since then, condition started getting worse more and more. Gradually i have got a feeling of total isolation from normal life. i lost interest in every thing and even once thought about suicide . I started taking antidepressants and instead of a total terrible isolated mechanical life i finised my B.Tech by taking additional 4 years. Then i got married and now i have two kids. i have been working here in saudi arabia as project electrical engineer since 2007. since this incident i have been leading a total mechanical life without any aim in life, every time thinking about how to get out of this terrible situation. For last 14 years i have been under medicine and for last 5 years i have been taking fluvoxin 100 1-0-0 and clonotril 0,25 1/2-0-0. Still now the condtion is not at all better. i feel that i have lost all the mental development which i have gained from childhood to my age of 18. Mind is fully mechanical. i cannot feel properly even the time phenomena as past present and future. Feel like a totlally closed and inert mind accompanied with a lot of unnecessary unasswerable questions mostly religious which are hunting all the time, i am not getting any enjoyment, satisfaction or mental involvement even in daily prayers.

I have been struggling with my weight and have been on exercise and diet pills and diets for most of my life. Over and above this, I have been diagnosed as well as un-diagnosed with bipolar several times. I have been able to cope with and without medication, but find that I am extremely tired when not using medication. Right now I am on Wellbutrin 150SR once a day in the morning and Epitec 100 mg at night. Recently, I tried some MDMA and was able to work for the first time in years like I never worked before - I worked and studied for over 8 hours straight. It was wonderful, as I really struggle to focus my mind as I always seem to have a million ideas running around - I have a very active mind and have been told I am very intelligent and extremely bright, I just cannot focus or apply myself or work very well for any extended period of time. This happened on three different occasions and not only I, but also my partner was extremely shocked and amazed at how much work I was able to finish as well as the quality of my work. Also, the vividness I was able to recall the work I did with was astounding and I remembered things in the finest detail. For the first time ever, I was able to apply myself and focus my thoughts in a way that I have always suspected possible, but have never experienced. Now, I now I cannot be using MDMA for prolonged periods, and even taking it more than once can be dangerous, as the purity could bbe questionable. But something in this compound triggered some kind of energy release and attention span activating substance in my brain allowing me to focus and work like never before. Surely there must be something that is not as harmful that can produce the same effect? Could it be that I dn t have bipolar but ADD or ADHD? Or could my bipolar medication be prescribed in the wrong dosages? Would a medication like Peracetam have any beneficial attributes for an individual such as myself? I am paranoid about my weight and the way I look, so I do not eat healthy per say, and I cannot see myself without the use of dietary pills and supplements - am I instead suffering from an eating disorder? I would love to be able to work like I did last week, but I cannot be taking MDMA all the time - that is just insane! Should I consider a supplement such as 5-HTP? I have been taking 5-HTP for a few days now with positive results but nothing cataclysmic - my anxiety did however lessen considerably. Your input will be greatly appreciated - I intend on seeing some kind of a professional, but would like to narrow it down to 1 or maybe 2. I have seen so many psychiatrists over time and they all tell me something different. Some clarity would be nice. Especially since the effect of an illegal drug had such profound positive effects and it was not just me alone who thought this - others who have seen the amount of work I did in one night and the quality of it and the fact that I was able to recall everything has also been astounded.","Doctor":"It does not seem to be of bipolar, ADHD may be a possibility MDMA should not be taken with medicines that you are taking now Admission to a good psychiatric center where multiple psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers will examine you, observe you will perform some test etc will help you to get a definite diagnosis and plan of management"},{"Patient":"Hi!

Please advise me on what I can do to alleviate these spasms. I have only told my mum about these. I am married with children who have now grown up. Nobody else in my family is aware I have any problems whatsoever. Kind regards. Dawn","Doctor":"Hi, from your description it appear that you have some form of anxiety disorder. You may also have some pathology related to teeth or jaw which cause spasm and anxiety is exacerbating your jaw spasm. Sometime anxiety disorder itself can present as jaw spasm, but it is better to rule out oral pathology. As problem is prolonged or severe and leading to frequent interpersonal problems, then for assessment and treatment, you should visit specialist like psychiatrist and dental surgeon together. I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you. Wish you Good Health.

How long should I expect such a change in his personality. Of course surgery can bring on some depression , this is so not him.

I have ADHD and don t want to be on medicine because it can affect appetite and I already struggle to eat enough (just due to not being hungry, having the bad habit of using work as an excuse, etc.). I know the low blood sugar greatly affects my mood, so stepping up my eating can help. But honestly, typical anger management strategies don t help because of the impulsivity. My main issue is that when I m stressed at work I can t stop the repeated swearing outbursts and self-destructive behavior that feeds itself. I need to know how to handle things better. Focusing isn t an issue anymore as I ve learned to adapt. It s the anger and frustration and feeling overwhelmed I don t know how to deal with. I ve read books, used my own knowledge, etc. I saw a counselor (can t afford to now) I liked but to no avail. They can only give you so many strategies, I know that, the rest is up to you. But I can t seem to control my brain. I know ADHD is a defect in dopamine D4. How do I overcome a brain problem and all the anger, etc., that goes with it?","Doctor":"Hi, You are a mental health professional, do not want counseling or medicine and want to improve. In this situation, first, you should be non judge-mental for your treatment. Because you can not improve without intervention for such problems as you are wishing here. In my view medicines will help you greatly with counseling. So, meet psychiatrist and continue following anger management techniques. If problem is prolonged or severe and leading to frequent interpersonal problems, then for assessment and treatment, you can visit specialist like psychiatrist or psychologist.

My brother is a 26-year-old Mentally handicapped individual with some SERIOUS health issues going on and noone can come up with anything, which has now left him oxygen dependent and on Lasix to keep fluid off his lung and heart, and no signs of getting any better. Let me start from the beginning as I believe this is all linked someway somehow. About 4 months ago, my brother presented with severe leg swelling on one leg from knee to ankle. My parents took him to Dr, and they treated him with infection from a scratch on his leg. The swelling did not get better and he was having troubles walking. Please keep in mind that all his symptoms have been observed as due to his mental challenges, he never tells us when anything is wrong, without much prodding, (life is good in his eyes) . My parents took him back and they tested him and the sore on his leg had MRSA , therefore they started treating him for MRSA. Again he did not get better, and the finally did a ultrasound of his leg to discover he had a severe DVT from the knee to the ankle. He was therefore put on blood thinners which the DVT eventually did resolve and they were going to keep him on blood thinners for 6 months then take him off and do further testing to see what may have caused this in such a young, active young man. Then at the end of June my parents noticed he was having trouble breathing. When they asked him what was wrong, he said nothing initially, and as they observed him longer they realized he was really struggling to breathe. Therefore, they took him to the ER, and discovered he had a pericardial and pleural effusion . They drained the fluid and ran cytology tests on it which came back negative, but the color of the fluid was milky. They also created a pericardial window to drain the fluid off his heart. His white count was elevated and initially he had blood and high protein in his urine as well, which later cleared. They sent him home on a Sunday. Within 2 days he could not even get out of bed without heavy breathing and again he thought he was okay, so they took him back to the doctor. They did a chest x-ray to discover he had a massive effusion in his chest already. He was admitted and due to the severity they had to put a chest tube in each side and be had to be intubated to keep his oxygen levels up. They drained 2 L of fluid off one lung and 1 L off the other. His white count was elevated. They began running more tests on his heart, from echo to ultrasounds to many other tests. This showed his heart was working extra hard to pump. Eventually he stabilized was extubated still with tubes draining a lot, and they did an MR of his heart which showed his pericardium was thickened to 9 mm. They thought they would have to perform a pericardiectomy due to constrictive pericarditis . They did a heart cath to verify and it showed that his heart was constricted, and by the time they did the cath, his heart actually was pumping ok. The pericardium was still obviously thickened and showed some abnormalities; however was not constricting the heart, so they did not perform the pericardiectomy. They could not pull the chest tubes though as he was still putting out a lot of fluid, but now was clear, with a bloody-tinge. At this time his white counts started dropping as well as his hemoglobin. They ran several blood tests and discovered he was extremely protein malnourished (which is hard to believe as my brother is 6 foot 3 inches and weighs 300+ pounds). He was also severe anemia and had very low lymphocytes, monocytes. They tried iron supplementation and discovered this was making his iron levels worse. They even tried IV iron and still made his iron levels lower therefore they discontinued the iron. He was taking protein shakes for the protein, and this helped stabilize his protein levels. They also did a CT scan of his abdomen and discovered he has splenomegaly. His liver function tests were normal. His CRP and Sed rate were elevated. At this time, they transferred him to a higher level of care as they could not figure out what was going on with him. The University Medical Center ran even more tests, and said everytime they ran a test they ended up with more questions than answers. They were sure it was some kind of inflammatory condition such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis as my mom has rheumatoid; however all these tests came back negative. Rheumatology signed off on his case saying it was not a rheumatologic condition. The fluid eventually slowed in his lungs and they pulled one tube and then the next. He still requires at least 2 L of oxygen via nasal cannula, but hospital had to send him home as that was his only requirement and insurance would not allow him to stay longer. One week after discharge of being in hospital for nearly 3 weeks total, he is still protein malnourished with anemia. His white cells are still extremely low. They ran immunoglobulin tests on him and discovered they were nearly non-existent. Therefore between his low white count and immunoglobulins, he has no immune system. His lungs have began filling up again in his lungs, and therefore the doctor put him on Lasix to help get rid of fluid. We will not know until next week if this seems to be helping. My parents believe it is helping with his breathing however his ankles are still swelling. He is still requiring his Oxygen. He also had a bone marrow test done, this came back negative for cancers. However, they did say they are still waiting for the iron studies of the bone marrow, but I am not sure what that will really show, except his iron deficiency. Everyone is at a loss as to what is going on. None has any answers and every doctor keeps passing the buck to another and now we are back to his primary care, which I am not confident at all he can handle this. To me it seems this is above so many doctors heads, we need to know where to go. We are treating symptoms as he is now on blood pressure medicines and a medicine to keep his heart rate down as it gets too high, and oxygen and Lasix. This is a 26-year-old, how can he live like this for life. There has to be someone who can help us. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, or anything we can suggest they test for. Obviously this is something rare no one has seen, so we just need to get to the right doctor or someone who has seen this before and can help.","Doctor":"Hi, We can understand your pain, suffering and frustration due severe nature of problem of your brother.

It was normal for the first five days, but I had it for an extra five days. I already got my period again on 8/13, but it was not due for at least another week. I had no pms symptoms this time, like sore breasts. I don t usually have cramps , but today I had pain in my left stomach a few times. I do not have a tampon stuck in me. More back ground on me: I went to an orthopedic two months ago for a reocurring pain in my hip. 6/28 they found out I have follicles on my left ovary and a cyst 4.8x2.6x3.5 cm between my uterus and ovary on my right side. After my vaginal ultrasound the gyne said I was probably ovulating during the test and we ll just watch the cyst in case it grows. A year ago I found out I have a large benign lump in my breast which I will be getting removed. The day my honeymoon began, my eyesight worsened so I had to start wearing my glasses all the time.

He suggested me to check my TSH and it is 7.50! I never had any kind of such issues and I am wondering how come all of a sudden my TSH shows 7.5 and become panic and depressed? Is this because of any side effects of those nasal sprays which I sued? Another interesting thing is whenever I feel depressed, I take two tablets of cod- liver oil and I can feel the difference. Within few minutes the stress feeling behind my head vanished and I am so relaxed!","Doctor":"Persistent depression or anxiety is very unlikely because of the rhinocot or otrivin.

I ve been with my boyfriend for 3 years now and we are each others only partners. The first few months of us having sex was normal, and by normal I mean, enjoyable, I had no problem getting wet, my body produced enough lubricant of its own, clear and slimy, normal! Then after about 6 months in, something changed. My body stopped producing its own lubricant, I was dry and has this thick creamy white discharge that would show up during sex. Then, it started to smell. I freaked out, went to the doctor, got every std test ran, everything. Turns out I had a yeast infection . So i took the prescribed antibiotics , they didn t work. Went back, turn out I have a bacterial infection . Took the prescribed antibiotics, the smell would go away for a few days and then the discharge and smell would return. I must have gone to the doctor over 20 times in the past 2 years and every time the rush me in and out and prescribe me antibiotics. Finally after a half a year of getting no where, I decided to research this myself. My mom is really into homeopathic remedies and has always told me to stay away from antibiotics. So I finally decided to listen to her. When the symptoms returned (as they always did) instead of paying to go to the doctor and having them give me the same medicine, I went to the health food store and got acidolphis (the good bacteria) since I had taken so many antibiotics, I had no more healthy bacteria in me. So I inserted the acidolphis pills directly into my vagina , ate tons of probiotic yogurt, used PH balanced fem wash, only wore cotton panties, peed and washed after sex, everything. And I got to say, this worked wonders. I really wish that doctors would give us this information, but of course their loyalty lies with the Pharmaceutical companies. I gotta say, all this worked. But I wasn t back to normal. I have never be able to get wet the way I used to, we now have to use lubricant. And there is always the presence of some thick discharge, which I never had before. Now, I know doctors say that some form of discharge if always normal, and it varys in different women. But I know my body, I know how sex was before all this, and I know how sex is now. Something is off. I most recently noticed a fishy smell AGAIN!! This time I tried the yogurt soaked tampons (inserting them into my vagina), Folic Acid pills, Deodorized garlic pills and Caprylic Acid pills and again acidolphis pills. The smell went away almost instantly!! But now, when I have sex, it starts off with a cream thick discharge and then a few minutes in my boyfriend is covered in clumpy white discharge. Never- the-less do I need to say that it has had a toll on our sex life, and despite how wonderful he is about it, I do not feel sexy when thick white clumps are coming out of me. I do not know what else to do. I just want to be normal again.. and dealing with this for TWO YEARS is getting overwhelming and frustrating!!!","Doctor":"Hi, First it may be harmful to self medicate self from apparently safe preparations and delaying medical management from specialist. Home remedies can be safe for minor problem but not for condition involving infection, like in your case.

Most people today are considering me arrogant or hostile, which I am not. I respect them, but I don’t know, what makes me feel so hostile towards them.

Wife is a self-employed workaholic perfectionist that places unrealistically high expectations on everything and our schedule is creating a lot of tension on our relationship as we simply do not have time for anything nor does she see the need for us to spend time together as a couple. I work days and she works nights/weekends leaving me to do the majority of the house stuff, yard work, cooking, cleaning, fixing, etc. I eat relatively healthy (providing I don t skip meals - rarely eat breakfast and sometimes skip supper and snack later at night), however I don t exercise aside from running around after the kids and cleaning the house and whatnot. My concentration has gotten progressively worse over the past few years and have determined I have ADHD and have been taking dexedrine for about 10 months. It helps immensely with focus and energy levels however I have started smoking again and have been drinking 2-8 beers a day in the evenings to relax for the past 9 months or so. I don t really get drunk or hungover and it never affects job performance, home responsibilities, etc. (although it is a complete waste of money) However, recently I am just feeling blah. I have had a problem with acid reflux for years and take Zantac almost every day. I m usually tired (I get about 6 hours sleep a night) and drink more coffee than I should, I m on edge and constantly walking on eggshells with my wife (mainly from marital problems and her being very critical, demanding and overbearing), anxious and our conversations usually turn into arguments. Now I m having a bit of a stomach ache, dark stools, and just a feeling of being stuck/trapped and unmotivated. The stress has been compounding yearly since the birth of our first child 6 1/2 years ago and shows no signs of slowing down so I need to find a better way to deal with it or eliminate the cause of the stress. My wife handles (aka: thrives on stress) much better than I do and has no need for down time, hobbies or anything of the sort. I m the opposite and need that to unwind and feel rejuvenated. We never hang out with friends or family and my only social life exists via keeping in touch with friends via email/texts or the couple times a year I go on a fishing trip or out to a concert with friends. It s the classic all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy scenario. However, any attempts at doing things for me (painting, outings, etc) start another fight in my wife accuses me of being selfish. I m sure the physical symptoms I am experiencing are a combination of many of these factors however I am wondering if there is a cause for concern to seek medical or psychological help. I am taking L-theanine to help mellow me out a bit and that works well. I ve tried not taking the dexedrine (10mg spansule twice a day) but if I don t I m bagged and my concentration is horrible. Any suggestions would be great as I am in a small town and the doctors here are not very helpful/resourceful and there are no mental health providers in the area and I m too busy to drive to go see one.

But since you have mentioned that you felt a chest pain it is recommended to definitely take an appointment with a cardiologist to check if everything else is alright. If yes, then I feel you are absolutely healthy and fine. The sudden rise in bp and the uneasiness after the rollercoaster ride is very natural and obvious  It potentially triggers high pulse rate. Try to stay calm in any kind of stressful situation.This will be helpful to you all the time. Hope this helps you. Stay healthy!"},{"Patient":"I had sufuring form IBS from 1990 to 1995.

I do understand that it must be a hard period to yourself. But i believe i would be interested to know the age of your husband and also some facts about any other condition he suffers from, like Diabetes/ Hypertension (high blood pressure)/ Asthma/ Alcohol use etc details. But, from whatever the brief history that has been provided, i believe your husband might be suffering from what we call as \\"Acute Confusional State\\" also called a s \\"Delirium\\" technically.

On several occasions , it would be difficult to find a proper cause in which case, many a times symptomatic management itself would set right the condition.

You are suffering from palpitation and it is essential to find the cause. Palpitation may be due to heart problem or may be due to hormonal problems. If cardiac and non-cardiac evaluation is normal then you may have panic attacks. Do you have fever/ increased sweating/ watery shit/ weight loss? Do you have squeezing sensation/ sweating/ difficulty in respiration/ respiratory difficulties with change of posture/ swelling in feet ? Have you undergone thyroid profile/ serum electrolytes/ ECG for heart previously? What was their reports? You should consult with physician / cardiologist and should go for following investigations: complete blood count, serum electrolytes, thyroid profile, renal function test, epinephrine, norepinephrine and urianry VMA level, ECG, 2 D echo and coronary angiography if needed. Palpitation may be cardiac problems such as VPCs, APC, PSVT, Junctional rhythm, ventricular bigeminy and trigeminy. These heart diseases may be diagnosed by ECG and holter monitoring for 48-72 hours. If still not helpful then you can go for electro-physiological studies of heart. Hormonal disorders may be thyroid disorders and pheochromocytoma. These disorders may be diagnosed by above mentioned hormone analysis test. As you have history of family mis happening, there may be possibilities of panic attacks, GAD and PTSD. You should consult with psychiatrist in such case. Take care, Dr. Mayank Bhargava"},{"Patient":"I am so tired, spacy, and forgetful all of the time.

Me and my wife have been going through a case of infedility from her end. we have had some very troubled times in the last 3 years, however the last 2 years have been most turbulent. Initially when I got to know about my wife s extra marital, I was very disturbed but I tried talking to her and gradually after the feeling sank in, I have tried innumerous times to talk to her. I have been performing well in the sexual sphere of life since we got married, but it never affected us as my wife was very co operative. but of late since the extra marital came to light, I am more keen on performing well that is no. 1, and no. 2 is that I want the relationship that has gone sour to get back on track. The last 2 years have seen me fall from an annual salary of 11lacs to below 7 lacs.She doesn t trust me, love me or consider me an important part of her life anymore, she also is secretive and doesn t reveal what happened or what went wrong, which is proving to be very difficult for me to deal with. On one hand I am dealing with professional loss, on the other sort of a personal loss & on the third front, am a disaster right now in terms of my self confidence & trying too hard to please her emotionally, mentally & physically. I feel I am good for nothing and we have a 5 year old son. I lost my parents at a very early age and have no siblings, my family starts with my wife and ends at my son.My in laws are separated so it s no help either & our s was a love marriage. Kindly advise and help.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for writing in. Dealing Infidelity is definitely very stressful.It would measure you patience, make you angry and upset.Creates a lot of uncertainty as well. I totally appreciate the effort you have taken from your side to understand and convince your wife. It looks like you have lost hope in yourself and you marriage.Keep up the faith. Try to understand where it all went wrong.With that you will be able to figure out probably the exact reason .Confronting your wife ,can to an extend help your wife to open up.You may already be aware of everything but give her confidence by reassuring that nothing would go wrong even after her confrontation. Look at all the aspects of a marriage right from trust, faith, emotional stability,financial matters.ask her about her expectations in all of these aspects. If you think your wife is still not ready to open up give her sometime. Blaming would do no good but spoil the relationship all the more.Stay with her throughout but do not question her or try to please/convince her emotionally. With that (mostly)guilt will make her confess everything to you. Reminding her and yourself about all the good things and positive things like your son,that happened in your entire marriage would also give you and your wife the confidence to gain it all back again. If  you think you and your wife have both equally understood where things have gone wrong(if especially your wife is willing to) start it all over again by forgetting the past.Do not remind her or remind yourself about the infidelity once its over.Forget about it and move on to your future. As of now take a break! go for a small vacation with your son and your wife(if she is willing to). Carry on with your other responsibilities like work and looking after your son. This will distress you.

Anything in excess is definitely not good and so is the anger if you are feeling that its affecting your relationship. Considering that you are aware of it, makes the job easier for yourself and the therapist to proceed further. Also the easy irritability in the family as well as your mother suffering from OCD is something to be considered as well. Looking at all the above factors, i definitely feel that Lexapro (Escitalopram) 10 mgs is one of the medication of choice and i hope that it should be helping you. Simultaneously i recommend asking help from your Psychiatrist to help you with anger management skills as well, or to refer you to a trained clinical psychologist who can help you with it.

I would advise that you seek a referral from your physician to another physician who has been trained in treating adult ADHD and this other physician will most likely be a psychiatrist.  Psychiatrist tend to have more training in ADHD in general.  A psychiatrist can also be a wealth of information on other coping mechanisms for your ADHD as well.

Thyroid disorders sometimes present with depression. Once the thyroid disorder is treated, the depression might get cured. Another thing you can do is tell her to do regular exercise 5 days a week, as exercise releases endorphins in the body which might make her feel good. Also tell her to sign up for yoga or relaxation classes which will help her to relax, and might relieve her from depression. Hope this helps.

I know it s not my heart because I had it checked a couple months ago after a fainting spell I had.

I haven t been sleeping well, when I do sleep I usually have really weird dreams and I wake up really really sweaty. That has never happened before besides when I have a fever and I don t have a fever. I do have low blood pressure but it s not seriously low last time I checked. I would love to not go to a doctor if it s nothing serious since I do not have insurance... if you suggest I go please let me know. If you have ideas on what s wrong please let me know so I can look into it more.","Doctor":"Hi Forum. It is not the age to think so much of the health.
