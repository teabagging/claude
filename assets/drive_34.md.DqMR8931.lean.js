Since at least one of the (c_{i}) has the value 4, the sum condition for the (c_{i}) can only be satisfied if (c_{3}=c_{4}=0), one of the two values (c_{1}) and (c_{2}) is equal to 4 and the other is equal to 2.It is (30000=2^{4} cdot 3^{1} cdot 5^{4}), so that according to e) (a_{2} leq 4, a_{3} leq 4, c_{2} leq 4) and (c_{3} leq 4) follows, where at least one of the (a) or (c) values must also assume the bound. Due to the previously obtained estimate for (a_{2}), it follows that (a_{2}=4) and analogously because (c_{3}=0) also (c_{2}=4).

Thus, S_{1} can have six possible values.1. S_{1}=100. In this case, the value of S could have been 101, 102, ..., 106, depending on whether the last roll was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, with equal probability.2. S_{1}=99. In this case, the last roll could only have been 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, with equal probability, so the value of S (with equal probability) could have been 101, 102, 103, 104, or 105.3. S_{1}=98. This time, the last roll could have been 3, 4, 5, or 6, so the value of S could have been 101, 102, 103, or 104, with equal probability.4. S_{1}=97. This time, only 4, 5, or 6 could have been rolled last, so the possible values of S are 101, 102, or 103.5. S_{1}=96. This time, the last roll could have been 5 or 6, so S could have been 101 or 102.6. S_{1}=95. This time, only a 6 could have been rolled last, so the value of S could only have been 101.From the list, it is already clear that the most likely value of S is 101. More precisely, the probability of 101 occurring is exactly as much greater than the probability of 102 as the probability of S_{1}=95. Similarly, the probability of 102 is greater than the probability of 103 by the probability of S_{1}=96, and so on.

Then:     [     left(a_1 - frac{1}{n} right)x = -frac{1}{n} - a_2     ]     Since ( a_1 = -frac{1}{n} - a_0 ), we substitute ( a_0 = 0 ) (as a simplification):     [     a_1 = -frac{1}{n}     ]     Thus:     [     left(-frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n} right)x = -frac{1}{n} - a_2     ]     [     -frac{2}{n} x = -frac{1}{n} - a_2     ]     Solving for ( x ):     [     x = frac{1}{1-n}     ]     Therefore:     [     a_1 + a_2 = frac{1}{1-n}     ]3. Inductive Step: Assume that for some ( k ), ( a_k + a_{k-1} = frac{1}{k-1-n} ). We need to show that ( a_k + a_{k+1} = frac{1}{k-n} ).   - Given:     [     (a_k + a_{k-1})(a_k + a_{k+1}) = a_{k-1} - a_{k+1}     ]     Substitute ( a_k + a_{k-1} = frac{1}{k-1-n} ):     [     left(frac{1}{k-1-n}right)(a_k + a_{k+1}) = a_{k-1} - a_{k+1}     ]     Let ( a_k + a_{k+1} = y ):     [     frac{y}{k-1-n} = frac{1}{k-1-n} - a_{k+1}     ]     Multiply both sides by ( k-1-n ):     [     y = 1 - (k-1-n) a_{k+1}     ]     Since ( y = a_k + a_{k+1} ), we have:     [     (k-n)(a_k + a_{k+1}) = 1     ]     Therefore:     [     a_k + a_{k+1} = frac{1}{k-n}     ]     This completes the induction.4. Conclusion: If ( N > n ), then ( a_n + a_{n+1} ) becomes undefined, so ( N le n ). For equality, we can set ( a_0 = 0 ) and recursively define ( a_{i+1} = frac{1}{i-n} - a_i ) for ( 0 le i le n-1 )."},{"problem":"In a geometric sequence {a_n} with a common ratio q and all positive terms, S_n represents the sum of the first n terms.

Solving this equation, we find q= frac{-1+ sqrt{5}}{2}.  Therefore, the answer is boxed{frac{sqrt{5}-1}{2}}.  From a_1= frac{1}{q^2} and S_5=S_2+2 with q > 0, we can deduce a_3+a_4+a_5=a_1q^2(1+q+q^2)=2, and by substituting and simplifying, we can solve for q.

Subtracting these two equations, we obtain a_{n+1}=2a_n+1. This can be rearranged to a_{n+1}+1=2(a_n+1) (for ngeqslant 2). Since a_1=0, we have a_1+1=1, a_2=a_1+1=1, and a_2+1=2(a_1+1). Therefore, the sequence {a_n+1} is a geometric sequence with the first term 1 and common ratio 2.(Ⅱ) From (Ⅰ), we have a_n=2^{n-1}-1. Since the point (T_{n+1},T_n) lies on the line frac{x}{n+1}-frac{y}{n}=frac{1}{2}, we have frac{T_{n+1}}{n+1}-frac{T_n}{n}=frac{1}{2}. Therefore, {frac{T_n}{n}} is an arithmetic sequence with the first term frac{T_1}{1}=1 and common difference frac{1}{2}. Thus, frac{T_n}{n}=1+frac{1}{2}(n-1), and hence T_n=frac{n(n+1)}{2}. For ngeqslant 2, b_n=T_n-T_{n-1}=frac{n(n+1)}{2}-frac{n(n-1)}{2}=n. Since b_1=1 satisfies this equation, we have b_n=n. Therefore, the inequality frac{b_1}{a_1+1}+frac{b_2}{a_2+1}+ldots+frac{b_n}{a_n+1}geqslant m-frac{9}{2+2a_n} becomes 1+frac{2}{2}+frac{3}{2^2}+ldots+frac{n}{2^{n-1}}geqslant m-frac{9}{2^n}. Let R_n=1+frac{2}{2}+frac{3}{2^2}+ldots+frac{n}{2^{n-1}}. Then, frac{1}{2}R_n=frac{1}{2}+frac{2}{2^2}+frac{3}{2^3}+ldots+frac{n}{2^n}. Subtracting these two equations, we get (1-frac{1}{2})R_n=1+frac{1}{2}+frac{1}{2^2}+frac{1}{2^3}+ldots+frac{1}{2^{n-1}}-frac{n}{2^n}=2-frac{n+2}{2^n}. Therefore, R_n=4-frac{n+2}{2^{n-1}}. Since R_ngeqslant m-frac{9}{2^n} always holds, we have 4-frac{2n-5}{2^n}geqslant m. Furthermore, (4-frac{2n-3}{2^{n+1}})-(4-frac{2n-5}{2^n})=frac{2n-7}{2^{n+1}}. Thus, when nleqslant 3, {4-frac{2n-5}{2^n}} is monotonically decreasing; when n=3, 4-frac{2times3-5}{2^3}=frac{31}{8}; when ngeqslant 4, {4-frac{2n-5}{2^n}} is monotonically increasing; when n=4, 4-frac{2times4-5}{2^4}=frac{61}{16}.

We will consider different cases based on the properties of (x) and (y).

Otherwise, color it (B).This works because the difference between any two even numbers or any two odd numbers is even, and the difference between an even number and an odd number is odd. Since (x) and (y) are both odd, the difference between any two cells with a label difference of (x) or (y) will be even, ensuring they have different colors.

Let (S_t) be the set of numbers such that for every (a in S_t), (a equiv t pmod{2^k}).2. Since (frac{x}{2^k}) and (frac{y}{2^k}) are odd, we can color the numbers in each set (S_t) using the same method as in Case 1.

Note that (M leq xy leq n(n-1)), so (M + 1) exists.2. Since (v_2left(frac{M}{x}right) neq v_2left(frac{M}{y}right)), by parity, we cannot use only 2 colors.

Claim: The answer is ( n(n+1) ).2. Complementary Counting: We will use complementary counting to find the minimum number of segments that can be chosen so that every unit equilateral triangle has at least one chosen edge. To minimize this number, we must choose the segments such that:   - Each unit triangle has exactly one edge chosen.   - As many segments as possible belong to two triangles rather than just one (so that we kill two birds with one stone).3. Coloring the Triangles: Color all of the upward-facing triangles black and all of the downward-facing triangles white. There are (frac{n(n+1)}{2}) black triangles and (frac{n(n-1)}{2}) white triangles.4. Choosing Segments: For each white triangle, choose a black triangle (not already chosen) that is adjacent to the white triangle, and choose the segment that is shared by both triangles. This gives (frac{n(n-1)}{2}) segments chosen (one from each black triangle-white triangle pair).5. Remaining Black Triangles: There are now (frac{n(n+1)}{2} - frac{n(n-1)}{2} = n) black triangles that do not belong to any pair. Choose one segment from each of these triangles, for a total of (n) additional segments. This means that (frac{n(n-1)}{2} + n = frac{n(n+1)}{2}) segments is the minimum.6. Total Number of Unit Segments: Finally, it is necessary to calculate the total number of unit segments in the figure. No two black triangles share an edge, and it can be seen that all of the unit segments in the figure belong to exactly one black equilateral triangle. This means that the total number of unit segments in the figure is (3left(frac{n(n+1)}{2}right)).7. Final Calculation: The total number of unit segments is (3left(frac{n(n+1)}{2}right) = frac{3n(n+1)}{2}). Subtracting the minimum number of segments chosen, we get:   [   frac{3n(n+1)}{2} - frac{n(n+1)}{2} = n(n+1)   ]Thus, the greatest possible number of unit segments with endpoints at vertices of the small triangles that can be chosen so that no three of them are sides of a single triangle is ( n(n+1) ).The final answer is ( boxed{ n(n+1) } )"},{"problem":"Dwarves count their ages in days, so they celebrate their birthdays every day.

If the dwarfs were divided so that one group consisted of Pinocchio alone and the other group consisted of all the others, Pinocchio would be 1443 days old. Pinocchio cannot be older than 1443 days.The sum of the ages of the seven dwarfs who came to visit Pinocchio is an odd number of days. For the sum of the ages of all eight dwarfs to be divisible by two, Pinocchio's number of days must also be odd. To be able to divide the dwarfs into two groups with the same ages, the sum of the seven known ages must be able to express both half the total sum and half of this sum without Pinocchio's age. We will sequentially examine the possibilities until we find a suitable one. In the following table, N represents Pinocchio's age and S the sum of the ages of all eight dwarfs.

The ages of these two exceptions end in the digits 5 and 8. Therefore, from the seven known ages of the dwarfs, only sums ending in the digits 0, 5, 8, and 3 (depending on whether none, one, or both of the mentioned numbers are included) can be expressed. This observation rules out the possibilities corresponding to N=1, 5, 9, 11 (and many others).

By sequential testing (e.g., starting from the largest available number), we find that this is not possible.- In the case of N=13, the sum frac{1}{2} S=728 must include the number 168:728=168+560 text {. }The summand 560 must be expressible using the numbers 120, 140, 210, 280, and 420.

The division into groups with a 13-day-old Pinocchio (i.e., the division corresponding to the sum left.frac{1}{2} S=728right) looked like this:140+168+420=13+105+120+210+280 .In the cases of N=3 and 7, it is possible to focus on the second discussed sum (i.e., 720 and 725, respectively), which also cannot be expressed using the available numbers.In the process of eliminating possibilities, other properties of the given numbers can be used. For example, the impossibility of expressing the number 450 in the case of N=3 can be justified as follows. The number 450 is divisible by 10 but not by 20. Of the available numbers, only the number 210 has the same property, so it must be included in the expression of 450:450=210+240 .The summand 240 must be expressible using the remaining numbers 120, 140, 280, and 420. Since the numbers 280 and 420 are greater than 240, only the sum 120+140 is possible. However, this sum is also greater than 240, so the expression of 450 is not possible."},{"problem":"Let  {a_n}_{n=1}^infty  be an arithmetic progression  with  a_1 > 0  and  5cdot a_{13} = 6cdot a_{19}  .

Then ( n = 5(4m + 3) = 20m + 15 ).   - Substitute ( n = 20m + 15 ) into the first congruence: ( 20m + 15 equiv 2 pmod{3} ).     - Since ( 20 equiv 2 pmod{3} ) and ( 15 equiv 0 pmod{3} ), we have ( 2m equiv 2 pmod{3} ).     - Thus, ( m equiv 1 pmod{3} ).     - Let ( m = 3p + 1 ). Then ( n = 20(3p + 1) + 15 = 60p + 35 ).4. Find the smallest palindrome:   - We need to find the smallest palindrome of the form ( 60p + 35 ).   - Check values of ( p ):     - For ( p = 0 ), ( n = 35 ) (not a palindrome).     - For ( p = 1 ), ( n = 95 ) (not a palindrome).     - For ( p = 2 ), ( n = 155 ) (not a palindrome).     - For ( p = 3 ), ( n = 215 ) (not a palindrome).     - For ( p = 4 ), ( n = 275 ) (not a palindrome).     - For ( p = 5 ), ( n = 335 ) (not a palindrome).     - For ( p = 6 ), ( n = 395 ) (not a palindrome).     - For ( p = 7 ), ( n = 455 ) (not a palindrome).     - For ( p = 8 ), ( n = 515 ) (a palindrome).5. Prove there are infinitely many such numbers:   - Consider numbers of the form ( 5underbrace{11 ldots 1}_{3r+1}5 ).   - These numbers are palindromes and can be written as ( 60k + 35 ) for some ( k ).   - For example, ( 5115, 511115, ldots ) are all palindromes and satisfy the given conditions.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ 515 } )"},{"problem":"7.029. 0.25^{log _{2} sqrt{x+3}-0.5 log _{2}left(x^{2}-9right)}=sqrt{2(7-x)}.","solution":"## Solution.Domain of definition: quadleft{begin{array}{l}x+3>0,  x^{2}-9>0.33 .

Thus m(m-1)+11 is odd and never divisible by 2. Thus any prime p that divides m^2-m+11 must divide 4m^2-4m+44=(2m-1)^2+43. We see that (2m-1)^2equiv -43pmod{p}.

But [(2cdot 11^2-1)^2=4cdot 11^4-4cdot 11^2+1 <4cdot 11^4-43<(2cdot 11^2)^2,]hence we have pinned a perfect square (2m-1)^2=4cdot 11^4-43 strictly between two consecutive perfect squares, a contradiction.

Reformulate the Problem: Each student writes a number from the set ({1, 2, 3}) on each of the 29 boards. We can represent each student's choices as a 29-digit number in base 3.

Given the data set has 18 tourist groups' satisfaction ratings, including a, to find the position of the upper quartile in this set, we calculate 18 times 75% = 13.5.

The number f(n) of ways of placing the n weights is equal to the product of all odd positive integers less than or equal to 2 n-1, i.e. f(n)=(2 n-1) ! !=1 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot ldots cdot(2 n-1).","solution":"Assume n geq 2. We claim   f(n)=(2 n-1) f(n-1) .   Firstly, note that after the first move the left pan is always at least 1 heavier than the right one. Hence, any valid way of placing the n weights on the scale gives rise, by not considering weight 1, to a valid way of placing the weights 2, 2^{2}, ldots, 2^{n-1}.  If we divide the weight of each weight by 2, the answer does not change. So these n-1 weights can be placed on the scale in f(n-1) valid ways. Now we look at weight 1. If it is put on the scale in the first move, then it has to be placed on the left side, otherwise it can be placed either on the left or on the right side, because after the first move the difference between the weights on the left pan and the weights on the right pan is at least 2. Hence, there are exactly 2 n-1 different ways of inserting weight 1 in each of the f(n-1) valid sequences for the n-1 weights in order to get a valid sequence for the n weights. This proves the claim.  Since f(1)=1, by induction we obtain for all positive integers n   f(n)=(2 n-1) ! !=1 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot ldots cdot(2 n-1)   Comment 1. The word \\"compute\\" in the statement of the problem is probably too vague. An alternative but more artificial question might ask for the smallest n for which the number of valid ways is divisible by 2011. In this case the answer would be 1006.  Comment 2. It is useful to remark that the answer is the same for any set of weights where each weight is heavier than the sum of the lighter ones. Indeed, in such cases the given condition is equivalent to asking that during the process the heaviest weight on the balance is always on the left pan.  Comment 3. Instead of considering the lightest weight, one may also consider the last weight put on the balance. If this weight is 2^{n-1} then it should be put on the left pan. Otherwise it may be put on any pan; the inequality would not be violated since at this moment the heaviest weight is already put onto the left pan. In view of the previous comment, in each of these 2 n-1 cases the number of ways to place the previous weights is exactly f(n-1), which yields (1)."},{"problem":"The 52 cards in a deck are numbered 1, 2, cdots, 52.

Then, for each (1 leq i leq m),[a_{i}+a_{n+1-i}=(z+(i-1) d)+(z+(n-i) d)=2 z+(n-1) d=: x]thus[a_{1}+a_{2}+cdots+a_{n}=left(a_{1}+a_{n}right)+left(a_{2}+a_{n-1}right)+cdots+left(a_{m}+a_{m+1}right)=m cdot x]so (m) and (x) must also be divisors and reciprocals of 1991. Since (x=2 z+(n-1) d geq 2+(n-1)>n=2 m), the divisors 181 and 1991 are again ruled out due to the large (x), and (m=1) is also ruled out because (m geq 2), so (m=11) and thus (181=x=2 z+21 d) or (z=frac{1}{2} cdot(181-21 d)) follows. Since (z) is an integer, (d) must be odd, and because (z geq 1), it follows that (1 leq d leq 7) since (9 cdot 21=189>181). Therefore, there are exactly 4 solutions in this case.Together, there are exactly 40 arithmetic sequences that satisfy the conditions of the problem."},{"problem":"In the Cartesian coordinate system xOy, among all the circles with the center at point (0,1) and tangent to the line mx-y-2m-1=0 (m > 0), find the standard equation of the circle with the largest radius.","solution":"AnalysisThis question examines the standard equation of a circle, the formula for the distance from a point to a line, and the student's computational ability.

Since y has only a finite number of factor chains, there must exist a longest one. If the quotient of two consecutive numbers in a factor chain is a composite number, then an additional number can be inserted between these two numbers to extend the factor chain.

Find the minimum number of blocks that must be formed.","solution":"1. Define the problem and variables:   - Let ( S_1, S_2, ldots, S_{100} ) be the 100 states.   - Let ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_m ) be the blocs, where ( m ) is the number of blocs.   - Let ( n(S_i) ) be the number of blocs containing state ( S_i ).   - Let ( n(B_j) ) be the number of states belonging to bloc ( B_j ).2. Establish the lemma:   - Lemma: Each state belongs to at least 3 blocs.   - Proof: Suppose there is a state ( S_i ) that belongs to at most 2 blocs, say ( B_1 ) and ( B_2 ). The maximum number of states these two blocs can cover is ( 50 + 50 - 1 = 99 ) (since ( S_i ) is counted twice). This leaves at least one state ( S_j ) not in ( B_1 ) or ( B_2 ). Thus, ( S_i ) and ( S_j ) are not together in any bloc, contradicting the condition that every pair of states must be together in at least one bloc. Therefore, each state must belong to at least 3 blocs.3. Calculate the minimum number of blocs:   - Since each state belongs to at least 3 blocs, we have:     [     300 = 100 cdot 3 = sum_{i=1}^{100} n(S_i)     ]   - Each bloc can contain at most 50 states, so:     [     sum_{j=1}^{m} n(B_j) leq 50m     ]   - Combining these inequalities, we get:     [     300 leq 50m implies m geq 6     ]4. Construct an example with ( m = 6 ):   - Divide the 100 states into 4 groups of 25 states each.   - Form blocs by taking any two of these groups. The number of ways to choose 2 groups out of 4 is:     [     binom{4}{2} = 6     ]   - This results in 6 blocs, each containing 50 states. Every pair of states will be together in at least one bloc because each state is in exactly 3 blocs, and each pair of groups forms a bloc.5. Verify the conditions:   - Each bloc has at most 50 states.   - Every pair of states is together in at least one bloc.Thus, the minimum number of blocs required is 6.The final answer is (boxed{6})"},{"problem":"Bill Rogers, a well-known American runner praised as \\"Boston Billy,\\" once said, \\"Running is the best sport in the world.\\" Persisting in running can enhance physical fitness, improve immunity, and enhance mental well-being.

Solution Let A be a subset other than {1, 2, ... , p} and {p+1, p+2, ... , 2p}. Consider the elements of A in {1, 2, ... , p}. The number r satisfies 0 < r < p. We can change these elements to another set of r elements of {1, 2, ... , p} by adding 1 to each element (and reducing mod p if necessary). We can repeat this process and get p sets in all. For example, if p = 7 and the original subset of {1, 2, ... , 7} was {3 , 5}, we get: {3 , 5}, {4, 6}, {5, 7}, {6, 1}, {7, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 4}. The sum of the elements in the set is increased by r each time. So, since p is prime, the sums must form a complete set of residues mod p. In particular, they must all be distinct and hence all the subsets must be different. Now consider the sets A which have a given intersection with {p+1, ... , n}. Suppose the elements in this intersection sum to k mod p. The sets can be partitioned into groups of p by the process described above, so that exactly one member of each group will have the sum -k mod p for its elements in {1, 2, ... , p}.

If events A and B are independent, then the probability of their joint occurrence is equal to the product of their individual probabilities:P(A B)=P(A) cdot P(B)II. If events A and B are mutually exclusive, then the probability that at least one of them occurs is equal to the sum of the two probabilities:P(A+B)=P(A)+P(B)III. If the probability of an event occurring is P, then the probability of the event not occurring is (1-P).In solving the task, we will also assume that each shot represents independent events (whether from the same or different archers).a) The event in question does not occur if none of the five shots hit. The first archer has a 0.2 probability of missing the target according to III, so if they shoot twice, the probability of missing both times is 0.2 cdot 0.2 according to I. The second archer has a 0.4 probability of missing the target, so the probability of missing all three shots is 0.4 cdot 0.4 cdot 0.4 according to I. The probability that none of the five shots hit is 0.2^{2} cdot 0.4^{3} according to I. Finally, the probability of the event in question is 1-0.2^{2} cdot 0.4^{3}=0.99744 according to III.b) Similarly to the previous part, the probability that the first archer's first shot hits and the second misses is 0.8 cdot 0.2. The same probability applies if the first shot misses and the second hits. Thus, according to II, the probability that the first archer hits exactly once is 2 cdot 0.8 cdot 0.2.By similar reasoning, the probability that the second archer hits exactly twice out of three shots is 3 cdot 0.6 cdot 0.6 cdot 0.4.Thus, the probability that both of these events occur simultaneously (i.e., in a single trial) is, according to I,(2 cdot 0.8 cdot 0.2) cdotleft(3 cdot 0.6^{2} cdot 0.4right)=0.13824c) First, let's determine the probabilities p, q of the following events:1. The first archer hits at least twice,2. The second archer hits at least twice.The probability p of the first event is, similarly to the previous parts: p=0.8^{2}.The second event occurs if the second archer hits either exactly twice or exactly three times, soq=3 cdot 0.6^{2} cdot 0.4+0.6^{3}The event in question can occur if either of the two events listed here occurs. Let's break this joint occurrence into three independent parts:1. The first event occurs, the second does not;2. The second event occurs, the first does not;3. Both the first and the second events occur.Thus, using the relationships listed, the probability of the event in question isp(1-q)+q(1-p)+p q=p+q-p q=0.87328d) The probability that the first archer hits the target once and the second archer does not hit it at all is 2 cdot 0.8 cdot 0.2 cdot 0.4^{3}. The probability that the second archer hits once and the first archer does not hit at all is0.2^{2} cdot 3 cdot 0.4^{2} cdot 0.6Thus, the probability that one of these two events occurs, according to II, is the sum of these: 0.032.With this, we have completed the solution.Remarks. 1.

Define and differentiate f(x):   - Let f(x) = ln x - frac{1}{2}left(x - frac{1}{x}right) for x > 0.   - Differentiating f(x) gives f'(x) = frac{1}{x} - frac{1}{2}left(1 + frac{1}{x^2}right) = -frac{(x - 1)^2}{x^2}  0, f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, +infty).   - At x = 1, f(1) = 0.5. Compare f(x) with 0 for x > 1:   - For x > 1, since f(x) is decreasing, f(x)  0, which means a > b.7. Determine the relationship between c and a:   - Given c = x and a = x - ln x, we find c - a = ln x > 0, hence c > a.8.

The process is correct, the answer is correct, and all conditions are used. However, the use of the angle bisector is limited to its definition, and the structural characteristics of the figure are revealed but not deeply or consciously. Some readers may have noticed that the application of congruent triangles repeats the proof of the \\"angle bisector theorem and its converse.\\" If we take one step further and use the angle bisector theorem, we can save the application of congruent triangles.Solution 2: As shown in Figure 2, the auxiliary lines are the same as in Solution 1.Since E B is the bisector of angle A B D and E C is the bisector of angle A C B, we haveE D=E H, E D=E F.Thus, E H=E F.Therefore, point E lies on the bisector of angle F A H.The rest is the same as Solution 1.Evaluation: This problem can also be proven by drawing other auxiliary lines (including the excircle, etc.). However, as long as the condition angle A=30^{circ} is used to reach the conclusion, the problem has not been fully understood.

Plugging x = 2 into y = x^2 - 4x + 3, we get:y = 2^2 - 4 cdot 2 + 3 = 4 - 8 + 3 = -1.Since this is a parabola that opens upwards (because the coefficient of x^2 is positive), we know that the minimum value of y is -1, and so the set M contains all y values greater than or equal to -1.

Here, since y = x - 1 for all x in mathbb{R}, the set N encompasses all real numbers because for any real x, subtracting 1 gives us another real number. Therefore, N = mathbb{R}.The intersection M cap N would consist of all elements common to both M and N. Since N contains all real numbers and M contains all real numbers greater than or equal to -1, their intersection is all numbers greater than or equal to -1.[M cap N = { y mid y geq -1 }]So the correct answer is boxed{B}."},{"problem":"Solve the following equation on the set of positive integers:x-y=frac{x}{y}+frac{x^{2}}{y^{2}}+frac{x^{3}}{y^{3}}","solution":"Let x=x_{1} d and y=y_{1} d, where d is the greatest common divisor of x and y, and thus x_{1} and y_{1} are coprime.

Alternating turns, each one chooses a number from the set {1,3,4} and removes exactly that number of sticks from the pile (so if the pile only has 2 sticks remaining the next player must take 1). The winner is the player who takes the last stick. For 1leq kleq100, determine the number of cases in which the first player can guarantee that he will win.","solution":"1. Initial Conditions:    - For ( k = 1 ), the first player can take the last stick and win. Thus, ( l_1 = T ).   - For ( k = 2 ), the first player can only take 1 stick, leaving 1 stick for the second player, who will then win. Thus, ( l_2 = F ).   - For ( k = 3 ), the first player can take all 3 sticks and win. Thus, ( l_3 = T ).   - For ( k = 4 ), the first player can take all 4 sticks and win. Thus, ( l_4 = T ).2. Recursive Definition:   - For ( k > 4 ), the first player can guarantee a win if at least one of ( l_{k-1} ), ( l_{k-3} ), or ( l_{k-4} ) is false. This is because the first player can force the second player into a losing position by removing 1, 3, or 4 sticks respectively.   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as:     [     l_k = neg (l_{k-1} wedge l_{k-3} wedge l_{k-4})     ]     where ( wedge ) is the logical AND and ( neg ) is the logical NOT.3. Pattern Identification:   - By calculating the values of ( l_k ) for ( k ) from 1 to 14, we observe the following pattern:     [     begin{align*}     l_1 & = T      l_2 & = F      l_3 & = T      l_4 & = T      l_5 & = T      l_6 & = T      l_7 & = F      l_8 & = T      l_9 & = F      l_{10} & = T      l_{11} & = T      l_{12} & = T      l_{13} & = T      l_{14} & = F      end{align*}     ]   - We notice that the losing positions (F) occur at ( k = 2, 7, 9, 14, ldots ). These positions are either ( 0 ) or ( 2 ) modulo 7.4. Generalization:   - Since ( l_k ) depends only on ( l_{k-1} ), ( l_{k-3} ), and ( l_{k-4} ), the pattern repeats every 7 numbers.   - Therefore, for every block of 7 numbers, there are 5 winning positions and 2 losing positions.5. Counting Winning Positions:   - From ( k = 1 ) to ( k = 98 ), there are ( 14 ) blocks of 7 numbers. Each block has 5 winning positions.     [     14 times 5 = 70     ]   - For ( k = 99 ), it is a winning position.   - For ( k = 100 ), it is a losing position (since ( 100 equiv 2 mod 7 )).6.

Each brick can be oriented so it contributes 4'', or 10'', or 19'', to the total height of the tower.  How many different tower heights can be achieved using all ninety-four of the bricks?","solution":"Solution 1We have the smallest stack, which has a height of 94 times 4 inches. Now when we change the height of one of the bricks, we either add 0 inches, 6 inches, or 15 inches to the height. Now all we need to do is to find the different change values we can get from 94 0's, 6's, and 15's. Because 0, 6, and 15 are all multiples of 3, the change will always be a multiple of 3, so we just need to find the number of changes we can get from 0's, 2's, and 5's.From here, we count what we can get:[0, 2 = 2, 4 = 2+2, 5 = 5, 6 = 2+2+2, 7 = 5+2, 8 = 2+2+2+2, 9 = 5+2+2, ldots]It seems we can get every integer greater or equal to four; we can easily deduce this by considering [parity](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Parity) or using the [Chicken McNugget Theorem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Chicken_McNugget_Theorem), which says that the greatest number that cannot be expressed in the form of 2m + 5n for m,n being [positive integers](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Positive_integer) is 5 times 2 - 5 - 2=3. But we also have a maximum change (94 times 5), so that will have to stop somewhere. To find the gaps, we can work backwards as well. From the maximum change, we can subtract either 0's, 3's, or 5's. The maximum we can't get is 5 times 3-5-3=7, so the numbers 94 times 5-8 and below, except 3 and 1, work. Now there might be ones that we haven't counted yet, so we check all numbers between 94 times 5-8 and 94 times 5. 94 times 5-7 obviously doesn't work, 94 times 5-6 does since 6 is a multiple of 3, 94 times 5-5 does because it is a multiple of 5 (and 3), 94 times 5-4 doesn't since 4 is not divisible by 5 or 3, 94 times 5-3 does since 3=3, and 94 times 5-2 and 94 times 5-1 don't, and 94 times 5 does.Thus the numbers 0, 2, 4 all the way to 94 times 5-8, 94 times 5-6, 94 times 5-5, 94 times 5-3, and 94times 5 work. That's 2+(94 times 5 - 8 - 4 +1)+4=boxed{465} numbers. That's the number of changes you can make to a stack of bricks with dimensions 4 times 10 times 19, including not changing it at all.Solution 2Using bricks of dimensions 4''times10''times19'' is comparable to using bricks of dimensions 0''times6''times15'' which is comparable to using  bricks of dimensions 0''times2''times5''. Using 5 bricks of height 2'' can be replaced by using 2 bricks of height 5'' and 3 bricks of height 0''. It follows that all tower heights can be made by using 4 or fewer bricks of height 2''. There are 95+94+93+92+91=465 ways to build a tower using 4 or fewer bricks of height 2''. Taking the heights mod 5, we see that towers using a different number of bricks of height 2'' have unequal heights.

For the equation to be linear, the exponents of x and y must be equal to 1. Given that the equation is linear, we have two conditions based on the exponents of x and y:1. The exponent of x, which is a+b, must equal 1.2. The exponent of y, which is 3a+2b-4, must also equal 1.Therefore, we set up the following system of equations:[left{begin{array}{l}a+b=1 3a+2b-4=1end{array}right.]Solving this system of equations, we start with the first equation:[a+b=1]For the second equation, we simplify it to:[3a+2b=5]To solve this system, we can use substitution or elimination.

How many different arrangements are there?","solution":"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of complementary counting. First, we calculate the total number of arrangements without any restrictions. Since there are 5 people, the total number of arrangements is 5! = 120.Next, we calculate the number of arrangements where person A and person B are standing next to each other. We can treat person A and person B as a single unit. Then, we have 4 units in total (the unit of A and B, and the other 3 people). The number of arrangements for these 4 units is 4! = 24. However, within the unit of A and B, A and B can switch places, so we need to multiply by 2. Therefore, the number of arrangements where A and B are next to each other is 24 times 2 = 48.Finally, we subtract the number of arrangements where A and B are next to each other from the total number of arrangements to get the number of arrangements where A and B are not next to each other: 120 - 48 = 72.Therefore, the number of different arrangements where person A and person B cannot stand next to each other is boxed{72}."},{"problem":"In the game \\"Drag One,\\" a checkered board and round pieces, one black and the others white, are used.

Initially, everyone gets frac{756}{n} raspberries. Three friends then each give back frac{1}{4} cdot frac{756}{n}=frac{189}{n} raspberries to Berry. This implies that 189 must be divisible by n.The number of friends is at least 3, so n geqslant 4. Also, n leqslant 8, because if n geqslant 9, then everyone initially gets no more than frac{756}{9}=84 raspberries, so Berry would eat no more than 84+3 times 21=147 in total. This contradicts the fact that he ate more than 150.Of the options n=4,5,6,7,8, n=7 is the only possibility, because 189 is not divisible by 4, 5, 6, or 8.

Let event M be: at least one of A and B chooses park B, and event N be: A and B choose different attractions. It is known that there are 16 possible scenarios when A and B randomly choose attractions. There are 9 scenarios where A and B both do not choose park B. Therefore, after calculation, the conditional probability P(N|M)=______.","solution":"To solve this problem, let's break down the solution into detailed steps:1. Total Possible Scenarios: It's given that there are 16 possible scenarios when A and B randomly choose attractions. This is because each of them has 4 options, so the total number of combinations is 4 times 4 = 16.2. Scenarios Where At Least One Chooses Park B (Event M): To find the number of scenarios where at least one chooses park B, we first calculate the scenarios where neither chooses park B. Since there are 3 other parks (A, C, and D), and both A and B have 3 options (excluding park B), the total scenarios where neither chooses park B is 3 times 3 = 9. Therefore, the scenarios where at least one chooses park B is the total scenarios minus the scenarios where neither chooses park B, which is 16 - 9 = 7. Thus, n(M) = 7.3. Scenarios Where A and B Choose Different Attractions Given At Least One Chooses Park B (Event MN): When considering the scenarios where at least one chooses park B, we have two cases:   - Case 1: A chooses park B, and B chooses one of the other three parks (A, C, or D). This gives us 3 scenarios.   - Case 2: B chooses park B, and A chooses one of the other three parks (A, C, or D). This also gives us 3 scenarios.      Adding these together, we have 3 + 3 = 6 scenarios where A and B choose different attractions given that at least one chooses park B. Thus, n(MN) = 6.4. Calculating the Conditional Probability P(N|M): The conditional probability P(N|M) is the probability that A and B choose different attractions given that at least one chooses park B. This is calculated as the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (n(MN)) to the total number of outcomes in event M (n(M)), which is frac{n(MN)}{n(M)} = frac{6}{7}.Therefore, the conditional probability P(N|M) is boxed{frac{6}{7}}."},{"problem":"In the expansion of the binomial ( sqrt {x}+ dfrac {1}{2 sqrt[3]{x}})^{n}, the coefficients of the first three terms form an arithmetic sequence.Find: (1) the sum of the coefficients of all terms in the expansion; (2) the term with the largest coefficient.","solution":"(1) Given that the coefficients form an arithmetic sequence, we have:2 C_{n}^{1} times dfrac{1}{2} = C_{n}^{0} + C_{n}^{2} times dfrac{1}{4}This simplifies to:n^2 - 9n + 8 = 0Solving this, we get n = 1 (which is discarded) or n = 8.Therefore, n = 8.In ( sqrt {x}+ dfrac {1}{2 sqrt[3]{x}})^{8}, let x = 1 to find the sum of the coefficients in the expansion:= ( dfrac {3}{2})^{8} = boxed{dfrac {6561}{256}}(2) Let's assume that the (r+1)th term has the maximum coefficient.

We need to find the optimal plan among all feasible plans.To determine the optimal plan, we will construct a m a t h e m a t i c a l m o d e l of our problem, i.e., translate the problem given in economic terms into mathematical language.Suppose that (x) furniture sets were delivered to store C from station A and (y) furniture sets from station B; (z) furniture sets were delivered to store D from station A and (u) furniture sets from station B (Table 3).|  | C | D |  || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || A | (x^{mid}-) | (z) | 15 || B | (y^{mid 2}) | (u) | 15 ||  | 10 | 20 |  |A total of 10 furniture sets were delivered to store C, so:[x + y = 10]A total of 20 furniture sets were delivered to store D:[z + u = 20]A total of 15 furniture sets were sent from stations A and B:[begin{aligned}& x + z = 15 & y + u = 15end{aligned}]Table 3It is clear that (x, y, z, u) are non-negative integers.

Indeed, from the equations of system (1), it follows that (y = 10 - x), (z = 15 - x), (u = 5 + x) (Table 4).The total cost of transporting furniture in this case will be: (F = x + 3(15 - x) + 2(10 - x) + 5(5 + x) = x + 90).We see that the variable (x) can take only the following integer values: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).

For 200 products:- Expected number of defects = 200 times 0.05 = 10.However, this is an expectation and not a certainty. The actual number of defective products can vary due to the random nature of defects. Therefore, statement A suggests a misunderstanding of probability and defects variability.[ text{Statement A is incorrect.} ]Statement B: The occurrence of 51 heads out of 100 coin tosses shows a frequency of:- Frequency = frac{51}{100} = 0.51.While this indicates the observed frequency in this specific experiment, it does not define the probability of getting heads in all coin tosses.

The probability of an event is a theoretical measure, while frequency is an empirical measure observed in experiments.

In the Euclidean plane, the set of points equidistant from two fixed points forms an ellipse, with the two points functioning as the foci of the ellipse. In this case, however, the sum of the distances equals the distance between the two foci, which implies that the ellipse degenerates into the line segment connecting the foci.Therefore, the points that satisfy the equation |z+i|+|z-i|=2 lie on the line segment between (0, 1) and (0,-1).

Letleft(x^{p}+a x^{q}+1right)left(x^{r}+b x^{s}+1right)=x^{15}+c x^{t}+1In particular, the monomials of the highest degree on the right and left sides are equal: x^{p+r}=x^{15}. Since p+r=15, then p neq r.First, we investigate how many of the coefficients a, b can be zero. If a=b=0, then due to p neq r the product left(x^{p}+1right)left(x^{r}+1right)=x^{p+r}+x^{p}+x^{r}+1 would not be a trinomial. Therefore, either a or b is not zero (the first case reduces to the second by changing the notation).If a=0 and b neq 0, then upon expanding the brackets in the equality (*) we get b x^{p+s}+x^{p}+x^{r}+b x^{s}=c x^{t}. Note that if the degrees of the monomials x^{p} and x^{s} were not equal, then both of these monomials would enter the left side of the resulting equality with non-zero coefficients (because their degrees cannot equal the degrees of the other monomials in the left side), which would contradict the form of the right side. Therefore, p=s, and similarly p+s=r. In this case, the resulting equality takes the form (1+b)left(x^{p}+x^{2 p}right)=c x^{t}, which can only hold if b=-1 and c=0. Under these conditions, the equality (*) takes the form left(x^{p}+1right)left(x^{2 p}-x^{p}+1right)=x^{15}+1, which holds for p=5.Finally, suppose that a and b are non-zero. Upon expanding the brackets in the equality (*) we getb x^{p+s}+x^{p}+a x^{q+r}+a b x^{q+s}+a x^{q}+x^{r}+b x^{s}=c x^{t}Note that if the degrees of the monomials x^{q} and x^{s} were not equal, then one of them (with the smaller degree) would enter the left side of the resulting equality with a non-zero coefficient (because its degree could not equal the degrees of the other monomials in the left side). The same can be said about the pair of monomials a x^{q+r} and b x^{p+s}. Thus, either the monomials x^{q} and x^{s} have equal degrees, or the monomials a x^{q+r} and b x^{p+s} have equal degrees, and these cases exclude each other, since otherwise we would get p=r.We assume that q=s and q+r>p+s. The remaining case q+r=p+s reduces to this case by substituting x=1 / y in the equality (*) and multiplying it by y^{15}, and therefore gives an answer that is obtained from the answer in the first case by the same substitution.In the assumptions made, r>p, and the previous equality takes the forma x^{r+q}+b x^{p+q}+x^{r}+x^{p}+a b x^{2 q}+(a+b) x^{q}=c x^{t}Note that in the left side the degree of the monomial x^{r+q} is greater than that of the others, so it cannot cancel out with them. Therefore, a x^{r+q}=c x^{t}, and b x^{p+q}+x^{r}+x^{p}+a b x^{2 q}+(a+b) x^{q}=0. Similarly, the degree of x^{q} is less than that of the other monomials, so it cannot cancel out with them. Therefore, a+b=0, and -a x^{p+q}+x^{r}+x^{p}-a^{2} x^{2 q}=0. Note that if the degrees of the monomials x^{p} and x^{2 q} were not equal, then both of these monomials would enter the left side of the resulting equality with non-zero coefficients (because their degrees cannot equal the degrees of the other monomials in the left side), which would contradict the form of the right side. Therefore, p=2 q, and similarly, p+q=r. Under these conditions, the previous equality takes the form (1-a) x^{r}+left(1-a^{2}right) x^{p}=0, which holds only if a=1. Under these conditions, the equation (*) takes the form left(x^{2 q}+x^{q}+1right)left(x^{3 q}-x^{q}+1right)=x^{15}+x^{4 q}+1, which holds for q=3. By substituting x=1 / y and multiplying by y^{15}, the remaining answer is obtained from this equality."},{"problem":"Given a circle C: x^2+y^2-2x-4y-20=0 and a line l: (2m+1)x+(m+1)y=7m+4 (m in mathbb{R}).(1) Prove that no matter what real number m is, line l always intersects circle C.(2) Find the minimum length of the chord cut by line l on circle C and the equation of the line at this time.","solution":"Proof:(1) Rewrite the equation of line l as (x+y-4)+m(2x+y-7)=0,From the system of equations begin{cases} x+y-4=0  2x+y-7=0 end{cases}, we solve begin{cases} x=3  y=1 end{cases},Thus, line l always passes through the fixed point (3,1).The equation of circle C can be rewritten as (x-1)^2+(y-2)^2=25,So, the center of circle C is (1,2), and its radius is 5.The distance from the fixed point (3,1) to the center (1,2) is sqrt{(3-1)^2+(1-2)^2} = sqrt{5} < 5,which means point (3,1) is inside the circle.Therefore, a line passing through point (3,1) always intersects the circle, i.e., no matter what real number m is, line l always intersects circle C.Solution:(2) Suppose line l intersects circle C at points A and B.

We need to determine for how many positive integers ( x leq 100 ) the value of ( f(x) ) is odd.3. First, let's consider the case when ( x ) is odd:   - If ( x ) is odd, then ( x = 2n + 1 ) for some integer ( n ).   - Using the function property ( f(2n + 1) = 2f(n) ), we see that ( f(2n + 1) ) is always even because it is twice some integer ( f(n) ).4. Next, consider the case when ( x ) is even:   - If ( x ) is even, then ( x = 2n ) for some integer ( n ).   - Using the function property ( f(2n) = 3f(n) + 2 ), we need to determine when ( f(2n) ) is odd.   - For ( f(2n) ) to be odd, ( 3f(n) + 2 ) must be odd. This implies that ( 3f(n) ) must be odd (since adding 2 to an odd number results in an odd number).   - For ( 3f(n) ) to be odd, ( f(n) ) must be odd (since 3 times an odd number is odd).5. We now need to find the values of ( n ) for which ( f(n) ) is odd:   - We know ( f(1) = 1 ) is odd.   - If ( n ) is a power of 2, say ( n = 2^k ), we can use the function property recursively:     - ( f(2^k) = 3f(2^{k-1}) + 2 )     - Since ( f(1) = 1 ) is odd, we can check the next few values:       - ( f(2) = 3f(1) + 2 = 3 cdot 1 + 2 = 5 ) (odd)       - ( f(4) = 3f(2) + 2 = 3 cdot 5 + 2 = 17 ) (odd)       - ( f(8) = 3f(4) + 2 = 3 cdot 17 + 2 = 53 ) (odd)       - ( f(16) = 3f(8) + 2 = 3 cdot 53 + 2 = 161 ) (odd)       - ( f(32) = 3f(16) + 2 = 3 cdot 161 + 2 = 485 ) (odd)       - ( f(64) = 3f(32) + 2 = 3 cdot 485 + 2 = 1457 ) (odd)6. We observe that for ( n = 2^k ), ( f(2^k) ) is always odd. We need to count the powers of 2 up to 100:   - ( 2^0 = 1 )   - ( 2^1 = 2 )   - ( 2^2 = 4 )   - ( 2^3 = 8 )   - ( 2^4 = 16 )   - ( 2^5 = 32 )   - ( 2^6 = 64 )7.

The easiest way to count the problem is to remember that each X may slide to the right, but NOT to the left.First shot made on attempt 3:XOXOOXOXOXOOOXXOOXOXOXOOXOOXXOOOXXOXOOOXOXXOOOOXXTotal - 7First shot made on attempt 4:Note that all that needs to be done is change each line in the prior case from starting with \\"XO.....\\" to \\"OX.....\\".Total - 7First shot made on attempt 5:OOXXOXOOOXXOOXOOXOXXOOOXOXOXOOXOOXXTotal - 5First shot made on attempt 6:OOOXXXOOOOXXOXOOOXOXXTotal - 3First shot made on attempt 7:OOOOXXXTotal - 1The total number of ways the player may satisfy the requirements is 7+7+5+3+1=23.The chance of hitting any individual combination (say, for example, OOOOOOXXXX) is left(frac{3}{5}right)^6left(frac{2}{5}right)^4Thus, the chance of hitting any of these 23 combinations is 23left(frac{3}{5}right)^6left(frac{2}{5}right)^4 = frac{23cdot3^6cdot2^4}{5^{10}}Thus, the final answer is (23+3+2+5)(6+4+10)=boxed{660}Solution 3Note a_{10}=.4. Therefore the player made 4 shots out of 10. He must make the 10th shot, because if he doesn't, then a_9=frac{4}{9}>.4. Since a_nleq .4 for all n less than 11, we know that a_1=a_2=0. Now we must look at the 3rd through 9th shot.Now let's take a look at those un-determined shots. Let's put them into groups: the 3rd, 4th, and 5th shots in group A, and the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th shots in group B. The total number of shots made in groups A and B must be 3, since the player makes the 10th shot. We cannot have all three shots made in group A, since a_5leq .4. Therefore we can have two shots made, one shot made, or no shots made in group A.Case 1: Group A contains no made shots.The number of ways this can happen in group A is 1. Now we must arrange the shots in group B accordingly. There are four ways to arrange them total, and all of them work. There are textbf{4} possibilities here.Case 2: Group A contains one made shot.The number of ways this could happen in group A is 3.  Now we must arrange the shots in group B accordingly. There are six ways to arrange them total, but the arrangement \\"hit hit miss miss\\" fails, because that would mean a_7=frac{3}{7}>.4. All the rest work. Therefore there are 3cdot5=textbf{15} possibilities here.Case 3: Group A contains two made shots.The number of ways this could happen in group A is 2 (hit hit miss doesn't work but the rest do). Now we must arrange the shots in group B accordingly. Note hit miss miss miss and miss hit miss miss fail. Therefore there are only 2 ways to do this, and there are 2cdot 2=textbf{4} total possibilities for this case.Taking all these cases into account, we find that there are 4+15+4=23 ways to have a_{10} = .4 and a_nleq .4. Each of these has a probability of .4^4cdot.6^6=frac{2^4cdot 3^6}{5^{10}}. Therefore the probability that we have a_{10} = .4 and a_nleq .4 is frac{23cdot2^4cdot3^6}{5^{10}}. Now we are asked to find the product of the sum of the primes and the sum of the exponents, which is (23+2+3+5)(4+6+10)=33cdot20=boxed{660}."},{"problem":"Among the following types of reasoning, the one that is deductive reasoning is marked by (　).A: From the fact that gold, silver, copper, and iron conduct electricity, it is inferred that all metals conduct electricity.B: It is guessed that the general formula for the sequence dfrac{1}{1times 2}, dfrac{1}{2times 3}, dfrac{1}{3times 4}, ldots {a_{n}} is a_{n}= dfrac{1}{n(n+1)}(nin N_{+})C: Given that the area S of a circle with radius r is S=pi r^{2}, it is then inferred that the area S of a unit circle is S=piD: From the equation of a circle in the Cartesian coordinate system being (x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^{2}=r^{2}, it is conjectured that the equation of a sphere in the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system is (x-a)^{2}+(y-b)^{2}+(z-c)^{2}=r^{2}","solution":"Solution: Option A is a reasoning process from specific to general, which is inductive reasoning.

This leads to the equations:- 1=3lambda- -1=-3lambda- 3=6lambdaSolving the first equation gives lambda=frac{1}{3}.

The derivative is:f'(b) = frac{-20b^3 + 47b^2 - 36b + 9}{(9 - 10b)^2}Setting f'(b) = 0 results in the cubic equation:-20b^3 + 47b^2 - 36b + 9 = 0Factoring this, we get:(4b - 3)(5b - 3)(1 - b) = 0which yields b = frac{3}{5}, b = frac{3}{4}, or b = 1 (but b = 1 is discarded because a and b are both less than 1).Analyzing f'(b) within the domains 0 < b < frac{3}{5}, frac{3}{5} < b < frac{3}{4}, and frac{3}{4} < b < 1, we find that f(b) is increasing, decreasing, and increasing, respectively, in these intervals.Thus, f(b) achieves a maximum when b = frac{3}{5}, at which point f(b) = f(frac{3}{5}) = frac{4}{125}.Since f(1) = 0, the maximum value of f(b) is frac{4}{125}.So, the maximum value of xyz is boxed{frac{4}{125}}."},{"problem":"Example 2 The vertex of the parabola y=a x^{2}+b x+c is (4,-11), and the x-coordinates of its two intersections with the x-axis are one positive and one negative.

To determine the probability that the product of the two numbers on the top of the dice is prime, we first need to understand the conditions under which the product of two numbers is prime. A product of two numbers is prime if and only if one of the numbers is 1 and the other number is a prime number. This is because a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.2. The prime numbers less than or equal to 6 (the numbers on a six-sided die) are 2, 3, and 5. Therefore, the possible prime numbers that can appear on the dice are 2, 3, and 5.3. For each prime number, there are two possible scenarios: the prime number can appear on the first die and 1 on the second die, or the prime number can appear on the second die and 1 on the first die. This gives us a total of 2 choices for each prime number.4. Since there are 3 prime numbers (2, 3, and 5), and each prime number can appear in 2 different ways (as described in step 3), the total number of favorable outcomes is:   [   2 times 3 = 6   ]5. The total number of possible outcomes when rolling two six-sided dice is:   [   6 times 6 = 36   ]6.

Within each interval, ( f(x) ) is continuous, and, as we will see, the right-hand limit of ( f(x) ) at the left endpoint of each interval is ( +infty ), and the left-hand limit of ( f(x) ) at the right endpoint of each interval is ( -infty ).

Establishing the lower bound for ( k ):   - We need to show that ( k > 2n - 1 ). Consider the ( 2n - 1 ) squares situated on the first row and the first column of the ( n times n ) chessboard.    - If we select any subset of these ( 2n - 1 ) squares, it is impossible to find a subset such that the number of squares in any row or column is even. This is because there are ( n ) squares in the first row and ( n-1 ) squares in the first column (excluding the intersection square), making a total of ( 2n - 1 ) squares. Any subset of these squares will always have an odd number of squares in at least one row or column.   - Therefore, ( k ) must be greater than ( 2n - 1 ).2. Showing that ( k = 2n ) suffices:   - Consider a bipartite graph ( G ) with ( n ) vertices in each class. One class represents the rows of the chessboard, and the other class represents the columns.   - Two vertices are connected by an edge if there is a square at the intersection of the corresponding row and column. Thus, the ( 2n ) squares we select correspond to ( 2n ) edges in this bipartite graph.   - We need to show that this bipartite graph has at least one Eulerian subgraph. An Eulerian subgraph is a subgraph where every vertex has an even degree.   - To show this, we first note that a bipartite graph with ( 2n ) edges and ( 2n ) vertices (since each class has ( n ) vertices) must contain at least one cycle. This is because a bipartite graph with ( 2n ) vertices and ( 2n ) edges cannot be a forest (a graph with no cycles) since a forest with ( 2n ) vertices can have at most ( 2n - 1 ) edges.   - Since our graph has ( 2n ) edges, it must contain at least one cycle. From any graph that contains a cycle, we can extract an elementary cycle (a cycle with no repeated vertices except for the starting and ending vertex).   - In this elementary cycle, each vertex has degree 2, which is even. Thus, this cycle forms an Eulerian subgraph.3. Conclusion:   - Since we have shown that ( k = 2n ) is sufficient to ensure that there is a subset of squares such that the number of squares in any row or column is even, and we have also shown that ( k > 2n - 1 ), the smallest number ( k ) that satisfies the condition is ( 2n ).The final answer is ( boxed{2n} )."},{"problem":"In a right trapezoid A B C D(A B | C D) the angle at vertex B measures 75^{circ}.

Next, we consider ( n = 3 ). We need to determine the possible number of regions formed by 3 lines:   - If all three lines are parallel, they divide the plane into 4 regions.   - If two lines are parallel and the third line intersects them, they divide the plane into 6 regions.   - If no two lines are parallel and no three lines are concurrent, they divide the plane into 7 regions.3. We need to check if it is possible to create 5 regions with 3 lines:   - If all three lines are concurrent (intersect at a single point), they divide the plane into 6 regions.   - Therefore, it is impossible to create exactly 5 regions with 3 lines.4. Now, we consider ( n = 4 ). We need to determine the possible number of regions formed by 4 lines:   - If all four lines are parallel, they divide the plane into 5 regions.   - If three lines are parallel and the fourth line intersects them, they divide the plane into 8 regions.   - If two pairs of lines are parallel, they divide the plane into 9 regions.   - If no two lines are parallel and no three lines are concurrent, they divide the plane into 11 regions.5. We need to check if it is possible to create exactly 6, 7, or 10 regions with 4 lines:   - By carefully arranging the lines, we can create exactly 6, 7, or 10 regions.6. Therefore, ( S_4 ) contains at least 4 elements: ( {5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11} ).Conclusion:The minimum ( i ) such that ( S_i ) contains at least 4 elements is ( boxed{4} )."},{"problem":"1.4.11 star star Given the equation in terms of xsqrt{x}+sqrt[3]{x+7}=sqrt[4]{x+80}+chas real solutions.

A four-digit number contains 3 prime numbers, so 42 needs to be decomposed into the product of 3 numbers. 42=2 times 3 times 7.Therefore, the double palindrome can be written as a times b^{2} times c^{6}. Let's see what the smallest case is when the prime numbers are the smallest. 11 times 3^{2} times 2^{6} =6336.When the prime numbers are a bit larger, such as b=5 and c=2, 11 times 5^{2} times 2^{6}=17600 (which does not meet the condition of being a four-digit number).

The key is to understand that the line y = ax + b must be tangent to both f(x) = -frac{1}{4}x^2 and g(x) = e^x at some points in the real number domain to satisfy the inequality for all x.1. Tangency with f(x) = -frac{1}{4}x^2: The condition for tangency implies that the quadratic equation ax+b+frac{1}{4}x^2 = 0 has exactly one solution. This leads to the discriminant condition Delta = 0, which simplifies to a^2 - 4left(frac{1}{4}right)b = 0, or equivalently, a^2 = b.2. Tangency with g(x) = e^x: At the point of tangency, the slope of the tangent line (which is a for y = ax + b) must equal the derivative of g(x), which is g'(x) = e^x. Let's denote the point of tangency as (x_0, e^{x_0}). Therefore, we have a = e^{x_0} and b = a^2 from the previous step.3. Equation of the tangent line: The tangent line at (x_0, e^{x_0}) to g(x) has the equation y - e^{x_0} = e^{x_0}(x - x_0). Simplifying, we get y = e^{x_0}x - x_0e^{x_0} + e^{x_0}. Comparing this with y = ax + b, we obtain a system of equations:   [   left{     begin{array}{l}       e^{x_0} = a        -x_0e^{x_0} + e^{x_0} = a^2     end{array}   right.   ]4.

Substituting (4 - k) / 6 for lambda according to (1), we get (4 - k)^2 = 6, which, under the condition 1 < k < 4, is only satisfied by k = 4 - sqrt{6}.Thus, the value of k can only be 4 - sqrt{6}. If we choose k to be this value, then according to (1), the congruent triangles PD_1F_2, F_1E_2R, and D_2QE_1 are created by a lambda = sqrt{6} / 6-scale reduction from the triangle PQR, so the area of the hexagon isT - 3lambda^2T = T - frac{1}{2}T = frac{1}{2}Twhich is indeed twice the area of the triangle ABC.Remarks. 1. The equation (4 - k)^2 = 6 obtained as a condition is also satisfied by k = 4 + sqrt{6}. What could be the geometric meaning of this second solution? When the triangle ABC is enlarged by a factor of (4 + sqrt{6}), the sides of the resulting triangle MKL do not intersect the sides of the triangle PQR, but only their extensions. The resulting D_1D_2E_1E_2F_1F_2 figure is a \\"looped\\" hexagon. If we define the \\"area\\" of this hexagon by subtracting the area of the \\"loops\\" from the area of the triangle PQR, then for this hexagon as well, its \\"area\\" is twice the area of the triangle ABC (2.

For ( (n+1)(n+2) ) to be divisible by ( 6 ), it must be divisible by both ( 2 ) and ( 3 ).5. Consider divisibility by ( 2 ):   - Since ( n ) is an integer, either ( n ) is even or odd.   - If ( n ) is even, ( n+1 ) is odd and ( n+2 ) is even.   - If ( n ) is odd, ( n+1 ) is even and ( n+2 ) is odd.   - Therefore, ( (n+1)(n+2) ) is always even, satisfying the divisibility by ( 2 ).6. Consider divisibility by ( 3 ):   - We need ( (n+1)(n+2) equiv 0 pmod{3} ).   - This implies that at least one of ( n+1 ) or ( n+2 ) must be divisible by ( 3 ).   - Therefore, ( n ) must not be congruent to ( 0 pmod{3} ).7.

How much time did it take the pedestrian to travel from A to B, if his speed is four times less than the cyclist's speed?","solution":"The first method. The distance that the pedestrian covers in 2 hours, we will take as a unit. Then the cyclist covers this same distance in 30 minutes. From the moment of their first meeting, the pedestrian has walked one unit, while the cyclist has traveled three units (he rested for half an hour in point B). Therefore, the distance from the point of their second meeting to point B is one unit. Then, after the second meeting, the pedestrian will walk another unit, while the cyclist will travel 4 units in the same time. Therefore, the distance between A and B is 5 units, so it took the pedestrian 10 hours to travel from A to B.The second method. Let v km/h be the speed of the pedestrian, then the speed of the cyclist is 4v km/h. Let the first meeting of the cyclist and the pedestrian occur at a distance of x km from point B. Then in 2 hours, which passed until the second meeting, the pedestrian walked 2v km and was at a distance of x-2v km from point B, while the cyclist traveled a distance of 1.5 times 4v = 6v (km) and was at a distance of 6v-x km from point B.Therefore, x-2v=6v-x, from which x=4v. This means that the point of the first meeting is at a distance from point B that the cyclist covers in one hour, and the point of the second meeting is at a distance that the cyclist covers in half an hour. Since 2 hours after the second meeting, the pedestrian will be at point B, and the cyclist will be at point A, it took the cyclist 2.5 hours to travel from B to A. Therefore, it will take the pedestrian 4 times longer, that is, 10 hours, to travel from A to B.## Answer10 hours."},{"problem":"Given that S_n is the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {a_n}, with a_1=1, and for ngeqslant 2, it always holds that ka_n=a_nS_n-S_{n}^{2}, if S_{99}=frac{1}{50}, then k= ______.","solution":"When ngeqslant 2, it always holds that ka_n=a_nS_n-S_{n}^{2},  which can be rewritten as (k-S_n)(S_n-S_{n-1})=-S_{n}^{2},  transforming into frac{1}{S_n}-frac{1}{S_{n-1}}=frac{1}{k},  from which we can derive frac{1}{S_n}=1+frac{n-1}{k},  leading to S_n=frac{k}{k+n-1}.

Gyak. Gimn.)II. solution. Let the edges be denoted by p, q, r, and their midpoints by P, Q, R. We will show that the perimeter of triangle PQR is minimal among the triangles we are examining. Let the plane of triangle PQR be denoted by S, and reflect the cube across the plane through r that is perpendicular to S. Since the center of the cube is in S, the plane we reflect across forms a 45^{circ} angle with p and q. Therefore, the reflection of p remains in the plane through p that is perpendicular to r and is perpendicular to p. Denote this by p_{1}, and the reflections of q, P, Q by q_{1}, P_{1}, Q_{1}. Since S is perpendicular to the reflection plane, P_{1}, Q_{1} will also be in S.Continuing step by step, reflect across the planes through q_{1}, p_{2}, r_{3}, and q_{4} that are perpendicular to S, denoting the reflections of p_{i}, q_{i}, r_{i} after the (i+1)-th reflection by p_{i+1}, q_{i+1}, r_{i+1} (where i=1,2,3,4, and r_{1} is identical to r). During this process, the points P, R, Q_{1}, P_{2}, R_{3}, Q_{4}, P_{5} will all lie on a single line. Perform these reflections on any points P^{*}, Q^{*}, R^{*} on the lines p, q, r as well. The perimeter of triangle P^{*} Q^{*} R^{*}, doubled, will split into the length of the broken line P^{*} R^{*} Q_{1}^{*} P_{2}^{*} R_{3}^{*} Q_{4}^{*} P_{5}^{*}. This length cannot be smaller than the length of segment P^{*} P_{5}^{*}, which is equal to the length of P P_{5} and twice the perimeter of triangle PQR.Remark.

Also, the sum of the angles in any quadrilateral is 360^{circ}, so we have:[angle A + angle B + angle C + angle D = 360^{circ}]Given that opposite angles are equal, we can simplify this to:[2(angle A + angle B) = 360^{circ} implies angle A + angle B = 180^{circ}]Furthermore, we are told that the largest angle is 100^{circ} greater than the smallest angle.

(Since odd plus odd is even and odd minus odd is even, then after two moves of odd length, the change to date is even, and after four moves of odd length, the change to date is still even, which means that the final change after the fifth move of odd length is completed must be odd, since even plus or minus odd is odd.)In the table below, these observations allow us to determine in which direction to put the moves of odd length and in which direction to put the moves of even length.| Choice | Change in x | Change in y | Horizontal moves | Vertical moves || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || (A) (27,33) | 7 | 14 | 1+3+5+7-9=7 | -2+4-6+8+10=14 || (B) (30,40) | 10 | 21 | 2-4-6+8+10=10 |  || (C) (21,21) | 1 | 2 | 1-3+5+7-9=1 | 2+4-6-8+10=2 || (D) (42,44) | 22 | 25 | 2-4+6+8+10=22 | 1+3+5+7+9=25 || (E) (37,37) | 17 | 18 | -1-3+5+7+9=17 | 2+4-6+8+10=18 |Since each of the locations (A), (C), (D), and (E) is possible, then the location that is not possible must be (B).We note that in the case of (mathrm{B}), it is the change in the y-coordinate that is not possible to make.In other words, we cannot obtain a total of 21 by adding and subtracting 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 . Can you see why?## Solution 2Let a be the horizontal change from the initial to the final position of the point and let b be the vertical change from the initial to the final position.For example, if a=-5 and b=6, the point's final position is 5 units to the left and 6 units up from its original position of (20,19).Notice that if (x, y) is the final position of the point, then a and b can be calculated as a+20=x or a=x-20 and b+19=y or b=y-19.First, assume the initial move is in the horizontal direction.This means the second move will be in the vertical direction, the third will be horizontal, and so on.In all, the first, third, fifth, seventh, and ninth moves will be horizontal and the others will be vertical.Also, the first move is by one unit, the second is by two units, the third is by three units, and so on, so the horizontal moves are by 1,3,5,7, and 9 units.Each of these moves is either to the left or the right.If all of the horizontal moves are to the right, then a=1+3+5+7+9=25.If the point moves, left on the first move, right on the third, then left on the fifth, seventh, and ninth moves, a will be -1+3-5-7-9=-19.In this case, the final position is 19 units to the left of the initial position (and has potentially moved up or down, as well).In each of the five horizontal moves, the point either moves to the left or to the right.This means there are two choices (left or right) for each of the five horizontal moves, so there are 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2=32 possible configurations similar to the examples above.Going through these carefully, the table below computes all possible values of a :| 1+3+5+7+9 | = | 25 | 1+3+5+7-9 | = | 7 || ---: | :---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: || -1+3+5+7+9 | = | 23 | -1+3+5+7-9 | = | 5 || 1-3+5+7+9 | = | 9 | 1-3+5+7-9 | = | 1 || -1-3+5+7+9 | = | 17 | -1-3+5+7-9 | = | -1 || 1+3-5+7+9 | = | 15 | 1+3-5+7-9 | = | -3 || -1+3-5+7+9 | = | 13 | -1+3-5+7-9 | = | -5 || 1-3-5+7+9 | = | 9 | 1-3-5+7-9 | = | -9 || -1-3-5+7+9 | = | 7 | -1-3-5+7-9 | = | -11 || 1+3+5-7+9 | = | 1 | 1+3+5-7-9 | = | -8 || -1+3+5-7+9 | = | 9 | -1+3+5-7-9 | = | -9 || 1-3+5-7+9 | = | 5 | 1-3+5-7-9 | = | -13 || -1-3+5-7+9 | = | 3 | -1-3+5-7-9 | = | -15 || 1+3-5-7+9 | = | 1 | 1+3-5-7-9 | = | -17 || -1+3-5-7+9 | = | -1 | -1+3-5-7-9 | = | -19 || 1-3-5-7+9 | = | -5 | 1-3-5-7-9 | = | -23 || -1-3-5-7+9 | = | -7 | -1-3-5-7-9 | = | -25 |Some numbers appear more than once, but after inspecting the list, we see that when the first move is in the horizontal direction, a can be any odd number between -25 and 25 inclusive except for -21 and 21 .When the first move is horizontal, the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, and tenth moves will be vertical and have lengths 2,4,6,8, and 10 units.Using the same idea as the previous case, all 32 possible values of b when the first move is horizontal are calculated as follows:begin{aligned}& 2+4+6+8+10=30 quad 2+4+6+8-10=10 & -2+4+6+8+10=26 quad-2+4+6+8-10=6 & 2-4+6+8+10=22 quad 2-4+6+8-10=2 & -2-4+6+8+10=18 quad-2-4+6+8-10=-2 & 2+4-6+8+10=18 quad 2+4-6+8-10=-2 & -2+4-6+8+10=14 quad-2+4-6+8-10=-6 & 2-4-6+8+10=10 quad 2-4-6+8-10=-10 & -2-4-6+8+10=6 quad-2-4-6+8-10=-14 & 2+4+6-8+10=14 quad 2+4+6-8-10=-6 & -2+4+6-8+10=10 quad-2+4+6-8-10=-10 & 2-4+6-8+10=6 quad 2-4+6-8-10=-14 & -2-4+6-8+10=2 quad-2-4+6-8-10=-18 & 2+4-6-8+10=2 quad 2+4-6-8-10=-18 & -2+4-6-8+10=-2 quad-2+4-6-8-10=-22 & 2-4-6-8+10=-6 quad 2-4-6-8-10=-26 & -2-4-6-8+10=-10 quad-2-4-6-8-10=-30end{aligned}Again, some numbers appear more than once, but examination of the table shows that when the first move is horizontal, the possible values of b are the even numbers between -30 and 30 inclusive which are not multiples of 4.We now begin to inspect the possible answers. The point in (A) is (27,33).In this case, we have that a=27-20=7 and b=33-19=14.These values for a and b fit the descriptions above, so (27,33) is a possible final position.The point (21,21) in (mathrm{C}) has a=1 and b=2, which means (21,21) is also a possible final position for the point.The point (37,37) in (E) has a=17 and b=18, so this point is also a possible final position.We have shown that the answer must be either (B) or (D).Note that in both cases we have that a is even and b is odd, which means that if either of these points is a possible final position, the first move cannot have been horizontal, which means it must have been vertical.If the first move is vertical, then the third, fifth, seventh, and ninth moves are also vertical, and the other moves are horizontal.Going through similar analysis as before, we will see that the restrictions on a and b have switched.That is, a must be an even number between -30 and 30 inclusive which is not a multiple of 4 , and b must be an odd number between -25 and 25 inclusive other than -21 and 21 .The point (42,44) in (D) has a=22 and b=25, which is possible with a vertical first move. However, the point (30,40) in (B) has a=10 and b=21.Since 21 is not a possible value for b, then (30,40) is not a possible final position."},{"problem":"Bikin Yu.A.In trapezoid ABCD, sides AD and BC are parallel, and AB = BC = BD.

Recall that if x is a real number, then lfloor x rfloor (the [i]floor[/i] of x) is the greatest integer that is less than or equal to x.","solution":"1. Estimate the sum using an integral approximation:   We start by approximating the sum ( S_n = sum_{k=1}^n frac{1}{sqrt{2k-1}} ) using an integral. The idea is to approximate the sum by the integral of a similar function. Specifically, we use:   [   sum_{k=1}^n frac{1}{sqrt{2k-1}} approx int_1^n frac{dx}{sqrt{2x-1}}   ]2. Simplify the integral:   To simplify the integral, we make a substitution. Let ( u = 2x-1 ), then ( du = 2dx ) or ( dx = frac{du}{2} ). The limits of integration change accordingly: when ( x = 1 ), ( u = 1 ); and when ( x = n ), ( u = 2n-1 ). Thus, the integral becomes:   [   int_1^n frac{dx}{sqrt{2x-1}} = int_1^{2n-1} frac{du}{2sqrt{u}} = frac{1}{2} int_1^{2n-1} u^{-frac{1}{2}} , du   ]3. Evaluate the integral:   The integral ( int u^{-frac{1}{2}} , du ) is straightforward:   [   int u^{-frac{1}{2}} , du = 2u^{frac{1}{2}} = 2sqrt{u}   ]   Applying the limits of integration, we get:   [   frac{1}{2} left[ 2sqrt{u} right]_1^{2n-1} = left[ sqrt{u} right]_1^{2n-1} = sqrt{2n-1} - sqrt{1} = sqrt{2n-1} - 1   ]4. Refine the approximation:   The initial approximation can be refined by considering the excess on the interval ([0,1]). A better estimate is:   [   S_n approx 1 + int_1^n frac{dx}{sqrt{2x-1}}   ]   Using the previous result, we have:   [   S_n approx 1 + (sqrt{2n-1} - 1) = sqrt{2n-1}   ]5. Apply the approximation to ( S_{4901} ):   For ( n = 4901 ):   [   S_{4901} approx sqrt{2 cdot 4901 - 1} = sqrt{9801} = 99   ]6. Estimate the error:   To rigorize the approximation, we estimate the error. The error in the interval ([m, m+1]) for ( m = 1, 2, ldots, n-1 ) is:   [   int_m^{m+1} frac{dx}{sqrt{2x-1}} - frac{1}{sqrt{2m-1}}   ]   Using the integral approximation, the error is:   [   frac{sqrt{2}}{sqrt{m+1} + sqrt{m}} - frac{1}{sqrt{2m-1}}   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   frac{sqrt{4m+2} - sqrt{m+1} - sqrt{m}}{sqrt{2m-1}(sqrt{m+1} + sqrt{m})} < frac{sqrt{6} - sqrt{2} - 1}{2sqrt{2}m}   ]7.

Final bounds:   Thus, the value of the sum is between:   [   sqrt{9802} - sqrt{2} + 1 - 0.13 > 98 quad text{and} quad sqrt{9802} - sqrt{2} + 1 < 99   ]   Therefore, the floor of the sum is:   [   lfloor S_{4901} rfloor = 98   ]The final answer is (boxed{98})"},{"problem":"10.

The number of ways to distribute the balls is ______.","solution":"To distribute 5 identical balls to 3 children with each child getting at least one ball, we can use the method of dividers. This method involves envisioning the balls in a line and placing dividers between them to indicate the division among the children. Since each child must receive at least one ball, we first give one ball to each child. This leaves us with 5 - 3 = 2 balls to distribute freely among the 3 children.Now, with 2 identical balls left to distribute, and needing to place 2 dividers among them to separate the distributions to the 3 children, we consider the total objects we are arranging: 2 balls + 2 dividers = 4 objects. The question now becomes how to arrange these 4 objects, where the arrangement of the dividers will determine the distribution of the remaining balls.Since we are arranging 4 objects, of which 2 are identical (the dividers) and the other 2 are also identical (the balls), we use the combination formula to determine the number of ways to choose positions for the dividers (or equivalently, the balls) among the 4 positions. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}, where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.Here, n = 4 (total objects) and k = 2 (either the dividers or the balls, since they are interchangeable in this context), so we calculate:[C_{4}^{2} = frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = frac{4 times 3}{2 times 1} = 6]Therefore, there are boxed{6} ways to distribute the 5 identical balls to 3 children such that each child receives at least one ball."},{"problem":"The diameter of a circle with radius r is the base of an equilateral triangle.

If M and N are symmetrical with respect to the line x - y - 1 = 0, then the center of the circle x^2 + y^2 + kx = 0 must lie on that line.The center of the circle is (-frac{k}{2}, 0). Substituting into the line's equation gives:-frac{k}{2} - 0 - 1 = 0 implies k = -2.With k = -2, the equation of the circle becomes x^2 + y^2 - 2x = 0. The center of the circle is (1, 0), and the radius is 1 (since by completing the square, the equation is equivalent to (x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 1).Now, let's find the equation of the line AB. The slope of AB is frac{2 - 0}{0 - (-2)} = 1, so AB has the equation x - y +c = 0. Substituting point A into the line equation yields c = 2. Hence, the line AB is given by x - y + 2 = 0.The length of AB can be calculated by the distance formula:AB = sqrt{(-2 - 0)^2 + (0 - 2)^2} = sqrt{8} = 2sqrt{2}.The distance from the center of the circle (1, 0) to the line AB is frac{|1 - 0 + 2|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{3}{sqrt{2}} = frac{3sqrt{2}}{2}.Since the height of Delta PAB (from P perpendicular to AB) is at most the distance from the circle’s center to the line plus the radius of the circle, the maximum value for the height is frac{3sqrt{2}}{2} + 1.The maximum area of Delta PAB can therefore be calculated as follows:max(text{Area of } Delta PAB) = frac{1}{2} times 2sqrt{2} times left(frac{3sqrt{2}}{2} + 1right) = frac{1}{2} times 2sqrt{2} times left(frac{3sqrt{2} + 2}{2}right).Simplify the expression:frac{1}{2} times 2sqrt{2} times left(frac{3sqrt{2} + 2}{2}right) = 2sqrt{2} times frac{3sqrt{2} + 2}{4} = left(frac{6 cdot 2}{4} + frac{2sqrt{2} cdot 2}{4}right).This simplifies to:frac{12}{4} + frac{4sqrt{2}}{4} = 3 + sqrt{2}.Therefore, the maximum area of Delta PAB is boxed{3 + sqrt{2}}."},{"problem":"The distance from a vertex of the hyperbola dfrac{x^2}{a^2} - dfrac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > 0, b > 0) to one of its asymptotes is dfrac{b}{2}.

Here, it suffices to factorize 2021^{a}+4 into prime factors, so we look at the small values of a. Here, when a=1, the equation becomes 2025=3^{b} times 5^{c}, so (a, b, c)=(1,4,2) is a solution. Moreover, if a geqslant 2, no one wants to factorize 2021^{a}+4, so we stop here our exploration of small cases.In a second step, one should either proceed with factorizations or look at the equation modulo a well-chosen number n to reduce the set of possible values of a, b, and c. The numbers 3 and 5 are clearly prime, and our study of the case a=1 indicates that 2021=45^{2}-4=43 times 47. We note this relation in a corner of our scratch paper for later use.Finally, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we reduce our equation modulo n when n is a power of a prime. For example:triangleright n=1, n=2 and n=5 do not provide any information;triangleright n=3 indicates that a is odd;triangleright n=4 indicates that b is even;triangleright n=7 does not provide any easy-to-exploit information;triangleright n=8 indicates, since a is odd and b is even, that c is even.We then set beta=b / 2 and gamma=c / 2. Moreover, two of the three terms in our equation are squares, which allows us to obtain the factorization43^{a} times 47^{a}=2021^{a}=left(3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}right)^{2}-2^{2}=left(3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}+2right)left(3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}-2right) .Since 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}+2 and 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}-2 are two odd integers whose difference is 4, they are coprime.Only one of these two factors is divisible by 43, and only one is divisible by 47. Several cases are possible a priori:triangleright if 47 divides 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}-2, then 47^{a} divides 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}-2, so 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}-2 geqslant 47^{a} geqslant 43^{a} geqslant 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}+2, which is impossible;triangleright if 43 and 47 divide 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}+2, then 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}+2=43^{a} times 47^{a} and 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}-2=1, which is impossible since 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}-2 geqslant 3 times 5-2=13.Thus, 47 divides 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}+2 and 43 divides 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}-2, so that 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}+2=47^{a} and 3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}-2=43^{a}. But then4=left(3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}+2right)-left(3^{beta} times 5^{gamma}-2right)=47^{a}-43^{a} geqslant 47^{a}-43 times 47^{a-1}=4 times 47^{a-1}which shows that a leqslant 1.In conclusion, the only solution to the problem is (a, b, c)=(1,4,2).Comment from the graders The problem was difficult, but many students managed to score points thanks to intelligent reflections. Finding a particular solution is always a step forward, as it allows one to see what can or cannot be proven: here (1,4,2) was a solution, so one could expect to prove that b or c was even, and it was futile to prove that b or c was odd without additional assumptions on a.Let's recall that looking modulo a composite number is rarely intelligent: looking modulo 15, for example, serves no purpose, since the same observations can be made modulo 3 and 5, and since the calculations are simpler, it allows one to avoid making mistakes.Here, the key to the problem was to question the parity of b, c to obtain a square: obtaining squares in Diophantine equations is crucial, as it allows one to factorize and thus simplify the problem. However, once the equation is factorized, some forget to specify that the two terms are positive and even strictly greater than 1, which means one cannot immediately conclude that one of the factors is 47^{a} and the other is 43^{a}. Moreover, it would be good to rigorously justify at the end that 47^{a}=43^{a}+4 implies a=1. For example, one can invoke that 47^{2}>43^{2}+4 and say that by immediate induction 47^{k}>43^{k}+4 if k geqslant 2.## Senior Problems"},{"problem":"We wrote to ten of our friends and put the letters into the addressed envelopes randomly. What is the probability that exactly 5 letters end up with the person they were intended for?","solution":"The number of possible events is 10!, which is the number of ways we can permute the letters in front of the envelopes arranged in a single row for the purpose of placing them.A favorable event is considered when 5 out of the 10 letters end up in their correct envelopes, while the other 5 letters are placed in the remaining 5 envelopes in such a way that none of them are in their correct envelopes. The 5 correctly placed letters can be chosen in binom{10}{5} different ways. In each of these cases, we essentially face the same further task: to determine the number of permutations of the remaining 5 letters - which we will briefly denote by the numbers 1,2,3,4,5 - in front of their respective envelopes numbered 1,2,3,4,5 - briefly: places - such that for each number, one place is forbidden and conversely, for each place, one number is forbidden, for example, the number 1 can be in any place except the 1st, and the 1st place can have any number except 1, and so on.Let's generally call the permutations of the numbers 1,2, ldots, n under these conditions absolute permutations of these numbers, and denote their number by A_{n}. Suppose we know the values of A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, and A_{4}; we will show that A_{5} can be calculated from these.Place the 5 in one of the smaller numbered places, say the 4th. (This also satisfies the requirement for the number 4.) If we now place the 4 in the 5th place - or in other words, swap the 4 and 5 - our task reduces to the absolute permutation of the numbers 1,2,3, the number of which is A_{3}.If, however, we do not place the 4 in the 5th place, then we need to form the absolute permutations of the numbers 1,2,3,4 in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th places (the 4 is forbidden from the 5th place for a different reason, i.e., because we have already dealt with such permutations), which gives us A_{4} number of sequences.Thus, while the 5 is in the 4th place, we get A_{3}+A_{4} absolute permutations, and if the 5 takes any of the 4 allowed places, then A_{5}=4left(A_{3}+A_{4}right).With the same reasoning, A_{4}=3left(A_{2}+A_{3}right) and A_{3}=2left(A_{1}+A_{2}right), and it is obvious that A_{1}=0 and A_{2}=1. Therefore, A_{3}=2, A_{4}=9, and A_{5}=44, so in the problem of shuffling the letters, the number of favorable cases is binom{10}{5} cdot 44.The sought probability isp=frac{1}{10!}binom{10}{5} cdot 44=frac{10!cdot 44}{10!5!5!}=frac{44}{120^{2}}=frac{11}{3600}=0.0031(Alternatively: out of 3600 attempts, the desired arrangement is expected to occur 11 times, or 3 times out of 1000.)Remarks. 1.

This is not a coincidence, and we will explain it below.2. According to the reasoning in the solution, A_{n}=(n-1)left(A_{n-1}+A_{n-2}right). Let's write this equation for A_{2 n}, A_{2 n-1}, ..., A_{3}, and multiply the rows corresponding to odd indices by (-1):begin{aligned}& A_{2 n}=(2 n-1) A_{2 n-1}+(2 n-1) A_{2 n-2} &-A_{2 n-1}=-(2 n-2) A_{2 n-2}-(2 n-2) A_{2 n-3} & A_{2 n-2}=(2 n-3) A_{2 n-3}+(2 n-3) A_{2 n-4} & ldots ldots cdots cdots cdots cdots cdots cdots &-A_{5}=-4 A_{4}-4 A_{3} & A_{4}=3 A_{3}+3 A_{2} &-A_{3}=-2 A_{2}-2 A_{1}end{aligned}By adding and rearranging, and considering A_{1}=0 and A_{2}=1,A_{2 n}=2 n A_{2 n-1}+1and similarly,A_{2 n+1}=(2 n+1) A_{2 n}-1or uniformly,A_{n}=n cdot A_{n-1}+(-1)^{n}3. It is surprising how similar our result is to the relation P_{n}=n cdot P_{n-1} for permutations. But what does the (-1)^{n} term do, which we are inclined to consider negligible next to the \\"large\\" numbers in combinatorics! The first three terms significantly reduce A_{n} compared to P_{n}! In the case of A_{2}=2 cdot A_{1}+(-1)^{2}, this term is even the larger of the two, but even so, A_{2} is only half of P_{2}; then in the case of A_{3}=3 cdot A_{2}-1, the (-1)^{3} term significantly reduces A_{3}, and A_{3}=P_{3} / 3. The found 1 / 3 is the smallest value of the ratio A_{n} / P_{n}.It can be shown - and the submitted solutions worked with this or the reasoning leading to it - that for every n,A_{n}=n!-frac{n!}{1!}+frac{n!}{2!}-frac{n!}{3!}+ldots+(-1)^{n} cdot frac{n!}{n!}from whichlim _{n rightarrow infty} frac{A_{n}}{P_{n}}=frac{1}{e}=0.36 ldotswhere e is the base of the natural logarithm.4.

Let's consider the smallest possible subset of mathbb{R}, which is {0}. For any a, b in {0}, we only have a = b = 0. So, we find- a + b = 0 + 0 = 0 in {0}- a - b = 0 - 0 = 0 in {0}Hence, {0} is a \\"harmonious set\\" and it is finite.

Therefore, the set left{x | x = sqrt{3}k, k in mathbb{Z}right} satisfies the criteria for being a \\"harmonious set\\".

What is the floor of 10 times the expected value of the fourth largest number?","solution":"To solve the problem, we need to find the expected value of the fourth largest number when choosing 5 distinct positive integers from the set ({1, 2, ldots, 90}). We will then multiply this expected value by 10 and take the floor of the result.1. Understanding the Problem:   We are choosing 5 distinct integers from ({1, 2, ldots, 90}). Let these integers be (X_1 < X_2 < X_3 < X_4 < X_5). We are interested in the expected value of (X_4), the fourth largest number.2. Expected Value Calculation:   The expected value of the (k)-th order statistic (X_k) from a uniform distribution on ({1, 2, ldots, n}) can be calculated using the formula:   [   E[X_k] = frac{k(n+1)}{m+1}   ]   where (n) is the maximum number in the set, (m) is the number of chosen integers, and (k) is the position of the order statistic.   In our case, (n = 90), (m = 5), and (k = 4). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:   [   E[X_4] = frac{4(90+1)}{5+1} = frac{4 cdot 91}{6} = frac{364}{6} = 60.6667   ]3. Multiplying by 10 and Taking the Floor:   We need to find the floor of 10 times the expected value of (X_4):   [   leftlfloor 10 times 60.6667 rightrfloor = leftlfloor 606.667 rightrfloor = 606   ]4. Verification Using Combinatorial Argument:   Another way to verify this is by considering the combinatorial argument provided. The expected value of the fourth largest number can be derived using the sum of binomial coefficients and the Hockey Stick Identity.   The expected value is given by:   [   frac{1}{binom{90}{5}} sum_{k=4}^{89} k (90 - k) binom{k-1}{3}   ]   Simplifying the summation:   [   sum_{k=4}^{89} k (90 - k) binom{k-1}{3} = 4 sum_{k=4}^{89} (90 - k) binom{k}{4}   ]   Using the Hockey Stick Identity:   [   4 sum_{k=4}^{89} (91 - (k+1)) binom{k}{4} = 4 left( 91 sum_{k=4}^{89} binom{k}{4} - 5 sum_{k=4}^{89} binom{k+1}{5} right)   ]   Simplifying further:   [   4 cdot 91 binom{90}{5} - 20 binom{91}{6} = left( 364 - 20 times frac{91}{6} right) binom{90}{5} = left( frac{182}{3} right) binom{90}{5}   ]   Thus, the expected value is:   [   frac{182}{3} approx 60.6667   ]   Multiplying by 10 and taking the floor:   [   leftlfloor 10 times 60.6667 rightrfloor = 606   ]The final answer is (boxed{606})"},{"problem":"Let the line l: (m^{2}-2m-3)x+(2m^{2}+m-1)y-2m+6=0 (mneq -1), determine the value of m under the following conditions:(1) The intercept of line l on the x-axis is -3;(2) The slope of line l is 1.","solution":"Solution:(1) The intercept of l on the x-axis is -3, which means the line l passes through the point (-3,0),So, (m^{2}-2m-3)(-3)+(2m^{2}+m-1)⋅0=2m-6,That is 3m^{2}-4m-15=0, factoring gives (m-3)(3m+5)=0,Solving, we get m=3 or m=-dfrac{5}{3},Upon checking, when m=3, the line equation becomes x=0, which does not meet the problem's requirement, so it should be discarded,Therefore, m=-dfrac{5}{3}.(2) The slope of the line is 1, which means the coefficients of x and y in the line equation are opposite numbers and not equal to 0.So, (m^{2}-2m-3)+(2m^{2}+m-1)=0, solving gives m=dfrac{4}{3}, or m=-1But when m=-1, 2m^{2}+m-1=0, so it should be discarded,Thus, m=dfrac{4}{3}.Therefore, the answers are m=boxed{-dfrac{5}{3}} for condition (1) and m=boxed{dfrac{4}{3}} for condition (2)."},{"problem":"A certain laboratory has developed a vaccine for a new type of virus and conducted human injection experiments on 1000 volunteers.

This implies that the probability of X being outside this interval is 1 - frac{19}{25} = frac{6}{25}.Step 2: Calculating the probabilities for X leq 10 and X geq 20Since the normal distribution is symmetric around its mean, the probabilities of X being less than 10 and greater than 20 are equal. Thus, we divide the probability of being outside the interval (10, 20) equally between the two tails:P(X leq 10) = P(X geq 20) = frac{1}{2} times frac{6}{25} = frac{3}{25}.Step 3: Finding the probability of X leq 20To find the probability of X leq 20, we subtract the probability of X being greater than 20 from 1:P(X leq 20) = 1 - P(X geq 20) = 1 - frac{3}{25} = frac{22}{25}.Step 4: Calculating the number of volunteers with M leq 20Since there are 1000 volunteers, the number with M leq 20 is given by multiplying the total number of volunteers by the probability calculated in the previous step:1000 times frac{22}{25} = 880.Hence, the number of volunteers with the value of immune response protein M not exceeding 20 is approximately boxed{880}.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{C}."},{"problem":"11.

Restate the problem in graph theory terms:   - Let each person be represented by a vertex in a graph.   - An edge between two vertices indicates that the corresponding people know each other.   - Condition (a) states that in any subset of three vertices, there is at least one edge.   - Condition (b) states that in any subset of four vertices, there is at least one pair of vertices with no edge between them.2. Apply Ramsey's theorem:   - Ramsey's theorem ( R(3,3) = 6 ) tells us that any graph with 6 vertices will either contain a triangle (3 vertices all connected) or an independent set of 3 vertices (3 vertices with no edges between them).   - Condition (a) implies that there cannot be an independent set of 3 vertices, so any subset of 3 vertices must form a triangle.3. Analyze the implications of condition (b):   - Condition (b) implies that in any subset of 4 vertices, there must be at least one pair of vertices with no edge between them. This means that the graph cannot be a complete graph ( K_4 ) for any subset of 4 vertices.4. Consider the maximum ( n ):   - Suppose ( n geq 9 ). We will show that this leads to a contradiction.   - If ( n = 9 ), each vertex must be connected to exactly 5 other vertices to avoid both conditions (a) and (b) leading to contradictions.   - This would mean that the graph is a 5-regular graph (each vertex has degree 5).5. Check the feasibility of a 5-regular graph with 9 vertices:   - The total number of edges in a 5-regular graph with 9 vertices is ( frac{9 times 5}{2} = 22.5 ), which is not an integer. Hence, a 5-regular graph with 9 vertices is not possible.6. Consider ( n = 8 ):   - We need to check if a graph with 8 vertices can satisfy both conditions.   - If each vertex is connected to at least 4 other vertices, then any subset of 3 vertices will have at least one edge, satisfying condition (a).   - To satisfy condition (b), we need to ensure that no subset of 4 vertices forms a complete graph ( K_4 ).7. Construct a graph with 8 vertices:   - One possible construction is a bipartite graph ( K_{4,4} ), where each vertex in one set is connected to all vertices in the other set.   - In ( K_{4,4} ), any subset of 3 vertices will have at least one edge, satisfying condition (a).   - Any subset of 4 vertices will have at least one pair of vertices with no edge between them, satisfying condition (b).Thus, the maximum number of people ( n ) that satisfies both conditions is 8.The final answer is ( boxed{8} )."},{"problem":"14 cdot 21 n is a positive integer, try to determine how many real numbers x, satisfy 1 leqslant x<n and x^{3}-left[x^{3}right]=(x-[x])^{3}.(Australian Mathematics Competition, 1992)","solution":"【Sol】Let [x]=a, x=a+r, quad 1 leqslant a leqslant n-1, quad 0 leqslant r<1.Then(a+r)^{3}-left[(a+r)^{3}right]=(a+r-[a+r])^{3} .So a^{3}+3 a^{2} r+3 a r^{2}=left[(a+r)^{3}right].Thus, a^{3}+3 a^{2} r+3 a r^{2} is an integer.

Some chess pieces are placed on each vertex of G, and a chess piece can only be placed on one of the vertices of G. The only operation you can perform is that if the number of chess pieces on a vertex v of G is not less than the number of its adjacent vertices d, then you can choose d chess pieces from v and distribute them to the adjacent vertices, with each vertex receiving one piece. If the number of chess pieces on each vertex of G is less than the number of its adjacent vertices, then you cannot perform any operation.Find the minimum value of m such that there exists an initial way to place the chess pieces, with a total of m pieces, and you can start from this placement and perform the operation infinitely many times.","solution":"Solution: The minimum value of m is e.Let the number of vertices in G be n, and the vertex set be V=left{v_{1}, v_{2}, ldots, v_{n}right}, and the number of vertices adjacent to v_{i} be denoted as d_{i}. An operation on v_{i} is defined as distributing the d_{i} chips on v_{i} to its adjacent vertices.Proof:Assume there is a way to place m chips that allows for an infinite sequence of operations.Let an infinite operation sequence be S=left(v_{t_{1}}, v_{t_{2}}, v_{t_{3}}, ldotsright), where v_{i} represents an operation on v_{i}.First, we prove: forall i=1,2, ldots, n, v_{i} appears infinitely many times in S.If not, let A=left{v_{i} mid v_{i}right. appears only finitely many times in S } neq emptyset, V backslash A neq emptyset.By the connectivity of G, there exists v_{j} in A adjacent to v_{k} in V backslash A.By the definition of A, exists N in mathbb{N} such that forall i>N, v_{t_{i}} notin A. Hence, after N operations, the total number of chips on the vertices in A does not decrease. However, there are infinitely many operations on v_{k}, and each operation on v_{k} increases the total number of chips on the vertices in A, leading to an infinite increase in the total number of chips on the vertices in A, which is a contradiction.therefore forall i=1,2, ldots, n, v_{i} appears infinitely many times in S.Now, during each operation, we do the following: (i.e., add some association between chips and edges, if a chip is associated with an edge, then the chip only moves on that edge)Initially, no edges or chips are associated. Before each operation, some chips and edges may have an association, satisfying that each chip is associated with at most one edge, and each edge is associated with at most one chip. If a chip is associated with an edge, the chip must be on one of the endpoints of the edge.Now we are to operate on v_{i}, and let the adjacent vertices of v_{i} be v_{j_{1}}, v_{j_{2}}, ldots, v_{j_{d_{i}}} . First, we look at which chips on v_{i} are associated with edges, and let a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{k} be all the chips on v_{i} that are associated with edges, and assume they are associated with edges left(v_{i}, v_{j_{1}}right),left(v_{i}, v_{j_{2}}right), ldots,left(v_{i}, v_{j_{k}}right). Then we select d_{i} chips from v_{i} to distribute to the adjacent vertices: a_{1} to v_{j_{1}}, a_{2} to v_{j_{2}}, ldots, a_{k} to v_{j_{k}}, and then select a_{k+1}, ldots, a_{d_{i}} from the remaining chips on v_{i}, and distribute them to v_{j_{k+1}}, ldots, v_{j_{d_{i}}}; simultaneously, if the edge left(v_{i}, v_{j_{s}}right) has no associated chip, associate chip a_{s} with edge left(v_{i}, v_{j_{s}}right), for s=k+1, ldots, d_{i}.At this point, the association between chips and edges still satisfies that each chip is associated with at most one edge, and each edge is associated with at most one chip. If a chip is associated with an edge, the chip must be on one of the endpoints of the edge.Notice that for an edge left(v_{i}, v_{j}right), the first chip to move from v_{i} to v_{j} or from v_{j} to v_{i} will be associated with it, and we have already proven that each chip will be operated on, so there will definitely be a chip moving from v_{i} to v_{j} or from v_{j} to v_{i}. Therefore, every edge will eventually have an associated chip.therefore The number of chips m geqslant the number of edges e.Construction:A placement of e chips is called \\"totally ordered\\" if there exists a permutation of V, v_{t_{1}}, v_{t_{2}}, ldots, v_{t_{n}}, such that the number of chips on v_{t_{i}} is the number of vertices among v_{t_{1}}, v_{t_{2}}, ldots, v_{t_{i-1}} that are adjacent to v_{t_{i}}. (Intuitively, this means ordering the vertices of G and assigning a direction to each edge: from the vertex that appears earlier in the permutation to the vertex that appears later; then, for each edge, place a chip at the endpoint of the edge.)For a totally ordered placement, let this placement be derived from the permutation v_{t_{1}}, v_{t_{2}}, ldots, v_{t_{n}}, then the number of chips on v_{t_{n}} is d_{t_{n}}. At this point, an operation can be performed on v_{t_{n}}, and the resulting placement is a totally ordered placement derived from the permutation v_{t_{n}}, v_{t_{1}}, v_{t_{2}}, ldots, v_{t_{n-1}}.A totally ordered placement can be operated on once and still remain a totally ordered placement, so it can be operated on infinitely many times.

Due to the axial symmetry of the circle and the square, the perpendicular line to the tangent at the point of tangency is the axis of symmetry for both figures (Fig. 1). The center O of the circle lies on this axis of symmetry. The side AB of the square is a chord of the circle. Let AB = 2d, and the distance from the side AB to the center of the circle be x. From the right triangle OFB: d = sqrt{1 - x^2}, and since AB = BC, 2d = 1 + x.From this, we get 5x^2 + 2x - 3 = 0 and x = frac{3}{5} (only the positive root is considered). The side of the square is frac{8}{5} units. The problem has a unique solution, which can be easily constructed.Kovács Péter (Tatabánya, Árpád Gymn., 9th grade)II. solution. The desired square can also be constructed without calculation. Take an arbitrary point E on the circle and draw the tangent to the circle at point E.Draw a line through the center O of the circle and the point E (Fig. 2). Then draw a square whose axis of symmetry is the line EO and whose two adjacent vertices lie on the tangent: let this be the square ABCD. Enlarge (or reduce) this square from the center E so that the vertices A and B lie on the circle. The point A' is the intersection of the line EA and the circle, and the point B' is the intersection of the line EB and the circle. A'B' will be the side of the desired square. From the similarity of the figures ABCD and A'B'C'D', it follows that A'B'C'D' is also a square and satisfies the condition. The problem has only one solution (a line can intersect a circle in at most 2 points, one of which is E, the other is A', or B').We still need to determine the length of the side of the square. Let x be half the side of the square, for example, A'F' = x. Then OF' = 2x - 1, because OE = 1. A'O = 1, because it is a radius. In the triangle A'F'O, applying the Pythagorean theorem, we get 1 = x^2 + (2x - 1)^2, which can be simplified to 5x^2 - 4x = 0. From this, x = frac{4}{5}, which is half the side of the square, so the length of the side of the square is frac{8}{5}.Based on the solution by Csató György (Hajdúszoboszló, Hőgyes E. Gymn., 10th grade)Note. Using the notation from Fig. 1, the construction part of the problem can also be solved by starting from the square and constructing a circle that passes through points A, B, and E (basic construction). The completed diagram is then scaled so that the radius of the circle is one unit in length.

In both (i) and (ii) the positive integers m, n are not necessarily different.Merlijn Staps, the Netherlands","solution":"The answer is k=3.First we show that there is such a function and coloring for k=3. Consider f: mathbb{Z}_{>0} rightarrow mathbb{Z}_{>0} given by f(n)=n for all n equiv 1 or 2 modulo 3, and f(n)=2 n for n equiv 0 modulo 3. Moreover, give a positive integer n the i-th color if n equiv i (3).By construction we have f(1+2)=6 neq 3=f(1)+f(2) and hence f has property (ii).Now let n, m be positive integers with the same color i. If i=0, then n+m has color 0, so f(n+m)= 2(n+m)=2 n+2 m=f(n)+f(m). If i=1, then n+m has color 2, so f(n+m)=n+m=f(n)+f(m). Finally, if i=2, then n+m has color 1, so f(n+m)=n+m=f(n)+f(m). Therefore f also satisfies condition (i).Next we show that there is no such function and coloring for k=2.Consider any coloring of mathbb{Z}_{>0} with 2 colors and any function f: mathbb{Z}_{>0} rightarrow mathbb{Z}_{>0} satisfying conditions (i) and (ii). Then there exist positive integers m and n such that f(m+n) neq f(m)+f(n). Choose m and n such that their sum is minimal among all such m, n and define a=m+n. Then in particular for every b<frac{a}{2}, we have f(2 b)=2 f(b). Since a is odd, we have frac{a+1}{2}<a and therefore f(a+1)=2 fleft(frac{a+1}{2}right)= (a+1) f(1). As a-1 is an even integer smaller than a, we have by Lemma 2 that a-1 also has the same color as a. Hence 2 f(a)=f(2 a)=f(a+1)+f(a-1)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-1) f(1)=2 a f(1), which implies that f(a)=a f(1), a contradiction. So a and a+1 have different colors.Since a-2 is an odd integer smaller than a, by Lemma 1 it has a color different from that of a, so a-2 and a+1 have the same color. Also, we have seen by Lemma 2 that a-1 and a have the same color. So f(a)+f(a-1)=f(2 a-1)=f(a+1)+f(a-2)=(a+1) f(1)+(a-2) f(1)=(2 a-1) f(1), from which it follows that f(a)=(2 a-1) f(1)-f(a-1)=(2 a-1) f(1)-(a-1) f(1)=a f(1), which contradicts our choice of a and finishes the proof."},{"problem":"Student A records the outdoor exercise time every day.

This allows us to rewrite a and b in terms of sin A and sin B, leading to the equation sin Acos B - sin Bcos A = sin B.3. Simplifying the equation: Using trigonometric identities, we can simplify the equation to sin(A-B) = sin B. This simplification uses the identity sin x cos y - cos x sin y = sin(x-y).4. Solving for A and B: The equation sin(A-B) = sin B implies two possibilities due to the periodic nature of the sine function: either A-B = B or A-B = pi - B. However, the second possibility, A-B+B = pi, can be discarded because it does not fit within the context of a triangle's interior angles.5. Finding the relationship between A and B: From A-B = B, we deduce that A = 2B.6. Considering angle C: Given that C = frac{pi}{5} and knowing that the sum of angles in a triangle is pi, we have A + B + C = pi. Substituting A = 2B and C = frac{pi}{5} into this equation gives 2B + B + frac{pi}{5} = pi.7. Solving for B: Simplifying the equation 3B + frac{pi}{5} = pi gives 3B = pi - frac{pi}{5} = frac{4pi}{5}. Dividing both sides by 3, we find B = frac{4pi}{15}.Therefore, the angle B is boxed{frac{4}{15}pi}."},{"problem":"390. There are 200 candies. What is the minimum number of schoolchildren to whom these candies can be distributed so that among them, there will always be at least two who receive the same number of candies (which could be zero)?","solution":"triangle Let's find the minimum n such that 200400. There is no need to solve this quadratic inequality in the usual way. Since the product n(n-1) increases with n, the minimum n satisfying the inequality can be found by trial and error: n=21.This means that if there are 21 schoolchildren, there will always be two of them who receive the same number of candies.Let's also verify that with n=20, it is possible to distribute the candies such that any two schoolchildren receive a different number of candies. For this, we will give 19 out of the 20 schoolchildren 0,1,2, ldots, 18 candies respectively. In total, this is 0+1+2+ldots+18=frac{18 cdot 19}{2}=171 candies, and thus 200-171=29 candies remain undistributed. We will give these to the last, twentieth schoolchild.Answer: the minimum number of schoolchildren is 21."},{"problem":"11.
