I also have these really small red dots on my body but not many. I had my doctor look and he didn t think it was anything. I never had a fever, sore throat, rash, and never had diarrhea or vomiting. Is a negative test at 5 weeks a good indicator of remaining negative? Also is easy bruising a symptom of HIV?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. People infected with HIV develop antibodies against HIV in their bodies as early as 1 week after exposure and as late as 3  months after exposure. As you have got negative HIV test 5 weeks after exposure, I would advise you to repeat the test after 7 more weeks, that is around 3 months after possible exposure. If that test is negative, then 97% chances are that you are HIV negative, which is the best percentage any test can give.If the test comes negative and you still suffer from swollen lymph nodes, easy bruising, headache and muscle ache, then you should go for blood test to determine complete blood count which will point towards what is going wrong, like presence of infection in body, possible allergic reaction, virus infection, platelet problems etc. Based on the test reports, further treatment can be advised.I hope this information helps you.

Not bad, just enough to be irritating. Also, I ve been feeling like there s a lump there, and at a certain point if I tilt my head down and to the right I actually have a little bump like when your joints crack. I can feel the bubble like sensation move and feel like a pop in my neck when I do this. I went to the doctors a few months ago with severe front neck pain when I spoke, turned my head certain ways, or swallowed, and the physician gave me some kind of muscle straining test, and with no other concerns, left it at that. Now the pain is back but not as severe with the bubble feeling, when I press on the left it s painful, but not on the right. I m not really worried, but I want to know before I go for another emergency room visit if I ve done something to my neck?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. As you are feeling the lump right under your left jaw, it is possible that you have a swollen submandibular lymph node. As it might be infected, you feel pain when you touch it. This lymph node can be infected due to presence of infection in the throat or in the oral cavity. As you are also having pain while swallowing, more chances are there of throat infection and tonsillitis. In that case, you should visit an ENT specialist to have a look at your tonsils and prescribe you antibiotics if infection is present.If the ENT specialist finds everything fine with the throat, you should consult a dentist to examine your oral cavity to find focus of infection present in the oral cavity. If infection is present in mouth like tooth decay, treatment of the infection will relieve you of pain and discomfort.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

My health has gone down to the point where I lost my job and have filed for disability by advice from my primary doctor. On a general question asked before the doctor responded my issues may be mental related, IE all in my head. Somatoform disorder is what he said. But first let me explain every issue I had been diagnosed with I saw specialists and everything was confirmed on tests. I do have active ulcerative colitis via 17 biopsies. I do have active psoriatic arthritis although my form effects more of my major joints than fingers and toes. I do have arthritis and degenerative disks disease in my spine. My arthritis in my spine is worse in my neck. All my life since being a child I have experienced myoclonic jerks. They can come in clusters in the day but mainly happen when I try to sleep. As a child I had my fair share of head injuries. One requiring blood removal from my skull at age 10. I have experienced blank out spells as a child that got me into a lot of trouble at school and at home. My primary doctor back then did not do any tests or send me to see a specialist. Instead I was put on ADHD drugs. I have noticed multiple times what some call auras. I can be watching TV when suddenly everything in the room looks far away and suddenly all sound goes silent. 5 years ago my GI doctor was trying to figure out why my colitis was not responding to medications other than steroids. An endoscopy found a tumor and multiple tests and CT scans later a trauma surgeon took my case and did the surgery. After the surgery my colitis started getting better but my arthritis exploded. I was diagnosed with spondylosis in my neck with multiple collapsed disks. C1 threw C3 are the worst. I began having stronger myoclonic type attacks in the evening before bed and in the morning. My mother would even tell me I was jerking and blanking out during the day for which I had no memory. Also a few back I started having double beart pause heart beats. Sometimes instead of returning to normal beats i would go into tack for a short period. Then suddenly I started getting these slow motion attacks as I tried to sleep a few weeks ago. They would start with an uplifting feeling in my gut that would spread into my chest. All sound would go away as I felt a slow motion electrical type shock hit me that seemed to take minutes rather than seconds. Then suddenly it was over and my heart would be pounding and I would be sweating. The only emotional feeling was scared that it happened wonder what just happened. These attacks happened back to back as the night went along. I ended up not sleeping for 3 nights straight. I contacted my primary and he put me on klonopin 1mg at bedtime and asked me to see a neurologist. The neurologist asked me to see a psychiatrist to rule out panic attacks. Panic attacks were ruled out so i went back to the neurologist. Instead of asking me questions I was chewed out for letting my doctor put me on klonopin or even suggesting I might need an EEG study. I was sent to a sleep study clinic which ruled out sleep apnea and sent me back for an EEG study. My neurologist then gave in and did a 2 hr sleep deprived study which showed nothing despite being told by the tech I had 2 myoclonic type jerks and asked me why I never hit the panic button so they could be identified better. So my neurologist basically pushed me out the door at that point and doesn t want to see me for another year. what bugs me most is that i worked in orthopedics years ago and know that RA in the neck can effect the brain. I also have a family history of ALS and picks disease. What should I do now. Should I seek out a second opinion? If so should this opinion be from another neurologist or a different field like a spine doctor?","Doctor":"Go for another opinion by neurosurgeon n go to physiotherapist for urRA factor n hv mild mulligan traction n strengthening excs.

I m still concerned. Thanks for your answer.","Doctor":"It is ok but tell ur son dont do any mov. Of fracture leg and don't put wt. On it by walking.

We also noticed a big hard big bite behind her ear on that side. We can tell she still has the stiff neck today by the way she moves bit it is better today. She wouldn t move and was crying until the ibuprofen kicked in yesterday. She has no fever and is acting herself otherwise. Should she see her doctor for this or do we wait it out? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. As you noticed the swelling along with the insect bite mark and your granddaughter is not having fever or any other discomfort, it seems that it is an allergic reaction to the insect poison only. As the swelling is decreasing and she is fine, you can wait for some time or days and it will subside on it own. Alternatively, you can giver her Cetrizine syrup (Zyrtec) 2.5 mg or half teaspoon per day for 3 days. If the swelling worsens or she starts feeling uncomfortable or fever develops, then a pediatrician should be seen for physical examination and sins of infection.I hope this information helps.

It is also effective in relieving pain. The heavier you are, the more stress you put on your joints. Weight reduction for obese patients, wearing shock-absorbing shoes, avoiding activities like climbing stairs and using a walking stick are worthwhile.ACTIVITY MODIFICATION -It is important to maintain as much activity and joint motion as possible, but impact activities will aggravate arthritis. Running and jumping will often accelerate cartilage loss from the joint. The key is to focus on low impact activities, such as swimming or cycling.  USING CANES: Assistive devices can make it easier to go about your day without stressing your painful joint. A cane may take weight off your knee or hip as you walk. Carry the cane in the hand opposite the leg that hurts. ANALGESIC MEDICATION : Simple over the counter medications like acetaminophen is sufficient in most cases. If this fails to control pain, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug may be better.  Hope this answers your query.

I took him immediately to my ped. However he said bleeding will stop on it s own and sent me away. But by the end of the day, my son was bleeding profusely and we took him to emergency. The dr made a suture and the bleeding stopped. But next night, my son fell on his bed playfully before going to sleep, with a pacifier in his mouth. The suture came out and it was bleeding a lot again. We again took him to emergency and as the bleeding did not stop over 1-2 hours, the dr examined and gave him 2 new sutures. This time, the bleeding did not stop immediately. They said we should be in observation for few hours at hospital and then, if the situation does not improve, he may have to be operated. But bleeding stopped after few hours and we came home. It s a week now and he has been bleeding on and off, finally more heavily with some tissue hanging near his mouth. He is using a pacifier. Does the use of pacifier delay his chances of healing. I would really appreciate your opinion. Thanks and regards Subha","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Maxillary frenulum area has very rich blood supply. Hence, it is understandable that when your son was hurt there, he experienced a lot of bleeding that was difficult to stop without suture. Yes, use of pacifier may keep interfering with the healing in the area making your child bleed from the suture and wound area on and off. It will be good for healing if pacifier use is stopped for about a week until permanent healing has occured and there is no chance of interfering the wound. In addition, as a week has passed, I would advise you to visit the surgeon again for the follow up regarding the infection that may have ensued in the area compromising healing and causing recurrent bleeding episodes. If that would be the case, the doctor will prescribe you antibiotics after examination of the wound and the healing will ensue.I hope this answer helps you. Thank you for choosing HCM. I wish your son heals soon.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"Hi, I ve got my lower jaw swollen on the left side. It is exactly on the left side, not below the jaw bone. In other words it’s in the area of mental foramen the size of 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch (sort of like a half of quail egg). It grew to this size in about 2 weeks. It is very hard and stuck to this particular position (it’s not moving under the skin if I try to move it). When I touch it, it s as if I touch a bone under the skin. I have a completely destroyed but not removed tooth in around this area. However I don t have even mild pain (not in the swelling, not in the teeth, not when I press hard on the swelling, no pain at all). The only feeling is some sort of discomfort when I open and close the mouth just because there is something under the skin that was not there before and I didn t get used to that yet. I have normal temperature (no fever). The growing of the swelling seems to stop but it does not diminish. Assessing the situation I sort of ruled out a possibility of infection. All symptoms or lack of them is against it. What could it be?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Regarding the tooth infection, you feel severe pain when the pus or infection is closed in a cavity and cannot get out. In this situation, it causes severe pressure on the surrounding walls which is felt as intense pain to the patient. In your case, if it is an infection, it is finding its way out either through a small hole (sinus) in the swelling or by expanding bone in the area. Thus, we cannot rule out infection of tooth as a cause in your case.Alternatively, submandibular salivary gland opens in the area you have described. So if the duct is obstructed, you may experience such swelling in the area along with feeling of pressure of saliva in the area when you eat.A very rare possibility could a be a lesion of bone where a bone overgrows without any pain.Thus, I would advise you to visit a dentist to look for a decayed tooth first. An x-ray of the area will be taken to see if the infection is related to tooth or it is a bony growth. You might have to go for CT Scan and MRI too. Based on the test results, diagnosis can be made and treatment can be suggested.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic. I wish you feel better soon.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"i was punched on my face and my cheek was swollen that was about 8 months ago,thought it will come down itself but wright now am feeling uncomfortale with my face swollen and when i touch it i feel a congealed blood inside it pls i dont know what to do.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. As the accident happened about 8 months ago and it was associated with swelling of the cheek area, it is possible that the cheek bone or zygomatic arch was cracked or fractured at that time that healed on its own leaving a hematoma-like bump behind. In such case, I would advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for examination of the area and an x-ray that will show any problems with the bony structures in the area.

Good afternoon. I am Dr shareef answering your query.Any pain on the right side of lower abdomen is not necessarily an attack of appendicitis. If I were your doctor, I would advise you to stop eating from out side if you do and also would advise you for a stool test. If positive for a any ova or cyst, treat them with appropriate drug. As your CT and barium meal are normal, appendicitis could be ruled out for the present. However, appendicitis is usually a clinical diagnosis and so you should get yourself examined whenever you get the pain in that particular area. There is no way of preventing an attack of appendicitis. You should take the fear of a general anaesthesia out of your mind, as now a days there is a lot of recent developments in this field, and the anaesthesiologist is equipped with more training and more sophisticated equipment to bring the patient out of anaesthsia. So stay care free.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

She said they were not to worry about, swollen lymph nodes but to let her know if they for bigger. 6 weeks later I called her as they had almost doubled in size. I had also found more lumps. I went back, all of my infraclavicular lymph nodes are enlarged. She sent me to a surgeon, he says it is just a sebaceous cyst and nothing to worry about? My primary doc is sendin me for a second opinion and for a mammogram. I am not sure what to think, or who I should believe.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. The swellings that do not hurt or cause other symptoms may be cysts and unifected cysts do not hurt. They are left where they are without any treatment as they are not harmful to health. If they get infected in future and cause pain and discomfort, then surgical removal of those cysts can be decided as permanent solution. The primary doctor is just ruling out any chance of cancer by sending you for mammogram as breast cancer can sometimes cause painless swelling of infraclavicular lymph nodes. If the mammogram will come negative, then he will agree with other doctors. So the steps you and the doctor have been following are correct and wait until appointment of the second doctor and mammogram. I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing HCM.

I had a bunionechtomy (sp?) and also had an artificial joint put into my big toe, left foot. I was given a medication called Levaquin. I took one pill and immediately started feeling a tingling and numbness in my arms and hands. I called my doctor and he told me to stop the meds which I did, but then it was a few days later that I woke up with the numbness and tingling in my feet. I couldn t figure out what could have caused that so quickly. I was tested for Diabetes, but my A1C is normal. So they have no clue as to what is going on. I went to a Neurosurgeon and he couldn t find anything wrong. He did a test on me using needles, inserting them into certain parts of my legs and then sending an electrical current up through to my spine and back to see if I had a disruption in the nerve conduction. The results were negative. They showed no problems. I then started investigating the drug Levaquin and found out that one of the possiblities as a reaction to that drug is peripheral neuropathy and it can be permanent. It will soon be close to when I had the surgery last June and then got an infection at the end of July beginning of August and was given the drug Levaquin. Also about 2 weeks later I had developed a urinary tract infection and was given Cipro. What I didn t know was that Cipro was from the same family as Levaquin. They are both part of the fluroquinolones family. My question is what are the chances that I really have permanent peripheral neuropathy and that it was from the allergic reaction to the Levaquin and then like adding insult to injury being compounded by the Cipro drug? Still numbing and tingling away.....Thank you","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.As you have this tingling and numbrness feeling, according to my understanding you need a thorough clinical examination and MRI of lumbar spine.

From the symptoms you have described, it is certain that you are suffering from temporomandibular joint problem, the joint near ear that helps in opening and closing of lower jaw along with side to side movements. When the joint has problems in the disc that acts as a cushion when the joint makes movements or if the muscles of mastication are affected, you can face such problems. have you had any accident that may have injured the side of the face? or are you having these troubles since long time? Injury to the joint can sometimes cause such problems.I would advise you to visit an oral surgeon who will examine the joint physically while you make movements, will take an x-ray to examine the associated structures with the joint. You might have to go for CT Scan and MRI, too. Based on the test results, specific diagnosis can be made and treatment can be advised. If the TMJ is affected, you might have to go for a surgical process to correct it. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

Its critical, as I have necrosis in my sinuses, that is getting exponentially worse by the day. The DDS I saw sent me to an Endodontist, who did the scan. He sent it out to be analyzed by ? and the results were: Bone loss to Upper and Lower Jaw; involving some 15 teeth-----BUT SINUSES ARE JUST FINE????!!! Help please. I am frightened by whats happening to me. There is a hole in my Septum that must be considered large by any standard. My nose bleeds daily. and can bleed from both nostrils regardless of the side its coming from. To make matters even worse, I have Mitral Valve Prolapse. WHAT DO I DO? WHO OUT THERE KNOWS HOW TO REALLY SEE WHAT S THERE TO BE SEEN? I NEED ANSWERS & A PLAN OF ACTION, before theres no point in seeking help. Im not clear on the way this chat works. Can someone explain?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. According to me the bone loss of the upper and lower jaws that is associated with 15 teeth is a different problem than the problem of sinus and bleeding from nose. Let us discuss both problems separately. Usually, the bone level of jaw is where the crown of teeth (the part we see in mouth) and the roots meet. With age, due to lack of proper oral hygiene, due to presence of systemic illness like diabetes or presence of gum disease, the bone level may reduce in size exposing roots, making gums bleed, and making teeth loose in their sockets. Visiting a dentist for this situation will help as dentist will perform scaling and root planing which will remove the bacteria, calculus and debris in the gums making gums healthier and stronger. You can also massage gums by using gumex gel daily for about 10 minutes. Make sure you mention to dentist about your heart valve problem as some treatment modifications will be required for you.Regarding the sinus problem, it is difficult to examine sinuses properly in an x-ray that is taken by dentist for examining teeth and bone status. Also, the problems you are facing of bleeding nose and previous bone scan presenting bone necrosis indicated towards some sinus problem. However, it is difficult to advise regarding that in absence of bone scan examination right now. Thus, I would advise you to visit an ENT specialist for the sinus and nose bleed problems. I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

The swelling on the nose bridge after an injury indicates towards possibility of a fractured nasal bone or cartilage. I would advise not to wait and go to an ENT specialist or oral and maxillofacial surgeon who can examine the area physically, take an x-ray and can look for any fractures or cracks in the area. Based on the x-ray examination, any treatment can be decided. If you are in pain right now, you can take an Acetaminophen 500 mg or Ibuprofen 400 mg that is available over-the-counter. You can take 3 tablets a day, if needed. In addition, do not rub any gel, cream or lotion and refrain from heat application until you see a doctor.

I really dont see the need in taking 3 kids to a drs app if its for nothing so any help is appreciated :) thanx","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. As you are using mouthwash Listerine for a long time twice a day, it may change the oral flora due to its continuous antibacterial activity giving environment for the growth of fungus or yeast which may appear as yellow or orange coating. You should continue with the brushing teeth and tongue and start antifungal medicine Fluconazole 150 mg (Fole) once a day for a week. Do not use mouthwash for some months now and then you can use it twice or thrice in a week.If you are on some medicine that you are using routinely, that may also alter the color of tongue as side effect. If that is the case, then you can talk to your prescribing doctor regarding the side effects of the medicines you are taking. However, the headache, achy joints and excessive sleepiness are not associated with this infection. It might be due to the stress of taking care of 3 kids under 5 or due to some other ailment of the body that you may need to consult physician for. If the tongue coating does not disappear after a week, you should consult a dentist for examination of tongue and further investigations.I hope this information helps you.

If there is a clot there should be skin discoloration and also some other symptoms.Taking a clinical examination and a Doppler scan can help reveal the causative factor and then the treatment can be initiated.The swelling can be because of numerous factors like the kidney pathology, the heart malfunctioning, DVT, etc. With the proper clinical examination and diagnostic tests we can rule out the causative factor & the diagnosis induced treatment can be initiated.Do not go by self assumption or by mere internet or Google. Without a thorough examination of a specialist you can just make yourself more weaker by mind . It can be a simple issue to solve rsther making it bigger.Regards Jay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have been feeling sore on the inner side of my left thigh, I thought I had pulled a muscle but the pain slowly is increasing and not getting any better!

He said his left hand started cramping first. He did a ton of yard work yesterday (hand cramps). Too late for urgent care yet not serious enough for the E.R. Any ideas? He is 6 1 and 175lbs. He does suffer from leg cramps.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. There can be two possibilities in your husband's physical condition. First is, he might be having some heart problem which may cause pain in left arm and jaw. You might not feel it serious enough for now but it may increase in intensity and may cause emergency later. Thus, it is better to get it checked once by a cardiologist by an ECG.In absence of heart problem, the hand cramps and jaw pain will be different entities to treat and just a co-incidence that they started together. I would advise you to gen at an appointment of a dentist to check for presence of an infected tooth and abscess related to it. If that is the case, then after getting treatment of that infected tooth by root canal treatment or extraction depending on the extent of infection, your husband will be pain-free. The hand pain might be related to the muscle fatigue due to yard work and can be relieved by taking mucle relaxant medicines like Dan-MR (Paracetamol 500 mg + Diclofenac Sodium 50 mg + Chlorzoxazone 250 mg) twice a day for 5 days.

I met a neurologist and he told its due to my working conditions. Could you please provide tips on how to reduce or cure myself and any precautions that I should be aware of ... Thanks","Doctor":"Hello,It would have been helpful if you had described the working conditions the neurologist has advised you against. Some more information regarding the wisdom tooth and jaw displacement problem that you may have suffered in the past would be good too to advise you in your situation.However, wisdom teeth are not known to be associated with any bulding vein above the ear. In addition, as you have the vein on both the sides, it does not seem to be related to wisdom tooth. Regarding jaw displacement problem, do you suffer from dislocation of jaw that happens frequently when you try to open your mouth wide? Have you met with an accident in the past and injured the TMJ? If any of these two cases is your case, then I would advise you to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for physical examination and further investigations of the TMJ area. Treatment of any disorder present in that area can help you.If you do not have any TMJ problem and vein is not causing you any trouble or discomfort, then you can ignore it unless it presents with any symptoms in future. Alternatively, you can take opinion of an ENT surgeon to rule out any pathology in relation with ears.I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing HCM. Take care.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"I am getting a pain in my right arm after getting three tooth removed with sedation .The arm also feel like it has a small lump under the skin. The other meds I took were one Loranzapan the night before the surgery and two the morning of .then three tylonol a day for pain. What could be causing this.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. The procedure of tooth extraction itself has no relation with pain in arm if the extractions were done under local anesthesia.However, if you were sedated for the extractions, the sedatives must have been given through IV line. If the same arm is having pain as the hand that was used for sedation, then it might be due to needle puncture. In that case, you can apply ice or Thrombophob Gel to the area of lump which will help in faster healing of the needle injury. If the other arm is having pain or if the pain worsens over time, then you should visit the physician for examination of the lump area and necessary treatment.I hope this information helps you.

We were not satisfied with the doctor we saw and was just interested in your opinion. All he said to us was doesn t look like it needs a pin stay off it for two weeks. Nothing about follow up visit to check on it or anything. Should he have some sort of support on it like moon boot or something?","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history.Since there is a metatarsal injury it may need an x-ray since the mechanism of injury suggest one. Ass x-ray will help to understand if there is any hairline fracture. If the x-ray turns negative than it will be just a ligament sprain. Using a ankloid or ankle brace will be good to provide some support to the ankle joint and foot bones. As in most cases of the children if the fracture is hairline or it is only ligament sprain than ankle brace helps to provide additional stability.Cast or boot is required if there is a visible fracture or else with ankle brace it should be fine. Ankle brace is available from companies like tynor, vissco, etc. In a child avoiding musculoskeletal injuries are not advised since the child is in the developmental phase and the growth has to occur in the proper physiological and anatomical way.Regards Jay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have been having a lot of pressure in my head, mostly in the front of my head in my eye area..right above my tear ducts I get swelling in both sacs in the inside of both eyes.

I was checked for a stroke/aneurism. Everything came back negative but I still have symptoms of these pressure headaches","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history of you.As you have headache, this looks to me like a inflammation of the sinus duct. Which we called it as sinusitis. There are numerous sinus duct in that area and any inflammation to it causes such headaches which are not bearable.the joint pains are related to the Repetitive Stress Injury - we call it as RSI. This occurs due to repetition of movements and leading to trauma foe the joint. Performing a regular physical exercise Should help you get rid of the joint aches and pain. Also you can perform some strengthening exercises like weight training to get maximum muscle torque.As for sinusitis I feel you work as a cook and the fumes coming in the kitchen during cooking is leading to inflammation of the sinuses. Using a nasal mask while cooking should help avoid some. Do regular breathing exercises which will help improve the oxygen content in the blood and may help avoiding inflammation of the sinuses leading to headaches. Also, oxygen therapy should also give a positive impact on overall health.Regards Jay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I was hit by a car 2 weeks ago.

Is this just a dentist problem? Is sort of feels like an abcessed tooth yet different place in mouth.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. There can be two possibilities in your situation. First is, as you feel the sore at the different place in mouth, you may have been bitten by an insect while you were asleep and you may have developed allergies due to the poison of the insect presenting as swelling of the face. As you are not feeling any pain, I feel this as a more probable diagnosis. You can start an antihistamine like Levocetrizine 5 mg (Levocet) or Loratidine 10 mg (Lorfast) once a day for five days. If it would be allergic reaction, you must feel relief in the swelling after the fist dose of the medicine.Alternatively, you might have an impacted or infected wisdom tooth which usually presents with this kind of swelling in patients. It could also be a decayed tooth which may have developed abscess and swelling. In that case, you should visit a dentist for oral examination, x-ray of the area involved to confirm the possibility. If that indeed is the case, then extraction of wisdom tooth or treatment of decayed tooth will relieve you of swelling.The sore that you have developed in mouth can be treated by local application of Benzocain gel (Mucopain) 3-4 times a day over the ulcerated area, especially before meals to avoid pain and burning due to eating.

Choice is depending upon the Clinical symptoms and also the laboratory investigation.regards Jay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"On multiple occasions I have awoken in the middle of the night with, what I can only describe as, the feeling of a football shoved under my diaphragm. It feels like my stomach (internally) is solid. The pain worsens if i lay on my stomach. I have to immediately stand and hold my arms over my head in order to get full breaths. In addition, there is a dull pain that runs through my lower sternum to the middle of my back.","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history of you.As per the history a thorough clinical examination is advised. For blotting of the stomach it could be a acidity or gastric issue which needs an examination. Getting a thorough blood test and ultrasonography of the abdomen can help us understand better. Also the pain in the lower sternum to back can be due to this but on a safer note getting a cardiac assessment done by ECG and echo of cardiac will be helpful to differentiated the problem and rule out any cardiac pathology. Also for breathing problems it could be an acidity which is stopping the diaphragm to function properly and thus breathing exercises for respiratory muscles should help to resolve the problems.Regards Jay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"My husband has had a rash all over his body for almost 2 weeks now and it is getting worse, he said that he could hardly walk earlier today, he is running a fever and all his joints and muscles hurt almost like a Charlie horse.

As you are 50 years old this could be degenerative changes happening in the body. This is a normal human physiological process. Also, checking the kidney function test and vascular insufficiency will make understand the cause of the discoloration of the skin and swelling.

It comes on suddenly and its very painful. If I eat or drink it immediately gets worse and if I bend over it gets worse. It kept me up all night and is still bothering me","Doctor":"Hello. This is Dr. Herisa Palla. I read your concern very carefully. The way you describe the location of the pain and the way it comes very suddenly it suggests toward a stomach origin of pain. It may refer to gastritis which is the inflammation or irritation of the lining of the stomach. The other probable diagnose  could be Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) which is a condition in which the stomach contents (food or liquid) leak backwards from the stomach into the esophagus (the tube from the mouth to the stomach). This action can irritate the esophagus, causing heartburn and other symptoms.I would suggest you should avoid hot and spicy foods, alcohol too.You can take antiacids such as Ranitidine or Omeprasole in order to reduce the pain. But I also recommend an upper endoscopy in order to check the condition of the stomach, esophagus and to discover the origin of the pain.Feel free to ask for anything unclear to you.Best regards"},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with gout, but I was checking into pseudogout.

These are the few.• Due to Gout - Increases uric acid levels in the blood can lead to pain in the foot. A urine examination can help us diagnose it.• Due to plantar fasciitis - as this can be due to the losing of the flexibility of the fascia and inflammation of the same the pain can arise• Due to calcaneal spur - in this there is a calcium deposition in the calcaneum bone and the pain is transferred from heel to whole foot. Since x-ray and MRI are normal this condition can be ruled out• Due to Lumbar spine disc degenerative disease - due to compression of the nerves in the lumbar spine at the L4-L5-S1 regions the pain can be felt in the foot. An MRI of spine can help understand this.Now we have to find the possible close by symptom and rule out the differential conditions and come to a provisional diagnosis.Treatmemt can be made accordingly with physical therapy and good results can be achieved.Regards Jay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have.

If you get those swellings again, you can take an antihistamine like Levocetrizine 5 mg (Levocet) once a day for few days and can also make a diary of all the things you eat so it can help in finding out what substance you are allergic to.The white striae on the side of the tongue are sometimes due to pressing of large tongue over the surfaces of teeth or due to fungal infection/inadequate hygiene of the tongue. Moreover, the precacerous lesions you are describing can also persist for a long time, are not removable and are painless. Thus, I would advise you to visit your dentist for the physical examination of the white lines and further investigations if needed.In addition, I would advise you to start with Multivitamin tablet (B-Folcin) once a day for at least a month. Many oral lesions are due to just vitamin deficiency and they clear after correcting the deficit. I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

If you are having pain that increases while eating hot or cold food, tooth pains while chewing and if there is some areas in oral cavity where food particles get stuck everytime you eat and it is difficult to remove them, then it could be tooth infection.If you experience pain while opening or closing movements of jaw, hear/feel clicking or popping sounds while opening and closing movements, then it could be TMJ problem.However, the symptoms you are explaining indicates more towards to possibility of an impacted wisdom tooth that may have infected surrounding gums and may be causing pressure on the adjacent teeth. You should visit a dentist and go for xray of the wisdom tooth area of the lower left side. If the tooth is indeed the cause, then its removal is advised.

Metallic taste in mouth could be due to medications, food allergies or CNS problem. It is possible that the medicines you might be taking for cardiomyopathy and probably control of blood pressure may cause metallic taste in mouth.In addition, some CNS disorder that impairs the sensory messages to brain from several areas of body can be responsible for the metallic taste in mouth. As your head and back are hurting and your are feeling dizzy too, I would advise you to visit the doctor treating you for Devic's syndrome to figure pout if nerves responsible for perceiving taste sensations in brain are okay.Unfortunately, very less can be done to help the metallic sensation until the underlying cause is cured.

The most common cause of itchy tongue and ears is allergic reaction. You might not be aware of it and usually one exposure to allergen cannot give allergic symptoms for 6 months. In this situation we can assume that probably you are having allergy to food item that you regularly consume.I would advise you to start antihistamines like Levocetrizine 5 mg (Levocet) once a day for 5 days. If you find relief, then it is allergic reaction only. In addition, go for a blood allergy test that will give idea regarding what food substances you are allergic to and will help you to avoid them.

This is the commonest thing which occurs in foot injuries.

As you had developed a cyst on the right side, it is possible that you might have developed the same type of cyst on the left side which may cause similar symptoms as you experienced on the right side. Alternatively, the condition can be unrelated and the lymph node might be enlarged just because of bacterial infection that it may have acquired.Usually, such swellings are treated with antibiotics first as bacterial infection can be the first assumption. However, your doctor is advising a sonogram because of your history of a cyst on the other side. At this stage, I can help you with this little information that if the swelling is painful, it could be infection and in case of absence of pain, chances of a cyst are more.I would advise you not to worry about the situation as in any case, the condition is not severe and can be treated with medicines or small surgical procedure.

He describes the pain as spreading to the lower abdomen and groin and comes in waves that fluctuate in intensity. He has painful urination and brownish foul smelling urine. He reports a persistent urge to urinate and urinating more often than usual along with nausea and vomiting","Doctor":"Brief Answer:This symptoms may be due to urinary tract infection.Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM.This symptoms may be due to urinary tract infection such as cystitis (bladder), urethritis (urethra), or pielonephritis (kidneys). The only way to diagnose an infection is checking a urine sample and after that performing a urine culture. The urine culture is the most accurate test to determine for sure whether or not an infection is present. The lab puts the urine sample in an incubator. If any bacteria are in the sample, they will multiply and show up. However, it takes 24 to 48 hours for the bacteria to grow enough to be detected.  The urinoculture should be followed by Antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST). Based on the result of the last one, you may take a specific antibiotic treatment. I suggest you to undergo an abdominal ultrasound too, in way to exclude any possible structural cause of the UTI.

I get a horrible burning rash like feeling when I take those meds. As I have RA, Fibro Myalgia, and all of my Lumbar Disks are herniated, and the L5 disk is ruptured. I have a Spinal Cord Stimulator that works most times, but there are times when my pain is so bad that I need to take pain meds. Now that I cannot tolerate codeine drugs, I would like to know if there is anything else I can take?","Doctor":"Brief Answer:You can use drugs from the third class of opioids such as tramadol 100 mg orally every 6 hour as needed, with a maximum dosage of 400 mg per day.Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM. I understand your concern and i will try to help you. All the medications you mentioned above belong to opioid class of drugs. Eventhough you are allergic to codeine, Vicodin, oxy, you still need to take an opioid, because i suppose you have tried weaker pain relievers without any satisfactory result. So what to do ? There are three groups of opioids: Group 1 (aka opiates) - Naturally occurring agents derived from the opium plant, such as morphine, codeine, thebaine.Group 2 - Semi-synthetics, such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, buprenorphine (heroin is also in this group).Group 3 - Synthetics, such as fentanyl (alfentanil, sufentanil, etc.), methadone, tramadol, propoxyphene, meperidine.You just need to choose an opioid that is structurally different from the group, part of which is codein (Group 1) or oxycodone (Group 2).Your solution is to use one of the third group of opioids, because they have structures different enough and can be given to a patient intolerant to the natural or semi-synthetics without fear of allergic reactions. For example : tramadol (Cemadol CR) 100 mg orally every 6 hour as needed, with a maximum dosage of 400 mg per day.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

As you have been working in the environment that exposes you constantly to iron particles in a closed space for long hours of days and for 10 constant years in addition to insufficient protective measures for the workers, your blood disorder/cancer can be related to it. Unfortunately, not all countries of the world follow adequate rules for the protection of health of its workers posing them at risk for such diseases. In addition, all countries have different laws regarding compensation for the health treatment of their workers, which you can learn from your lawyer.Under such circumstances, as your doctor has advised, it is best to change the working environment which stops your exposure to harmful metal particles along with starting prompt treatment for the disorder you have developed.

It is our belief that it has gotten worse over time! Please, any ideas what is wrong?","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history.A thorough clinical examination is advised along with an x-ray or an MRI.As the knee is in his it needs a thorough clinical examination and an MRI to understand the ligament injuries.Also there will be shortening of the quadriceps and lengthening of the hamstring muscle.

Not sure of cause but nowim getting left upper arm muscle spasms that are a noticeable pulsing and I just realized it was noticeable after I did a workout. Would it be a neck muscle strain, or something more concerning. What is the best method to fix the problem. Feels like a pinched nerve but exray doesn t show anything","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.As you have a doubt of the pinched nerve in the cervical spine, than an x-ray will not reveal such nerve compression because x-ray show roughly the idea about the bone and fractures. Also for nerve injuries in the cervical spine usually an MRI is advised to see the amount of disc pressure applied on the nerve root.Also, chiropractor can help unlocking the facet joints and there by spasm can be relieved but the actual compression on the nerve root may not get relived. Also, massage can help soothen the muscles and lead to vasodilation to the muscle and reduce the pain.For the proper way to handle the discal injuries the muscle strength has to be regained as by regaining the strength the inter vertebral space is maintained and the compression from the nerve root will be elevated. that is how the in my clinical practice we rehabilitate the patients.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Hello docotor, I am having severe abdominal pain for the last 2 weeks.

Right frontal lobe, facial fractures; Do u think he is getting better? Is it advisable to move him to another hospital, he need venti support now and then; CT scans are better doc says; No surgery was required.","Doctor":"hi,Thank-you for providing the brief history of you.As it was a ETA and serious injuries leading to low GCS score, he needs a thorough attention. CT is always good for helping Doctor for planning further medical management. As his hand movement are recovering there will be a positive sign as well. Grabbing the tube is due to the irritation happening to the trachea and the brain is trying to perform some activity for hand to move and grab the tubes out. This is a positive reaction but by grabbing the tube and pulling it out may lead to serious issues.Now since we have to only wait and see how his brain is recovering from the TBI as it's all time framed reactions. Also if the ventilator is advised than there is a serious brainstem issue for which an MRI or CT has to be performed. Surgery for anything may not be of a good choice since the patient is in comatose state.Also, having the urine and lung infection he may need a good oxygen supply for allowing the body to heal. As oxygen is a major source of energy supply for the normal human physiological functionsto keep in mind that many of the infections are due to hospital acquired and he need to be kept completely hygienic for each and everything.Frontal lobe injury will take its own time to injury and since the brain will be still in a shock state this comatose state will come down as the inflammation in the brain comes down.Important to mention that shifting the patient in this situation for more than 20 kilometers will not be goodRegards Jay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, I have a patient with infected nonunion fracture shaft femur with osteopetrosis. was operated 4 years back with DCP, got infected failed, was redone by a different surgeon with LCP and has failed again.

Sometimes a impacted wisdom tooth can compress the lingual nerve, which supplies the lower lip and chin area causing numbness in the supplied area unless it is decompressed by removal of the wisdom tooth. Impacted tooth means the tooth that cannot come put in oral cavity because it lacks physical space to come out and is stuck in the bone. You are tight in assuming that it might cause pressure on other teeth, too causing vague pain and pressure feeling.I would advise you to visit a dentist and go for physical examination along with x-ray of the left sided wisdom tooth are. An x-ray called OPG is more preferable as it presents the surrounding area and vital structures around the tooth well. If x-ray shows impaction of the tooth, I would advise you to get it removed after consultation with an oral surgeon. However, if wisdom tooth is not a problem, you should visit a neurologist or maxillofacial surgeon for further investigations such as MRI to find out the cause of the numbness.I hope this information helps you.

How can I remove it? I tried brushing it and it didn t work for me, please reply","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. However, a burn by drinking hot coffee, even if it was too hot, is not known to cause burn mark on tongue that can last for 6 years. It might be some other discoloration or lesion and not the burn mark. If you are able to taste the food and if your tongue does not experience numbness, chances are less that it is a burn mark. Is it a white discoloration or black?In case of white discoloration, it can be presence of fungal infection called candidiasis, psoriasis, lichen planus or precancerous lesion such as leukoplakia. If it is black, it could be normal melanin pigmentation, melanoma - a benign tumor, or hairy leukoplakia. Drinking too much tea or coffee or use of tobacco products can change the tongue color too.I would advise you to visit a dentist for the physical examination of the discoloration as diagnosis of the discoloration is mandatory in order to decide if it harmful or harmless.I hope this information helps you.

After they put in a PiccLine. I did get a blod clot on my arm from the PICCline. I also got a blod clot in the actual right knee.

The doctors stated in quoting I was like on heroin and going through withdrawels. they basicly put me on IV and nutrients through IV for about 4 nights straight. Recently about 15 days ago the Range of motion was 72 passisve. So this doctor thought time for a manipulation. Due to all the issues this was to be couple of nights overstay.

I have been experiencing a very subtle and minor numbness in my big toe, no pins and needles feeling, but I can definitely tell it feels unusual. I first noticed it back in February of this year but it was never major enough to bother me. Just felt numb when I touched it with my fingers or other foot. Today however it has been more prominent and it looks swollen compared to my right big toe which feels completely normal. My right foot has been in a medical boot due to a sprained ligament. I also work retail and spend most of the day on my feet in flat sandals that really don t offer much support. I m wondering if I should ice this to reduce the swelling or take an anti inflammatory? I know numbness is not a common thing for the big toe and I am worrying myself even more by looking up symptoms and causes on the internet. If you could help me I would greatly appreciate it!","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.As the numbness is in the for this could be due to any of the musculoskeletal or neuromuscular issue.having a clinical examination performed and an MRI of lumbar spine should help understand the soft tissues.As due to mild impingement of the nerve in the L5-S1 region there may be numbness in the toe and this is the first symptom.Also since it is toe you need to even check your uric acid levels via urine examination to rule out the gouty arthritis.As per my clinical practice most patients needs a differential diagnosis method to be performed to find the root cause.Also doing icing is better than anti inflammatory drugRegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Thanks for taking my question.

I went to the dentist and it is not a root canal problem. I do not grind my teeth, so it isn t tmj. What type of a dr or dentist should I see? Any ideas of what can be causing the problem? I didn t realize there was a charge. Forget it","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. It would have been easier to advise you if you had mentioned the pain is in the upper or lower jaw. I am answering for both possibilities.If it is in the lower jaw, it could be due to an impacted third molar, the wisdom tooth that is stuck in the jaw, trying to come out but probably there is less physical space available for it to come out so it is locked and causing pressure and pain in jaw and gums. To confirm this diagnosis, your dentist can take an x-ray (IOPA) or you can go for OPG (more preferable) that will show all teeth of your mouth. If the pain is in the upper jaw, third molar possibility can be considered for that, too. However, sometimes severe sinusitis can cause pain in upper teeth and gums. Are you having symptoms of sinusitis, like cold, congestion, headache etc? Do u feel pain if pressed in the area below eye and around cheek area on left side? If yes, then this is the possibility, which can be solved by an ENT specialist. Taking a painkiller like Ibuprofen 400 mg or Acetaminophen 500 mg 8-hourly will help till diagnosis is made.I hope this advise helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

Zometa does has many side effects including the jaw pain and irregular heart beat. Though noises is ear is not a side effect associated with the medicine, it might be due to nerve related side effects that can affect the ear and cause noises. However, the doctor had prescribed you this medication because the benefits of it outweighed the side effects regarding your health condition. In addition, chemotherapy with Abraxane is also associated with the side effects like muscle pain, bone pain, diarrhea, vomiting, numbness and tingling sensations etc. However, the pains are well controlled by Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen.

Also, to the younger generation who have underwent the scoliosis surgery do get post surgery symptoms at early or later stages of life by having muscle weakness and nerve root entrapment. We advice the patient who have undergone or who have not undergone surgery only physical therapy as most of the symptoms can be controlled as well.I also wish your father a good health as ageing doesnt require any surgery but a proper care and approach as well.In my clinical practice, i see geriatrics with a lot of spinal problems, but surgery is not the choice to perform as due to the age factor chances of the future years to get trouble may become high due to degenerative changes in the body.

Regards R.K.Rao","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of your mother.As your mother is advised with TKR, I think in many of the cases TKR can be delayed or avoided even depending upon the clinical findings.As your mother is 64 years old, there will be some degenerative changes happening within the joint which may lead to damage of cartilages within the knee joint. If the x-ray has revealed no joint space most surgeons will recommend TKR as to reduce the pain levels. Also, due to knee pain, there will be changed in normal gait mechanism leading to stress and strain on the spinal column leading to back pains.In my Clinical practice, most patients never underwent surgery even after the x-ray was indicating the TKR. As we follow a strict protocol to rehabilitate the knee and back to make sure the surgery is avoided to 99%.Also, in my practice many patients been seen under me who had a prescription of advice for TKR but never underwent. The first foremost thing we did is a thorough clinical examination and then used the diagnostics for understanding the knee mechanism and predicted the outcome score. infact we got more than we expected.Many patients coming to me with similar complaints are actually having a functionally active life style like jogging.

Having an medial arch for the feet is not a bad thought but understanding the actual mechanism and change in the normal body due to medial arch needs a thorough understanding.

I had it for almost one week now, it has shrunk a bit but not to a normal condition. I felt tightness and I went to emergency dept and they brushed me off as a simple burst vein there and does not pose a danger. They also told me to wait until it heals by itself.I can t do my day job and it really bothers me. Do I need to get a second opinion and have it checked? Or this is really not a dangerous condition?

Many a times it is just an adaptation to vascular system. Also, if you are facing any symptoms or signs like vision issues, headaches, etc you can get it examine by a neurologist in person which can help us understand what can cause this. Also, the feeling of tightness will be just more of a psychological as you are getting worried.In my clinical practice such bulging of vein is not at all harmful and is just a simple adaptation of the vascular system for which nothing to be worried.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Hi, Thanks for your advice.

As ice is a hard substance, injury can be possible and post thorough examination we can request for an x-ray of the chest and hip to figure out if any fracture is persisting.Most of the times, swelling is a protective mechanism and it occurs in both, muscle injury as well as bone injury.I will recommend you to take an x-ray of the chest and hip so we can understand the bony status better.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"hi i have a hernia in the groin it started to hurt very bad two days ago i went to the immediate care went for a ct scan and now have to wiat 5 days for the results,but dont think i can wait that long why does it hurt down to the knee the meds are not doign the job should i go to the emergancy","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.I think you are mentioning about inguinal hernia here and have done CT for the same for the diagnosis. Kindly wait till the reports come as it may help understand the soft tissues better.Inguinal hernia may lead to symptom of having pain in the knee, since due to hernia there will be pain in the groin region and the muscles of the front of thigh arise from the ASIS and go down the thigh bone called femur. And due to the inflammation at the inguinal region there will be excess load happening at the knee joint leading to gait disturbances and pain. As you are already under the pain medication I will advice you to undergo physical therapy like therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy which will help reduce the pain in the location of inguinal area as well as the reffered pain in the knee joint too. once the pain come under control there will be little of stretching and strengthening of the muscles to avoid the hernia localized and referred pain as well.In my clinical practice, physical therapy is helpful for patients with inguinal hernia for pain which is localized and even referred.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"My xray results were as follows: the bony structures of the pelvis and hips appear intact. No acute fracture, focal destruction or dislocation is seen. There is narrowing of the right and left hip joint spaces with adjacent osteophytes at the acetabulum and slight sclerosis at the acetabulum on the right and left. In addition, there appears to be degenerative disc disease at the lower 2 at (sic) 3 levels of the lumbar spine at the disc space. Impression: there is moderate DJD of the right and left hips Degenerative disc disease in the lower lumbar spine Is this normal wear and tear for a 65 year old female? Moderate to very active throughout lifetime.","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.As your reposts indicate that is degenerative changes in both the hip joints with reduction in the joint spaces. Also the lumbar spine has degenerative changes in the disc which is the soft tissue structures in between the two vertebral bodies.As due to this, there will be pain in the hip joint and also the lumbar spine. Depending upon the extent of the lumbar disc degenerative changes there might be even pinching of nerve root and leading to radiating pain.Also, an MRI will be good to understand the lumbar spine disc degenerative changes. Your age is 65 and having degenerative changes are common as i notice in my clinical practice.Also, for such cases usually physical therapy iw recommended for pain management and also for muscle strengthening.

The vision is totally very bad and only the person undergoing will know. Also, for macular degeneration the Steroid injections are effective to a certain extent, but the healing of the issue is totally depended upon the body. With steroid injection only the symptomatic treatment can be done and nothing more to reverse the degeneration process.I will advice you to do regular general body exercises, take oxygen therapy, do breathing exercises, meditation and allow the body to utilize its own natural medicine produced within to help control the degeneration process.In my clinical practice, i have seen cases with macular degeneration and performing the combination of therapy i mentioned, it has got some benefits in the patients, but to be honest the reversal process will surely take time.

But ortho doctor says its normal.","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of your daughter.As she has a cyst formed in the medial posterior aspect of the bone I think it should be a calcium deposition. Since the child is in the growing stages she may have some changes of growth of the bones. As bones also has some remodelling phase during the growing ages of a Child certain things are time framed and goes off on its own. As the ortho said, this is not to worry as he might want to speak about the growing phase of your child and also the remodelling of the bone which he must have not explained.In my opinion this is not so worrying thing as it's only giving pain due to the remodelling of the bone. In case the pain worsens over a period of time and this remodeling doesn't remove the excess deposition of the cyst may be an excision of the cyst will be performed.In my clinical practice many parents comes with child having pain and aches, but this is the growing phase of the child and may have some aches and pains. I advice them to take the child for swimming as it will help better for muscle movements for its relaxation, strengthening and stretching.

Also, the tibial plateau is fracture and the unstable compartment I will advice you to have another corss consultation with other ortho as this looks a more of the failure of the first partial knee replacement.Also, if you had full ROM and good mobility knee joint, certain issues shouldn't occur. but if you have applied an abnormal weight or have injured your knee then the plateau fracture can occur.Also, pre partial knee replacement and post operation how is you bone strength. Are there any changes in the dexa scan report? this report makes a lot of sense to understand whether the partial or full knee replacement has to be taken into consideration.As the tibial plateau fracture needs an understanding and based on it the next surgical or conservative treatment plan can be decided. In a grade 1/2 degree of fracture it might not be advised to undergo any surgery but if the fracture is massive then a surgery might be needed.Also getting a full knee ROM post TKR is not the only thing in the rehabilitation process, even the muscle imbalance needs a correction to avoid stress and strain injuries to the bone.In my clinical practice such cases like yours are very uncommon and treatment will be totally symptomatic post all the parameters taken into consideration.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Hello, I was diagnosed with hep c in 1980, am taking narcotics and gabapentin for pain relief from degenerative disc disease, I was apparently having allergic reactions to the gabapentin and was prescribed lactulose with no questions, warnings, contraindications or instructions to follow.

The degenerative disc disease occurs dude to weakness of the spinal muscles which allows the spinal column to reduce in size and then later provides compression on the disc and the pinching of the nerve roots.Usually in my clinical practice such cases with degenerative disc disease are recommended with physical therapy as to get the maximum outcome and reduce the medication. As medicine over a longer run are not good for the kidneys and may lead to damage.

Taking a proper care is of due importance. Also, the pain has to be high since it is close to the brain and the muscular system is too less to provide a big support. If the muscles were bulky enough like thigh or hip then things were different but any increase in the pain you need to contact your Surgeon again as smallest injury when it becomes big no can predict.Also, you need to be very careful as the TMJ surgeon tries their best and the effort from them is really incredible. what you eat, how you chew, how you posiuon yourself in sleeping etc makes a very high understanding here.

However this test is only conducted for patients with symptoms suggestive of CMT. If no symptoms this test can't be used for screening purpose."},{"Patient":"I have reynaulds mostly effecting my fingers. I had foot surgery on three toes and a bunion. The middle toe was straighted out and a nerve was moved because it was pinched. After 4 days my incision was turning black. My doctor said it was superficial. He told me to put neosporin on it. I did for two weeks but it got worse. I went to my rheumatologists and she suggested I go back to the surgeon and get stronger antibiotics. I did, but within a week I was in the hospital with an infection. They said it was ecoli and it was in my bone. Could this not have been prevented?","Doctor":"Hi thereevery operation carries a 1% risk of infection. the surgeon will do his best to prevent post operative infection but still a small group of patients will get infected. this is unfortunate but true.

I have a bit of anxiety and don t know if I am over analyzing or worrying over this. Last week I was obsessing over my freckles...color, shapes, etc. I am a fair skinned red head, so I have had freckles all my life (I am 27). But a show on tv got me paranoid. While I was looking at my freckles I just so happened to feel and find a knot on the inside of my elbow. If you were to turn your palm up and l look at your elbow crease, it is on the side of my arm closest to my body, just above the crease I cannot tell if is movable or fixed in position. It sort of feels movable, but I am kind of overweight and have fat in my arms, so it is confusing. It feels round. Of course when you search online, almost every symptom could be the dreaded C word, and I start feeling panicked. I have two small children and that is not what I want to worry about. I m thinking it is nothing, and quite possibly scar tissue from maybe an IV I had several months ago while having a heart issue. But, is it possible it is something more serious, such as melanoma, or a symptom of disease?","Doctor":"Hi therefrom the description you give I get the impression that this knot is something benign(not cancer) it can be anything from irritation from IV Line to a lipoma(fatty lump).signs of a soft tissue cancer are summarized with acronym \\"BAD\\"B: big : usually bigger than 5 cmA:angry: grows faster, is painful and has irregular borderD: deep, is deep seated and fixed to underlying tissues and to skin.If your knot doesn't have these characteristics it is unlikely to be a cancer."},{"Patient":"I have been getting dull ache pain/cramps in my lower abdomen, I read it could be due to Ovulation and the pain could be implantation pain (falling pregnant) , but I have had the implanon in since last year.

Like undergoing physical therapy for the general body conditioning is a must since you had radical nephrectomy. As due to the surgical procedure there will be weakness in the abdominal muscles which are also the muscles of the respiration. As weakness comes the cardio respiratory endurance falls. Regaining the cardio respiratory endurance is a must to have a functionally active lifestyle.In my clinical practice, once the patient undergoes surgery, we advice them to undergo physical therapy doe general body conditioning and also cardio respiratory endurance training.

My latest x rays show a floating mass in my left knee (most likely cartilage). That knee now makes a popping sounds (no pain but feels uncomfortable) when i straighten it after being bent for a period of time. Because of this disorder, I often get flashes of instances where my knee pops out, whence in pain even though nothing is happening and just fearful that it will happen again at any given moment. I get very anxious every so often. Not every day but at least 1-2 times a week. Not sure if this a form of PTSD but looking to at least resolve the uneasiness of my situation. Any thoughts?

As major support of the knee joint is through the muscles and the ligaments.Strengthening the knee muscles in a proper technique using a multiple kinetic and kinematics your muscles can be taken into the balancing role to support the knee. Also, for the ligaments to act and keep the joint in position a proper proprioceptive neuromuscular training is needed to activate the joint proprioception.

Based on this we can understand as what MRI needs to be performed. But on a safer side taking and MRI of the cervical spine and brain in contrast will make some insight.The pain in the neck and shoulder -  this looks more of the Neuromuscular issue. Like if there is any pinch of the nerve root in the cervical spine then there is a possibility of the radiating symptoms and pain. For which physical therapy is a choice to get solution for. Evidence of research has a good support.For the balance issue - it should be assessed in detail as this can occur due to two issues. One any vestibular related issue or any cerebellar related issue.

Should I do any other tests?","Doctor":"Hello dear,The symptoms as mentioned in your post can be attributed to accumulation of gas secondary to increased acid production in the stomach.As the investigations like sonogram, egd and colonoscopy does not reveal any abnormality, pathological cause for the symptoms can be ruled out.Symptomatic relief can be obtained with intake of Pantoprazole preparation (to be taken twice a day before meals) & antacid gel (to be taken after meals).They prevent formation of excess acid in the stomach & provide symptomatic relief.And it is also needed that you take certain precautions regarding your diet & lifestyle, such as:1. Take soft, plain, non-spicy foods.2. Drink lots of water to maintain adequate hydration.3. Avoid fast foods & gas producing food products like cabbage, etc.4. Avoid smoking & alcohol.5.

The pain was less when I was running than walking.","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. Muscle tightness is because it's over-lengthened, stretching will not resolve the problem because it's already over-stretched, stretching will most likely irritate the muscle further. Problem lies in the opposing muscle group.you can do this for prevention or treatment:  Stretch or roll your quadriceps (front thigh muscles)and hip flexors with quad stretch.Stretch your hamstrings by lying on your back, NOT by standing up and trying to touch your toes.Strengthening core especially abdominal muscles.Try incorporating planks into your routine.Strengthen hamstring muscles with leg curls. Use no weight or a very light weight at first. Ice the site immediately after any exercise for 15 to 20 minutes. Also try wearing compression shorts to help support the affected muscles.Massage Therapy can help by relaxing tight muscles, improving flexibility, and restoring joint range of motion.       Visit your physician if the pain is persistent, if you are limping or altering your gait in any way, and especially if you notice any bruising. Physical Therapy can help healing and work on correcting any muscle weaknesses or imbalances.Hope this answers your question.

If the SLR Test is positive clinically than it might be related to the pinched nerve, if this test is negative then the issue is muscular.Also, if you have a bubbling sensation than understand of the vascular system is needed . If any skin color changes are present in the lower limbs a vascular hemodynamics is compromised which is leading to pain factor. If this is not present then have to come back to knee.usually when knee is Injured the clinical assessment is focussed to the knee only and may be an MRI to understand the soft tissue Injury as well. Performing a patella grinding test will help understand the muscle strength status. Any injury in the knee will lead to patella grinding test positive and the muscles will be weak as well.After a thorough clinical assessment, physical therapist will be able to assist you in strengthening the muscle groups and regain the mobility.Iny clinical experience after a thorough clinical assessment patient is advised to undergo physical therapy and majorty of them respond well to physical therapy.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"My ortho has prescribed cap carnisure 500 1 capsule twice day and tab aceproxyvon 1 tab twice a day, both for 5-7 days for pain around my knee area and just above calf.

Also, the fatigue can be due to another factor and needs an understanding. It may be due to reduced physcial activity of may be due to not a proper diet.A neurologist should assess you initially and go through all the physical examination, chief complaint and diagnostic reports.Understanding that MRI can not be a perfect diagnosis as well.

ZMRI scheduled tomorrow?","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history of youAs the pain is radiating in nature it could be a degenerative disc changes leading to pinching of the nerve and the symptoms pass on by the course of the nerve. As you mentioned the pain is radiating upto the toe it could be related to the L5-S1 nerve root which is common. It is common because of two major reasons. - the L5- S1 level is the mobile joint and also it is the most weight bearing joint as well. Since you are 61, the disc degenerative changes can be expected and the treatment will be guided accordingly.Post MRI with simple pain killers and physical therapy you will respond well.In my clinical practice such cases respond well to a combination of drug therapy and physical therapy which includes - therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy.Also exercises are implemented to stabilize the spinal column and avoid future remissions. also a complete near normal functionality is achieved with physical therapy.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have a misplaced or damaged tendon in the elbow.

Also, using a wrist brace should be helpful for stabilizing the joint and then some simple Forearm muscle Strengthening exercises. As this will improve your joint stability and muscle endurance.

This is quite a common occurrence after a forceful vomiting. The causes of such bleeding can be : a small blood vessel ruptures either in the throat or there is a small tear at the junction of the esophagus and the stomach.Both the conditions heal well.

Regards Wilhelmina Turner","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.As the MRI confirms the avulsion fracture in the cervical region, we should check for the clinical signs like, pain, radiation, numbness, tingling etc. ,if the avulsion fracture is only giving pain in the neck region then stabilization of the neck is a must by using a hard collar. Also, travelling should be avoided as it may lead to worsen the symptoms.As the avulsion fracture if very minor will heal on its own, nothing to be worried as such, but taking a proper care is important. In majority of the cases surgery is not planned until the clinical signs and symptoms are big.Post the 8weeks of collar, simple physical therapy will be needed to regain the strength and mobility in the spine.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have a painless muscle twitching in the heal of my right foot. It has been occurring off and on (maybe the past month or so?). I exercise regularly. Drink water (rarely any soda; no coffee) Level of stress on the job has increased dramatically. Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"hithank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised.as you have no pain and other symptoms except twitching of the muscles in the foot, it could be related to muscle weakness in the foot region. Performing exercises for the foot muscles should regain the strength and avoid twitching later on.The twitching occurs due to imbalance in the muscular system and with simple exercises it can be balanced. Exercises includes are - picking the marbles from floor,  picking small bits of paper and walking bare feet on grass.This will provide stimulation to the muscles of the feet and make a Neuromuscular correction in the imbalance in the muscles.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have sharp spasm pain on left side of pubic bone that pulls tight and pain goes across the pubic bone. Pain is not constant but when happens can be extremely intense.

Another thing to know is the examples I gave don t bring the pain immediately, it could be 15 mins a half hour or longer but the pain always comes after doing these things and other things that seem to tighten that area. The pain can last mins and be done and has come an lasted over a day or so but intermittent. But NOT a pain you could take if it was constant or stayed. Any suggestions David","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.As you mentioned the pain is in the pubic bone area, it could be related to a nerve pinch. Usually, certain symptoms arise due to pinching of the lumbar area nerves. Getting a thorough neuromuscular assessment will help understand the root cause.Usually with physical therapy majority of patients recover in 2-3 weeks of time as per my clinical practice.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I am female, I have lower abdominal pains, and every half an hour i need to pee. i have no warning, its just a sudden feeling.

Due to ligament injuries within the knee joint, such types of pain can be expected. On a longer run, this ligament injuries if left untreated leads to early OA knee, that is the degenerative changes in the knee joint. Also, undergoing an MRI of the knee should help understand the soft tissues better and than you have to undergo physical therapy for 2-3 weeks post which you can follow the exercises at home itself.

Now since everything is done and steroid is also failed, i will have something to workout here.I have seen, many patients with OA knee and bakers cyst. Now this bakers cyst can be get rid of through exercise and the venous insufficiency can be corrected as well. So, lets come to the point here. Your brothers age is 67, so we can expect his metabolism to be slow and the venous drainage to be slow as well. Getting the proper exercise done should help reduce the cyst and also the swelling too.The exercises to perform are -1. Sit and stand in a chair - 100 timesBegin this exercise by performing 25 and then a non stop to 100 when endurance improves. Having a sit adjustment is needed. Now what is his ROM of the operated knee is to be understood. If he has achieved 130 degrees of ROM of the operated knee than it will be good here.2.

Also, as you have symptoms like diffiwij breathing, abdominal pain and back ache, MRI should reveal something.Since to understand here is, that the muscles of respiration like the diaphragm and the abdominal muscles are the supportive structure for the connecting the upper and the lower body along with spine. Any injury occuring to the spine will directly affect the respiratory system. Also when one breathes there is a mobility in the abdominal muscles and also the spinal column. So that will be the reason you are facing with breathing issue and pain in the abdomen and back.As post MRI we can come to closer look to the matter and plan the further management. As treatment may include - physical therapy as it is successful in majority of patients .Also, in my clinical practice patients respond well to physical therapy and recovery is achieved at the earliest.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I noticed that my left supraclavicular area is swollen.

If you had said that you have danced all your life and having such symptoms, I would have diagnosed osteoarthritis, a degenerative bone disease that degenerates the joint causing friction between bones while movement and causes pain and clicking sounds.

What would cause this and how do I treat it?","Doctor":"Hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough musculoskeletal assessment with MRI of lumbar spine is advised.Now since you are active and healthy, the injury to the soft tissues to the spine will lead to pinch of the nerve. In the initial stages the symptoms arises are little discomfort in the thighs and legs. But it is always misunderstood as just a muscular pain. But later stages this becomes big and lead to radiating pain in leg.Getting a thorough assessment done and MRI will help understand the pinching of the nerve. In many cases the MRI turns normal but the little touch of the disc to the nerve will alter the sensory pathways and later stages becomes different.Also, undergoing  proper physical therapy should help stabilize the spine and this symptoms and the future ones can be controlled.In my clinical practice i see such symptoms and find that actual problem starts from the lumbar spine and needs a proper training.

Welcome to HCM.This seems to be due to a stone in urinary tract.Stone causes obstruction to urine outflow. Smooth muscles in ureter contract excessively to overcome the obstruction & so is the pain.Commonest stone is Calcium-oxalate stone which has spikes on its surface.

Also, the decision of the orthopedic surgeon is totally depending upon the clinical signs and symptoms along with the bone strength.Prior to shoulder joint replacement one needs to understand the basic requirements of the post surgery progress.As the line of action in any musculoskeletal injury is as follows - medication , physcial therapy, steroid, physical therapy.  If this line of action fails then a surgery is planned. Prior to surgery there are measures need to be taken - the muscles of the supporting joints should be in grade 4+ as post surgery the muscle strength drops and delays the recovery process. Also, this surgery or any surgery is a major one, but if the proper pathways are taken than surgery might not be needed or the post surgery recovery is outstanding.As mentioned , I will recommend to undergo physical therapy , no matter it may take a little longer but physical therapy can help you regain the strength in the muscles and also may help to avoid surgery.Also, if you are planning to undergo the surgery make sure you have a good range of motion of the shoulder joint and also good muscle Strength of grade 4+. As post surgery this will make a difference in your recovery process.As per my clinical experience, most surgery cases of the shoudler joints are discarded as physical therapy has helped to the maximum. Proper assessment and planning can help avoid the surgeries to the greater extent. Always to understand that this original joint is the original and artificial is artificial. The choice is always left to patient.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I am Datta Padulkar, 41 years old. My problem is not too serious.

Cindy","Doctor":"hithank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised.As the surgeon mentioned an ACL reconstruction is required he is correct as the ACL ligament helps the stability of the knee joint while movement. also, for the non-displaced fracture of the condyle of femur it is not always needed to make an effort for surgery as it is non displaced. Non-displaced fracture can be treated conservatively better than operation. Since you should look for ACL reconstruction now and stabilize the knee joint where it will heal. In the case of lower limb fracture the Duration of healing is 6-8 weeks depending upon the individual's physiology.  Post which a physical therapist will help your case take further for proper strengthening, ROM and gait.Usually patient recovers well in 8-12 weeks based on the type of fracture and the recovery process.

Should I use warm compresses & try to rub it out?","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough musculoskeletal and Neuromuscular assessment is advised.As you had a direct hit on the cheek bone and eye was red, this is a usual symptom of bleeding internally. which subsides on its own. Nothing much to worry.Also, if the bleeding is from the nose, ear etc than its a case to check further. As only eye was red that means a little internal bleeding was there and must have healed.Also, now you have hit the bone directly it will take little time to heal. As cheek bones are soft and very thin.. they take healing time little longer than usual.with icing and gentle massage you will be fine.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have been on inhaled corticosteroids for asthma f o r quite some time. I recently started having pain on bunion areas on my feet. The Podiatrist took an xray and says that I either have cysts on both bunions or there are softened areas. He says that this will not affect the bunionectomy because the bone will be shaved. He says that the rest of the bones in the foot look strong. I also have a little more than moderate joint laxity in all of my joints including my feet. Should I obtain a second opinion from an orthopedic foot surgeon. Once we talked about my joint laxity he said he would be careful not to over correct me. I am also concerned about bone deterioration in my feet. Any suggestions ? Thanks","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised.I agree to your podiatrist that the bunionectomy will not help to a greater extent because your joints are LAX and due to which desire results can be obtained. Also, undergoing physical therapy will help you strengthen the muscles and get a good relief.In my clinical practice 99% recovery is achieved only with physical therapy.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Early every morning, I wake with severe pain in my upper arm muscles,particularly my left arm.

The next day I would have a sore stomach – it felt swollen, I couldn’t eat or I would get pain (even though I’m so hungry), and I would be extremely lethargic. It happens every few weeks so going to see a GP wasn’t something I could do, I would have to be in the middle of these ‘attacks’ for them to see how sick I was. Plus I was embarrassed… But in April 2013 I decided that I’d bite the bullet and go and see my GP, I found it hard to describe what was happening to me without it sounding like I was getting food poisoning every few weeks. I was sent for bloods and tests: Celiacs disease was ruled out, B12 and Iron was very very low (well below low levels) and my Calprotectin was high but not alarming. I saw a Gastroenterologist where I had a Colonoscopy and Endoscopy. The GP said I had a very small ulcer in my terminal ilium – which meant very mild Crohns Disease (mild?!?!? Holey crap I would hate to know what Bad was like, I’m not sure I would survive it). He wasn’t sure if it was crohns though so my slides, info and findings were taken to a regular gastroenterologists gathering where they could discuss my case (there were also microbiologists and a few other smart people like that) and they came back with ‘yes, mild crohns because of the small ulcer’. (yet again… mild? I feel like I’ve been cut to shreds with a rusty box knife and my guts are on the floor and being jumped on!) I was put on Pentasa – probably one of the worst things ever!, I was in pain constantly, my hair fell out in clumps, I was having silent migraines (one pupil extremely large, and the other was a pin prick) and I was on the verge of vomiting all of the time. I was told that the side effects would eventually stop. A month later I begged to stop taking this horrible drug and I started feeling better within a few days. My doctor told me that he wanted me to have a scan of my stomach, unfortunately at the time my Father passed away suddenly and going for a scan fell off my list of priorities as I had a family to look after (as my mother passed away a few years before that), I had to sell their house, and pay for burials, lawyers etc etc (none of which caused a flare up… not stress reactive) A month went passed and I got a letter from my Gastro guy saying ‘don’t bother with the scan, if you haven’t done it by now then you obviously don’t need to’ so that was nice....! yes my health is important to me, but I was in another part of the country attending to my grieving family – which is far more important, thank you very much. A few months later I went to a dietician to see if my flare ups were due to food – I did a FODMAPs diet to eliminate food groups, nothing caused a flare up, so that was a waste of a few hundred dollars! I did a fructose drinking test – apparently I can’t have fructose and that might be my trigger. I saw a nutritionist to tailor a diet for me, and I am still being horribly sick. There is no pattern, so nothing in my diet is triggering this. The problem I have is… I don’t have fructose (glucose syrup, corn syrup, invert syrup etc) in my diet, I pretty much stick to a very natural diet, veges and protein. I am very careful with everything I eat, I don’t eat rubbish, I exercise, I drink lots of water (no fizzy or orange) and yet I have spent the last two days metres from my bathroom and not being able to go out. I would love nothing better than to go to the beach or a mall or hang out with friends. I can’t even stand up straight without my stomach hurting!! (I just moved a tiny bit now and it feels like I’ve just been roundhouse kicked in the stomach) I am in constant pain and I don’t believe that ‘mild’ crohns should be this painful – In the middle of my ‘attack’ I feel like I am dying (I know that sounds like I’m being dramatic, but until you’ve been here then you can’t judge me). The pain is so intense that I sob uncontrollably, I lie on the bathroom floor because its cold, I want to vomit (sometimes I do), and I am as white as a ghost. I just have to wait for the pain waves to stop. It’s been two days so far, and will probably take that long for me to come right. I logged onto a crohns forum on my phone while on the floor one day, and mentioned how ill and in pain I was, looking for support in my darkest hours on the bathroom floor. And they were so mean to be because they said that I knew nothing of pain until I’m on ‘X’ amount of drugs and had ‘X’ amount of surgeries. They even said if I was in that much pain I shouldn’t be on my phone (I was sick for 72 hours!!!, I’m sure I’m allowed to be on my phone in that time) So I feel let down by people who should know!! Apparently those people are the gate keeps of the pain scale…. Who knew? I feel let down by my Gastro person. I feel as if I’ve been given the shove because I have ‘mild’ crohns. I read through the crohns disease forums and I don’t get all of the symptoms that those people have – boy I feel sorry for those guys! But I haven’t lost weight, I don’t have any blood, I don’t lose my appetite, I don’t have depression, no abscesses, ulcers or fissures. The only thing I have in common is a small ulcer in my ilium, pain and Diarreha. I have a good friend who has crohns and is on Hurmia yet our symptoms are different. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t believe I actually have crohns, I think I have an ulcer because something else is going on! I will go to another gastro person, but if I don’t work, I don’t get paid, so aside from the fact that I don’t trust doctors, I want to know as much as possible before going in to see someone else who treats me like I’m a ‘mild case’. The pain I am experiencing is not mild, in fact if anyone told me it was mild during my attack I would actually punch them in the face. I’m lost… sore, tired and let down by so many.

Also, due the position of the head over a longer period there might be a possibility of losing the lordotic curve of the cervical spine.Understanding the proper biomechanics and then undergoing physical therapy should give you outstanding results.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"i have pains under my right side rib cage it comes and goes , im sitting on couch and have strong pains under rib cage same spot everytime.my family physician says its nothing to worry about.but its something to worry about if it happens everyday for about 6-8 months now.please help.","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough cardiothoracic assessment is advised.As the pain is persistent from past few months I will advice to take up a thorough cardio thoracic assessment if it is on the middle of the chest or above the abdominal region. You may be recommended x-ray or any other test based on the assessmentIf the pain is below the xphisternum then I will advice to take a thorough abdominal assessment and an Diagnostic ultrasonography will be advised to see the soft tissue status.Also, if the pain is near to the rib joining the sternum then it could be costochondritis and may need further assessment.I will still advice to undergo atleast a chest x-ray to check the soft tissue and bony status. No pain persists for longer months until there is something to understand about the physiology.Also, with breathing exercises if the pain subsides then you many not have to worry, as certain times due to weakness of the inter costal muscles there leads to pain.As no chest congestion, cough cold, abdominal pain is mentioned by you I suspect it to be a costochondritis and with breathing exercises you should respond well. Possibly learn the proper breathing exercise techniques from a physical therapist once by which you can follow at home and in 2-3 weeks of time you should be fine.regardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have been suffering tremendously with terrible coccyx pain throughout the buttocks and down through the vaginal area.

Have been using ice and heat but it doesn t seem to be improving. Any suggestions to help until I can see my Primary Care Physician on Thursday?","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.As, you had a fall from a bed and bruised your right shoulder along with the top of right foot, how is the pain in that area. Also, you mentioned from last week you have severe back pain. What i suspect it be a sprain of the ligaments in the spine. As, when the symptoms with sneeze, cough arise, there is always an advice to get the thorough neuromuscular assessment performed.As you been trying ice and its not subsiding, i will advice you to undergo physical therapy as you will have instant relief with Therapeutic Ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy. Post finishing you visit, you can undergo the MRI scan of the Lumbar spine to see the soft tissue status, Never ignore the smallest pain and aches in the spine, as it may worsen as days progresses. Prevention is better than cure.Also, try doing Mckenzie extension exercises as it will help centralize the pain, post which applying hot water bag in the lower back region will help reduce the pain. Try doing little of core stability exercises, ofcourse in a day it wont give you any results, but will atleast activate the muscle to help you to travel for 8 hours.Once you are back, perform an MRI of lumbar spine and with physical therapy you will be back to normalcy.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"MRI impression of My father aged 68 yrs is Mild broad posterior disc protrusions at L2-L3 to L4-L5 levels Mild Posterior protrusion,moderate left paracentral extrusion,inferior migration of disc material at L5-S1 level. What exactly is this? Is surgery necessary?","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of your father.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.I will like to begin with this. Your father's age is 68. So the physiological degenerative changes will be setting in. Lumbar spine has got 5 vertebrae and in between the vertebrae there comes a Disc, which is called as inter vertebral disc. This disc's act as shock absorbers and support the spinal column. As ageing progresses the disc starts losing the water. By which the overall spinal column reduces in Size. Once the disc starts losing water , it mat lead to - herniation, protrusion, prolapse etc. due to which there will be a compression on the adjacent nerve roots and this may lead to radiating pain, numbness, burning sensation, weakness of the relevant side. Also, lumbar spine is the most mobile weight bearing area after cervical spine and is prone for disc injuries.Treatment options which are safe and successful but in the following order, are - Medication, physical therapy, steroids, physical therapy, surgery, physical therapy.Now the MRI scan suggest here is - that your father has some disc protrusion but no where it mentions that the nerve root impingement on either side. L1-L2 , L4-L5 and also the L5-S1 as well. Since no where it mentions about the nerve impingement the surgery will be an optional or rare thing to look ahead.Also, the symptoms like, pain, numbness, tingling sensation, etc are more than one needs to wait and see with physical therapy is the symptoms subside. In 99% of cases in my clinical practice have been never operated and responded well to physical therapy. Duration may be longer, but conservative is better than operative, is a good medical logic.If by physical therapy the symptoms don't subside then a steroid dose is recommended and if this fails them surgery.Also, since the levels are too many, it is totally subjective that surgery successful changes are depending. Since your father's age is 68, I will advice to under go physical therapy and he should he fine with physical modalities and exercise; & may not need surgery.For any more details / doubts / suggestions etc you can contact me and I will happy to solve the matter with the in depth knowledge.Regards.Jay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I get these tightening pains (reminiscent of active labor) the start about mid-spine and often feel like they wrap around my rib cage.

Firstly I would like to point out that the symptoms you are describing are pointing towards a Coxarthrosis ( condition when the cartilage from hip joint get eroded and leads to pain and difficulties in performing certain kinds of movements). You will need an X ray of your pelvis to confirm my suspicion. It is also a age related disease so telling me your age would help me rule that out too.  Secondly a muscle strain could also be the culprit behind pain and the trouble in performing certain movements but not at the level you are describing, plus ice packs would make your pain go away not heat. Thirdly, pain while coughing in the groin area could be a sign of inguinal hernia.My advice is to go to your local doctor and get an X-ray done and have a full physical exam and get more details as what you are describing needs some medical attention not just some over the counter medication.Hope my answers helped.

As you can imagine facing the daunting future of limited use of my right arm I wish to consider all the absolute best options for further surgery and innovative possibilities for my wrist so I can perhaps be able to return to doing the things that a young active person like myself, loves and lives for. If you would like more information or to speak to me I would love the opportunity to discuss my injury with you further. My email address is YYYY@YYYY and I would be available to Skype with you if that is a possibility. Alternatively my contact number is +64 21 034 0794. I thank you for your time and consideration of my injury and I look forward to hearing from you if you have any advice or suggestions for how I can proceed, that would be so greatly appreciated. Yours sincerely,","Doctor":"Hi thereit sounds that you had a major injury to your wrist almost 2 years ago. You will need some adjustments to your lifestyle within limits of the best possible function your wrist will allow. at 22 months bony injuries must be healed but cartilaginous injuries need to be followed up. I suggest that you see a orthopaedic hand surgeon for an assessment and follow up plan."},{"Patient":"I have a 13 year old boy, who grew to fast and will need back brace because of his ribs is not in position it should be. Xray have been done and Drrecommended Ct. Children Hospital.Can we get the brace for free or low cost.We do not have any insurance.Thank you for your advice. At this point I need financial advice before any other questions","Doctor":"Hi thereA state children hospital should be able to provide you with a low cost Back brace. Please ask your doctors about this. If they don't then ask them for the specific name and size because this matters and then search for it and see how much actually it costs, if can't afford it then turn to social media and as for help, describe your case and POST details of the brace, I am sure someone out there has used and has grown out of it but it still is in good condition and can give it to you for free or for low cost."},{"Patient":"I have a recocurring abcess on my lower abdomen.  Its is quite painful and doesnt seem to be softening up.  I'm now on day 6 with it. Some of the swelling has gone down but the skin has become sort of broken and dry on top where you would expect to see the head of it form.  I seems to get one of these a couple times a year, usually when I'm particullarly stressed out (not sure if there is a correlation there). Anyway I was wondering what I can do about this?  Like I stated I have gotten them in the past and they do eventually go away.  They are just really painful and usually leave a scare as a reminder.   Thank you","Doctor":"Hollow,You have mentioned abscess,but have not mentioned any approx size, its the pus filled cavity,mainly abscess tends to spread and invade surrrounding tissue..you will have to do some blood investigations . You will need to get it incised  and drained by a doctor. And startup with some antibiotic ..so please get an opinion from a surgeon.Hope this information helps you"},{"Patient":"I broke my ankle in Sep 2013. I had 2 screws and a device similar to a sling put in it. I began walking on it in Dec and had no pain until I started Cardiac rehab in Apr 2014. A recent xray says On the present examination metallic screws noted at the medial malleolus and the Union is incomplete at the medial malleolar fracture. Degenerative changes of right ankle noted with overlying soft tissue swelling . What can be done to help this ankle heal?","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you,As you mentioned you had a fracture at the ankle joint and for which the surgery was performed, till now i feel the healing is not completed as the callus is not formed at the fracture site, also, this is completely a physiological process and a body's call for healing. Taking an oral calcium supplement prescribed by your physician must be taken and also some exercises advised. Since the location of the bone is weight bearing there will be changes in the joint structure, and function. So now the question is of swelling here, as you mentioned you have a degenerative changes in the right ankle, it is needed to allow the venous return to happen and reduce the swelling for which, dipping the feet in hot water and performing ankle toe movements while placing the feet over the pillow above the level of heart. Post this, some lower leg strengthening exercises are also needed to make the muscles of the lower limb stronger. As we do not know your age yet, if you are having any hypertension, then swelling is because of slow cardio, so the cardio rehab has to be performed but without weight bearing. And there are cardiac rehab protocol for non weight bearing as well.Also, the xray shows, non union, that means, you may need a graft of bone to be placed to ensure the healing, this is your call and you can discuss with the surgeon, as healing of the weight bearing joints is utmost importance. Also, taking an Ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy from a physical therapist will help you further.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I punched a wall about 5 hours ago and I have had Ice on it since then but it is really hard to move it s purple and rarther swolen, it feels numb but I don t know if that s from the ice, I even found it hard to hold a glass, it s my right hand so I can t do much without that, any advise?","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised.As you have applied the ice, the numbness is because of it. Since due to icing, the sensory pathways gets disturbed and leads to numbness. Also, since you punched the wall, there might be some small injuries to the soft tissues leading to pain and inflammation.Incase the pain, swelling and numbness don't subside in 48 hours you need to take an x-ray to see if any bony injury is happened.Usually, within 48 hours the swelling and numbness subsides.If any fracture is noticed on a x-ray then you need treatment accordingly.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Hey, so last week i crashed my longboard and it was pretty bad. I had tons of pain and my arms were pretty banged up. About two hours later i noticed that i had little to no flexibility in my left arm and hurt to move it. Now i have almost all my road burns healed. But my left arm is still weird. I cant fully straighten it and when i do a bicep flex without flexing (if that makes sense) i cannot pull my arm towards my self. What do you think..","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.As you are not able to flex the elbow actively you need a thorough assessment. Due to pinched nerve there leads to certain weakness and early detection helps for further management.If the injury is happened by the fall on the neck directly an MRI or NCV will be advised and post which the medical management will be directed.Also, post these if the injury is minimal then with rest, medication and physical therapy you should respond well.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with a right-side L4/L5 herniated disc. I ve had a sharp and persistent pain for about four months; a sharp pain which shoots down my leg and causes a numbing effect (in the leg/foot) due to sciatica. Bending backwards far enough also causes pain in my right lumbar area. Once I m fatigued, it becomes extremely difficult to walk and stand up straight. I ve noticed that my body tries to compensate my body-weight by shifting to the left (away from the right side) making me look crooked. I can t sit comfortably or for a prolonged period of time. The pain is most severe in the mornings upon awakening; my back becomes stiff and and the pain in my right lumbar is usually what wakes me up. I ve been treated with two epidural cortisone injections on the site of the problem (about a month apart) to no avail of alleviating the pain (the pain is still as persistent as before). I ve been exercising my core on a routine basis, have done stretching exercises and have gotten therapy. I ve been researching spinal decompression through a decompression machine and wanted to know if it s implementation on the site of the injury can potentially be beneficial in my case. I do not want to get surgery in that area due to the potential of further complications. I used to live a very active lifestyle and I am an avid weightlifting and this injury has really put all of that to a screeching halt and the pain is unbearable at times.","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.As you have herniated disc and nothing worked till date. I will advice to undergo proper physical therapy. As by the use of proper therapy you can get help.Using the therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy will help reduce the pain. McKenzie exercises are more successful as per research to centralize the pain. post which the TENS therapy works better.once the pain is centralized and reduced the further course of action is advised.Usually ,in my clinical practice my patients recover in 3 weeks of time if the proper therapy is applied.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"hi ...my husband had surgery on his neck c6/c7 area of his neck where they put in titanium disc fuse thing....after surgery he had a small rash on his chest which seemed to go away after awhile but now(surgery was may 2) he has pinpoint pink to red spots on his lower legs ankles inside forearms some on chest and back and they itch thruout the day he started vitamins 2weeks prior to surgery ....also since march 10 he has had steroid meds pain killers an injection in neck and then the surgery. the rash appeared on chest after surgery but did fade but now what seems to be spreading has been going on since maybe a few day to a week after surgery just spreading more now! should he be seen for this ? what would it be?","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history of your husbandA thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.As he had the surgery in the spine, there will be some sensory protective mechanism happening by the bodynl itself to control and balance the new implant. This this of spots will stay for a while and as time passes by it will go away. If any thing is due to drug reaction than needs a thorough pharmacological assessment of the drugs induced.Also, by keeping the cervical spine stable and doing little physical therapy should help for the strength.This red spots will go slowly as it is more of the sensory issues. The nerves carry two major functions - motor & sensory.Since after the operation there needs to be a balance Certain times such reaction occurs but fades off with time.Regards.Jay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I was trying to use my ankle to inject meth but was unsuccessful.

About 5 days ago my feet started hurting or rather aching. Its gotten a little worse and now it is switching between a dull aching and sharp pain every now and then. Both feet feel the same way and my heels hurt badly when I stand up. Almost as if I have no padding under them? It does no good to rest and put my feet up or walk. Feels the same regardless. Today was the worst yet and its extremely uncomfortable to stand. I have not done any sort of exercise, had no accidents or anything. I am self employed..work from home so Im not on my feet all day or anything like that. I do not have any swelling, redness or warmth coming from my feet. Only discomfort, aching pain.

Also, when there is nerve impingement there symptoms can occur into the distal joints and feels like something else could be there but the actual cause will be in the root of the nerve. Once traced by a clinical neuromuscular assessment and with the help of an MRI of lumbar spine one should be able to guide you better with it.Also, exercise is a wide subject to mention here but undergoing a proper physical therapy for your problem should solve your pain and aches to the maximum. Physical therapy is a non invase way of getting treated with no side effects.In my clinical practice patient come with similar complaints and have prescription on which it mentioned something else. But the root cause is the spinal nerve root. As human body lands into the degenerative phase depending upon the metabolism of each individual and life style as well. As per my personal Handson in clinic I feel you should get an MRI of lumbar spine done and see the soft tissue stauts.Also , a physical therapist will be of help to you.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Is it normal to get a tingling sensational pain near & below the small toe area when leg is a cast ? It s been 41/2 weeks since I fractured my bone that supports the ankle. Got 2 more weeks in the cast ! Feeling a sharp tingling nerve pain this morning ?? Could it be serious? are there side effects or signs when bone is healing ??","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.As mentioned in history about the tingling sensation, it is very uncommon until the cast is applied too tight. If the cast is applied too tight then the nerve is getting compressed and the symptoms of tingling is arised which needs an attention.In case if the cast is not tight, I will advice to undergo an MRI of the lumbar spine as, any soft tissue injury in that area will lead to pinching of nerve root and produce symptoms.Also, a vascular assessment is needed to cross confirm is any DVT is present for which a Doppler is advised.As, until a thorough neuromuscular assessment is performed the diagnostic tests are an optional. Based on the assessment the diagnostic tests will be planned.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Today I heard a good joke and had a deep laugh the bottoms on both sides of my ribs had a very sharp pain a minute or so later I got very dizzy and could not breath well 1 had a total of 3 dizzy spells about 15 min apart were I thought it might be the end.

Also, I will advice to stop the aerobics for time being as aerobics is more of the high torque exercises which leads to gavity induced movements in the limbs by applying additional pressure on the muscles to make the spine more mobile in the unstable surface.Also, you need to focus more in performing mat exercises currently till the muscles become stronger and the spine gets stabilized. Due to instability in the spine there is a chance for the disc to have movements towards the spinal nerve root again. It is advised to strengthen the core, pelvic floor, spine muscles and lower limb strengthening before undergoing any aerobic or sports. As on a safer note taking a note from a physician before the aerobics or sports is advised to avoid further damage to the disc.in my clinical practice , my patients spend 6-8 weeks of proper physical therapy and post which after the Neuromuscular assessment the futher plan is made.

Welcome to HCM.Right upper abdominal pain suggests gall bladder related pain.As you said black pellets, there can be occult blood positive if you do stool exam for it.This can be due to bleeding somewhere in upper gastrointestinal tract.This can also be due a stone in ureter causing obstruction to urine outflow.In my clinic, many such patients do come to whom I advise ultrasound abdomen & pelvis, urine & stool routine, CBC.Treatment is done accordingly.Hope this information is useful to you.Wish you speedy recovery.Thanks.

I have been x-rayed and there are no broken bones but I wonder if tendon trouble would show up? This has gone on too long and I also question if arthritis would or could come on overnight and be the cause. Please advise.","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised.As the pain is in the medial side of the ankle, it cannot be arthirits as per my knowledge. Since you are on Anti-inflammatory drug and the pain is still persisting , than it might be related to the ligament injury at the ankle or may be a plantar fasciitis. By a thorough musculoskeletal assessment the rest can be determined.Also, undergoing physical therapy for the same will help you reduce pain and inflammation. By Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy the inflammation and pain will subside.Later you will be taught exercises for strengthening the muscles of the foot, and leg region.If you are having issue with your foot wear it needs to be checked once. Following the thorough assessment of the gait mechanism it can be understood further what could be possible secondary cause for the pain levels to aggrevate.In my clinical practice, I have found early results of reduced pain and inflammation with physical therapy. I recommend you the same.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have been suffering from heel heel and ankle pains with swelling for the last one month. For the last ten days multiple joint pains developed, without any swelling, but swelling at ankle continuing and suffering from fever and chillness in the evenings. For the last one month, I have been using Dolokind & Pentakind tablets. For fever I am taking Lenol as prescribed by Doctor. Now, on 29 th I have consulted Rheumotologist in one of the famous Hospitals in Mumbai. They have prescribed HLA B27 test(reort yet to come) and medicines of :T.Etoshine90,T.Omnacortil5,T.Saaz,T.Folvite,T.Pan. I need ur sincere opinion. I was diagnosed for Reactive Artheritis ( without HLA B27 test).","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of youA thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised.As you have been diagnosed with reactive arthirits a little knowledge about it is requiredReactive arthritis is a painful form of inflammatory arthritis (joint disease due to inflammation). It occurs in reaction to an infection by certain bacteria. Most often, these bacteria are in the genitals (Chlamydia trachomatis) or the bowel (Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella and Yersinia).Now, as you have multiple join pain and aches along with swelling at the ankle, I will advice you further to visit a physiotherapist who can help you with your pain and aches.Since the pain and aches are possibly due to the infection I am sure the physician will guide you with antibiotics for the same. Undergoing a thorough urine examination is advised as to check the possible bacterial infection present also.For the pain and swelling management the physiotherapy will help you with therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy by which the inflammation and pain will subside.Also, performing regular exercises are guided here to understand that the body's metabolism and immune system are slowed down which lead the bacterial infection to go higher and lead to reactivate arthirits. Exercise will help improve the metabolism, immune system and strength in the muscles as in the reactive arthirits the bacterial infection directly attacks the soft tissues of the joint. So exercises will play an important role.Also while performing the Strengthening of the core and pelvic floor along with special exercise will help improve the bladder to empty completely and avoid any bacterial infection to persist due to UTIIn my clinical practice I recommend patients with similar complaints to physical therapy as it will help them to recover better and avoid future complications.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I was playing catch with my little sister and I jumped and when I landed my knee started to hurt a little. Now there is a constant pain and starts to hurt a little more when I walk, jump, go up and downstairs , and bend it. I am a catcher in softball. What should I do to help it.","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised.As you landed on the feet with knees 10-15° bend this would have allowed the excess pressure on the meniscus ligament present in the knee joint. Also the ACL might has landed into grade 1 sprain. Undergoing a thorough musculoskeletal assessment and an MRI of the knee it will assist to determine the soft tissue status.Post all of these you need to visit a physical therapist for the rehabilitation of the knee to make it stronger and avoid future injuries.In my clinical practice, I advice knee rehabilitation post any sort of knee injury. It takes anywhere between 2-12 weeks depending upon the type of injury.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I was cleaning my car today and hit my cheekbone with the corner of the car door really hard.

Should I seek medical help?","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.Due to the impact of the car door directly to the cheek bone , there must be an inflammation which will lead to irritation to the sinuses and later on headace. Ringing can be a temporary issue too.Also , getting a thorough neuromuscular assessment and if needed an MRI will be advised. but in most cases it's more of a bone and muscular injury and heals at its face.Since , in the facial region, the muscles are smaller than the other parts of the body and any injury in that area will lead severe pain and bead.If you get any further symptoms which are add-on to the current symptoms then visiting a physician is advised.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"i have a sharp pain on the right side, in my chest, stomach, and shoulders, and back everytime i breath in deep or sneeze or burp or do anything. this has been going on for two days.

Usually a combination of medicine and physical therapy helps to improve the functional ability. Also, medicine prescribed are symptomatic and one need to focus on long term rehab.Along with physical therapy there will be an improved metabolism, muscle strength, immune system, etc.In my clinical practice I advice my patients to undergo a combination of both as it clicks better.Also, check the blood sugar level at regular intervals using the laboratory as electronic device may misguide you due to errors. Check the kidney function test and creatinine levels too. Performing an diagnostic ultrasound will help to see the functions of the liver as well.Working out with proper ladder for the symptoms will help plan a better rehabilitation program.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I saw my Dr as my lower legs really hurt and my ankles look swollen. He told me I had fluid on the front of the knees but not to worry about it but I do as this has never happened before and also he told me my veins on the back of my legs are causing the problem but I don t have varicose veins and he told me to stretch them and that was it no cure nothing I stretch them and it still hurts. I go swimming as it helps my arthritis can you give me advice on what to do as i m not happy and I only know one stretch!","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.As you mentioned in the history about swelling in front of the knees and you have arthritis, i will advice you two things to look ahead - first , take an MRI of knee to see the soft tissue status - as due to soft tissue injury the swelling arises and it takes a while for it to go. Second , kindly undergo physical therapy for the knees, as it will help improve the lower limb mucles and also improve your venous return by which swelling will be avoided.As, to understand why in arthritis the lower limbs swell, is simple to understand. Due to pain in the arthritic joints, the functional mobility of the body reduces. By this, the cardiac output also slows down. Which leads to lack of vascular insufficiency and swelling.In my clinical practice i see cases with such issues, i advice them to undergo physical therapy, get complete ROM of knee to get the normalcy of the biomechanics and muscle property. Strengthening is also needed for the lower limbs, core and pelvic floor - since body functions as a single unit, there needs to be a stabilization as well. Also, my patient recover upto 99% in 6-8 weeks of time, post which they can jog, run , jump.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I fell backwards 2 weeks ago and caught myself with my right hand.

It is still swelling some without using ice and now my wrist on my thumb side still hurts and my hand is beginning to burn at tingle at times. I can move my hand and fingers so I didn t figure I broke anything. Can sprains cause this 2 weeks later?","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised,Since you had a fall, post which you are having burning and tingling sensation of the hand, i feel, due to the fall on the elbow, there will be a mild injury to the nerve, where there are sensory issues happening. also, the injury dont look that big since your motor functions are normal. For fall, this are common features and recover with proper therapy.I advice you to undergo physical therapy where you will be initially treated with therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy. Post which exercises will be implemented to improve the strength in the muscles. Focus more on strengthening the triceps muscle as to improve the elbow mobility and nerve healing. RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have pain in my left foot when walking. It varies in intensity. I also have clicking when walking. I exercise 3 times a week. The pain is on the left side of the foot is only painful when I walk. The pain is a sharp sometimes. I broke a bone in my heal 6 years ago.","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.As your chief complaint is that when you walk there is a sharp pain in the lateral side of the left foot, I suspect it to be muscular pain or either neuropathic pain for which a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.Also. when there is a nerve impingement in the lumbar spine, it all starts with the pain in most cases on the lateral side of the foot. As you even mentioned that you had a bony injury in the past, there might be a tendency of abnormal gait during that time and shortening of muscles of the spine due to walking in pain.As I feel, by strengthening the muscles of the core, spine, pelvic floor and lower limbs on both sides you should be able to walk. Since the nerve impingement gives the initial symptoms as pain in the lateral side of the foot and progresses over a period of time. So before it gets more on future you can get an MRI of lumbar spine and them proceed with physical therapy for the lumbar spine. In my clinical experience I see cases who initially comes with this sort of pain and later with Nerve impingement diagnosis. So, from past couple of years I have noticed that this is the first alerting symptom of the Neurological pain so now I deal with first an MRI of spine and core stability. Results come on 3-4 weeks of time and post which in future complaints are less RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Hola! I had a lumbar spine MRI and was told my L5 transverse process is articulated with the sacrum. This is obviously what has been causing me low back ache (and other aches and pains) since I was a teenager. More recently (since pregnancy over 5 years ago) I also have a more localised pain which turns out to be the exact location of where the L5 TV would touch the sacrum. I am in physiotherapy for this but I really think that the results will be temporary if my pain is relieved. I think this because if I miss a couple of days of exercise, I m back to square one with the pain and ache. I really want to have the resection (transverse process) surgery. The thing is.. I really want to know if the surgery could actually give me the flexibility I never had in my back due to the Bertolottis syndrome that I ve had for so long. Mechanically it makes sense that it would, but in reality is it too much too late? I would like to hear from any surgeon who has experience the this surgery... and what is the recovery like for this op?Many thanks","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.As by reading your history I can understand that the back ache is bothering you too much. As in my clinical experience I see cases with such abnormalities of spine. I personally have recommended people not tonunderfo surgery to the importance of the muscles and the bony factors. performing regular exercises will surely help you proceed further. The reason to avoid the surgery is also the recurrent post surgical pain. As the spine will be more of the instable. Usually, post laminectomy, discectomy, etc any spinal surgeries the pain persists in the future. since it is more of a joint play understanding here that the physics of the spine is designed to bear the sheer stress and load onto it. Also, once the muscles are stronger with the following exercises the levels are under control. Exercises includes - Core stability, Pelvic floor strengthening, Spine muscle strengthening, hip muscles strengthening, and later over all body conditioning. Looking forward to the other matter here is why the pain arises, it is the understanding of the just the bony deformity or it is more of the physics of mechanism involved.To head further I recommend my patients to use the hard wooden surface to sleep in nights, which the body in momentum and the recurrence of pain is much less. Practicing regular exercises post learning from a physical therapist helps in longer run.Surgery is a tempory relief of pain, but post the surgery the pain and aches are more due to instability of the spine, which I have personally experienced in my clinical practice.Also, the best job of an orthopedic surgeon is to safeguard the joint and not to allow it to damage more. A good surgeon will never advice for the surgery as the original joint has its own importance which no good surgeon will have a mind to lose.I will recommend to undergo a good number of weeks of physical therapy where you will learn various ways to exercise and safeguard the spine for future and avoid surgeries.In my clinical practice I have this same attitude of teaching more of the physical exercises then looking for the surgery. as exercise is the natural form of safeguarding the spine and surgery is the artificial. So choice is left up to you. In my opinion learning the best way to exercise is better than undergoing the knife.regards.

Also, once ACL reconstruction is done you can later proceed to physical therapy for strengthening exercises and ROM exercises which will help to extend the life of the knee joint.due to ACL injury, the knee joint enters into faster degeneration, so ACL reconstruction will be advised in my opinion. As it is a small procedure and recovery is also optimum. Also, once ACL reconstruction is done , you may avoid the TKR in future. To avoid TKR you need to understand that ACL reconstruction is important. Rest I leave a choice on you.In my clinical practice, I avoid surgery for my patient with grade I ACL injury but with complete tear I also advise surgery ,post which the knee ROM and strengthening is performed and optimum results are achieved with 100% of success.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Have started having a burning sensation behind my right knee in the past two weeks: no physical signs. I do one hour of Zumba dance exercise 6 days/week; 58 years old, weight, blood pressure, etc. all good. No prescription drugs.. Am very healthy! Today, some numbness has started on the outside of that calf; doesn t really stop me from going/doing/exercising but is annoying .. Have noticed that my tail bone is uncomfortably sore in certain sitting positions, recently, but don t recall anything that would account for that... Help?! Thx.","Doctor":"hithank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.Based on your history, due to performing of the zumba, the mechanism of the injury has to be understood, Due to performing zumba for long hours, there will be a possibility of the injury of the soft tissues in the knee as well as the lumbar spine. As, your age is 58, you may have degenerative changes in the joints and soft tissues. So, stopping Zumba for a week will be advised. Also, performing the thorough neuro musculo skeletal assessment by a ortho, the weakness in the muscles can be determined, if required the ortho may ask for an MRI of either the knee or the lumbar spine as you have burning sensation behind the knee.The burning sensation in the knee or behind can be due to ligament injury , which needs a thorough assessment. Also, you have numbness in the calf  muscle and discomfort in the tail bone, this can be the lumbar spine pathology for which the symptoms are arising.I will recommend to undergo a clinical orthopedic musculoskeletal assessment and an MRI of knee and spine to help you further.Physical therapy will be recommended by your ortho and zumba will be stopped as well.Recovery with physical therapy will help you regain the normalcy in 2-3 weeks since you are an active person.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"My MRI reads: L5-S1 Small broad based posterior disc herniation with bilateral fact joint degenerative disease.

Moderate narrowing of neural foramen on left.What does this muean and how long will it take to heal?","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief information of the report.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.As the report suggest you have degenerative changes in the facet joint - the facet joint is the one which supports one vertebrae over the other and below it. The L5-S1 disc herniation is noticed - the disc is a soft tissue placed between the two vertebrae, this disc act as a shock absorb-er in the spine. As due to over use of misuse or ageing factor the disc becomes weak and ends into herniation.So, this report has to be correlated clinically and the symptoms like - tingling, numbness, pain radiating in the leg etc may be present.Treatment of choice will be simple pain killers and physical therapy. Also, with physical therapy, the optimum strength in the muscles will be attained in 2-3 weeks  * based on the extent of the symptoms and soft tissue injury.In my clinical experience , i see cases with such injuries and they recover well with 99% success rate.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Hello: I broke my femur just over 10 months ago. I underwent surgery to place a rod and nails in the leg. Bone growth has been consistently slow. At my 6 month x-ray the bone growth was progressing but still very slowly and the nails were in good shape. At 10 months the bone growth was not at the level my Dr. anticipated and the nail at the knee had broken. There was good evidence of union on the one side of the break but still lots to go on the other side. I had post-operative infection and open surgical wounds for the first 6 months. I am 50, overweight and T2 diabetic (well controlled). I am to have a CT scan to get a better look at the callous formation but my Dr. has mentioned that further surgery may be required to put another nail in and to ream around the bone marrow. The thought of more surgery terrifies me. If this surgical intervention is required, what does it entail and how limited will I be after the surgery? Can it be done with a local? Thanks in advance for any info you can share.","Doctor":"Hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough clinical assessment with diagnostic is advised.With your history to understand is there are 2 factor which delayed your healing. 1. Post-operative infection and 2. High Blood sugar levels. This both has interfered in your healing. Also, the infection and high blood sugar levels are related to your weak immune system and weak metabolism from the before of the operation, so the healing is delayed.Now , since the bone is not healing, there is one possibility to try out, that is the bone graft. As bone graft usually helps to heal in non healing fractures, provided the infection and blood glucose levels stays in control.In my clinical practice, patients respond well to bone graft and bone healing is faster. You can discuss the same with your surgeon as this will be of choice.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"A week ago I began to have pain behind my left knee and calf.

Also, post surgery, did you perform any exercises to regain the ROM of ankle joint and strengthening of the muscles? also, do you have any current symptoms like, pain, swelling, discomfort etc.Now to understand the healing of the lower limbs, it varies from patient to patient and also from injury to injury. Lower limbs in theory can take upto 8 weeks, but when comes to ankle and foot, it may take longer. Since the patients keeps asking about the walking, they are made walk early with non weight bearing and then full weight bearing. The bones of the feet are smaller and then need adequate time to heal. In that duration, doing physical therapy helps improve the ROM and strength in the muscles which prepare the body for propulsion and weight bearing. Most cases, due to pain avoid physical therapy and the ultimate result turns out to be dissatisfaction.I will advice you to undergo physical therapy as it will help you to regain the ROM and Strength. Also, the post fracture, the remodeling of the bone is provided by the muscles by friction of the muscles over the bones.You may not necessarily need to under go a re-surgery for the foot, if the ROM and Strength are back.I have seen cases with similar complaints so i am aware that what helps to avoid the re-surgery.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I had knee replacement (right one) 3/26/14 and after going through lung cancer (chemo and radiation) in 2013 I now have breathing problems and a 1 cm blip on the scan on my clivus and now my knee has been hurting very bad since yesterday.

Well, metal do not get infection, so your knee contains metal, and infection is not possible after so long.Also, you can take a physical therapy, by which your muscles can be made to optimum strength and on later stages you will be made to strengthen the core, pelvic floor, breathing exercises for lungs, both legs strengthening, spine strengthening and hip strengthening. As the body functions as a unit, the unit needs a stabilization which can be achieved with the above exercises.I have seen cases post TKR and similar complains.

I would very much appreciate any feedback.... thanking you kindly","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of your son.As mentioned, a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.As for carpal tunnel syndrome, you need to have a brief understanding about the mechanics. During this condition there is a tightness and the flexor retinaculum which leads to compression in the underlying structures leading to pain, numbness and hand dysfunction.Since your Surgeon provided the cortisone over the flexor retinaculum, it is to relax the tissues there. which may depend upon the physiology to accept or reject. That is where you have heard or on net that people had to undergo the next dose of cortisone or may be surgery in future. But there is a non invasive way of dealing With carpal tunnel syndrome - that is the physical therapy. Physical therapy is non invasive and no side effects. also, research supports that in carpal tunnel syndrome physical therapy helps to release the tightness of the flexor retinaculum and also relaxed the pressure beneath the structures.In my clinical practice , I see carpal tunnel syndrome. with the help of neuromuscular assessment , MRI ,NCV and EMG a plan for physical therapy is designed to rehabilitate the hand. Most cases recover with 4-6 weeks of time and then a gradual improved rehabilitation protocol is designed again after reassessing the Hand. I wish your son a good health.

I would advise you to visit an Orthopaedics sports surgeon who might go for a MRI scan for further diagnosis."},{"Patient":"I was using scissors when my grip slipped and I accidentally stabbed the palm of my left hand directly underneath the middle finger. The injury initially hurt and briefly bled, but I put a Band-Aid on it and forgot about it. It s been about two hours since I hurt myself, but the finger directly above the injury is now slightly swollen and extremely painful. Could I have caused muscle or nerve damage? I m mostly concerned because the spot I hit with the scissors is not painful, just the finger above it. I m currently icing the finger, but the pain is not diminishing.","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.Also, to understand here is hand is a complex anatomy structure with the smaller muscles and the vascular and nerve supply needs to be intact for the hand to function. As you had a cut with the scissor which is a metal, a tetanus injection is required in either case. So I will advice to get it checked first as hand is important. If the nerve is damaged than the first reaction will occur is severe pain with no movement of the finger Also, if the nerve is damaged than we only need a proper neuromuscular assessment to understand this. Without having an hands-on examination it will be difficult to judge anything. nerve injuries usually takes longer time if not treated in time. After all hand is all about we have got to deal each activity in our life. Hand is most precious and there is no harm getting it checked by just spending some amount.I hope to see you at good health & I pray you do not have any nerve injury.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am facing stomach pain problem from last couple of days. It is not continuous pain, but comes for 2-3 seconds. It is sharp pain in and slightly above the center. I had appdix surgery 10 years back, so that option is not there. I already too constipation and antigas tablets. No improvement. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello! Welcome to HealthCareMagic.Pain in the area above centre as mentioned by you suggests acidity.Increase in acid secretion in stomach can be due to various reasons like consumption of hot/spicy food, late night meals, excessive stress, alcohol, non-vegetarian diet etc.So, the advise is to avoid these things.Consult your doctor for medicines like omeprazole, syp. sucralfate..Hope this information is useful to you.Wish you a good health.Thanks.

It hurts to stand but once I ve been on it a little, I m able to walk. I can t bend it upwards, say, to put on pants or my socks without bad pain","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A detailed assessment of the knee joint and lumbar spine is advised.Since the pain is while bending the knee, for me it looks more of a ligament injury which could have occurred due to any factor. That is the reason you are not able to bend the knee. Also, an MRI can help assist further post assessing the knee in the clinic by a ortho.Based on the MRI reports, simple pain killers and physical therapy will be guided. in about 2-3 weeks of time, depending upon the type of soft tissue injury, you should be back to normal.In my clinical practice i find 2-3 weeks of physical therapy regains the movement and functioning.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Ive had a problem with my neck poping for years. Im only 24 but have done hard physical labor all my life. Recently ive had a strong shock feeling down my right arm and sometimes so bad my arm involuntary moves. Not sure what it is or what kind of doc to go see about it","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.As mentioned you were a hard physical labor and also now having strong shock feeling down your right arm, i feel you need to consult an ortho and get clinical neuromuscular assessment done. By which the cause of injury can be understood. Also your ortho may ask for an MRI of cervical spine to see the soft tissue injury, by which the next rehabilitation plan is prepared.As per me, due to hard physical labor, you may have now called as cervical spine degenerative disc disease, for which the disc is giving pinch on the nerve root/s where you are getting such symptoms,With the combination of medication and physical therapy, symptomatic pain can be relieved and also strengthening of the muscles can be performed. As in  99% of cases in my clinical experience the patients responds well to physical therapy and the normalcy is attained in 3-4 weeks. But in the later stages, you may have to perform exercises regularly at home to make sure the muscles of the neck are strong enough to hold the head.Regards.Jay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I woke up with a sharp stabbing pain in my upper back between my shoulder blades, felt short of breathe and haven t felt the best today. my blood pressure is good and oxygen level is good. ive seemed to have heart burn the past few days and diarrhea, was wondering if I should be concerned about it being my heart. the pain in my back by my spine seems to hurt more when I breathe in. thank you","Doctor":"hi,thank you for briefing the history of you.As you mentioned the sharp stabbing pain in the upper back and in between the shoulder blades, this could be due to two factors.One - the cervical spine disc degenerative changesTwo - inter-scapular muscle spam.The cervical spine disc degenerative changes can be assessed by an MRI scan and some special orthopedic tests. Post which a physical therapy is advised and 99% of cases recover with the same. Correction of the posture is also important.The inter-scapular muscle spasm is related to the poor posture. Due to the poor posture the muscles of the thoracic region becomes weak and then leads to inflammation and pain. For which a physical therapist will help with the therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy for pain relief and inflammation reduction. Post which an exercise regimen will be implemented to strengthen the muscles. Correction of the posture is of due importance. 99% cases recover soon.With the grace of God i wish you a Good health.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Hi. I have had a foot problem since 2004, which a doctor quickly diagnosed as Foot Drop, and he said it would go away eventually, The foot doesn t perform very well, and it obviously hasn t gone away. That Dr. said there wasn t a treatment for it so I didn t follow up. But I ve moved from North Carolina to Charlottesville, VA and have recently visited the UVA neurology clinic and had the nerve tests, which gave me the startling news that I did not have foot drop --- wrong nerves involved. I m seeing the Neurologist at UVA soon and have been Googling just now, which makes me think I might have Morton s Neuroma, and I m struck dumb as it were. I have lived with a crippled foot (and talked about it ) for 11 years and now feel foolish, but does it sound as if that s the problem? If so, do you think I ll have any luck with physical therapy to wean myself off my walker? I m 84 and have waited too long, but would love to hear about your experience in this area. Sorry to go on so long. Best regards, Carol Cook Neurology specialty","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.Yes, you can have an opportunity with physical therapy to regain the movement back which will be completely the nerve acceptance to the electrical stimulation provided as a part of the therapy. Also, most nerve injury or major neurological issues require physical therapy in this or the other way to get the musculoskeletal movements back. And research also supports the electrical stimulation to get the movements back with electrical stimulation, exercises and medicine combination. Since your age is 84 there will be a little delay but still there is a possibility to get back on feet without a walker. Keep a strong mental attitude and i am sure you will be helped. In my clinical experience i have seen cases with foot drop with multiple causes, and optimum results are expected if the dedication is provided.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Hello, I tripped over my daughters toy yrsterday. When I fell my ankle popped and twisted and fell hard on my hip. I iced and put my ankle up. My foot is swollen and sore and my toes are numb feeling. My hip hurts in any position but laying down. Stairs and sitting down and standing up is when the pain is the worst.How long before the pain gets better? Thank you, Crystal","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.As you tripped of the toy and then twisted the foot , so the swelling was there and subsided as well. You tried doing ice but it did not work much. Now since the mechanism of injury you did not mention indetail so i can suspect you feel on the floor, for which a thorough neuromuscular assessment is guided.Also, when the hip is hurting and while going up and down the stairs, then you need to consult an ortho who may ask for an x-ray of the hip, ankle and lumbar spine. May be an MRI of lumbar spine as well. Some times the lumbar spine is ignored and the treatment is provided symptomatic for muscular pain.Once the reports are out, simple medication and physical therapy will be advised after a thorough musculoskeletal assessment. 2-3 weeks of time you will be back to normal life.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I woke up in the morning and when I went to get out of bed my right knee hurt.

I put cold compresses on it and a wrap but it is still there. Should I see a doctor. I am 74 yrs. old and in good health. I don t exercise but I am very active.","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.As mentioned, your age is 74, you dont exercise so it can be suspected for two things, either the ligament injury or the lumbar spine disc pathology. Based on the clinical assessment the ortho will advice for an X-ray or an MRI. Post which if any soft tissue injury found than you will be guided for - rest, medication and physical therapy.Usually in my clinical practice i see geriatrics who are active but not enough for the body to withstand the force applied on joints, these kind of pains needs an MRI by which we understand the soft tissue injury and guide physical therapy based on it. In about 2-3 weeks of time a proper rehabilitation is implemented and the normalcy of life is achieved.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I had a total hip replacement 2.12.13 and am still getting excrutiating pain when getting in and out of bed and when sitting in a chair at work. I m a young 57 year old low bmi right weight for height and my surgeon has said the operation went well and there s no infection what could be wrong?","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is guided.As the THR was successful, and no infection is there, than the pain is due to muscle weakness. Also, you need to perform physical therapy post THR not only upto the mobility but upto the state where your body is out of pain and aches. For which, exercises included are - core stability, pelvic floor strengthening, back strengthening, hip strengthening and lower limb as a whole. Since all these exercises will strengthen the muscle groups in and around the hip joint which needs an attention to give full support to the hip joint.In my clinical experience, i prefer physical therapy for my patients anywhere between 6-8 weeks post which after a musculoskeletal assessment the discharge from physical therapy is advised. Patient recover to 99% of optimum muscle strength and no pains.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"i have a large bubble like swelling in my left knee. located outside of left knee just below level of kneecap. it is like a hard ball of fluid.about one year ago it appeared after I was using a tiller in uneven ground.I am 67 years old and played soccer into my early 40 s.

Post which the proper measured will be taken according to the assessment.Also, if the area is non painful than you do not have to worry, as it can be just a soft tissue of the skin to provide some sort of fluid accumulation as you were a soccer player.Also, you can try doing hot water fermentation and see, if the area where the swelling is present gets resolved. In case if it not, then the ortho may ask for an x-ray or MRI and then see if the fluid accumulation is high, he may plan to drain it out and send for the culture to see further what could be the bacteria present which causes such bubble.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have had pain in my knees can t sit or stand for more than 30 min without causing a lot of pain.

The pain is almost present all time. I will advise to get the clinical musculoskeletal assessment as by which we come to know, is the pain because of the weakness of the muscles or because of soft tissue injury with in the joint or because of bony degenerative changes.After a thorough musculoskeletal assessment, the ortho will guide you to simple medicine and physical therapy.With physical therapy, your muscles will become stronger, able to perform regular activities and also move around safely without aches and pains.In my clinical experience, most of the time such pains are due to weakness and by a combination of symptomatic medicine and physical therapy they respond well.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"i have had an xray done on my knee with nothing abnormal coming back. I have horrible pain when trying to straighten out my leg from a bent position to the point of tears. i also have had numbing in my hands for about two weeks off and on. please help!","Doctor":"hi,Thank you for providing the brief history of you.A detailed clinical musculoskeletal assessment is advised.As mentioned in your history about the normal x-ray and pain still persists while bending the knee, than an ortho clinical assessment is needed, as your pain sounds more of a soft tissue injury than a bony one. So x-ray cannot show anything except the bones which appeared normal. Your ortho may also advice you for MRI of knee, which will help in addition to see the soft tissue status. As pain during straightening the knee is related to the soft tissue injury and should get assessed.Based on the diagnosis, you will be recommended for simple pain killers and physical therapy.With physical therapy, your pain will reduce by use of therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy. Also, exercises will be performed to regain the ROM of the knee joint and also the strength of the muscles.In my clinical experience, I have seen cases with such injuries, and they respond well to the medication and physical therapy.

Do I really need to have this kind of surgery and what is the risk of having this? I did a research and this kind of surgery are mostly people having problems w/ their knees not elbow. Please advise. Thank you.","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised.Based on your history, X-ray was normal and MRI was showing tear of the tendon. Well, X-ray cannot show soft tissues and it is taken only for bony deformity, so in any case x-ray will be normal. Also, if MRI shows the tear of the tendon, than what is the grade of the tear? As based on the grade of the injury, the conservative or surgical treatment is planned. If there is complete tear than surgery is advised but if it is partial or fibers of tendon tears , then conservative treatment is planned. Usually in my clinical practice, i have seen patients recovering in the conservative treatment and never need surgery. Also, you can try performing physical therapy as it will help you reduce the inflammation by using therapeutic ultrasound therapy and for pain relief, TENS therapy. Later stages, exercises will be performed and taught as well, to regain the Elbow complete ROM and Strength in the muscles so as to avoid direct strain on the tendon. Which means, your case will be treated on a special note like a sports injury case to regain the maximum output of the upper limb functions without straining or damaging further the tendon.

My mother aged 78 years who is being suffering from bronchitis allergy for past one decade... two days back she suddenly had short breath with noise while breathing and her foot and ankle are swollen. She has varicose veins.. Doctor have put her on CHESTON DT, DERIPHULLIE SYRUP and ZIFI 200 all twice a day... Her chest x-ray shows as all normal... is she on write medicines? please help me out..","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of your mother.As by history I can understand that your mom is 78 years old so the Cardiorespiratory endurance will be less. Also, on addition she has asthama so the respiratory system is weak. She has varicose vein and not the foot and ankle are swollen.To assist further a thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised. To understand the situation a little knowledge about the conditions is needed.Bronchial Asthama - as you know when people having difficulty in breathing they will consume more energy and feel weaker with fatigue. when there is bronchial Asthama the patient feels more weaker to perform any activity due to early fatigue and less oxygen supply. they will have shortness of breath, difficulty in doing deep breathing.Varicose veins - this is like the clots obstructing the normal venous return and led to high blood pressure. As sometimes this leads to swelling as well.Age - as she is 78, she will have slow metabolism and the vascular system will also be slow which may lead to insufficient flow of blood to various organs of the body including the brain.In my clinical practice I deal with geriatrics range between 79-107 years of age. I have a strong recommendation for them to perform exercises. The exercises are divided into various forms.for your mother's initial complain of swelling in ankle and feet I will advice to eleveate the feet and perform ankle toe movements. as it will improve the venous return and reduce the swelling & pain.Also, for asthama I will advice doing regular breathing exercises. these include the following -* deep breathing exercises* pursed lip breathing exercises* diaphragmatic breathing exercises* costal breathing exercises* abdominal breathing exercise .For the ageing factor - general body exercises to improve the metabolism and immune system. By doing regular general exercises the vascular system Improves and also the blood supply to different organs which helps the other organs nourish.Also, ageing demands a physical exercise but each case has different way to deal and get helped. In ageing the pain levels are not berable and also due to lack of exercise the muscles and joints become painful.Exercise will also improve the blood supply, breathing ability, functional Mobility etc.My geriatrics patients recover in 4-8 weeks of time and prolong the therapy as long as they can perform. As by doing regular physical therapy exercise they live healthy and mobile.regardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"i had a cut, 4 stitches on my finger, it healed up ok, but then i got soe over granulation on the healing part, i went to the dr, and the nurse put silver nitrate on it yesterday, it scabbed up and the scab has fallen off, and its about half the size, is there anything i can do to help the healing process?","Doctor":"hi,thank you for the brief history of you.Usually healing is a normal physiological process which does not need anything to boost it.

Usually, with clinical assessment, the ortho comes close to the diagnosis and if he feels there is a need of MRI to see the soft tissue status with in the knee joint he will recommend one. Based on that you will be advised simple medication and physical therapy.As, you are 56 year old, there may be a possibility of soft tissue damage in the knee joint where it is swollen and painful as well. Also, due to ageing of tissues and wear & tear of the soft tissues, the mechanical changes occurs in the soft tissue which can allow it to get injure and give symptoms of pain and swelling at any time. Getting assessed by an ortho will be of input to your health and functional status. Post this physical therapy will help to regain the strength in the muscle and avoid any future injuries by which your activities of daily living is fulfilled.

As your history indicates the tingling of fingers, it can be due to two factor - 1. carpal tunnel syndrome or 2. cervical spine disc degenerative changes. Since you mentioned when you play gold your tingling is not evident it appears to me more of a sports related injury. May be your physician can recommend the NCV test first to rule out the carpal tunnel syndrome and later an MRI of cervical spine to rule out the soft tissue injury.Once diagnosis is made, you will be directed to physical therapy for proper retraining of the muscles of the neck or the forearm as per the requirements.

Also, the muscles are shorter as well. Usually, while buying the shoes, you should check few things how to buy a shoe, as the flexibility of the shoe matters a lot for the feet. If the shoe can flex for 180° than that shoe is mostly recommended for feet. But in today's time, there are a plenty of options but very few shoes are good.Also, why mentioning about 180° of shoe flex is because a human feet is a complex but flexible structure to take the stress and strain along with balance and weight. So a perfect shoe is very difficult to make as well as to find.Now coming to your pain, first need is the X-ray of both the feets, needs a thorough gait assessment and also Musculoskeletal assessment. Since feet bears the weight of the body and also acts as a base of support the relative structures needs an assessment.Also, performing simple feet exercises like, picking the marbles with toes, rubbing the feet in a hard enough stone, picking the bits of paper, etc are the few exercises for the feet. For which this exercises will help strengthen the muscles of feet and also the balance and control of the feet.Also, as age progresses our feet becomes more soft and more shiny. this means the muscles are becoming weak and that is the reason people in old age have falls.with performing this exercises and selecting the best shoe will help you get rid of pain and also to avoid falls in old age.As I wish to explain more of the shoes and foot biomechanics but still it's a less place for me to write up. as the complex mechanism is difficult to understand.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"hello I have been taking Celebrex for some time for arthritis pain.

A combination of proper medication and physical therapy helps in my clinical practice.I will recommend you the same.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"My hips both are always in pain and it feels like it around where the joints are and it hurts to stand sometimes, and sometimes if pants are too tight my whole leg numbs and pain shoots down it, and now after a while of hip pain I have an indentation on my upper thigh too, should I go to a doctor and what could this be ?","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough neuromuscular assessment is advised.As mentioned by your symptoms, I will advice to get assessed by an ortho or a physical therapist. As by undergoing the Neuromuscular assessment it will help us the cause and the symptoms better.Also, you have mentioned in your history about tingling, numbness, pain etc I will advice to look forward with a MRI of lumbar spine. As it will assist us to see the internal structures of the spine.This symptoms are usually due to lumbar radiculopathy - that is the pinched nerve in the lumbar spine and symptoms arise accordingly.You can take physical therapy like - Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy. post which exercise for the core, pelvic floor,  spine muscle Strengthening , lower limb strengthening ,etc.in my clinical practice I deal with the cases having complaints. They respond well a combination of medication and physical therapy.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have pain when I touch the area just under my rib cage on the right side. I went to a clinic in February because I was shovelling and jammed the handle into my stomach and the doctor said he didn t think it was anything serious and should get better, sometimes I don t notice as much until I push on it and it still hurts- any suggestions would be great","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised.As mentioned the pain is in the right side of the rib and your physician it is not a serious one, I still feel that you can take x-ray of the ribs and see if hairline fracture of the ribs is there. As this is common at times and recovery gets delayed. Also, post this, performing proper breathing exercises your muscles will become stronger and bone will also heal. As hairline fracture is not a big thing and bery little ortho can do due to the anatomy of the bone.Also, breathing exercises to perform are -* Deep breathing exercises* Purselip breathing exercises* diaphragmatic breathing exercises* abdominal breathing exercises* costal breathing exercises.To  note the important thing - while performing breathing exercises kindly place the hand over the paigul region to avoid pain triggering.In case, in 5-7 days you don't feel improvement than taking an abdominal scan is advised since you injured your abdomen region to see any systemic illness. usually in my clinical practice patient recover with breathing exercises in 5-7 days and continue same for 4 weeks further.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Had and upper EGD this morning. Everything went well. Small gastric polyp removed. However, my neck and upper shoulders are sore and even once in a while I have a shooting pain.

It is located right below my ribcage. when I was on the elliptical yesterday my heart rate went up to 155 during the tough workout. should I be concerned.","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history of you.As to let you know one of the primary act  is thorough musculoskeletal assessment is advised and also the cardiac clearance before undergoing gym. It is on a safer side to get clearance and then proceed.As mentioned by you that you have a pain under the ribcage or below it, it could be most of the time a muscular pain. Due to overtraining there will be a sudden mucle spasm due to stretch contract mechanism on the elliptical. Taking a rest with hot water fermentation should reduce the pain and after 3 days you can go back to gym. Also, if the pain doesn't come down, than taking up a thorough musculoskeletal and cardiac assessment is advised on a safer side. Since you have discomfort on the right side, the worry is less, may be just a muscle spam on the right hypochondria. It should subside in short time.This is on of the common injury in gym, as the body is not prepared to undergo the stress & strain on the muscles. Undergoing slow and steady training under guidance will help avoid such injuries in future.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"HI. I have panhypopifuitarism & was recently prescribed Amlodopine 5mg & Indapamide 2.5mg to reduce blood pressure. My blood pressure is better but I am getting dreadful muscle & joint pain, in my arms & legs...esp calves. Am also v tired & brain fogged...and finding I wake several times during thd night. Could these drugs be causing my pain?","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history of you.As to know that what is panhypopituitarism is the below mentioned will help you understand.BackgroundThe pituitary gland is called the master endocrine gland of the body because it controls the function of other endocrine organs. The anterior pituitary produces the hormones thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]), corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), growth hormone (GH), and prolactin (PRL). The anterior pituitary is controlled by specific hypothalamic-releasing hormones. The posterior pituitary produces vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone [ADH]) and oxytocin.Panhypopituitarism is a condition of inadequate or absent production of the anterior pituitary hormones. It is frequently the result of other problems that affect the pituitary gland and either reduce or destroy its function or interfere with hypothalamic secretion of the varying pituitary-releasing hormones. Panhypopituitarism can be the end result of various clinical scenarios. The signs and symptoms are diverse.Since the pituitary gland is the main of all, any abnormality in that can lead to various issues including the growth hormone. Consulting a physician can help further into the depth of the situation.Also, fatigue is common due to disturbed metabolism and may lead to muscle & joint aches and pains.Undergoing physical therapy will help imporve the metabolism & immune system.

I don t even remember that it s there till I touch it I have had this for more than 16 years but no dermatologist has been able to figure out what it is or how to treat it. Any help?","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough derma assessment is advised.As mentioned by you, the skin is thickened and it has no symptoms than probably the dermatologist can not help much as it is just skin hardening. for this I can advice to take therapeutic ultrasound therapy as it helps to loosen the skin by activating the cells and also by gradual stretch it can be made flexible. certain times, the hardening can be due to unknown reasons, but how the approach is made to make it flexible is important. Also, ultrasound therapy will even help to get the elastic property of the skin and kindly take help of a Physical therapist for the same. I have seen cases with scar tightness and the scar has become mobile with therapeutic ultrasound therapy. I am sure even you can get help. Since the therapy is non invasive and there are no side effects you can surely try it. keep me posted.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Hello. I am a 22 year-old female. I have had strange pelvic aches and pains for a little over a year now, but the doctors don t know why. I have a 22 month old daughter. My lymph nodes have been up in my throat (under my jaw bone) for over a month now (perhaps longer - I had almost forgotton about them as they had been like that for a while) but then around 2 weeks ago 2 glands in my leg/groin area came up too, with one side being visible and larger than the other. I am experiencing a dull ache with them too. Other than feeling a little more tired than usual I am feeling well other than being absolutely sick with worry about what my be wrong with me. I am ashamed to say that last year I caught chlamydia off of someone I slept with on one occasion and had the infection for 6 weeks (picked up on a full sexual health screen.) One treated, I retested in three months which came back negative. Not convinced, I had 3 more chlamydia tests and decided to go for a another full STD screen again, which again, came back clear. I am frightened that this person could of given me the HPV virus which is causing cancer in me. Could this be possible? What could be causing my pelvic aching and swollen lymph nodes? I also have a heavy feeling in my pelvic area too. I have been examined and have been told that my muscles are ok... I suffer from piles, and also Diastasis Recti which causes me aching in the tummy area. Please help, I feel there could be something really wrong which could take a long time to get to the bottom of. Thankyou","Doctor":"hithank-you for providing the brief history of you.As mentioned in the history what I am able to understand that you have 22 months old baby, diastasis rectii, pain in pelvic region, swollen lymph nodes etc.I want to ask you a question - was the delivery normal? were you physically active before pregnancy? have you undergone physical therapy post delivery?Now , due to the changes in the hormones there will be possibility of the lymph node swelling and also pain and aches. But this are all temporary. Your all tests are negative so you should be happy that nothing major is there. For first, I want you to start strengthening your pelivc floor muscles, core muscles, spinal muscles, lower limb as a whole which will help you ease of pain and aches.Also, doing general body conditioning will help improve metabolism and the swollen lymph nodes will disappear as to understand that with exercise you get good metabolism -> with good metabolism you get good hormonal balance -> with good hormonal balance your worries are down since no symptoms will be there.On a small note, in my personal practice I see cases with such issues post pregnancy, and undergoing physcial therapy and body conditioning helps them to reduce alot of symptoms. They later have an active lifestyle.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I was startled and got up very fast, when I took my first step I landed on the side of my foot; not my ankle.

Usually, at this position there is a sprain of the ligaments. Which takes about 2-3 weeks to recover. Also, the pain will come down in 2-3 days but the ligament healing will take some time. Also, if the foot gets swollen or painful after 72 hours of injury then an x-ray is advised.

And sciatica is not a obvious condition but rather it is a symptom.Also, as your pain is having radiating in nature with burning sensation it could be lumbar radiculopathy. In this condition, there will be compression of the nerve in the lumbar spine due to lumbar disc degenerative pathology. Also, an MRI will be performed to confirm the diagnosis by correlating the MRI reports with the clinical symptoms. usually the upper level of the lumbar spine like - L1, L2 , L3 gives pain in the inner aspect of the thigh - this is just an example to understand that which nerve will be pinched to give symptoms.The treatment will be guided based on the diagnosis. With medication and physcial therapy the symptoms subside and the overall health improves.in my clinical practice we call this kind of condition as lumbar radiculopathy and with the combination of medication and physical therapy cases respond well.You may be advised by a physical therapist to undergo - Therapeutic ultrasound therapy, TENS therapy and exercises on a later stages. All together this will help you spine become stronger and the active life style is achieved.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have been feeling ill all night and morning.

Also, avoiding self medication is recommended.As you have taken medicines - it is legitimate that it may cause some symptoms of acidity , due to which you are having a pain in the left hypochondria. The first thing to do is to stop medicine and see if the symptoms subside. Also keep body hydrated and consume more water with cooling food. So the acidity comes down. If by stopping medicine the pain comes down in the left hypochondria then it was a side effect of the medicine.Also, for the discomfort in the lower limb you can get assessed by an ortho. Performing neuromuscular assessment and special test we come closer to diagnosis and also help further. Along with proper physician prescribed medication and physical therapy the discomfort can be relieved.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Hi I was feeling some problem with breathing and smelling.

And for smelling, she said it cant be treated as i lost the sens of smelling from my childhood. Please suggest.","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.A thorough neuromuscular ENT assessment is guided.As mentioned by your doctor you have smaller passage of the left side of the nostril which is not allowing sufficient air to flow and surgery is of choice, then your doctor may be right as unitl the passage of the respiratory system is clean and opened the air entry to the body is restricted which leading to breathlessness as body don't get sufficient air.Also, for smell sense, it totally depends upon the Neurological system of your body. By taking training for it from a physical therapist who is a rehabilitation specialist , you can get help better.before undergoing the procedure of surgery you may need to take a pulmonary function test to assess the fitness of the lungs. As, if the PFT is normal than the breathlessness issue is not due to the nostril but due to muscle weakness. As you have already lived long years without any issues. Also, by strengthening such muscle groups of respiration your breathlessness issue can be solved. In case the PFT turns negative than you may need further assessment to decide for the surgery.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I was running after a student at work and fell on concrete.

Also, depending upon the symptoms the treatment is always Planned. As in my clinical practice, even with the CLBP and Spinal stenosis, we are able to get 99% of the mobility in patients with minimal pain left, for which a regular exercises are recommended. Also, extension exercises are avoided to exaggerate the pain symptoms if the pain is increasing with the extension exercises and traction. Also, what we do initially in our clinic is medication and understand the pharmacokinetics of the drug first and the fitness level of the patient. Later we focus more on the core stability and pelvic floor strengthening. We even focus on lower limb strengthening as a whole. Strengthening the gluteus muscles helps to stabilize the spine, as the whole body weight falls on the lower spine, the muscles of the hip are important to provide the base of support. Understanding the normal biomechanics and pathomechanics of the patient we deal accordingly and every patient a different therapy.Sometimes, for pain management, we use TENS therapy, Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and Myofascial release technique,Also, exercises are totally depending upon the pathomechanics and needs a careful attention. Extension exercises and traction are usually not advised by us to avoid the movement of the spinal stenosis.We deal mostly with - TENS therapy, Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and exercises.But if the symptoms of pain is not bearable by you and leading to severe lower limb weakness, than a surgery will be advised.

Massage is strongly not recommended as you are doing all mixed up stuffs. Doing strengthening also and massage also will only make the muscle weaker. Also, just by mere working behind the blind fold treatment, i will advice to first take the MRI, and based on that, the combination of medication and physical therapy will work better. The physical therapist you choose, should know there is a difference between the patient to patient and symptoms to symptoms. A specialized plan for you should make a difference. Applying a conventional way of therapy will surely not function to the optimum.As , in my clinical practice i have seen cases with 100% recovery, but prior to that, the MRI, and the ortho prescription is understood for the pharmacokinetics of the drug.

Now since you have a swelling of the lower limbs that is the ankle, and pain free on rest.now to help you further , as per my understanding I am coming close to the problem - you are 71, so there is an ageing process. Next, your metabolism has slowed down too. Also , your Cardiorespiratory endurance must have fallen. But one thing to understand is that during the ageing process, the metabolism is at a slower rate and needs more effort to make sure that it functions well. Also , as we age Cardiorespiratory endurance slowed down, for which walking is recommended badly and some physical exercise which are individual or a group therapy.my personal practice goes well with almost 90% of my patients as geriatrics so by understanding and improving the metabolism in them helps me alot to help them. I have all my geriatrics enjoying without pain and aches. Cardiorespiratory endurance is on the moderate level to help them ease the daily activities.

As by performing the exercises for strengthening the core, pelvic floor, spinal muscles and lower limb muscles helps to reduce the symptoms and eliminate as well. As post lumbar spinal fusion, there is a change in the biomechanics of the spine as well as the muscles of the spine too.

Like if you had TKR on right then the left has more load and vice versa.Now TKR was performed due to pain in knee joint due to Osteoarthritis and reduced joint space. So it can be possible you have the OA knee from atleast 5 years ? This 5 years have changes the biomechanics of the weight bearing joints and may be tilting of the pelvic.Now to not go much deeper into the technical aspect of the situation, i will advice you to take an MRI of the lumbar spine to see any soft tissue abnormality. If the test comes positive the treatment will be guided for the same - rest, medication and physical therapy.So mention little brief here - that there is change in the anatomy of the spine due to OA knee and the symptoms arise before or after surgery. This is my personal clinical experience with patients. So when TKR is performed in our clinical practice we strengthen not only the muscles of the knee but also the core, spine, pelvic floor and whole lower limbs on each side. As we believe in our clinic that body functions as a single unit and disturbance in the unit may lead to symptoms at later stages.Our TKR cases in clinical setting are 100% success without any aches and pains for years.I recommend you to undergo an MRI of the lumbar spine and under go physical therapy later. I am sure you will be 100% fit and back to life.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"June 6 fell hard on right buttock which jarred the sacroiliac area. No breaks.

Also, pain in the shoulder which is stabbing is related to either a shoulder joint pathology or cervical spine pathology. The pain in the rib cage for which chest examination is required. May be pathology of the lungs which is very uncommon to predict also, since pain cannot be because of it as well.The pain in the lower part of the rib cage for which an ultrasound scan of the abdomen will help assist further.The pain in the shoulder and rib cage can be not connected as the nerve supply ,blood supply and the muscle innervation are totally different. So both pathologies are different. For stabbing pain in shoulder the pathology will be related to either the cervical spine or the shoulder.And for pain in the rib cage, the pathology can be related to chest or abdomen. both needs a different assessment and different approach to diagnosis.I will recommend to undergo a Neuromuscular assessment by which we can differentiate both the pathologies and help you better.For shoulder pain, with proper rest, medication and physical therapy things fall into place.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I was pushed onto cement and landed on my the back of my head an back.

As medicine and natural methods are more of symptomatic relief. The focus has to be made to make the muscles stronger as to avoid any space for the fluid to accumulate. Also, exercises will help improve the metabolism and keep the lower limbs at the optimum.I have seen many chronic lymphedema cases, and the exercises have helped them alot for reducing the swelling and also the over all functioning of the lower limbs.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have a pain in my left arm along with cold chills after urinating which leads me to go to the doctor for a UTI. It is always positive. The pain and cold chills stop after I take a few antibiotics that the doctor has subscribed. Why the pain in the arm?","Doctor":"hi,As mentioned by you about the UTI, i will recommend to first strengthen the core and the pelvic floor, as the muscles of the core and pelvic floor will help the bladder to get completely empty and avoid any back log drops of fluid which leads to UTI.Also, now looking to the pain in the left arm, it is needed to understand by taking an neuromusuclar assessment of your arm. It can be bicipital tendinits or may be pinched nerve in the cervical spine. Based on performing the special tests for each of the possible pathology, the positive test will help us plan the next rehabilitation process.Arm pain are usually controlled by taking therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy in the physical therapy center and 99% cases recover in  a short time.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Hello:I went to a GI Specialist today because I've been experiencing abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fevers.  I thought maybe I had Diverticulitis.  Note:  I consider myself to be very healthy and in shape, infrequently sick.  Doc said that my blood work was mostly fine, and that he thought it was safe to rule out diverticulitis.  And, my symptoms have gone away.  He did say that I had an elevated C Reactive Protein level, and to be on the safe side, I should have a CT Scan.  Before spending my 3000 deductible on a CT Scan, I've been analyzing the necessity of the test.  I realized I forgot to mention to the doctor that I was on the HCG Drops diet for 30 days, ending 8 days ago.  Here's my question:  Could the HCG Drops, 8 days after quitting the diet, lead to an elevated C Reactive Protein level?  Is this relevant?  Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Yes indeed.C reactive protein is a acute phase reactant protein which is raised in any condition ranging from common cold to cancer. Diverticulitis by itself is the main reason for elevation. Diets would not cause such an effect.regards"},{"Patient":"I have shooting pain on the upper part of left thigh which travels zig-zag, for about 30 seconds and vanishes when I massage my hip at the front and back.

Now this is because, your age is 71 , and at this age the possibility of the degenerative changes in the body is always high. Also, while you are already into the multiple fitness training regimen, that shows how active you are how troubling this pain factor is. But the nature of the pain is shooting and also on the thigh region, relieved with rest and more on activity. Undergoing an MRI of the lumbar spine can help further to understand the soft tissues. Also, for time being stopping the fitness training will help further.Usually, people performing aerobics, yoga , stretching etc develops at certain stage the lumbar spine degenerative disease, which can be controlled by proper physical therapy and precision of exercises as well.My personal clinical experience have been seeing many cases and treated almost 99% with 100% success rate. I am sure you will also recover soon.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"the tip of the index finger of my left hand (I am right-handed) has been overly sensitive to pressure.

I don t recall injuring or over-using my hand or fingers recently","Doctor":"hithank-you for providing the brief history of you.As you mentioned that pain is in the index finger a thorough neuromuscular assessment is needed.Now to understand this, that the pain is triggered on activity and subsides on relaxing. As you mentioned the nature of the pain is sharp in nature on the tips, what are the other associated symptoms along with the pain. Like any kind of numbness or the pain is just restricted to one location and of one kind.to assess further, are you a high computer usage person? or a high smartphone usage person? any injury or skin color changes in the painful area, are the nail beds intact?Since it is totally a sensroy symptom, we need to assess two things here. One is to assess the nerve with Nerve conduction velocity test and the other is the MRI of the cervical spine.Nerve conduction study will help assess the course of the nerve and it's functioning also any carpal tunnel compression is present will be revealed.Incase this test is negative than an MRI of the cervical spine is guided to see the soft tissues compression on the nerve roots.Also, how is your motor functions of the strength. Is there any difference in the strength of both the hands? if so than a musculoskeletal assessment will help further. Now since it is a sensory issues of the radial nerve, as radial nerve supplies the index finger and control the motor and sensroy functions of it, assessment done in detail will help come close to diagnosis and guide for further rehabilitation plan.with the grace of God I wish you a speedy recoveryregardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Extreme pain that radiates from my shoulder down to my left arm and results in a rash.

Since nerve carries both the functions - motor and sensory as well. Also an MRI post the Neuromuscular assessment of the cervical spine us recommend. An NCV test will help further to check the course of the nerve. On a later stages the skin rashes needs assessment as the skin rashes and the radiating pain has no connection as per my understanding. Also, once coming close to the root cause the next part can be planned.For rashes, it is about the dry skin, and may be a reaction to the medicine if taken any or may be due to any bite of an insect. which might need an dermatologist attention.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have a problem with meds. all together.

Muscle cramps occurs due to the imbalance in the electrolyte transmission which disturbed the neural impulses.

Since your age is 57, fall at this age is not good. Now since you mentioned you have pain, what is the nature of the pain, if the nature of pain is numbness, tingling, radiating then you might have spine issue. If not, then you are safe.

I am in intense pain and can hardly move","Doctor":"hi,As mentioned by you, that you are having a doubt about DVT then getting a Doppler scan will be advised to rule out the DVT factor. Also, if the pain is in the lower limb as a whole then getting an MEI of the lumbar spine will be recommended to rule out any pathology of the lumbar spine. Usually due to the nerve impingement there will be symptoms of pain and can be misdiagnosed with DVT or any other issue. But getting a scan done wil help understand the extent of the lumbar disc degenerative pathology. As the spinal nerves works as dual functions of motor and sensory, any compression on the nerve will lead to abnormal motor or sensory symptoms. It is never compulsory to have all the symptoms . Having a provisional diagnosis and differential diagnosis in mind and step by step ruling out the pathologies will help come closer to the root cause.Usually 99% of patient recover with physical therapy, this is my personal experience in clinical setting.I recommend to undergo MRI of lumbar spine and also the Doppler of lower limbs to come close to the root cause.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have diabetes high blood pressure and thyroid issues take medicine for all due to obmacare havent seen a dr in a while .My left leg started hurting me in feb.

So i will advice to take sun bath on daily basis, also to undergo physical therapy as by therapeutic ultrasound and TENS therapy the pain will be lowered, but later on performing regular general body exercises which will be of only 15-20 minutes and no strain on the heart is kept in mind. I have personally dealt with similar cases. I am more focused on geriatric cases, so i look to all corners of them and find the best natural possible way to help them. Ageing needs proper attention and rehabilitation plan, medication is only for symptomatic relief, and for the body to function normal, the body has to rise.I will recommend to take physical therapy and sun bath to help your mother with the non invasive treatment.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I m a 54 years I had surgery a week ago an I was there for 4 days , right after surgery they put these stockings/ socks on my feet an I felt like they were really bothering me. An now it is very painful to walk as my right foot hurts to the point I need a cane to walk","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.As you mentioned the history you did not mention what surgery you have undergone. Also, to understand here is, the stockings are provided to avoid swelling of the lower limbs, i.e. legs. As due to lack of mobility post surgery with the age of 54 possibly hypertension, needs stockings to allow the proper venous return. Also, due to the lack of mobility which may lead to swelling may also, lead to Deep Vein thrombosis, so the stockings are just provided on a precautive.If you feel you can walk better and every hour, than you can discuss with your surgeon about not using the stockings.

MRI 2 yrs ago did not show MS as diagnosis. We figured maybe stress? She now in the last month has noticed bruising, is fatigued, has bone pain, and when her arm suddenly went numb yesterday the doctor saw her and also diagnosed Petechia on legs. They took 12 vials of blood for testing. We do not live in the same state and I only know what she can remember to tell me. What do you think he is looking for? When might we know something?","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of your daughter. As, you mentioned about MS i do not think this should be the case. As the pain is in the arm, legs, numbness, bone pain and fatigue, it can be a metabolic dysfunction which needs a correction. Since now medicine is implemented for symptomatic relief which allows the body to heal on its own.Also, undergoing a physical therapy will help further to first reduce the pain and numbness. For pain in bone, there is a need for calcium and Vitamin D - for calcium milk is the source and for Vitamin D sun is the source. Also for fatigue, exercises will help improve the metabolism activity of the cellular functioning and help delay the fatigue. Also with exercises which included cardiorespiratory training will help improve the oxygenated blood supply to the cells and improve the mechanism.sometimes, symptoms can be controlled with a natural way rather getting making it too much complicated. If you have more doubt i can explain in detail if you provide me proper and detailed history.I wish your daughter a speedy recoveryRegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Hi I fell onto my left knee one year after a TKR, one year on still painful, hurts to walk downstairs and up. Had x rays and bone scans. Doctors have so far said they can find nothing wrong, Upon requesting my x ray results and bone scan results, the diagnosis was mild synovitis. This was not discussed with me at all, is there any cure, will it get better. I have been unable to play tennis now for 2 years and think that I will never get back to playing. What do you think.","Doctor":"hi,as mentioned by you the brief history, and the synovitis. the synovitis is the inflammation of the synovial membrane and it's just a small issue which can be controlled. Since you are having a pain in the knee which is replaced, I will advice you to strengthen the hip muscles and core muscles. As by doing this, the stress on the knee joint will be less and the synovitis may not trouble you again.You can take a guidance from a physical therapist on how to perfrom exercises for the core and hip muscles. This has helped many of my patient post TKR and I expect the same from you.regardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I had a cyst in my left butt cheek the size of maybe an tennis ball or bigger. I had surgery two years ago in which the cyst was removed but also a huge chuck of my butt muscle in which has left a pretty big size dent.. The doctor that performed the surgery told me it would fill in in time it has already been two years and I really feel like it s not going to fill in at least not to the normal size it once was so my question is.. Is it realistic to think it will never fill back in or will it fill in and how long would it take","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you. As mentioned by you about the cyst and the surgery you have undergone. The surgery was performed to help ease of the cyst. Now since the space you are feeling empty there is not filled than you need to  perfrom some exercises to strengthen the muscles and eliminate the space. Usually due to the cyst the muscle is overstretched and than after removal there is empty space which can be filled by exercises. Also , to not allow that space to be occupied by anything else in future you need to have a good tone of the muscles. I am sure you will be helped and your complains will be eliminated by toning of muscles.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"yes I just recently had an mri don due to job injury about a year ago,it came out normal but im still in pain everyday.My physician says he don t know what it could be,he ordred physical therapy again.im wondering if it has to do with some nerve damage?","Doctor":"hi,as mentioned by you the history of your illness, what I can understand is you have a general body pain. Now to understand your pain the MRI was suggested. Apparanlty, with the grace of God it came normal and it is a good news. Now what needs focus is to understand that due to workstation , there is something called as - Repetitive stress injury. This injury are divided into wide based classification. On a general note when you perform the office work while sitting or standing in a same position for longer hours there is a static contracction in the muscular system and leads to the metabolism of the muscles and early fatigue. which leads to the pain. To help this issue. you need to perform regular gents body exercises, breathing exercises and meditation.

After one year I I expected full recovery, but I am still experiencing pain and my leg feels heavy ? I apply heat, ice, go for swim and physical therapy treatments. How long do I have to endure this? What could be the problem?","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.As you mentioned that post 1 year of TKR the pain is still persisting regardless of undergoing all protocols. It is sad to hear this.Well, let me help you further, the first thing you should is to visit the one who performed TKR and get the thorough orthopedic assessment. As the one who operated the knee has seen inside of your body well so he is the one to comment.Now to look further, total knee replacement, is it a bicompartment or tricompartment or unicompartment? this makes a lot of sense in understanding the Surgical procedure.To look ahead, post TKR how many weeks the physcial therapy was performed, I personally recommend my patients atleast 12 weeks of protocol and post that as per the assessment the next number of weeks will be designed.Also, to understand that prior to TKR you had a lot of weakness in the muscles of the thigh, hip and core. Now if this three area are not Strengthened to Muscle Grade 5, then you need some more input of the physcial therapy.Usually, my cases post TKR can perform 40 squats in a 60 seconds. also, they can perform, sprinting, running, jogging, jumping etc. I get 100% knee stability.Also, in TKR your internal structures of the knee are removed to provide a new implant. As the role of the implant is to just hide the knee joint sensory system to sensation less. The degenerative changes of the bone is irreversible. Also, as the internal structures of knee are removed, the joint is super immobile and only the strength in the muscles can hold the joint intact and get you rid of pain. There is alot to understand about the TKR, as what I mentioned is just a few points. With my patients I initially spend alot of time making them understand the Arthitis of knee, how to avoid TKR, What is the TKR procedure, what are the plus and minus of TKR, how to get the best joint stability and how the whole process will be followed with strenous exercises. By this, my 50% of Job is done as they understand their joint better and perfrom the best possible exercises advised under supervision. Within 12 weeks of time we get 80% stability and the last 20% we go slow but painful procedures and again in another 8 weeks all is settled. I wish you get your doubts clear by sitting down with a Surgeon and the physcial therapist as well to get the best results.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I was told I had bone on bone osteoarthritis both knees, no space in one knee and minimal spacing in the other.

By performing the special tests for knee assessment we can come closer to which ligament must be injured. Since there is buckling and pain behind the knee I come closer to two-three things here - either it is a Anterior Cruciate ligament injury or meniscal injury or both.By perfroming an MRI in the later stage will help assist to understand that which ligament is Injured and what is the extend of injury.Initially a conservative management is planned like -- Rest- physical therapy on the later stages , exercises are included to import the strength and Range of motion of the knee joint.

As mentioned your age is 51, feet swollen and gout. So Gouty arthritis are possibly responsible for the swelling of the feet. As in gout there is increase in the uric acid levels and that can be checked by a laboratory test. Taking medicine to reduce the uric acid levels is important to help reduce the swelling. Also, due to the pain in the feet, there is restriction of the mobility, may not be visually seen, but it happens such. So performing regular exercises for the lower limb will help improve the venous return and also core stability to stabilize the spine. With these there will be increase in the urine output and elimination of the uric acid. Also, currently you can use how water fermentation and elevate the leg above the level of the heart to reduce the swelling, but it will be a symptomatic help. For long term relief, performing exercises for the lower limbs and also the feet exercises which will be guided by a physical therapist can help to maintain the long term relief.I have seen many gouty arthritis patients, and with a combination of medication and physical therapy i have found 99% success rate in my patients.I wish the same for you.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"HI one or two of my toes on my right foot feel numb and squishy.

What kind of doctor would i need to go see?","Doctor":"hi,Thank you for providing the brief history of you.As mentioned by you, about the pain in the neck, back and arm, also the right foot feel numb and squishy, it is looking to me as a cervical and lumbar degenerative changes of the spine. An MRI of the cervical and lumbar spine will help understand the extent of the soft tissue injury. Also, to understand here is that, due to the pinching of the nerve there will be altered sensation and does not always need to have sciatica pain symptoms. If there is a nerve pinching there can be any symptoms - a motor or a sensory, in your case it is sensory for the foot.By understanding the MRI study we can plan the further treatment by rest, medication and physical therapy. As by physical therapy, the exercises will help strengthen the muscles and reduce the pinching of the nerves which will help reduce the current symptoms you are facing. Also by performing exercises for the neck and back will help strengthen the muscles and reduce the pain.

I know I ve had swelling and pain in my lower back and have been taking Ibuprofen and Neproxan to help that (no.. I didn t go the the ER or see a doctor but lower back pain is common with this type of injury and a few months earlier I hurt my lower back where the Dr said that there was swelling in that area). That has helped me to move around and function. My question is, would the pain cause phantom pain on my left side around my hip (not hip.. a little higher) area? You know where you put your hands on your hips but your hands are above the hip.. right there is so uncomfortable that it hurts to roll over or turn. What do you think (besides going to see a Doctor). :)","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.As you mentioned you faced an accident and after which you are having a pain in the hip. As reading your history, i can understand that you were hit from behind and then you had a fall. Now to understand this mechanism, you need to understand some physics here. As when you are hit from behind, your  body is not prepared to take the force applied on it. Also, due to the hit from the back, the body has gone into extension in the spine level and later on fallen down. So there might be chances of soft tissue injury which needs an assessment. Also, an MRI of the lumbar spine is advised. I agree to you, that most RTA will have back pain, and all are not serious, but without examining deciding on a general terms is a baseless understanding. Taking self medication is also not advised, as if the injury is big you may be trying to reduce the pain but the other factors of the soft tissue injury will be present and may get worsen as well. I will advice to get your spine assessed, as spine is an important segment in the human body and needs a real attention. also to understand that, due to any injury now, the later disadvantages are present. Afterall its totally your call and you can decide better.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have knee pain in my right knee a little in the front lower section and then a lot in the back left bottom corner.

As mentioned by you, that you have pain in the neck and tingling sensation. Apparently as per your history mentioned neither the ENT nor the chiropractor was helpful.Well, first i will advice you to take the MRI of the cervical spine and also perform some orthopedic special tests prior to MRI to assess the cervical spine. With the help of MRI the understanding of the soft tissue is better as we can visualize the inner body structures. Also, due to any nerve impingement there will be a persistent neck pain and also some swooshing sound in the ears.For neck pain and the swooshing sound in your left ear i will recommend further to undergo physical therapy. The use of therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy will first help reduce the pain in the neck. Also the latter part will focus on the exercises.Exercises will be focused on the Strengthening of the muscles of the neck and also Vestibular rehabilitation exercises which will help reduce the sound in your ears. Now vestibular rehabilitation helps the movement of the fluid in the vestibular system, as dude to the inability of the vestibular system to function properly the swooshing sound is heard.Physical therapist have been helpful to many patients in this conditions of neck pain and swooshing sound.

The female who massages my legs (at times of pain) says, she can feel hard muscles at the time of the start of the massage, but, she works on it, so that it softens. Please suggest what should I do?","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for providing the brief history of you.As per my understanding what i feel is you need to do two things - one is to check the straight leg raise, if in performing this movement you get pain then you need to check the MRI of the lumbar spine. Also, in either case taking an MRI of lumbar spine will help insight to the internal structures of the spine and understand if any impingement is present. Spinal nerves has two functions - motor and sensory, and any impingement in the nerve will disturb the sensory or motor system. Next it is advised to undergo the doppler of the lower limbs to rule out any varicose veins issue. Once ruled out, a physical therapist will help you with Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy for pain management. Based on the pain levels, the exercises will be performed. Also, to understand that the spinal nerve pathology is sometimes misdiagnosed and later on it comes back with higher degree of pain, where the recovery takes longer time . So as said, prevention is better than cure. Act now so the worry for future stays down.As, you are undergoing massage therapy, the massage will help improving the blood supply and provide the soothing effect, if any varicose vein issue is there, in that case massage is contra-indicated as it may worsen the situation.I have seen many patients in my daily practice and most complains are similar , but the diagnosis comes at the early stage by looking at the MRI. and most of my patients are 100% benefited at the early stage of diagnosis and physical therapy.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"About 7 wks ago, I was bending over picking pine cones and gum balls up off the ground.

Using the Therapeutic Ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy will help reduce inflammation and pain. Also, post that strengthening the muscles of the spine, core, pelvic floor and lower limbs will help for controlling the symptoms and recovery also. Cortisone and predisone are the secondary lines of action.For any pinched nerve there is a safest way to practice1. Assess the patient and make provisional diagnosis2. confirm the diagnosis using the radiology - like MRI scan3. Rest - sleeping on a hard surface and avoid bending4.

Infact most systems will have fluctuation as it is normal.chances for any breaking of the blood vessels is uncommon due to walks, but if you want to confirm a Doppler of the lower limbs is recommended to figure out if there are any.for swelling of the ankles you need to first keep the legs elevated and perfrom ankle toe movements.Also, understanding that physical exercise is recommended highly in you as you are obese. But prior to any exercise regimen a cardiac clearance will be of an advantage.regardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have a sprained right knee per the ER. They gave me norco w/Tylenol for pain.

I will recommend you to take an MRI and see if ligament injury is present. As while having a ligament injury most of the times pain dont come down even with the RICE protocol. Also in the mean time you can ask a physical therapists help for ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy. As it is an instant pain reliever since it is applied in the site of the injury. We have practically tested this and research also supports this for instant reduction in pain. Pain won't be at level zero but sure it will not be that bad too. Also some small exercises for maintenance of the muscle property will be performed to keep the haemodynamic stable.Once MRI is done we can come to conclusion of any possible ligament injury and post that treatments will be planned accordingly.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I was told I have tendonitis and an arthritis spur.

All the blessings of God be upon you.As you mentioned you have a D12 Vertebrae fracture, I think it will be fracture of the body of the vertebrae. As mentioned, you should really take a proper care initially because of the allow the callus to form inside the fractured bone. Since it is a crucial place you should be really careful. Movements you should avoid are bending and twisting in bed. You should just lie down.Also, also with that, perfrom slow breathing exercises to keep the respiratory system intact and also perform some little exercises. You can consult your physician and a physical therapist for the same as some maintenance of the muscle property is required.Also, consume good calcium supplement through diet which will act as a boost to the healing.Once you are adviced to move out of bed, discuss with your physician priror to initiative of any exercises.

My question is what could be causing so much pain?","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for providing the brief history of you. As you mentioned the mechanism of injury we should understand that when ever there is a fall, there might be two things, either muscular injury or either a bony injury.Undergoing an MRI of the Lumbar spine will help provide some input. Sometimes due to fall there are chances that you may damage the soft tissue of the lumbar spine and also the bony alignments are disturbed. The reason for this is the whole load is borne by the lumbar spine as there is a tremendous thrust on the hip region due to fall. Most cases landing on the hip region during the fall, land into the injury of the lumbar spine and get misdiagnosed due to improper assessment plan. I will recommend to undergo an MRI of the lumbar spine to get assess further into the depth of the issue.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have severe pain in both of my knees, sometimes it feels like they could bend backwards, the pain is chronic, to mild, and on inside of both knees, there is a spot that is painful to touch. even times when I m laying on the couch doing nothing, a bolt of pain will jab to the point I even hear myself moan.","Doctor":"hi,Thank you for providing the brief history of you. Depending upon your age the further guess work can be made. If you are 40+ then there are chances of early degenerative changes in the bone. If you are lower than it than chances of soft tissue injury chances are there.Now to help you better, i will advice to take an MRI scan of the knee to understand the internal structures of the knee. As without knowing the internal structures of the knee, it will be a provisional diagnosis, and the use of the technology will help provide good inputs.Further more, you need a thorough lower limb musculokseletal assessment as to check the strength in the muscle and based on that the exercises will be implemented by the physical therapist.Also, once the MRI confirms the knee internal structures it will help further to plan the rehabilitation.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I am wondering what type of surgery would be done for Disc Osteophyte complex with spinal cord compression. My dad just had an MRI done and was advised that if he does not have surgery he could end up paralyzed so I am trying to find out what the surgery entails?

Based on the region and the symptoms the next plan of treatment is decided or advised.Since you want to know what sort of surgery is performed - it will be excision of the osteophytes. That is all i can say for now. As you havent mentioned the level giving a precise idea on the surgery process will be difficult. As the osteophytes may be present on any side of the spinal cord and based on the location of the osteophyte the approach of the surgery is planned. Also, surgery in the lumbar or cervical region any where is not an easy process, understanding that the surgery which involves the spine needs to be a careful decision as the spine is the major structure of the human body.I wish you can undergo a physical therapy and reduce the symptoms and avoid the surgery, but if the symptoms are uncontrolled than the surgery is of choice.I have personally seen many cases of spine with many complexes, but till date havent allowed my any patient to undergo spinal surgery, we followed a long process and made the spine stronger. Also, we never came across loss of faith, because having a discussion with my patients who were already recommended surgery, a good exercise plan is made and its been years now, but no surgery.

Also , as your mobility is reduced, the swelling is but obvious due to the low cardio endurance and mobility of the muscles and joints.You can discuss the same with the physician, as most cases seen by me recover by post physical therapy sessions and the possible near normal mobility is regained.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Hi.

Also, Only Rheumatoid arthritis can affect the rib cage so for this the RA test has to be performed to confirm rather just predicting it with symptoms.Also, for a complete analysis of the cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal system the assessment has to be done by examination and observation.By doing regular breathing exercises will help improve the muscles of the rib cage and hold the joints in proper position by which the pain reduces. Usually pain arises due to the abnormal anatomy of the joints and can be corrected by getting the optimum strength in the muscular system.I have seen cases with chest pain and also RA of rib cage. we have come closer to the maximum improvement where the normality of the daily activities can be maintained.For further deep discussion you can contact meRegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I had a fall in a manhole,It was so painfull ,I called for help but I had to pull myself out of the hole I had to drag myself into my home..

The area is painful to touch as well.As seeing your symptoms what I can understand is to see two possibilities.1. De Quervain's Tenosynovitis2. cervical spine disc degenerative changes.As you mentioned that you are left handed by nature to perform all activities by left hand the above mentioned two provisional diagnosis comes in mind1. De Quervain's Tenosynovitis - A test called the Finkelstein test can help confirm de Quervain's tenosynovitis. To do this test, you bend your thumb down across the palm of your hand, and then cover your thumb with your fingers. Next, bend your wrist toward your little finger. If this causes pain, you likely have de Quervain's tenosynovitis2. Cervical spine disc degenerative changes - The Spurling's test (also known as Maximal Cervical Compression Test and Framonial Compression Test) is used during a musculoskeletal assessment of the cervical spine when looking for cervical nerve root compression causing Cervical Radiculopathy.Following this two test we can rule out one and diagnosis is close by. Also taking an MRI of the wrist or cervical spine based on the positive test either of the above will help guide confirm the diagnosis.Treatment -1. De Quervain's tenosynovitis - physical therapy can help you with the therapeutic ultrasound therapy, phonophoresis, TENS and exercises.2.

What is the best way to know for sure?","Doctor":"Hi, As mentioned by you, There seems to be two things as per my understanding.First - if we know the exact location then we can figure out if the muscle spasm is due to the kidney issueSecond - may be it is related to the pathology of the spine.Also to understand here, Muscle spasm can be due to end number of results, as you have taken a self medication it might be the case of frequent urination. Since you have not mention any history of abdominal pain or kidney stones.As to my knowledge, Taking hot water fermentation will help ease the symptoms of muscle spasm. Mean time kindly avoid self medication.For muscle spasm, you can take a physical therapists advice to understand that exercises are more important. When muscles becomes weak, to avoid any particular injury the muscle goes into spasm. Also, an abnormal jerky movement can lead to the same.Prevention is better than cure.I wish you a good healthRegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Last month I had a very sore throat and I couldn t walk sit up on my own or eat.

Well thats the past story, Since now you should focus on how to control the infection with pain and aches.Perform regular breathing exercises, oxygen is the major source of human body, human body can stay without water for 1 hour or more but without oxygen every second is important. because one cannot live without oxygen.Also, breathing exercises have been divided into -1. Deep breathing2. Diaphragmatic breathing3. Pursed lip breathing4. Costal Breathing5. Abdominal breathing.Performing this exercises regular can help you further to maintain the metabolism and also the lung capacities,Also , you need to perform the core stability exercises and pelvic floor strengthening exercises to avoid any kidney issues in future.Most patients with such symptoms i recommend the exercise along with medication and they bounce back faster.I wish you a Good health.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I am a 40 year old male who has had daily pain since about 12 years old.

I have to walk back and forth to class every day (across campus, maybe a quarter to half a mile). The brace didn t give me any support--only made sure it wouldn t twist or turn on itself.

Ankle joint is the one first joint to bear the whole body weight so coming close to the diagnosis will be of choice with the help of an MRI.Also, rather doing all these, Try to pick bits of paper with your toes from the floor. it will help strengthen the muscles of feet. Also, understanding the biomechanics and pathomechanis of the foot is a wide area to explain, so care is important even in the smallest cases.

Only on examination we can come to a conclusion.Since you mentioned you have a restriction of ROM of the shoulder it can be due to stiffness of joint or may be a muscle stiffness/weakness.Also, you can perform some slow neck exercises to strengthen the muscles of the neck. Perform ROM exercises for the shoulder while lying down on the floor as it will be free of gravity and the ROM will be a bit easy.

As you need to take a small visit to a physical therapist who can actually guide you to perform some special test to check what injury it might be. Also you will be directed mild static exercises for the shoulder girdle muscles. It will progress to moderate and then Strengthening the shoulder girdle muscles. The muscles to focus on are the, pectoralis, triceps, biceps, deltoid, shoudler girdle, trapezius etc.Strenthening the muscles of the shoulder girdle will help you in further to avoid any sorts of pain. Also perform exercises for both sides to balance the strength in them.On a safer side an MRI will be of help to see any soft tissue Injury.Usually with proper exercises 99% of shoulder cases get benefit and avoid future injuries.With the grace of God I wish you a good health."},{"Patient":"Hi My partner has had pain just below and under ribs on left side which is worse when lying down.

Liver function is good and blood as well.","Doctor":"hi,thanks for the brief history of you.as you mentioned you have the symptoms of tingling and also you have done a heavy shoulder workout. which makes me close to the cause of it. It may be a pinched nerve in the spine. for which you can take an MRI if the symptoms increase and find the extent of injury to the soft tissues. Also performing the slow core stability and spinal muscle Strengthening exercises will help you ease the system. also to understand the biomechanics of spine here as when you do sqatting there is a big open window for the inter vertebral disc to move. which can lead to pinching of the nerve and provide any sensory and motor symptoms.Also, when next time you do heavy shoulder workout please make assure you learn the proper technique to life.as in many cases one may make the spine in danger.

Or is there a remedy besides soaking in warm water? Or do I try to get a family member take her to a doctor","Doctor":"hi,as you mentioned that you didnt notice slurred speech, facial deformity it should be ruled as a major issue. Thanks for the quick assessment made by you. As you said she is feeling numbness in her hand you should see if she has placed her arm in a resting position where it is compressed. like resting on a the edge of the chair etc. Also she might have pinch nerve which may be leading symptoms of numbness for her. Taking a help of a physical therapist for this will help her. Also as she is aged , there will be a lot of weakness which can be corrected by doing some simple active physical exercises.

So for this you need to do some simple hip exercises. Also at times the weakness of muscles is seen as edema but it is not true edema. I will advice you to keep the leg elevated over a pillow when you are lying flat on your back. this will help drain the lymphatics. Try performing slow static exercises for the hip muscles and thigh muscles under a physical therapist as due to lack of knowledge one may have a chance to dislocate the hip again.

My right leg is always in pain and cannot go a day with out my compression socks on and is slightly bigger now then the left leg (just from the knee up)most of the pain is inside part of my leg. I just had ultra sound done on both my legs and they said everything is normal and to wear compression socks nothing else they can do. I feel too young to have this kind of constant pain in my leg. I m not over weight and exercise regularly when my leg feels o.k. Could it be something else causing the pain?","Doctor":"hi, as you mentioned you have pain in your let's I will make a small understanding here. what happens is, when the muscle is weak the metabolism is faster and the fatigue in the muscles occur faster . which leads to the lactic acid production and later a pain.performing regular exercises and progressing from mild to moderate to severe levels is needed. also a need of endurace training is needed to improve the cellular mechanism.Since the pain is not lowering down and constant it is, I will like to know the nature of the pain, if it is like burning, numbness, radiating, etc then you should take the MRI of lumbar spine as the nerve may be getting trapped in the spinal column.for this you can improve the strength in your core muscles by performing core stability exercises and spine Strengthening exercises. Also strengthening the hip muscles is of importance as the stronger the muscles is the better the venous return.Exercise is a slow a steady process which will consume alot of time for getting progress. You may need to even improve you cardiovascular response to exercise as it will even help to maintain the hemodynamics of the blood and help you perform well. including cardiorespiratory training is good for lungs and to improve the oxygen levels in the blood for detoxification.you can discuss the same with your vascular surgeonwith the grace of God I wish you a good health."},{"Patient":"Ok jan2 surgery for inguinal hernia also diagnosed with possible detached groin and or abdominal muscles yesterday i had for first time black specs sum bigger blackish brown eraser size peices also sum stringy stuff that looked like pulled pork or sumthin wich has not been eatin also bright red blood in a runny mucusy stool a little concerned as er did stool sample today and came up with nothing when i got home of course more blood and other contents","Doctor":"hi,thank you for the brief history of you.since it is a possible detached groin or abdominal muscle and the possibility can also be less.what I will advice is to get the scanning done to rule out any of the possible factor of doubt. Also since you had an inguinal hernia surgery you should slowly start doing mild exercises to strengthen the muscles as to avoid any muscle wasting. start with breathing exercises like deep breathing and diaphragmatic breathing by placing the hand over the incisional area as to safeguard it.on a later stage you should strengthen the core muscles and the spinal muscles.

Hx of disc herniation 8 years ago. Recently had a severe episode that I knew was different than a flare up of my previous injury. Started with severe left hip pain, then one day woke up and could barely stand or walk with severe back pain. This was also accompanied by numbness, tingling and a hot water sensation (left labia, left thigh, down the back of my leg into my foot). I had hyperactive reflexes and other signs of nerve impingement so was put on steroids, muscle relaxers, pain meds, but a month later the symptoms had not completely resolved (still having intermittent pain and increased frequency of the hot water sensation). A few days ago had MRI (lying down) and results are: L4-L5 - Mild disc bulge with left paracentral protrusion. Mild left ventral thecal sac impression without central stenosis. L5-S1 - Mild disc bulge. Minimal central protrusion. Mild flattening of the ventral thecal sac. No significant central or foraminal stenosis. Impression: Degenerative disc disease at L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels consisting of mild disc bulging and small protrusions. Mild ventral thecal sac impressions without central stenosis.

A physical therapist will help you to learn and strengthen the muscles of the core and the spine. Also the focus will be on the lower limb strengthening to give you good functionalities.I have seen cases between age group 17-90 with same symptoms and 100% have responded well.I can expect the same with you.your spine rehabilitation should include the short term goals and long term goals. which will be planned by a physical therapist attending you.Also this process is little time consuming but I have a 100% record with my patients.
