How many different arrangements are possible? (Answer with a number)","solution":"To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Since there are 5 classes and 4 factories, and each factory must host at least one class, we can consider the problem as distributing 5 identical objects (classes) into 4 distinct boxes (factories) with no box empty.This is equivalent to solving the equation x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 5 under the condition that x_i geq 1 for i=1,2,3,4, where x_i represents the number of classes assigned to the i-th factory.The solution to this problem can be found by using the method of stars and bars, which gives us the number of ways to distribute n identical items into k different groups, with each group getting at least one item, as binom{n-1}{k-1}.However, in this case, since the objects (classes) are identical and the boxes (factories) are distinct, and we need to ensure that no factory is left empty, we use a slightly modified approach. We first assign one class to each factory to ensure that each factory has at least one class. This leaves us with 1 class to distribute freely among the 4 factories.The number of ways to distribute this remaining class among the 4 factories is simply the number of ways to choose 1 out of 4, which is binom{4}{1} = 4.But, this straightforward calculation does not account for the different permutations of distributing the initial 4 classes among the 4 factories, which also matters since the classes are considered identical in this context, but the factories are distinct. The correct approach is to use the Stirling numbers of the second kind, which count the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k non-empty subsets, and then multiply by k! to account for the permutations of these subsets (factories in our case).For our problem, this translates to finding the number of partitions of 5 classes into 4 non-empty groups (factories), which is a problem of distributing 5 identical items into 4 distinct boxes with no box empty. This is a classic problem in combinatorial mathematics, and the solution involves a bit more than the simple binomial coefficient calculation mentioned earlier.The correct calculation involves considering the different ways to achieve this distribution, taking into account the constraint that each factory must have at least one class. This can be done by considering the partitions of 5 that include 4 parts, which are essentially the ways to add up to 5 with 4 positive integers, considering that each integer represents the number of classes in a factory.After considering all possible distributions and the constraints, the total number of different arrangements is boxed{240}."},{"problem":"A certain product has a cost price of 200 yuan and a marked price of 300 yuan.

Thus, (1) becomes f(-x-y)=f(x)+(2 x+y) g(y) (3) and with x=0 to f(-y)=f(0)+y g(y) (4).Replacing f in (3) according to (4) yields after subtracting f(0):(x+y) g(x+y)=(2 x+y) g(y)-x g(-x) (5). With y=0 we get for x neq 0: g(x)+g(-x)=2 g(0) (6), which is also true for x=0, thus for all x in mathbb{R}.We set h(x):=g(x)-g(0).

For example, the number 8161 is special because:- none of its digits is zero;- the sum of all its digits is 8+1+6+1=16;- the double of its first digit is 8 times 2=16.a) Is there a special number with five digits that is even? Why or why not? If it exists, give an example.b) What is the smallest special number with four digits?c) What is the largest special number?d) What is the largest special number that has all distinct digits?","solution":"Solutiona) They exist. For example, the number 51112 is special, as zero does not appear among its digits, and, moreover, the double of its first digit is 2 times 5=10, equal to the sum of its digits, given by 5+1+1+1+2=10.b) The largest special number is 9111111111. No other number larger than it can be special, let's see why. If we have another special number also with 10 digits (9111111111 has 10 digits) larger than 9111111111, this number would have some different digit. The first digit 9 cannot be, because 9 is the largest digit. If any other is different, the sum of its digits would be greater than 18. Therefore, there is no 10-digit number larger than 9111111111.If a number has more than 10 digits, all different from zero, then the sum of its digits is greater than 10. Therefore, the sum of its digits cannot be double any digit. Thus, we conclude that 9111111111 is the largest special number.c) The smallest special number of four digits is 3111. No other number ABCD of four digits, smaller than it, could be special, because the sum of its last digits, A+B+C+D would be greater than or equal to 4. Therefore, the first digit A is greater than or equal to 2. If we had A=2, then we would have 2+B+C+D=4, and therefore B+C+D=2, which is impossible, as no digit is zero.d) Note that if two numbers have different quantities of digits, then the larger of them is always the one with more digits. Therefore, we will start by looking for the largest possible quantity of digits.Saying that double the first digit is equal to the sum of all the digits is the same as saying that the first digit is equal to the sum of the remaining digits. Since 1+2+3+4=10, no special number with all distinct digits can have five digits, as the sum of the last four would be greater than 9, the largest possible digit. Therefore, we can only look for special numbers with fewer than five digits.We will choose the first digit as the largest possible. Therefore, it must be 9. The three remaining digits must be distinct and sum to 9. Therefore, the number will be of the form 9BCD, with B+C+D=9. To make B as large as possible, we choose B=6 (if B is larger than this, there is no way to find C and D). Therefore, we will have C+D=3. Choosing C as the largest possible, we will have C=2 and thus D=1. Therefore, the largest special number with all distinct digits is 9621."},{"problem":"655.

Given that the ellipse is centered at the origin and its major axis is along the x-axis, the left vertex A_{1} is at (-a, 0) and the right vertex A_{2} is at (a, 0). The circle with diameter A_{1}A_{2} has its equation as x^{2}+ y^{2}= a^{2} because the diameter of the circle is the distance between A_{1} and A_{2}, which is 2a, and thus its radius is a. Given that this circle is tangent to the line bx-ay+2ab=0, we can find the distance from the center of the circle (which is the origin (0,0)) to this line. The formula for the distance from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}.

Since c^2 = a^2 - b^2, we substitute a^2 = 3b^2 into this equation to get:[c^2 = 3b^2 - b^2 = 2b^2]Therefore, c = bsqrt{2}. Substituting a^2 = 3b^2 into the eccentricity formula, we get:[e= frac{c}{a} = frac{bsqrt{2}}{sqrt{3b^2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{6}}{3}]Thus, the eccentricity of the ellipse C is boxed{frac{sqrt{6}}{3}}."},{"problem":"Xiao Hua loves playing soccer.

First, we need to evaluate the given integrals separately. Let's start with the first integral:   [   int_0^x frac{dtheta}{cos theta}   ]   We know that:   [   int sec theta , dtheta = ln|sec theta + tan theta| + C   ]   Therefore:   [   int_0^x frac{dtheta}{cos theta} = left[ ln|sec theta + tan theta| right]_0^x = ln|sec x + tan x| - ln|sec 0 + tan 0|   ]   Since (sec 0 = 1) and (tan 0 = 0):   [   int_0^x frac{dtheta}{cos theta} = ln|sec x + tan x| - ln 1 = ln|sec x + tan x|   ]2. Next, we evaluate the second integral:   [   int_x^{frac{pi}{2}} frac{dtheta}{sin theta}   ]   We know that:   [   int csc theta , dtheta = -ln|csc theta + cot theta| + C   ]   Therefore:   [   int_x^{frac{pi}{2}} frac{dtheta}{sin theta} = left[ -ln|csc theta + cot theta| right]_x^{frac{pi}{2}} = -ln|csc frac{pi}{2} + cot frac{pi}{2}| + ln|csc x + cot x|   ]   Since (csc frac{pi}{2} = 1) and (cot frac{pi}{2} = 0):   [   int_x^{frac{pi}{2}} frac{dtheta}{sin theta} = -ln 1 + ln|csc x + cot x| = ln|csc x + cot x|   ]3. Combining the results of the two integrals, we get:   [   f(x) = ln|sec x + tan x| + ln|csc x + cot x|   ]   Using the property of logarithms, we can combine the two logarithms:   [   f(x) = ln left( (sec x + tan x)(csc x + cot x) right)   ]4. To find the minimum value of (f(x)), we need to find the critical points by taking the derivative and setting it to zero:   [   frac{d}{dx} f(x) = frac{d}{dx} ln left( (sec x + tan x)(csc x + cot x) right)   ]   Using the chain rule:   [   frac{d}{dx} f(x) = frac{1}{(sec x + tan x)(csc x + cot x)} left( (sec x + tan x) frac{d}{dx} (csc x + cot x) + (csc x + cot x) frac{d}{dx} (sec x + tan x) right)   ]   We know:   [   frac{d}{dx} (sec x + tan x) = sec x tan x + sec^2 x   ]   and:   [   frac{d}{dx} (csc x + cot x) = -csc x cot x - csc^2 x   ]   Therefore:   [   frac{d}{dx} f(x) = frac{(sec x + tan x)(-csc x cot x - csc^2 x) + (csc x + cot x)(sec x tan x + sec^2 x)}{(sec x + tan x)(csc x + cot x)}   ]   Simplifying the numerator:   [   (sec x + tan x)(-csc x cot x - csc^2 x) + (csc x + cot x)(sec x tan x + sec^2 x) = 0   ]   This simplifies to:   [   frac{2(sin x - cos x)}{sin(2x)} = 0 Rightarrow sin x = cos x Rightarrow x = frac{pi}{4}   ]5. To confirm that this value is a minimum, we check the second derivative (f''(x)) at (x = frac{pi}{4}). Since (f''left(frac{pi}{4}right)) is positive, (x = frac{pi}{4}) is indeed a minimum.6. Finally, we evaluate (fleft(frac{pi}{4}right)):   [   fleft(frac{pi}{4}right) = lnleft(sec frac{pi}{4} + tan frac{pi}{4}right) + lnleft(csc frac{pi}{4} + cot frac{pi}{4}right)   ]   Since (sec frac{pi}{4} = csc frac{pi}{4} = sqrt{2}) and (tan frac{pi}{4} = cot frac{pi}{4} = 1):   [   fleft(frac{pi}{4}right) = lnleft(sqrt{2} + 1right) + lnleft(sqrt{2} + 1right) = 2 lnleft(sqrt{2} + 1right) = lnleft((sqrt{2} + 1)^2right) = lnleft(2 + 2sqrt{2} + 1right) = lnleft(3 + 2sqrt{2}right)   ]The final answer is (boxed{lnleft(3 + 2sqrt{2}right)})"},{"problem":"11.

Dividing both sides of the equation by cos Bcos C, we get tan B + tan C = 2tan Btan C.Also, we can express tan A as:tan A = -tan(pi - A) = -tan(B + C) = -frac{tan B + tan C}{1 - tan Btan C},and by multiplying both sides by tan Btan C, we obtain:tan Atan Btan C = -frac{tan B + tan C}{1 - tan Btan C}tan Btan C.Substituting tan B + tan C = 2tan Btan C into the above expression, we have:tan Atan Btan C = -frac{2(tan Btan C)^2}{1 - tan Btan C}.Let t = tan Btan C, where t > 1 because all angles A, B, and C are acute, and thus their tangents are positive. Now we can rewrite our expression as:tan Atan Btan C = -frac{2t^2}{1 - t} = -frac{2}{frac{1}{t^2} - frac{1}{t}}.The latter denominator can be expressed in terms of a square minus a constant:frac{1}{t^2} - frac{1}{t} = left( frac{1}{t} - frac{1}{2} right)^2 - frac{1}{4}.Since t > 1, we have -frac{1}{4} leq frac{1}{t^2} - frac{1}{t} < 0, thus the minimum value of tan Atan Btan C = -frac{2}{text{denominator}} is achieved when frac{1}{t^2} - frac{1}{t} = -frac{1}{4}.

Since the tangent line is perpendicular to the line 2x - 6y + 1 = 0, its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line, which is frac{2}{6} = frac{1}{3}. Therefore, the slope of the tangent line must be -frac{1}{3}'s negative reciprocal, or -3.To find the x-coordinate of the tangency point, set f'(x_0) = -3: 3x_0^2 + 6x_0 = -3. Divide the entire equation by 3: x_0^2 + 2x_0 = -1. Factoring the left-hand side, we find: (x_0 + 1)^2 = 0. Thus, x_0 = -1.To find y_0, we plug x_0 into the equation of the curve: y_0 = (-1)^3 + 3(-1)^2 - 1 = -1 + 3 - 1 = 1. This gives us the point of tangency (x_0, y_0) = (-1, 1).With the slope of the tangent line and the point of tangency, we can write the equation of the tangent line using the point-slope form: y - y_0 = m(x - x_0), where m is the slope and (x_0, y_0) is the point of tangency.

In many functional equations, it is such a \\"outer\\" surjective function (here x rightarrow f(0)-6 x) that allows us to show that f is surjective.If there exist a>b such that f(a)=f(b), then by writing the equation successively with y=a and y=b, f(f(x)+2 a)=f(f(x)+2 b) for all x, so by the surjectivity of f, f(z)=f(z+2 a-2 b) for all real z, so f is 2(a-b) periodic.Let's use the non-periodicity of the function x mapsto 6 x to show that this is absurd: by writing the equation twice with x=0 (for example) and x=2(a-b), we get 2(a-b)=0.Therefore, f is injective. By taking x=0 in the equation, we get f(y)=2 y+f(0) for all real y.

Apply (1) to the pairs (u, v) and (2-u, 2-v) :g(1+u v)-g(1)=(g(u)-1)(g(v)-1), quad g(3+u v)-g(3)=(g(2-u)-1)(g(2-v)-1) .Observe that the last two equations have equal right-hand sides by (3).

From this time, a number of mathematical treatises (by Euclid, Archimedes, and Apollonius) have survived to the present day. Our knowledge of the preceding period is based primarily on reports from later authors, which are not always reliable. Following the period of prosperity, there was a decline in Greek mathematics, which was due to the decline of Greek culture as a whole. Although significant works in mathematics continued to appear until the 6th century AD, none of them could compare with the works of the Alexandrian period in terms of content or rigor of exposition.Greek mathematicians brought the logical construction of mathematics, especially geometry, to a high level of perfection. It was not until the 19th century that this logical construction was raised to a higher level. The Greeks brought trigonometry (primarily spherical, the development of which was driven by the needs of astronomy) to a high level of perfection. Theoretical mechanics (particularly statics, hydrostatics, and the theory of machines) was developed using rigorous mathematical methods. The Greeks achieved significant success in solving problems that are now part of higher mathematics (integral calculus). Here, methods were created that were forgotten in later times and only re-emerged in the 17th century among Western European mathematicians.We also find a well-developed theory of conic sections among the Greeks, which in terms of factual material is little different from the modern one.The Greeks laid the foundations of algebraic methods; however, although they solved a number of difficult problems in this area, they did not develop a method as advanced as in the aforementioned fields.The name of Pythagoras (6th century BC) is associated with a number of unreliable reports. In particular, the so-called \\"Pythagorean theorem\\" was undoubtedly known to the peoples of the ancient East, from whom the Greeks could have borrowed both the theorem and its proof."},{"problem":"1.

Under what condition does there exist an integer k such that k^{2} equiv-1 (bmod p) ?","solution":"Finding a necessary and sufficient condition requires mathematical tools that you do not have, but you can at least find a necessary condition. If k^{2} equiv -1 pmod{p}, then k^{4} equiv 1 pmod{p}, so the order of k - the smallest exponent n such that k^n equiv 1 pmod{p} - divides 4. If -1 neq 1 pmod{p}, therefore if p neq 2 (for p=2, the condition is satisfied), this order is not 2 because k^{2} equiv -1 pmod{p}, and it is certainly not 1 because if k equiv 1 pmod{p}, we would have k^{2} equiv 1 pmod{p}, so it is necessarily 4. Any other n such that k^n equiv 1 pmod{p} is divisible by the order 4 of k: otherwise, we would have n = 4k + r with 0 leq r < 4 and k^r equiv 1 pmod{p}, which would contradict the minimality. Furthermore, by Fermat's theorem, since k is not divisible by p (otherwise we would have k^{2} equiv 0 pmod{p}), k^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p}, which implies that p-1 is divisible by 4. A necessary condition is therefore that p=2 or p equiv 1 pmod{4}.Let's give an overview of the proof that this condition is sufficient. We work in the set of congruence classes modulo p: a and b are in the same class if a equiv b pmod{p}. This set of classes, mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z}, is equipped with addition and multiplication, because if a equiv b pmod{p} and a' equiv b' pmod{p}, then a + a' equiv b + b' pmod{p} and aa' equiv bb' pmod{p}. The elements k and -k have the same square: the \\"perfect squares\\" (we call them: quadratic residues) of mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z} are therefore 0 and at most half of the other p-1 elements. In reality, it is exactly half of the other p-1 elements, and a given integer, for example -1, has \\"a one in two chance\\" of being a quadratic residue (for about half of the prime numbers, -1 is a quadratic residue). Because - and this is where it would be appropriate to delve deeper - the equation x^2 = a cannot have more than two distinct roots, and more generally a polynomial of degree d cannot have more than d distinct roots, just as in the set of reals, for example. However, in mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z}, the equation x^{p-1} = 1 has p-1 distinct roots: all the non-zero elements of mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z}. If p is odd and x is non-zero, x^{frac{p-1}{2}} has a square of 1, so it is equal to either 1 or -1. If x is a quadratic residue, there exists y such that y^2 = x, so x^{frac{p-1}{2}} = y^{p-1} = 1: all quadratic residues are roots of x^{frac{p-1}{2}} = 1. But since there are frac{p-1}{2} quadratic residues, and this equation of degree frac{p-1}{2} cannot have more than frac{p-1}{2} roots, all its roots are quadratic residues. Therefore, if (-1)^{frac{p-1}{2}} = 1, -1 is a quadratic residue. If p equiv 1 pmod{4}, (-1)^{frac{p-1}{2}} = 1, hence the result."},{"problem":"Given cos (frac{π}{12}-θ)=frac{1}{3}, find sin (2θ+frac{π}{3})=______.","solution":"Since cos (frac{π}{12}-θ)=frac{1}{3},We have cos (frac{π}{6}-2θ)=2cos ^{2}(frac{π}{12}-θ)-1=2times frac{1}{9}-1=-frac{7}{9},Then sin (2θ+frac{π}{3})=sin [frac{π}{2}-(frac{π}{6}-2θ)]=cos (frac{π}{6}-2θ)=-frac{7}{9}.Therefore, the answer is boxed{-frac{7}{9}}.This problem requires finding the value of cos (frac{π}{6}-2θ) from the given information and then using the cofunction identity to find the value of sin (2θ+frac{π}{3}).

In his annotation of \\"Circular Fields in The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\\", he proved the precise formula for the area of a circle using the method of 'Exhausting the Circle'. This method involves inscribing a regular polygon within a circle and gradually increasing the number of sides of the polygon until its perimeter closely approximates the circumference of the circle, thus deriving a more accurate value for pi (π, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter). Liu Hui started his calculation of π with a regular hexagon. It is known that the regular hexagon inscribed within a circle can be divided into six equilateral triangles, each with a side length equal to the radius (R) of the circle. At this point, the perimeter of the inscribed regular hexagon is 6R, which, if considered equal to the circle's circumference, would yield a value of 3 for π.

The perimeter of the regular 24-gon is 24S, which is also the approximated circumference of the circle:   24S ≈ 2πR4. Substituting the value of S, we get:   24(0.26R) ≈ 2πR5.

What is this number?b) What is the largest number without the digit 0 that can appear in the collection?c) What is the largest number without repeated digits that can appear in the collection?","solution":"Solutiona) There are only three ways to write 1 as the sum of three natural numbers: 1=1+0+0, 1=0+1+0, and 1=0+0+1, which give us the possibilities 1001, 0101, and 0011. The numbers 0101 and 0011 must be discarded because they do not have four significant digits. Therefore, in Joãozinho's collection, the number 1001 appears.b) First, we note that if a number with non-zero digits is in the collection, then it has at most 10 digits. Indeed, if it had 11 or more non-zero digits, then the sum of all its digits, except the units digit, would be at least 10, which is not possible since the largest digit is 9. Therefore, all numbers with non-zero digits in the collection have at most 10 digits, which shows that there is a largest number without the digit 0 in the collection. Let's assume that Joãozinho's collection is complete. The number 2316 is in the collection; by replacing the 3 with 111, we get 211116, which is also in the collection and is larger than 2316 because it has more digits. In general, if a number without the digit 0 is in the collection and has a digit other than the units digit that is not 1, we can \\"stretch\\" the number by replacing that digit with a sequence of 1's, obtaining a new number that is in the collection and is larger than the first. Therefore, the largest number with non-zero digits in the collection must have all its digits equal to 1, except for the units digit, which is equal to the number of 1's preceding it. Since the largest possible units digit is 9, it follows that the number we are looking for is 1111111119.We note that the collection can have arbitrarily large numbers with the digit 0, such as (for example) 101, 1001, 10001, and so on.c) A number in the collection cannot have six distinct digits, because in that case the sum of the five digits to the left of the units digit would be at least 0+1+2+3+4=10. On the other hand, the collection can have numbers with five distinct digits, such as, for example, 25108. If one of these numbers has a units digit different from 9, we can \\"increase\\" it by adding 1 to the units digit and 1 to the ten-thousands digit (which clearly cannot be 9), without leaving the collection. For example, the number 43108 can be \\"increased\\" to 53109, which is also in the collection. Therefore, the largest number with five distinct digits in the collection must have 9 as the units digit. It is now sufficient to write 9 as the sum of four distinct terms in descending order to \\"build\\" our number; it follows immediately that the desired decomposition is 9=6+2+1+0 and we obtain the number 62109."},{"problem":"B1.

How many children did not receive any candies?","solution":"Answer: 36.Solution. Let's number the children clockwise from 0 to 72. Initially, Santa Claus gives a candy to the child with number 1.Consider the sequence of numbers a_{n}=1+2+3+ldots+n, where n=1,2,3, ldots, 2020. Notice that the n-th candy is given to the child whose number is the remainder of the division of a_{n} by 73. We need to determine how many different remainders there are among these.Consider the difference a_{k}-a_{l} (for k geqslant l). This is the sum of an arithmetic progression:a_{k}-a_{l}=(l+1)+(l+2)+ldots+k=frac{1}{2}(k+l+1)(k-l)The remainders of the division of a_{k} and a_{l} by 73 will coincide if this difference is divisible by 73. Since 73 is a prime number, either k-l or k+l+1 must be divisible by 73.First, note that all candies starting from the 74th will go to the children who have already received them in previous steps, since k-(k-73) is divisible by 73, and therefore the numbers a_{k} and a_{k-73} give the same remainders when divided by 73. Thus, it is sufficient to consider a_{k} for k=1, ldots, 73.For different natural numbers k and l, not exceeding 73, the difference k-l will not be divisible by 73. For the sum k+l+1 to be divisible by 73, it must be either 73 or 2 cdot 73. In the first case, we get l=72-k, where k=1, ldots, 71 and k neq 36, and in the second case only k=72 and l=73 (and vice versa).This means that the same remainders will be in pairs left(a_{1}, a_{71}right),left(a_{2}, a_{70}right), ldots,left(a_{35}, a_{37}right),left(a_{72}, a_{73}right). The remainders between the pairs are different (and also different from the number a_{36}). In total, there are 37 different remainders.Thus, among the 73 children, only 37 will receive candies. Therefore, 36 children will be left without candies.## 10th grade"},{"problem":"Given 2x-y=4.

Understanding the Problem:   We are given a point ( O ) and a sequence of points ( P_1, P_2, P_3, ldots ) in the plane. The distances from ( O ) to ( P_n ) are denoted by ( r_n ). We are also given that for every ( n ), the distance from ( P_n ) to any other point in the sequence is at least ( r_n^alpha ), where ( 0 < alpha < 1 ). We need to determine the largest possible exponent ( beta ) such that ( r_n geq Cn^beta ) for some constant ( C ) independent of ( n ).2. Assumption and Condition:   We assume the additional condition ( r_1 leq r_2 leq r_3 leq cdots ) as mentioned in the IMO Compendium. This condition ensures that the sequence ( r_n ) is non-decreasing.3. Analyzing the Distance Condition:   The condition that the distance from ( P_n ) to any other point in the sequence is at least ( r_n^alpha ) implies that the points ( P_n ) are spread out in the plane. Specifically, for any ( m neq n ), the distance ( P_nP_m geq r_n^alpha ).4. Bounding ( r_n ):   To find the largest possible ( beta ), we need to analyze how ( r_n ) grows with ( n ). We use the fact that the points ( P_n ) are spread out and the distances ( r_n ) are non-decreasing.5. Using the Distance Condition:   Consider the circle of radius ( r_n^alpha ) centered at ( P_n ). No other point ( P_m ) (for ( m neq n )) can lie within this circle. This implies that the area around each point ( P_n ) is essentially \\"forbidden\\" for other points.6. Estimating the Growth of ( r_n ):   The area of the circle with radius ( r_n^alpha ) is ( pi (r_n^alpha)^2 = pi r_n^{2alpha} ). Since the points are spread out, the total area covered by ( n ) such circles should be proportional to the area of a larger circle with radius ( r_n ). Thus, we have:   [   n cdot pi r_n^{2alpha} leq pi r_n^2   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   n leq r_n^{2 - 2alpha}   ]   Taking the logarithm on both sides, we get:   [   log n leq (2 - 2alpha) log r_n   ]   Solving for ( r_n ), we get:   [   r_n geq n^{frac{1}{2 - 2alpha}}   ]7. Determining ( beta ):   Comparing this with ( r_n geq Cn^beta ), we see that:   [   beta = frac{1}{2 - 2alpha}   ]8.

Since 1+cdots+9=45, the sum of each row is 15.Since all rows play the same role, it suffices to count the number of grids such that the 9 is on the first row, and then multiply by 3. By reasoning similarly on the columns, we can assume that the 9 is in the top left corner, and we will multiply the number of grids found by 9.Since 6=1+5=2+4, either the 1 and the 5 are on the same row (and then the 2 and the 4 on the same column) as the 9, or it is the reverse. Therefore, the number of grids with a 9 in the top left corner is equal to 8 times the number of grids of the formleft(begin{array}{lll}9 & 1 & 5 2 & * & * 4 & * & *end{array}right)It is easily verified that there is only one solution, and thus the answer is 9 times 8=72."},{"problem":"5.

In the end, it is seen that for any pair of students which have played a match versus each other, at least one of them has played at most 22 matches. What is the maximum possible number of matches in this event?","solution":"To solve this problem, we will use graph theory. We can represent the students as vertices in a graph, and each match between two students as an edge between two vertices. The problem states that for any pair of students who have played a match, at least one of them has played at most 22 matches. This means that in the graph, for any edge, at least one of the vertices connected by that edge has a degree of at most 22.1. Graph Interpretation:   Let ( G = (V, E) ) be a graph where ( V ) represents the 2017 students and ( E ) represents the matches played. We need to find the maximum number of edges ( |E| ) in ( G ) under the given condition.2. Define Sets ( A ) and ( B ):   Let ( A ) be the set of vertices with degree greater than 22, and ( B ) be the set of vertices with degree at most 22. Clearly, ( A cup B = V ) and ( A cap B = emptyset ).3. Case 1: ( |A| > 22 ):   - Since each vertex in ( A ) has a degree greater than 22, there are no edges between vertices in ( A ) (otherwise, both vertices would have a degree greater than 22, violating the condition).   - Therefore, all edges must be between vertices in ( A ) and vertices in ( B ), or within ( B ).   - The maximum number of edges is then bounded by the number of edges between ( A ) and ( B ), plus the number of edges within ( B ).   - The number of edges between ( A ) and ( B ) is at most ( |A| cdot (2017 - |A|) ).   - Since ( |A| > 22 ), the number of edges is maximized when ( |A| ) is as large as possible, but still less than 2017. The maximum occurs when ( |A| = 1995 ) (since ( 2017 - 22 = 1995 )).   - Thus, the number of edges is at most ( 1995 cdot 22 = 43890 ).4. Case 2: ( |A| leq 22 ):   - In this case, we can assume that the graph with the maximum number of edges contains all possible edges between ( A ) and ( B ).   - The number of edges between ( A ) and ( B ) is ( |A| cdot (2017 - |A|) ).   - Additionally, the number of edges within ( B ) is at most ( frac{(2017 - |A|)(2017 - |A| - 1)}{2} ).   - To maximize the number of edges, we need to maximize ( |A| cdot (2017 - |A|) ). This is maximized when ( |A| = 22 ).   - Therefore, the number of edges is ( 22 cdot (2017 - 22) = 22 cdot 1995 = 43890 ).In both cases, the maximum number of edges is 43890.The final answer is ( boxed{43890} )."},{"problem":"At the beginning of the game \\"Clock 7 \\", the arrow points to one of the seven numbers.

Use proof by contradiction.Assume there exist 15 subsets of X such that the union of any 7 of them contains at least 41 elements, and the intersection of any 3 of them is empty. Since each element belongs to at most 2 subsets, we can assume each element belongs to exactly 2 subsets (otherwise, add some elements to some subsets, and the conditions still hold). By the pigeonhole principle, there must be a subset, say A, containing at least left[frac{2 times 56}{15}right]+1=8 elements. Let the other 14 subsets be A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{14}. Consider any 7 subsets that do not include A, each corresponding to 41 elements in X. All 7-subset groups that do not include A together contain at least 41 C_{14}^{7} elements. Additionally, for an element a, if a notin A, then 2 of A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{14} contain a. Hence, a is counted mathrm{C}_{14}^{7}-mathrm{C}_{12}^{7} times. If a in A, then 1 of A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{14} contains a. Hence, a is counted mathrm{C}_{14}^{7}-mathrm{C}_{13}^{7} times.

Now the right hand side of (*) is congruent to 4 or 28 modulo p, which gives us p=3. Consequently 3^{q}+1 mid 6244, which is only possible for q=3.

Since 100=37 times 3-11 and 1000=37 times 30-110=37 times 27+1, we have 1000000=1000^{2}=37 times (37 times 27^{2}+2 times 27)+1 (by double distributivity).Since 37 divides N, 37 also divides 300070003+x-11 y. By performing the Euclidean division of 300070003 by 37, we find that 300070003=37 times 8110000+3.In short, 37 divides N if and only if it divides 3+x-11 y, which is an integer between 12 (if x=9 and y=0) and -96 (if x=0 and y=9).

According to the definition of a unimodal function, f(x) is monotonically increasing on [0,x^*] and monotonically decreasing on [x^*,1].  When f(x_1) geq f(x_2), assume x^* notin (0,x_2). Then x_1  f(x_1), contradicting f(x_1) geq f(x_2). Therefore, x^* in (0,x_2), i.e., (0,x_2) is a peak interval.  When f(x_1) leq f(x_2), assume x^* notin (x_1,1). Then x^* leq x_1  f(x_2), contradicting f(x_1) leq f(x_2). Therefore, x^* in (x_1,1), i.e., (x_1,1) is a peak interval.

Determine the range of digits:   - Since ( N ) is a 3-digit number, ( 100 leq N < 1000 ).   - The factorial of a digit ( d ) is denoted as ( d! ).   - The maximum value for ( a, b, ) and ( c ) is 9, but we need to check the feasibility of each digit.2. Check the upper limit for factorial sums:   - The factorial of 9 is ( 9! = 362880 ).   - For a 3-digit number, the sum of the factorials of its digits must be less than 1000.   - Therefore, ( a, b, ) and ( c ) must be such that ( a! + b! + c! < 1000 ).3.

Check each combination of digits:   - We need to check if ( N = 100a + 10b + c ) is equal to ( a! + b! + c! ).5. Case analysis:   - For ( a = 1 ):     - ( N = 100 + 10b + c )     - Check if ( 100 + 10b + c = 1! + b! + c! )     - For ( b = 4 ) and ( c = 5 ):       [       100 + 40 + 5 = 145       ]       [       1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145       ]       - Therefore, ( 145 ) is a factorion.6.

Transforming h(x):   Let t = sin x + cos x, then sin xcos x = t^2 - 1, and t in [1, sqrt{2}].

Comparing g(x) and h(x):   To satisfy g(x_2) geq h(x_1), it is sufficient to have 2k+1 geq frac{109}{100}. Solving this inequality for k gives k geq frac{9}{200}.Combining this with the condition from part 1, the final range for k is:[k in left[frac{9}{200}, frac{1}{4}right)]Therefore, the range of the real number k that satisfies both conditions is boxed{left[frac{9}{200}, frac{1}{4}right)}."},{"problem":"3.

Since there are 77 nodes in total in the grid, the length of the broken line is at most 76.

Another reasoning is possible. Let's start constructing a closed broken line from some node. Since we need to return to it, the number of horizontal steps to the right is the same as the number of steps to the left. Therefore, the number of horizontal steps is even. The same is true for vertical steps.

Recall the properties of combination numbers:   The given expression is {7^{n}}+C_{n}^{1}{{7}^{n-1}}+C_{n}^{2}{{7}^{n-2}}+ cdots +C_{n}^{n-1}7.2. Observe that the expression resembles the expansion of a binomial. We can rewrite it as follows:   {7^{n}}+C_{n}^{1}{{7}^{n-1}}+C_{n}^{2}{{7}^{n-2}}+ cdots +C_{n}^{n-1}7 = (7+1)^n - 1 = 8^n - 1.3. Since n is an odd number, we can express 8^n as (9-1)^n:   8^n - 1 = (9-1)^n - 1.4. Using the binomial theorem to expand (9-1)^n, we get:   (9-1)^n - 1 = 9^n + C_{n}^{1}9^{n-1}(-1) + C_{n}^{2}9^{n-2}(-1)^2 + cdots + C_{n}^{n-1}9^{1}(-1)^{n-1} - 1.5. Notice that each term in the expanded form contains a factor of 9, which means they are all divisible by 9. The only exception is the last term, -1.6. Therefore, when the expression 8^n - 1 is divided by 9, the remainder is the same as when -1 is divided by 9. However, we need to adjust the remainder to a positive value less than 9. To do this, we can add 9 to -1, which gives us 8.7. However, the problem's expression is {7^{n}}+C_{n}^{1}{{7}^{n-1}}+C_{n}^{2}{{7}^{n-2}}+ cdots +C_{n}^{n-1}7 = 8^n - 1, not 8^n. Therefore, we need to subtract 1 from our remainder of 8. This gives us a final remainder of 7.Hence, the remainder when {7^{n}}+C_{n}^{1}{{7}^{n-1}}+C_{n}^{2}{{7}^{n-2}}+ cdots +C_{n}^{n-1}7 is divided by 9 is boxed{7}."},{"problem":"Example 6 Let f: mathbf{R} rightarrow mathbf{R}, and for any x, y in mathbf{R} we havebegin{array}{l}f(x+y)+f(x-y)+f(2 x) =4 f(x) fleft(frac{x+y}{2}right) fleft(frac{y-x}{2}right)-1 .end{array}Given f(1)=0.(1) Prove: f(x) is an even periodic function;(2) Find f(2005) and f(2006).","solution":"(1) Proof For equation (1), let x=y=0, we getf(0)=1 or f(0)=-frac{1}{2}.Let x=y, then2 f(2 x)+f(0)=4 f(0) f^{2}(x)-1.If f(0)=-frac{1}{2}, let x=frac{1}{2}, thenf(2 x)=-f^{2}(x)-frac{1}{4}<0 Rightarrow f(1)<0,which is a contradiction.Therefore, it can only be f(0)=1.In equation (1), let y=-x, we getbegin{array}{l}f(x)=2 fleft(frac{x}{2}right) fleft(-frac{x}{2}right)-1 Rightarrow f(x)=f(-x)end{array}Rightarrow f(x) is an even function.In equation (1), let x=1, we getf(1+y)+f(1-y)+f(2)=-1 text {. }Taking y=1, we get f(2)=-1.Thus, f(1+y)+f(1-y)=0.From this, we deduce that f(x) is a periodic function with a period of 4.(2) Solution Since f(x) is an even function, we havef(1+y)=-f(1-y)=-f(y-1) text {. }Let y+1=x.

The two lines 2x - y + 4 = 0 and 2x - y - 6 = 0 are parallel, as they have the same normal vector (2, -1). A circle that is tangent to two parallel lines will have its center on the line that is equidistant from both tangents.To identify the center (a, 1), we substitute 1 for y in the equation of the center line 2x - y - 1 = 0, leading to: 2a - 1 - 1 = 0 Rightarrow 2a = 2 Rightarrow a = 1 This gives us the center of the circle, (1, 1).The radius r of the circle is equal to the distance from the center to either of the two lines.

The red balls can then be drawn from the urn in binom{101}{3} different ways, and these cases can occur with equal probability.If the second red ball is drawn at the k-th position (1<k<100), then among the k-1 balls drawn before it and the 101-k balls drawn after it, there is one red ball each. This means that the positions of the first and third red balls can be determined in (k-1) cdot(101-k) ways, which is exactly the number of cases in which the second red ball can end up in the k-th position.The probability in question will therefore be maximal for the value of k where the product (k-1) cdot(101-k) is the largest.

Then, the B plot has 3 choices, let's say b; the C plot can choose from a, c, d, and so on. By the time we reach the E plot, there are still 3 choices. However, the choice for the F plot depends on whether the plants in the A and E plots are the same. If the plants in the A and E plots are the same, say a, then the F plot can choose from b, c, d, which gives C_{3}^{1} ways; if the plants in the A and E plots are different, say a, b, then the F plot can only choose from c, d, which gives C_{2}^{1} ways.Next, let's examine the probability that the plants in the A and E plots are the same. According to the principle that the sum of the probabilities of complementary events is 1, and the probability of two independent events occurring simultaneously is the product of the probabilities of each event. For this problem, if the plant in the A plot is a, then the probability of the B plot being a is 0. The probability of the C plot being a is frac{1}{3}. According to the problem's restrictions, the probability of the D plot being a is left(1-frac{1}{3}right) times frac{1}{3}=frac{2}{9}, and so on, the probability of the E plot being a is left(1-frac{2}{9}right) times frac{1}{3}=frac{7}{27}. Correspondingly, the probability of the plants in the E and A plots being different is 1-frac{7}{27}=frac{20}{27}.

Therefore, ( f(0) = 2 ).Substituting ( y = 1 ), we get ( 2 f(x + 1) = f(x) cdot f(1) ), which means ( f(x + 1) = 5 f(x) ). From this, for any natural number ( n ), we find ( f(n) = f(0) 5^{n} = 2 cdot 5^{n} ).It is also easy to prove by induction the formula ( fleft(x_{1} + x_{2} + ldots + x_{n}right) = frac{1}{2^{n-1}} fleft(x_{1}right) fleft(x_{2}right) ldots fleft(x_{n}right) ), from which, in particular, ( f(1) = fleft(frac{1}{n} + ldots + frac{1}{n}right) = frac{1}{2^{n-1}} left(fleft(frac{1}{n}right)right)^{n} ). Thus, ( fleft(frac{1}{n}right)^{n} = 5 cdot 2^{n} ), from which ( fleft(frac{1}{n}right) = 2 cdot 5^{frac{1}{n}} ) for all natural numbers ( n ).From this, ( fleft(frac{m}{n}right) = fleft(frac{1}{n} + ldots + frac{1}{n}right) = frac{1}{2^{m-1}} left(fleft(frac{1}{n}right)right)^{m} = frac{1}{2^{m-1}} 2^{m} cdot 5^{frac{m}{n}} = 2 cdot 5^{frac{m}{n}} ) for natural numbers ( m ) and ( n ).Now let's consider negative fractions: ( 2 f(0) = 2 fleft(frac{m}{n} - frac{m}{n}right) = fleft(frac{m}{n}right) fleft(-frac{m}{n}right) ), from which ( fleft(-frac{m}{n}right) = 2 cdot 5^{-frac{m}{n}} ).Thus, the function ( f(x) = 2 cdot 5^{x} ) for all rational numbers.

If we denote this problem as left{k_{1}, k_{2}, cdots, k_{n}right}_{m}, we want to ask: For the problem {1,2,3, cdots, n}_{3}, for what value of n does A (the first player) have a winning strategy?","solution":"26. First, prove the following lemmas:Lemma 1 For the problem left{k_{1}right}_{3}, player B has a winning strategy if and only if 4 mid k_{1}.Proof of Lemma 1 If 4 mid k_{1}, when k_{1}=4, if player A takes r balls (1 leqslant r leqslant 3), then player B takes 4-r balls to win; when k_{1}>4, if player A takes r balls, then player B takes 4-r balls, leaving the remaining number of balls as a multiple of 4. This continues, ensuring that player B will win. If k_{1}=4 r+s(1 leqslant s leqslant 3), then player A first takes s balls, making the remaining number of balls 0 (when r=0, thus player A wins) or still a multiple of 4. From the above analysis, it is clear that player A will eventually win.Lemma 2 For the problem left{k_{1}, k_{2}right}_{3}left(k_{1} leqslant k_{2}right), player B has a winning strategy if and only if 4 mid k_{2}-k_{1}.Proof of Lemma 2 When 4 mid k_{2}-k_{1}, if each turn of taking balls by player A and player B is considered as one step, then player B just needs to ensure that after each step, the remainder of the number of balls in both pockets when divided by 4 is the same. This way, as long as player A has balls to take, player B will also have balls to take, thus ensuring that player B takes the last ball and wins. If 4 nmid k_{2}-k_{1}, let k_{1}=4 q_{1}+r_{1}, k_{2}=4 q_{2}+r_{2}left(0 leqslant r_{1}, r_{2} leqslant 3right), then there must be r_{1} neq r_{2}. Without loss of generality, assume r_{1}<r_{2}, then player A first takes r_{2}-r_{1} balls from the second pocket, making the difference in the number of balls in the two pockets divisible by 4. From the previous analysis, it is clear that player A has a winning strategy.Lemma 3 If for the problem left{k_{1}, k_{2}, cdots, k_{n}right}_{3}, player B has a winning strategy, and for the problem left{lambda_{1}, lambda_{2}, cdots lambda_{m}right}_{3}, player B also has a winning strategy, then for the problem left{k_{1}, cdots, k_{n}, lambda_{1}, cdots, lambda_{m}right}_{3}, player B has a winning strategy.Proof of Lemma 3 Player B can divide the problem left{k_{1}, k_{2}, cdots, k_{n}, lambda_{1}, lambda_{2}, cdots, lambda_{m}right}_{3} into two groups, with the number of balls being k_{1}, k_{2}, cdots, k_{n} in the first group, and lambda_{1}, cdots, lambda_{m} in the second group. Player B adopts a winning strategy in each group, combining them into a winning strategy for the problem left{k_{1}, k_{2}, cdots, k_{n}, lambda_{1}, cdots, lambda_{m}right}_{3}.Lemma 4 If for the problem left{k_{1}, k_{2}, cdots, k_{n}right}_{3}, player A has a winning strategy, and for the problem left{lambda_{1}, cdots, lambda_{m}right}_{3}, player B has a winning strategy, then for the problem left{k_{1}, k_{2}, cdots, k_{n}, lambda_{1}, lambda_{2}, cdots, lambda_{m}right}_{3}, player A has a winning strategy.Proof of Lemma 4 Player A can divide the pockets into two groups, with the number of balls being k_{1}, k_{2}, cdots, k_{n} in the first group, and the rest in the second group. Player A adopts a winning strategy in the first group and a winning strategy for player B in the second group, combining them into a winning strategy for the problem left{k_{1}, k_{2}, cdots, k_{n}, lambda_{1}, cdots, lambda_{m}right}_{3}.Returning to the problem {1,2, cdots, n}_{3}, when n=1,2, by Lemmas 1 and 2, player A has a winning strategy; when n=3, player B can always ensure that after the first step (i.e., after player A and player B each take one turn), only two pockets have balls, and the number of balls in these two pockets is the same. Thus, by Lemma 2, player B has a winning strategy at this point; when n=4, because for the problems {1,2,3}_{3} and {4}_{3}, player B has a winning strategy, by Lemma 3, for the problem {1,2,3,4}_{3}, player B has a winning strategy. Also, when k=1,2,3, cdots, for the problem {4 k+1,4 k+2,4 k+3,4 k+4}_{3}, player B always has a winning strategy. This is because, when player A takes r balls from a pocket with more than 4 balls, player B takes 4-r balls from the same pocket, ensuring that the remainder of the number of balls in each pocket when divided by 4 remains unchanged. If player A takes balls from a pocket with no more than 4 balls, player B can adopt the winning strategy for the problem {1,2,3,4}_{3}. Therefore, the strategy for the problem {4 k+1,4 k+2,4 k+3,4 k+4}_{3} is the same as for the problem {1,2,3,4}_{3}. Since for the problem {1,2,3,4}_{3}, player B has a winning strategy, for the problem {4 k+1,4 k+2,4 k+3,4 k+4}_{3}, player B has a winning strategy.From the above, we can conclude: (1) When n=4 k(k geqslant 1), player B has a winning strategy, because at this time, the pockets can be grouped into sets of 4 pockets in order of the number of balls, and for each set, player B has a winning strategy. By Lemma 3, for the problem left{1,2,3,4, cdots, 4 k-3,4 k-2,4 k-1,4 kright}_{3}, player B has a winning strategy; (2) When n=4 k+1(k geqslant 0), player A has a winning strategy, because when k=0, it has been proven that player A has a winning strategy, and when k geqslant 1, it has been proven that for the problem {1,2, cdots, 4 k}_{3}, player B has a winning strategy, and by Lemma 1, for the problem {4 k+1}_{3}, player A has a winning strategy. Therefore, by Lemma 4, for the problem {1,2, cdots, 4 k, 4 k+1}, player A has a winning strategy; (3) When n=4 k+2(k geqslant 0), player A has a winning strategy, because when k=0, it has been proven that player A has a winning strategy, and when k geqslant 1, it has been proven that for the problem {1,2, cdots, 4 k}_{3}, player B has a winning strategy, and by Lemma 2, for the problem {4 k+1,4 k+2}, player A has a winning strategy. Therefore, by Lemma 4, for the problem {1,2, cdots, 4 k, 4 k+1,4 k+2}, player A has a winning strategy; (4) When n=4 k+3, player B has a winning strategy, because when k=0, it has been proven that player B has a winning strategy, and when k geqslant 1, if for the problem {1,2, cdots, 4 k+3}_{3}, player A has a winning strategy, and for the problem {4 k+4}_{3}, player B has a winning strategy, then by Lemma 3, for the problem {1,2, cdots, 4 k+3,4 k+4}_{3}, player A has a winning strategy, which contradicts the conclusion already proven in (1). Therefore, for the problem {1,2, cdots, 4 k+3}_{3}, player B has a winning strategy. In summary, when n equiv 1,2(bmod 4), player A has a winning strategy; when n equiv 0,3(bmod 4), player B has a winning strategy."},{"problem":"The solution set of the inequality ax^2 + bx + c > 0 is (-infty, -2) cup (-1, +infty).

Let the common tangent touch the first parabola at a point whose x-coordinate is x_{1}, and the second parabola at a point whose x-coordinate is x_{2}. The derivative of the equation of the first parabola at the point x_{1} is 2 x_{1}+3, which is the slope of the tangent at x_{1}, and similarly, by considering the second parabola, we get that the slope of the tangent is 2 x_{2}+5. If the common tangent has the equation y=k x+n, then from the above we have 2 x_{1}+3=2 x_{2}+5=k, and from there x_{1}=x_{2}+1. Further, since the points of tangency lie on both the tangent and the first and second parabolas, by considering the y-coordinates we get left(2 x_{1}+3right) x_{1}+n=x_{1}^{2}+3 x_{1}+6 and left(2 x_{2}+5right) x_{2}+n=x_{2}^{2}+5 x_{2}+3, from which it follows thatn=6-x_{1}^{2}=3-x_{2}^{2}, i.e., x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}=3.

Below, we prove that this is indeed the case.The proof requires several steps. The first point is to consider the smallest prime divisor p of n, and from n mid (2^n + 1), derive that p=3, as seen in Example 1 of Unit 8. Therefore, we can assumen=3^m c, quad m geqslant 1, quad 3 nmid c.The second step is to prove that m=1. From n^2 mid (2^n + 1), we get 2^{3^m c} equiv -1 pmod{3^{2m}}, hence2^{2 times 3^m c} equiv 1 pmod{3^{2m}}.If m geqslant 2, then by Example 5 of Unit 8, the order of 2 modulo 3^{2m} is 2 times 3^{2m-1}, so from (2) we deduce that 2 times 3^{2m-1} mid 2 times 3^m c, i.e., 3^{m-1} mid c, thus 3 mid c (since m geqslant 2), which contradicts (1) where 3 nmid c. Therefore, we must have m=1.The third step is to prove that c=1 in (1). This can be done similarly to the first step, i.e., Example 1 of Unit 8: squareIf c>1, let q be the smallest prime divisor of c, then2^{3c} equiv -1 pmod{q}.Let r be the order of 2 modulo q. From (3), we get 2^{6c} equiv 1 pmod{q}, and also 2^{q-1} equiv 1 pmod{q}, so r mid 6c and r mid (q-1), hence r mid (6c, q-1). By the selection of q, we have (q-1, c)=1, so r mid 6. From 2^r equiv 1 pmod{q}, we deduce that q=3 or 7. It is easy to see that q=3 is impossible; and from (3), q=7 is also impossible. Therefore, we must have c=1. Thus, n=3.Note that if we first prove that c=1 in (1), it will not be effective. The order of the arguments here is quite important. Additionally, in the second step, m=1 can also be proven by comparing powers of primes:By the binomial theorem,2^n + 1 = (3-1)^n + 1 = 3n + sum_{k=2}^n (-1)^k binom{n}{k} 3^k.Let 3^a parallel k!, thenalpha = sum_{l=1}^{infty} left[frac{k}{3^l}right] k + m - frac{k}{2} geqslant m + 1.Thus, beta geqslant m + 2, so the sum on the right-hand side of (4) is divisible by 3^{m+2}. If m>1, then 2m geqslant m+2, so from 3^{2m} mid (2^n + 1) and (4), we get 3^{m+2} mid 3n, i.e., 3^{m+1} mid n, which contradicts (1). Therefore, we must have m=1."},{"problem":"6.

What is the integer nearest to S?","solution":"1. First, we need to determine the proper divisors of ( 1000000 ). We start by expressing ( 1000000 ) in its prime factorized form:   [   1000000 = 10^6 = (2 times 5)^6 = 2^6 times 5^6   ]   The number of divisors of ( 1000000 ) is given by ((6+1)(6+1) = 49). Since we are interested in proper divisors, we exclude ( 1000000 ) itself, leaving us with ( 48 ) proper divisors.2. For any proper divisor ( a ) of ( 1000000 ), there exists another proper divisor ( b ) such that ( ab = 1000000 ). This means:   [   log_{10} a + log_{10} b = log_{10} (a times b) = log_{10} 1000000 = 6   ]   Therefore, each pair of proper divisors ( (a, b) ) contributes ( 6 ) to the sum of the logarithms.3. Since there are ( 48 ) proper divisors, they can be paired into ( 24 ) pairs. Each pair contributes ( 6 ) to the sum, so the total contribution from these pairs is:   [   24 times 6 = 144   ]4. However, we must consider the divisor ( 1000 ) (which is ( 10^3 )). This divisor pairs with itself, contributing:   [   log_{10} 1000 = 3   ]   Since ( 1000 ) is a proper divisor, it should be included in the sum.5. Therefore, the total sum ( S ) of the base 10 logarithms of all the proper divisors of ( 1000000 ) is:   [   S = 144 - 3 = 141   ]The final answer is ( boxed{141} )."},{"problem":"5cdot31 In a school, students observed a comet 20 times, with exactly 5 students participating in each activity, and any two students participated together in at most 1 activity.

How many different ways are there to select the 16 red cubes? Explain your reasoning.","solution":"Solution: Choose a 4 times 4 side of the 4 times 4 times 4 large cube as the base plane. Divide the large cube into four layers parallel to the base plane (each layer being 4 times 4 times 1 in size), and number these layers as 1, 2, 3, 4. Project each red unit cube onto the base plane and write the layer number of the red unit cube in the corresponding grid. This way, we obtain a 4 times 4 grid, where each cell contains a number from {1, 2, 3, 4}, and cells with the same number are neither in the same row nor in the same column. Such a 4 times 4 grid is called a 4th-order Latin square. Conversely, each 4th-order Latin square uniquely determines a coloring method that meets the problem's requirements, and different Latin squares determine different coloring methods. Therefore, the problem is reduced to determining: how many different 4th-order Latin squares are there.We agree to label the positions of the individual cells in the 4 times 4 grid as shown in Figure 1. For any permutation (a, b, c, d) of (1, 2, 3, 4), we will examine the number of Latin squares as shown in Figure 2. For this purpose, we first examine the number of Latin squares as shown in Figure 3.The (2,2) cell in Figure 3 can be filled with any number from {a, c, d}. We will examine these three cases separately.(i) Suppose the (2,2) cell in Figure 3 is filled with a.In this case, the (2,3) and (3,2) cells can only be filled with d; then the (2,4) and (4,2) cells can only be filled with c; then the (3,3) cell can be filled with a or b. Once the (3,3) cell is filled, the remaining three cells are uniquely determined. Therefore, there are exactly 2 Latin squares corresponding to this case.(ii) Suppose the (2,2) cell in Figure 3 is filled with c.In this case, the (2,4) and (4,2) cells can only be filled with a; then the (2,3) and (3,2) cells can only be filled with d; then the (3,4) and (4,3) cells can be filled with b. Once these cells are filled, the remaining cells are uniquely determined. Therefore, there is exactly 1 Latin square corresponding to this case.(iii) Suppose the (2,2) cell in Figure 3 is filled with d.Similar to case (ii), there is only one unique filling method for this case, i.e., there is exactly 1 Latin square.Based on the above discussion, there are exactly 4 Latin squares as shown in Figure 3. Each such Latin square can generate 3! different Latin squares as shown in Figure 2 by permuting the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th rows. Therefore, there are exactly 4 times 3! Latin squares as shown in Figure 2. Finally, since there are 4! permutations of (a, b, c, d), the total number of 4th-order Latin squares is (4!)^2.Thus, the total number of ways to select 16 red cubes is (4!)^2 = 576.Note: Consider a more general problem, in an n times n times n large cube, select n^2 unit cubes to be painted red, such that any 1 times 1 times n rectangular prism composed of n unit cubes contains exactly one red unit cube. How many different ways are there to select n^2 red unit cubes that meet the above requirements?Following the solution above, the problem can be reduced to finding the number of different n-order Latin squares L_n. The number of n-order Latin squares with the first row and first column being the standard permutation (1, 2, cdots, n) is denoted as l_n. Thus,L_n = (n!)((n-1)!) l_n.As n increases, l_n and L_n grow rapidly. People have only calculated l_n and L_n for smaller n.begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}hline n & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 hline l_n & 1 & 1 & 1 & 4 & 56 & 9408 & 16942080 & cdots & cdots hlineend{tabular}For n geq 5, a large number of cases must be analyzed to accurately calculate the large number l_n without repetition or omission, which is difficult to achieve in a short time.

Therefore, the maximum number of black squares required by the problem is no less than 890.Next, we will prove that under the conditions of the problem, the number of black squares in the table cannot exceed 890. For this purpose, we first point out that it is easy to prove by mathematical induction that in a 2 times (2n+1) rectangular grid, under the conditions of the problem, the table can have at most 2(n+1) black squares, and only by coloring in the way shown in Figure (b) can the table have exactly 2(n+1) black squares.We then use mathematical induction to prove that in a (2m+1) times (2n+1) rectangular grid (n geqslant m), if some squares are colored black and meet the conditions of the problem, then the number of black squares is no more than (m+1)(2n+1).When m=0, the proposition is obviously true. Suppose the proposition holds for m=k. When m=k+1, in a (2k+3) times (2n+1) rectangular grid, we separate a 2 times (2n+1) strip at the top. If the number of black squares in the strip does not exceed 2(n+1)-1=2n+1, then by the inductive hypothesis, the number of black squares in the (2k+1) times (2n+1) grid below does not exceed (k+1)(2n+1), so the total number of black squares in the entire (2k+3) times (2n+1) grid does not exceed (k+2)(2n+1), i.e., the proposition holds. If the number of black squares in the strip is no less than 2(n+1), then by the discussion above, the number of black squares is exactly 2(n+1) and can only be colored as shown in Figure (b). At this time, we can cut off the first row of the (2k+3) times (2n+1) rectangular grid, which has exactly (n+1) black squares. The remaining (2k+2) times (2n+1) rectangular grid is divided into k+1 strips of 2 times (2n+1), so each strip has at most 2(n+1) black squares. Therefore, the total number of black squares in the entire grid does not exceed (n+1) + (2k+2)(n+1) = (2k+3)(n+1) leqslant (k+2)(2n+1), i.e., the proposition holds for m=k+1.In summary, in the coloring method that meets the conditions of the problem, the table can have at most 890 black squares."},{"problem":"6.

Let's examine which rational-coefficient polynomials p satisfy p(sqrt{2}+sqrt{3})=sqrt{2}. It can be shown by some calculations that the numbers 1, sqrt{2}, sqrt{3}, sqrt{6} are linearly independent over the field of rational numbers, that is, if r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4} are rational numbers such thatr_{1} cdot 1+r_{2} cdot sqrt{2}+r_{3} cdot sqrt{3}+r_{4} cdot sqrt{6}=0then necessarily r_{1}=r_{2}=r_{3}=r_{4}=0.

It can be easily verified that sqrt{2}+sqrt{3} is a root of the polynomial x^{4}-10 x^{2}+1. Let p now be any polynomial with rational coefficients. Divide p by x^{4}-10 x^{2}+1 with remainder:p(x)=left(x^{4}-10 x^{2}+1right) s(x)+r(x)where r and s are polynomials with rational coefficients, and r is of degree at most three. Due to the choice of x^{4}-10 x^{2}+1, we have p(sqrt{2}+sqrt{3})=r(sqrt{2}+sqrt{3}). Therefore, p satisfies the condition if and only if r does. Since r is of degree at most three, this is equivalent to r(x)=frac{1}{2} x^{3}-frac{9}{2} x.

Add the two equations:   [   (r^2 - q) + (r^2 + q) = 1 + p   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   2r^2 = p + 1   ]   Therefore:   [   p = 2r^2 - 1   ]5. Substitute ( p ) back into the first equation:   [   r^2 - q = 1   ]   Solving for ( q ):   [   q = r^2 - 1   ]6. Check if ( q ) is a prime number:   For ( q ) to be prime, ( r^2 - 1 ) must be prime. We need to check small values of ( r ) to find valid primes.   - If ( r = 2 ):     [     q = 2^2 - 1 = 3     ]     [     p = 2 cdot 2^2 - 1 = 7     ]     Here, ( p = 7 ), ( q = 3 ), and ( r = 2 ) are all prime numbers.   - If ( r = 3 ):     [     q = 3^2 - 1 = 8     ]     8 is not a prime number.   - If ( r = 5 ):     [     q = 5^2 - 1 = 24     ]     24 is not a prime number.   - If ( r = 7 ):     [     q = 7^2 - 1 = 48     ]     48 is not a prime number.   Continuing this process, we find that for ( r > 2 ), ( q = r^2 - 1 ) is not a prime number.Therefore, the only solution in prime numbers is when ( r = 2 ), ( q = 3 ), and ( p = 7 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ p = 7, q = 3, r = 2 } )."},{"problem":"A number x is randomly selected from the interval [-1,1].

Let (alpha) be a root of this polynomial in some extension field of (K).2. Degree of the extension:   - Since (x^p - x + 1) is irreducible over (K), the degree of the extension (K(alpha)) over (K) is (p), i.e., ([K(alpha) : K] = p).3. Order of the field (K(alpha)):   - The field (K(alpha)) is a finite field with (p^p) elements, i.e., (|K(alpha)| = p^p).4. Properties of finite fields:   - In a finite field with (q) elements, every element (beta) satisfies (beta^{q-1} = 1). Therefore, in (K(alpha)), we have (alpha^{p^p - 1} = 1).5. Conclusion:   - Since (alpha^{p^p - 1} = 1), (alpha) is a root of (x^{p^p - 1} - 1).   - Given that (x^p - x + 1) is irreducible, it divides (x^{p^p - 1} - 1).

For m = 3, calculate A cap complement_R B.2. If A cap B = {x mid -1 leq x < 4}, find the value of the real number m.","solution":"1. First, we solve the inequality for set A: x^2 - 4x - 5 leq 0. We find the roots of the corresponding equation x^2 - 4x - 5 = 0 which are x = -1 and x = 5. Since the coefficient of x^2 is positive, the inequality holds between the roots, thus we have A = {x mid -1 leq x leq 5}.   Now let's consider set B when m = 3: x^2 - 2x - 3 < 0. The roots of the equation x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 are x = -1 and x = 3. Hence, B = {x mid -1 < x < 3}.   The complement of B with respect to the real numbers is complement_R B = {x mid x leq -1 text{ or } x geq 3}.   To find the intersection A cap complement_R B, we combine both sets while respecting the defining inequalities of each:   A cap complement_R B = {x mid x = -1 text{ or } 3 leq x leq 5}.   We can express the solution as boxed{x = -1 text{ or } 3 leq x leq 5}.2. For the second part, A cap B = {x mid -1 leq x < 4} implies that x = 4 must be a solution to the equation x^2 - 2x - m = 0. By substituting x = 4 into the equation, we get:   4^2 - 2 cdot 4 - m = 0,   16 - 8 - m = 0,   m = 8.   At m = 8, the roots of x^2 - 2x - 8 = 0 are x = -2 and x = 4, which results in B = {x mid -2 < x < 4}. This satisfies the condition given by A cap B. Therefore, the value of m is boxed{m = 8}."},{"problem":"Let  n be an even positive integer.

Expressing the problem in terms of polynomials:   We need to show that for an even positive integer ( n ), there exists a positive integer ( k ) such that:   [   k = f(x) cdot (x+1)^n + g(x) cdot (x^n + 1)   ]   for some polynomials ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) with integer coefficients.2. Divisibility and polynomial properties:   Since ( x+1 ) divides ( x^n - 1 ) for even ( n ), we can write:   [   x^n - 1 = a(x) cdot (x+1)   ]   for some polynomial ( a(x) ). This implies:   [   2 = (x^n + 1) - a(x) cdot (x+1)   ]   Raising both sides to the ( n )-th power, we get:   [   2^n = (a(x) cdot (x+1))^n + b(x) cdot (x^n + 1)   ]   for some polynomial ( b(x) ).3. Existence of minimal ( k ):   This shows that some minimal ( k ) with:   [   k = f(x) cdot (x+1)^n + g(x) cdot (x^n + 1)   ]   exists. If we subtract this equation ( lfloor 2^n/k rfloor ) times from the previous equation, the left-hand side must be 0 (or else the minimality of ( k ) is contradicted). Thus, ( k ) must divide ( 2^n ), implying ( k ) is a power of 2.4. Determining ( k_0 ) for ( q = 1 ):   When ( q = 1 ), we must have ( k = 2 ). Substituting ( x = 1 ), it is clear that ( k ) must be even. Suppose for contradiction that ( k = 2^c ) for some ( c geq 2 ). Let ( h(x) = -g(x) ). Our new equation is:   [   2^c = f(x) cdot (x+1)^{2^r} - h(x) cdot (x^{2^r} + 1)   ]   It is clear that ( deg f = deg h ). Let ( f(x) = (x^{2^r} + 1)u(x) + v(x) ) with ( deg v(x) < 2^r ). We can replace ( f(x) ) and ( h(x) ) with ( v(x) ) and ( h(x) + u(x)(x+1)^{2^r} ), respectively, so ( deg f = deg h < 2^r ).5. Finite field ( F_2 ) analysis:   Consider the equation in the finite field ( F_2 ):   [   f(x) cdot (x+1)^{2^r} = h(x) cdot (x^{2^r} + 1)   ]   Since ( (x+1)^{2^r} = x^{2^r} + 1 ) in ( F_2 ), we have:   [   (x^{2^r} + 1)(f(x) - h(x)) = 0   ]   Since ( x^{2^r} + 1 ) is nonzero in ( F_2 ), we must have ( f(x) - h(x) = 0 ) in ( F_2 ), i.e., ( f(x) = h(x) + 2p(x) ) for some integer polynomial ( p(x) ). Substituting this into the equation, we get:   [   2^c = h(x) cdot ((x+1)^{2^r} - (x^{2^r} + 1)) + 2p(x) cdot (x+1)^{2^r}   ]   Let ( e(x) = frac{(x+1)^{2^r} - (x^{2^r} + 1)}{2} ). Note that ( e(x) ) is an integer polynomial, and ( e(1) = 2^{2^r - 1} - 1 ) is odd. Dividing by 2, we get:   [   2^{c-1} = h(x) cdot e(x) + p(x) cdot (x+1)^{2^r}   ]   Since ( 2^{c-1} ) is even, considering this in ( F_2 ), we get:   [   p(x) cdot (x+1)^{2^r} = -h(x) cdot e(x)   ]   Since ( e(1) ) is odd, ( (x+1)^{2^r} ) and ( e(x) ) are coprime in ( F_2 ). Thus, ( (x+1)^{2^r} ) divides ( -h(x) ) in ( F_2 ), implying ( h(x) = c(x) cdot (x+1)^{2^r} + 2d(x) ). This implies ( deg h geq 2^r ) or ( h ) is zero in ( F_2 ), both contradictions. Thus, ( k = 2 ).6. General case for all ( q ):   Suppose we have polynomials ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) such that:   [   2 = f(x) cdot (x+1)^{2^r} + g(x) cdot (x^{2^r} + 1)   ]   Raise both sides to the ( q )-th power:   [   2^q = f_0(x) cdot (x+1)^{q cdot 2^r} + g_0(x) cdot (x^{2^r} + 1)   ]   where ( f_0(x) = f(x)^q ) and ( g_0(x) ) is obtained from binomially expanding and factoring ( x^{2^r} + 1 ) out of all terms but ( f_0(x) cdot (x+1)^{q cdot 2^r} ). Replacing ( x ) with ( x^q ):   [   2^q = f_0(x^q) cdot (x^q + 1)^{q cdot 2^r} + g_0(x^q) cdot (x^{q cdot 2^r} + 1)   ]   This completes the construction.The final answer is ( boxed{ k_0 = 2^q } ) where ( q ) is the odd integer determined by ( n = q cdot 2^r )."},{"problem":"4sin {15^{circ }}sin {105^{circ }}=A: 1B: -1C: sqrt{3}D: -sqrt{3}","solution":"Given the options, the correct answer is boxed{A}."},{"problem":"1.

(III) According to the problem, f(x-t)+f(x^{2}-t^{2})geqslant 0Leftrightarrow f(x-t)geqslant -f(x^{2}-t^{2}),  Since f(x) is an odd function,  because f(x-t)geqslant -f(x^{2}-t^{2})=f(t^{2}-x^{2}),  Since f(x) is increasing on mathbb{R},  therefore when xin[1,2], x-tgeqslant t^{2}-x^{2} always holds, that is, x^{2}+xgeqslant t^{2}+t always holds,  When xin[1,2], (x^{2}+x)_{min}=2,  Then x^{2}+xgeqslant t^{2}+t always holds Leftrightarrow t^{2}+tleqslant 2,  Solving this gives -2leqslant tleqslant 1,  Therefore, the range of t is boxed{[-2,1]}."},{"problem":"Which of the following surveys is suitable for a census?A: Surveying the quality of frozen food in the marketB: Surveying whether passengers on airplanes are carrying prohibited itemsC: Surveying the lifespan of a certain brand of tiresD: Surveying the maximum range of a certain brand of new energy vehicles","solution":"To determine which of the following surveys is suitable for a census, let's analyze each option step by step:- Option A: Surveying the quality of frozen food in the market. This type of survey would typically involve selecting a sample of frozen food items from the market to assess their quality. Given the vast variety and quantity of frozen food available, it's more practical to conduct a sampling survey rather than a census. Therefore, Option A is not suitable for a census.- Option B: Surveying whether passengers on airplanes are carrying prohibited items. This survey involves checking all passengers on airplanes to ensure they are not carrying prohibited items. For safety and security reasons, it's essential to inspect every passenger, making it a comprehensive survey of the entire population of airplane passengers. Hence, Option B is suitable for a census.- Option C: Surveying the lifespan of a certain brand of tires. To determine the lifespan of a brand of tires, a representative sample of tires would be tested under various conditions over time. Conducting a census, or testing every single tire, would be impractical and unnecessary for gathering the needed lifespan data. Thus, Option C is not suitable for a census.- Option D: Surveying the maximum range of a certain brand of new energy vehicles. This involves testing a sample of vehicles to determine their maximum range under various conditions. Like with the tires, testing every single vehicle would be impractical, making a sampling survey the better approach.

Define Exquisite Polynomials:   A polynomial ( P(x, y) ) is called exquisite if it satisfies ( P(x, y) = P(y, -x - y) ).2. Homogeneous Polynomials:   Let ( g(d) ) be the number of linearly independent homogeneous exquisite polynomials of degree ( d ) up to a constant. We need to show that:   [   sum_{l=0}^d g(l) = leftlceil frac{(d+1)(d+2)}{6} rightrceil   ]   This implies that a generic exquisite polynomial can be expressed as a linear combination of these homogeneous parts.3. Crucial Claim:   If we let ( U = x^2 + xy + y^2 ), ( V = xy(x + y) ), and ( W = x^3 - 3xy^2 - y^3 ), then ( P ) is exquisite if and only if it can be written as ( Q(U, V, W) ), where the degree of ( U ) is ( leq 2 ).4. Implication:   - ( U, V, W ) are all exquisite, so ( Q(U, V, W) ) is exquisite as well.   - For the other direction, we construct ( Q ) from ( P ) by induction on ( n ).5. Observation:   If ( y mid P ), then ( V mid P ). This follows from ( P(x, y) = P(y, -x - y) = P(-x - y, x) ).6. Induction Base Cases:   The base cases ( n leq 3 ) can be verified by hand.7. Induction Step:   Assume ( n geq 4 ). Let ( n = 3k + 2j ) with ( k geq 0 ) and ( j in {0, 1, 2} ). If ( P ) is exquisite and the coefficient of ( x^n ) is ( a ), then:   [   P - aU^jW^k   ]   is exquisite and divisible by ( y ), so it is a multiple of ( V ). Thus, we have:   [   P = aU^jV^k + VP'   ]   where ( P' ) is exquisite and has degree ( n - 3 ). By the inductive hypothesis, there is a ( Q(U, V, W) = P'(x, y) ), which implies that ( P ) can be written in that form as well. This procedure ensures that the degree of ( U ) in the resulting polynomial is ( leq 2 ).8. Counting:   Observe that ( V^k, V^{k-1}W, ldots, W^k ) are all linearly independent. Therefore, ( U^jV^k, U^jV^{k-1}W, ldots, U^jW^k ) are also linearly independent. Since the crucial claim tells us that their linear combinations span the space of degree ( n ) exquisite polynomials, we get:   [   g(3k + 2j) = k + 1   ]   and ( g(1) = 0 ). From this, the conclusion follows.9. Remark:   The characterization of exquisite polynomials remains the same if ( F_p ) is replaced by any field with characteristic ( neq 3 ). For fields with characteristic ( 3 ), the exquisite polynomials are generated by ( x - y ) and ( xy(x + y) ).

Symmetry about x=1:   - Given that f(1+x) = f(1-x), this implies the function f(x) is symmetric about the vertical line x=1.    - Therefore, for any x, f(0) = f(2) because f(1-1) = f(1+1).

Is this possible?","solution":"A number is divisible by 33 - which is 3 cdot 11, and here 3 and 11 are relatively prime - if and only if it is divisible by both 3 and 11. The necessary and sufficient condition for divisibility by 3 is that the sum of the digits is a multiple of 3. The sum of the digits of the given number is divisible by 3, so the digit to be appended can only be 0, 3, 6 or 9.A number is divisible by 11 if and only if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions (counting from the right) and the sum of the digits in the even positions is a multiple of 11. This difference can also be formed by taking the digits from right to left with alternating + and - signs and summing them; in our case:8-6+4-2+1-3+5-7+9=9Thus, our given number is not divisible by 11. (It is also true that the remainder when divided by 11 is the same as the obtained sum, which is 9.)From this, we immediately see that adding a 9 at the beginning of the number ensures divisibility by 11, since the next sign in the sequence is minus, and 9-9=0=0 cdot 11. The found 9 also ensures divisibility by 3, so one valid number is:begin{array}{llllllllll}9 & 9 & 7 & 5 & 3 & 1 & 2 & 4 & 6 & 8 .end{array}This can also be viewed as inserting a 9 between the first two digits of our given number (from the left). No other digit can fit in these positions, as there are no two digits whose difference is 11.If we insert the digit x at the far right, the alternating sum becomes x-9, since (1) the sign of each term on the left side of the equation changes, so the same applies to the sum.

The line passing through the midpoints of AB and AC intersects the circumcircle of triangle APQ at points X and Y. Find the length of segment XY.(2023-47, D.

We also know that the perimeter of triangle ABC is 1, that is, P_{ABC}=1.Since points P and Q are the points of tangency of the excircle of triangle ABC with the sides of angle PAQ, then AP=AQ as segments of tangents. As known, the length of such segments is the semiperimeter of triangle ABC.Since MN is the midline of triangle ABC, then MN=frac{1}{2} BC.Let AB=2c, BC=2a, AC=2b. Then AM=frac{1}{2} AB=c, AN=frac{1}{2} AC=b, MN=frac{1}{2} BC=a.

Since MN is the midline of triangle ABC, then MN = frac{1}{2} BC, and MN parallel BC. Mark the point O - the center of the circle omega.Notice that point O lies on the bisector of angle BAC as the center of the excircle of triangle ABC.Since OP perp AP and OQ perp AQ, points A, Q, O, P lie on the same circle (specifically, the one constructed on AO as the diameter), so point O lies on the circumcircle of triangle APQ.Next, we will prove a variation of problem 255 from Sharigin's problem book and apply its results to prove our problem.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_fde2078dee7bae03239bg-04.jpg?height=825&width=788&top_left_y=153&top_left_x=605)Fig. 3: to the solution of problem 3Denote the point of tangency of circle omega with BC as R. Now notice that point O lies on the bisector of angle BCQ as the center of the excircle of triangle ABC. Extend this bisector beyond point C to the intersection with line PR. Call this point Y_2. We will prove that angle CY_2A = 90^circ. For this, we will calculate the angles:Segments BP and BR are equal as tangents to circle omega. Therefore, angle BPR = angle BPR. And from the fact that angle ABC is external to triangle PBR, it follows that angle BPR = angle BPR = frac{1}{2} angle ABC.angle BPR = angle Y_2RC(being vertical angles)angle RY_2C = angle BCO - angle Y_2RC(since angle BCO is external to triangle RY_2C)begin{gathered}angle RY_2C = frac{1}{2} angle BCQ - frac{1}{2} angle ABC angle RY_2C = frac{1}{2} (angle ABC + angle BAC) - frac{1}{2} angle ABCend{gathered}(since angle BCQ is external to triangle ABC)angle RY_2C = frac{1}{2} angle BACUnderstand that since AO is the bisector of angle BAC, then angle BAO = frac{1}{2} angle BAC = angle RY_2C.Therefore, by the inscribed quadrilateral criterion, points O, P, A, Y_2 lie on the same circle, that is, on the circumcircle of triangle APQ (since points O, P, A lie on it). Then angle OY_2A = 90^circ.Now we will prove that point Y_2 lies on MN. Indeed, if we extend AY_2 beyond point Y_2 to the intersection with line BC, then in the resulting triangle ACT, the bisector CY_2 is also the altitude, and therefore the median, that is, point Y_2 is the midpoint of AT.Line MN will pass through the midpoint of AT, that is, through point Y_2, since in triangle CAT it passes through the midpoint of side AC parallel to side CT.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_fde2078dee7bae03239bg-05.jpg?height=1022&width=765&top_left_y=146&top_left_x=608)Fig. 4: to the solution of problem 3Thus, point Y_2 lies at the intersection of the circumcircle of triangle APQ and line MN, so it coincides with point Y.In the right triangle AYC, the median NY, drawn to the hypotenuse, is half of it, that is, NY = frac{1}{2} AC. Similarly, XM = frac{1}{2} AB. Therefore, XY = XM + MN + NY = frac{1}{2} (AB + BC + AC) = frac{1}{2}.## Solution 3.Introduce the same notations as in the previous solution, that is: points M, N are the midpoints of AB and AC respectively, points P, Q are the points of tangency of omega with the extensions of AB and AC respectively. Point O is its center.As before, notice that point O lies on the circumcircle of triangle APQ. This is true because OP perp AB, OQ perp AC as radii drawn to the points of tangency, and then points P and Q lie on the circle constructed on AO as the diameter.Next, denote by I the center of the circumcircle of triangle PAQ. Since AO is the diameter of the circumcircle of triangle APQ, point I lies on AO and AO = 2AI.Now perform a homothety with center at point A and coefficient frac{1}{2}. In this case, point B will go to point M, point C to point N, point O to point I. Thus, triangle ABC will go to triangle AMN, and the center of the excircle of triangle ABC will go to the center of the excircle of triangle AMN. Thus, we have obtained that point I is the center of the excircle of triangle AMN.Therefore, point I lies on the bisector of angle BMN, and, in particular, the heights dropped to AP and XY are equal. It follows that XY and AP are equidistant from the center of the circle. Therefore, they are equal.

(The Fibonacci numbers are elements of a recursive sequence: F_{0}=0, F_{1}=1; for n>1 then F_{n}=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}.)","solution":"Solution. Let f be a polynomial function that satisfies the condition. Then fleft(F_{0}right) must be a positive prime number, let this be p. According to this, the constant term of the polynomial is p, since fleft(F_{0}right)=f(0)=p. Now let's examine the remainder of the division of Fibonacci numbers by p. There are infinitely many consecutive pairs of Fibonacci numbers, but the remainders of the numbers in these pairs when divided by p can only have at most p^{2} possibilities, so there exist i and j such that for i neq j, the remainders of F_i and F_j are the same, and the remainders of F_{i+1} and F_{j+1} are also the same. This means that the Fibonacci sequence modulo p is periodic. Let n_0 be the period of this sequence. For n > n_0, the Fibonacci numbers modulo p will repeat. Therefore, for n > n_0, f(F_n) equiv f(F_{n mod n_0}) pmod{p}. Since f(F_{n_0}) = p, for n > n_0, f(F_n) equiv 0 pmod{p}. Now, let n_1 be the smallest integer such that F_{n_1} > p. For n > n_1, f(x) > p. Thus, substituting a Fibonacci number greater than n_1 and divisible by p (which exists according to the above proof) into the polynomial, the value will be divisible by p, since in this case every term is divisible by p. Therefore, the polynomial f assigns a prime number divisible by p and greater than p to this Fibonacci number, which is a contradiction. Thus, the polynomial can only be constant, i.e., the sought polynomials are: f(x)=p, where p is a positive prime number.Remark. Similarly to what is described in the first part of the solution, it can be proven that the well-known statement is true that for any positive integer m, the Fibonacci numbers modulo m form a periodic sequence. In fact, this statement is true not only for the Fibonacci sequence but for all recursive sequences.

This gives us 5 options for the first experiment.2. Once the first experiment is chosen, we proceed to arrange the remaining 5 experiments. Without any constraints, there would be 5! ways to do so.3. The final restriction is that the last experiment must have a smaller number than the one preceding it. To satisfy this, let's first consider the number of ways we can choose the last two experiments. We will 'pair' adjacent experiments as (preceding, last).

Indeed, if ( k > 1 ) is coprime with ( n ), then it is coprime with ( 2, 3, 5 ). If, in addition, ( k ) is not prime, then it admits a non-trivial factorization ( k = ell m ) with ( ell, m > 1 ). Since ( ell ) and ( m ) are coprime with ( n ), they are coprime with ( 2, 3, 5 ), so ( ell, m geq 7 ), which implies that ( k geq 7 times 7 = 49 > n ).Conversely, let's show that if ( n ) satisfies the property, then ( n leq 30 ). Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that ( n > 30 ). Let ( p ) be the smallest prime not dividing ( n ). Since ( p^2 ) is not prime but is coprime with ( n ), we have ( p^2 > n > 30 > 5^2 ), so ( p geq 7 ). In particular, 2, 3, and 5 divide ( n ), so 30 divides ( n ). Since ( n > 30 ), we deduce that ( p^2 > n geq 60 > 7^2 ), so ( p > 7 ), hence ( p geq 11 ).Let ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k ) be the primes dividing ( n ). Since ( p geq 11 ), we have ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_k leq 7 ). Therefore, ( n geq p_1 p_2 cdots p_k ), which contradicts Bonse's inequality.Remark: If we do not know Bonse's inequality, we can easily derive it from Bertrand's postulate, which states that ( p_{j+1} < 2p_j ). This implies that ( p_{n+1} < 2p_n ), and by induction, ( p_{n+1} < 2^n p_1 ). Since ( p_1 = 2 ), we have ( p_{n+1} < 2^{n+1} ).Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists ( n geq 8 ) such that ( p_1 p_2 cdots p_n leq p_{n+1}^2 ). Let ( m = leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor ). We have[left(p_1 p_2 cdots p_mright)^2 < p_1 p_2 cdots p_n leq p_{n+1}^2]so ( p_1 p_2 cdots p_m < p_{n+1} ).Consider the integers ( N_j = j p_1 p_2 cdots p_{m-1} - 1 ) for ( 1 leq j leq p_m ). For all ( j ), we have ( N_j < p_1 p_2 cdots p_m < p_{n+1} ) and ( N_j ) is coprime with ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_{m-1} ). Therefore, if ( q_j ) is the smallest prime dividing ( N_j ), we have ( p_m leq q_j leq p_n ).The ( q_j ) are distinct because if ( j < ell ) and ( q_j = q_ell ), then ( q_j ) divides ( N_ell - N_j = (ell - j) p_1 p_2 cdots p_{m-1} ), so ( q_j ) divides ( ell - j ), which is impossible since ( 1 leq ell - j < p_m leq q_j ).Therefore, there are at least ( p_m ) distinct primes between ( p_m ) and ( p_n ): in other words, ( p_m leq n - m + 1 ). Since ( n leq 2m + 1 ), we have ( p_m leq m + 2 ).Since ( p_m geq 2m - 1 ) for all ( m geq 1 ), this implies ( 2m - 1 leq m + 2 ), so ( m leq 3 ), and thus ( n leq 7 ).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_d74311deaed1ce0e1dceg-07.jpg?height=79&width=177&top_left_y=2069&top_left_x=974)"},{"problem":"Given that {a_n} is a geometric sequence and S_n is the sum of the first n terms, with S_3=2 and S_6=6, find the value of a_{13}+a_{14}+a_{15}.","solution":"From the properties of a geometric sequence, we know that the sums S_3, S_6 - S_3, S_9 - S_6, S_{12} - S_9, S_{15} - S_{12} also form a geometric sequence.Given that:- S_3 = 2- S_6 = 6We can determine that:- S_3 = 2- S_6 - S_3 = 6 - 2 = 4- S_9 - S_6 = 2 times (S_6 - S_3) = 2 times 4 = 8- S_{12} - S_9 = 2 times (S_9 - S_6) = 2 times 8 = 16- S_{15} - S_{12} = 2 times (S_{12} - S_9) = 2 times 16 = 32Therefore, to calculate a_{13} + a_{14} + a_{15}, we subtract the sum of the first 12 terms from the sum of the first 15 terms:a_{13} + a_{14} + a_{15} = S_{15} - S_{12} = 32Hence, we get: a_{13} + a_{14} + a_{15} = boxed{32} "},{"problem":"11.3.

The eccentricity (e) of the ellipse is given by frac{sqrt{3}}{2}.- Since the eccentricity e = frac{c}{a} where c is the distance from the center to a focus, we find that c = ae = 2 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = sqrt{3}. - Using the relationship b^2 = a^2 - c^2, we can calculate the length of the minor semi-axis (b):b^2 = a^2 - c^2 = 2^2 - (sqrt{3})^2 = 4 - 3 = 1,so b = 1.- The standard equation of an ellipse with a horizontal major axis is frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1.

Therefore, the value of S is at least 35.If n is even, then S will be an even number greater than 35, which cannot be a prime. Therefore, n must be odd. The remainder of n when divided by 10 can be considered in five cases.i) n=10 k+1 (where k is at least 1). Then 2 n-3=20 k-1, andS=(10 k+1)+(10 k+1)^{2}+ldots+(10 k+1)^{20 k-1}-4Consider the last digit of the terms, their sum is:underbrace{1+1+ldots+1}_{20 k-1 text { terms }}-4=20 k-5Thus, the last digit is 5, meaning S is divisible by 5.ii) n=10 k+3(k in mathbb{N}).

Some did not examine the last digit, or the remainder modulo 10, but the remainder modulo 5. They also reached the goal in a similar way.2. The fact that the expression S is divisible by 5 for all odd values of n that are not divisible by 5 is not entirely coincidental. Write n in the form n=2 k+1. If n gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 5, then this is true for all its powers, and in this case, 2 k, and therefore k is also divisible by 5. Thus, the value of n+n^{2}+ldots+n^{2 n-3}, as the sum of 2 n-3=4 k-1 numbers that give a remainder of 1, gives a remainder of -1, and subtracting 4 results in a number divisible by 5.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the largest ( m ) such that the sum of the lengths of the intervals is 1 for all ( k ) from 1 to ( m ). The intervals are defined by the points ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{2n} ) raised to the power ( 2k-1 ).2. Sum of Intervals:   The length of each interval ( [x_{2i-1}^{2k-1}, x_{2i}^{2k-1}] ) is ( x_{2i}^{2k-1} - x_{2i-1}^{2k-1} ). The sum of these lengths for ( n ) intervals is:   [   sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{2i}^{2k-1} - x_{2i-1}^{2k-1}) = 1   ]3. Symmetric Functions and Power Sums:   We use the fact that if the power sums of two sets of numbers are equal up to a certain degree, then the sets are permutations of each other. Specifically, if ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) and ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n ) are such that:   [   sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i^k = sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i^k quad text{for} quad k = 1, 2, ldots, n   ]   then ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) and ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n ) are permutations of each other.4. Applying the Symmetric Function Theorem:   Given the intervals and the condition that their lengths sum to 1 for all ( k ) from 1 to ( m ), we need to ensure that the power sums of the ( x_i )'s raised to ( 2k-1 ) are equal. This implies that the ( x_i )'s must be such that their power sums up to ( 2m-1 ) are equal.5. Determining the Largest ( m ):   The largest ( m ) for which this holds true is when ( 2m-1 leq 2n ). This is because we have ( 2n ) points, and the power sums up to ( 2n ) can be controlled. Therefore, the largest ( m ) is:   [   2m-1 leq 2n implies m leq n   ]6. Conclusion:   The largest integer ( m ) such that the sum of the lengths of the ( n ) intervals is equal to 1 for all ( k ) from 1 to ( m ) is ( m = n ).The final answer is ( boxed{n} )."},{"problem":"Determine the coefficient of the term containing x^{2} in the expansion of (1+x)^{7}.","solution":"By the binomial theorem, the general term T_{r+1} of the binomial expansion (1+x)^{7} is given by:T_{r+1} = C_{7}^{r}x^{r}We are looking for the coefficient of x^{2}, which corresponds to the case when r=2.

We start with the given identity:   [   (1-x)^n f(x) = 1 + sum_{i=1}^n a_i x^{b_i}.   ]   We need to find a simple expression for ( f(1) ).2. Consider the derivatives of both sides of the equation. For any ( 0 leq k leq n-1 ), the ( k )-th derivative of the left-hand side is divisible by ( 1-x ), hence it vanishes at ( x = 1 ). This is because ( (1-x)^n ) and its derivatives up to the ( (n-1) )-th derivative are zero at ( x = 1 ).3. The ( n )-th derivative of the left-hand side consists of a ( (-1)^n n! f(x) ) term plus other terms that are divisible by ( 1-x ).

Therefore, we have:   [   (-1)^n n! f(1) = sum_{i=1}^n a_i frac{b_i!}{(b_i-n)!}.   ]6.

Notice that the sum ( sum_{i=1}^n a_i frac{b_i!}{(b_i-n)!} ) is independent of ( a_i ) because the ( a_i ) terms cancel out due to the properties of the polynomial and the distinctness of ( b_i ).
