Overweight  ccould be due to two conditions of hormonal disturbance.. which in turn can lead to menstrual problems/ovulation problems(like pcod or thyroid problems)       You need to consult a gynecologist for normality of genital tract & endocrinologist to point out or exclude /confirm hormonal irregularity as a cause of lack of conception..

Among couples trying for pregnancy 80% of them conceive in the first year. 95% of them conceive by the end of second year. Therefore the delay in your wife conceiving could be part of this natural process.  What tests have you done so far?  It is necessary that your wife gets hormone tests and tubal latency test done and you get your semen analysis done. Based on these results, further treatment can be planned. To improve your chances of conception, you both  need to maintain normal BMI, stop smoking if smoker and have intercourse at least 3-4 times in a week. I hope this is helpful.

Count the first day of your cycle as day #12.  Most women ovulate on day#143.  Abstain from intercourse except for days 10/12/14/164.  Use an over the counter ovulation predictor kit to see how well you are timing thingsIt is normal to take up to a year to conceive.I hope that this helps and good luck!"},{"Patient":"Hi, im 24 years old female sexually active with my partner 7 yrs i have not been on birth control over 2 and a half years i use withdrawl method as contraception (not ttc but would be happy if so).

The guy that i was messing around with and didnt actually have intercourse with,  my boyfriend knows nothing about him.","Doctor":"Hello,Yes, pregnancy is possible without proper ejaculation. Precum or pre-ejaculatory fluid contains small amount sperm and it can cause pregnancy if you did sex or rubbing his penis on vagina during your ovulation time or fertile days.Here, you need to wait for upcoming period and do one home pregnancy test if you miss it.

I am Dr Ramadevi Wani. I will be answering your concerns today. From your notes it appears that you have problem with ovulation. You need to consult doctor and find out the reason for this ovulation problem. You need to do hormone tests. What is your BMI? Obesity can interfere with ovulation. So Maintain normal BMI.  At the same time you need to have fallopian tube latency test. Your husband needs to do semen analysis to confirm that it is normal. Based on all these results appropriate treatment can be planned. To improve your chances of conception you both need to stop smoking ( if smoker) and have intercourse 3-4 times in a week. Take a tablet of folic acid daily. Best wishes,Dr Rama"},{"Patient":"Hi, my husband and I have been trying to conceive for 5 months now with no luck. I am having pain in both overies and across my lower stomach.

Another thing, you did sex on safe period. Here, chance of pregnancy is extremely rare. However, the pill can cause delayed period for 1 to 2 weeks due to hormonal imbalance.

But when we did the ultrasound on 15th day the size of the follicle increased to 23mmX20mm with slight streak of bleeding but unruptured. Now the doctor has suggested to take Betnilan.

As size of follicle is progressing continue follicular study and injection done which helps in follicle release.The ovulation sticks indicate the level of LH in our body and an LH surge is diagnostic of ovulation.So, if ovulation sticks are not showing the positive result it means ovulation has not occurred yet.Hope this helps you.Regards"},{"Patient":"Dear Docteur appreciate your help, i did  prolactin level once early in the morning it was 25, i repeated it after one week after beeing awake for more than 3 hours and it was 46, My AMH level is 2.2, And im trying to get pregnant do you think its from my prolactin level that i didnt conceive yet?","Doctor":"Hi ur AMH level is also slightly less means ovarian reserve is not very good and this may be one of the reason of not conceiving .and yes prolactin level should be normal for u to conceive so start with Tab XXXX 0.5 mg once weekly for 4 wks and repeat ur prolactin level"},{"Patient":"Dr. i have been married 4 months before and having sex regularly. we both of us same blood group is A+ does the same blood group affect the pregnancy. or whats a good time of sex for pregnancy.

If you have regular cycle plan to have intercourse around day of ovulation.Your cervical mucous changes during your fertile period becoming more slippery, wet and clear - it's often described as having the look and feel of uncooked egg whites - indicating ovulation.Few tips to increase conception rates:Avoiding additional lubricants during sex.Choosing a sexual position that encourages deep penetration.Leaving the penis in the vagina until it goes soft after ejaculation. After sex, you can increase your chances of conception by lying flat for half an hour after sex.Being in the healthy weight rangeTo optimize conception, your partner should ideally avoid ejaculation for 2 -3 days before your fertile period to increase his sperm count.

Duramine contains phenteramine.Half life of phenteramine is around 25 hours.So, after stopping the drug by this time the drug might have cleared from circulation. But as there is around 20 kgs weight loss in your case, that may have some impact on menstrual cycle. And it may take some time for regularization of the hormonal levels. So, better to wait for one to two months. Possibly by that time, your cycles will get regularized. Then you can track the ovulation in next cycles and plan intercourse around that period. This will increase the possibility of pregnancy.

No luck..i wasnt even ovulating. my dr. Had me go get an ultra sound done and the radiologist pretty musc said everthing looked normal but you may have a bicornuate uterus but they couldnt tell for sure and recomended the mri and told me since i was 180 pounds it would probably help if you lose a lil wieght. So another few months went by with no success and we decided to just give it a break for now...so here we are 3 years later and about 5 months ago I was diagnosed with adhd and the dr.

Sometimes symptoms are premenstrual phase can mimic symptoms of early pregnancy due to hormonal effect. So, just by symptoms we cannot come to one conclusion regarding pregnancy.

Thanking you.","Doctor":"Dear Miss,Greetings!Welcome to Healthcare-Magic.Coming to your first question regarding menstrual flow, 4 days menstrual flow is very quite normal. Lesser than 2 days of bleeding classifies as epimenorrhoea and should be a cause of concern. Also please note as age increases the flow starts reducing. It also depends on your hemoglobin levels too. Four days bleeding is quite normal and there should not be any concern.Regarding your weight, your BMI is around 28, which falls under \\"normal\\" category. What you require is nutritious and well balanced diet. Do concentrate on well balanced diet and no worries on weight gain. This will help you with your pregnancy too.Coming to your next point, folvite is surely a beneficial drug during pregnancy especially 1st Trimester. I am not sure how much is your Hb levels, but advice you to start with Iron therapy and make sure it's above 10Gm before planning pregnancy.Wish you great health and successful pregnancy.Best regards,Dr. T.

Sometimes antibiotics can affect the function of birth control pills by disturbing their metabolism. But if you used the contraceptive pills as per the guidelines the possibility of pregnancy is less. For more details :   . telAs, you used condom also, if there was no ejaculation,  there is less possibility for pregnancy. So, continue to pills and wait till your expected date of withdrawal bleeding. Possibly you will get withdrawal bleeding as expected. If not consult gynecologist once and go for pregnancy test.

If we take ovacare tablets it will help for getting pregnent?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. The basic problem is that you are already perimenopausal. Your AMH values reflect your ovarian reserve. Ovarian reserve indicates the capacity of your ovaries to produce good quality and good number of egg follicles. This is diminished in your case. Also, the FSH values are high, indicating approaching menopause. There is very low scope for you to get pregnant naturally. Ovacare will not help you to achieve this. You must consult an experienced IVF practitioner at the earliest, and opt for IVF using donor eggs. Or else consider adoption.

Please doctor, I am very worried.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for using HCM.Even though you masturbated the night before, and had urinated throughout the morning before intercourse, the chance of being pregnant is there since you had inserted. But getting pregnant requires sperm to enter the vagina. So it is difficult to say whether she can become pregnant or not. If she is in the fertile period she can take emergency pill with in 3 days of intercourse to prevent conception. (Regular use of emergency pill is harmful)Conception occurs if she was in 10th to 18th day of her cycle(in a regular cycle of 28 day duration). You can ask her at what day she is in and wait for next cycle to occur. If it delayed by 7 days then get done UPT to diagnose if pregnant and then the required treatment can be taken.Regards"},{"Patient":"Am I PregnantMy Boyfriend And I Had Sex Back In September On A Sunday Night Woke Up The Next Morning And Did It Again Of Course Each Time He Ejaculated In Me.Like 2 To 3Weeks Later He Was Throwing Up Then In October I Had A Period In The First Week For 4Days Then I Was Off For A Whole Week Then Came On Again On The 18 Of October And This Time Is Was On For 3 Days I Usally Last For 4Days Here We Are In November And IM LATE!!!!!!!!!

Is there anything else I can do to help get pregnant quicker?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for the query. Poly cystic ovary disease presents with irregular periods, anovulation, insulin resistance etc. Metformin helps in treating the insulin resistance. The possibility of pregnancy depends on whether ovulation is occurring or not. As you are having irregular periods, it is difficult to guess the period of ovulation. So, after getting your periods, track the ovulation either by kit or by physiological methods. For more details :  plan unprotected intercourse around the time of ovulation. This will increase the possibility of pregnancy. If needed you can take tablets to induce withdrawal bleeding and for ovulation induction with your doctor's advice.

I understand your concern. Clomid is a drug which leads to stimulate follicular stimulating hormone FSH from pituitary gland  .. stimulates maturity of follicle  ( higher dose of the medicine can cause maturity of multiple follicles & cause twins/ triplets/ quadruplets & so on) .. These follicles  secretes estrogen  .. &  on full maturity of ovum... estrogen stimulates Leutinizing hormone secretion by pituitary gland  which is responsible for ovulation.     Soy isoflavone are known to help in estrogen production by body ... & thereby helps ovulation.      Somehow it is not proven  to influence FSH secretion by pituitary for more follicles to mature... Some how Isoflavones action is unpredictable in this respect... so it's not sure to cause twin or triplet pregnancy like Clomid.

Most of the cases that respond do so within the first two months and the overall success rate is about 30-40%. The hormonal injections are meant to accelerate ovulation. There is a risk of ovarian hyper-stimulation and this is the reason for close monitoring. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I been trying for a baby for a year and no look .my periods for two months are coming every 24.instead of 28 .but are only two days long however 9 days after my period.

Your symptoms cannot be clearly related to pregnancy as they are varied. Also, there appears to be some urethritis and this needs to be treated. Please see a specialist for a proper evaluation, get a sonogram-pelvic and trans-vaginal, urinalysis and blood counts. The pain in the rib cage needs to be assessed too. Hope your query has been clarified. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"I am trying to conceive and I am confused about when to have sex in reguards to cervical mucus. My last period was 10/27/13. I started having some ovulation discomfort 11/8/13, egg white mucous on 11/11/13, and watery mucous on 11/12/13. We had sex on 11/7,11/8,11/10 and 11/11. Was that right or did my fertile period start after the egg whites? I also still have ovulation discomfort. I am just confused on how to tell best when the egg is realsed?","Doctor":"Hi,To know exactly when ovulation has occurred is a little difficult. You can predict it happening within 12 hours with a basal body temperature chart while ovulation kits can predict within 30 hours. Ovulation is usually associated with watery discharge. In a regular cycle, ovulation correspond to the 14th day before the onset of the next period, i.e., it occurs on the 14th day in a 28-day cycle and on the 16th day in a 30-day cycle. Intercourse should take place at least on alternate days during the fertile period.

And till now on 3rd oct I am just spotting.I had regular periods this is first time in am facing this problem.Do I get pregnant or some other problem...?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for the query. In case of regular 28 to 30 days cycles, usually ovulation occur on 14th to 16th day. In that case the possibility of conception is somewhat less in your case. As you had bleeding immediately after intercourse, the possible causes are :- Post coital tear. - Local causes like cervical erosion, polyps etc. So, better to consult gynecologist once and get examined.By local examination the actual cause of the problem can be identified and treated. In case of post coital tear, depending on the extent of the tear sometimes suturing may be needed. Cervical erosion etc can be treated with medicines initially. In case of severe problem sometimes cryotherapy etc may be needed. In the next cycle, track the ovulation and plan intercourse around that period. This will increase the possibility of pregnancy.

Please what can I do to boost the production of fertile cervical mucous during ovulation.","Doctor":"Hello,Yes, folic acid can be taken on a daily basis as a prenatal vitamin. If ovulation status has been achieved on a regular basis and the hormonal profile is normal, there is no need of additional hormonal supplementation. If needed, your doctor may prescribe progesterone supplements to be used during the latter half of the cycle. Checking of tubal patency also is necessary if you do not see any result after at least six months of trying. Hope you find this information useful.

There is always the chance of you getting pregnant (well that was just for some information).As for your worry, the symptoms you are presenting such as spotting may rather be related to contraceptive withdrawal other than pregnancy. It is true that implantation bleeding usually presents as spotting but I doubt if that is the case given the scenario that you have described. How ever, since we can never be 100% sure, it is always best to do pregnancy test if next period is missed or wait for say 2-3 weeks before conducting a test. In the mean time, just be calm and concentrate on other stuffs.Hope this helps and wish you the best"},{"Patient":"Hi doc.. I'm 24. We got married 2yrs ago.

In early stages of PCOD hormonal imbalance may not manifest sometimes. But there is possibility that it may lead to hormonal imbalance in future. If you are having regular ovulatory cycles, you can plan for pregnancy now. With your doctor's advice, you can go for ovulation induction and follicular study. Then plan intercourse around the time of ovulation, this will increase the possibility of pregnancy. If there is problem with ovulation, better to use insulin sensitizers like metformin for few months. This may help in increasing the fertility rate.

My partner had some liquid on the tip of his penis, but he didn't ejaculate for another 10 minutes or so. The thing that worries me most is that from what I've just read, there is sperm in even that little drop, and if he fingered me after (I don't remember what order everything was) it could've entered my vagina and possibly fertilized an egg, and I'm probably a week or two from my next period (My periods are not very regular, and I'm 18 years old). What is the likelyhood, and what should I do? Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi,You are right. Even a drop of ejaculate or even the pre-ejaculate is sufficient to cause conception during the fertile period. As of now, you will have to wait until your next period and if you miss it, go for a pregnancy test 3-7 days later. Else, you can get a serum beta-hCG titre studied two weeks from the time of intercourse. This can be conclusive. Please see a specialist for further management. Hope you find this information useful.

If you have been trying to conceive for only 6 months, infertility treatment is not usually started until at least 9-12 months after failure of spontaneous pregnancy to occur. The cyst may be an incidental finding. As of now you do not need to do anything. Wait for 1-2 months for the cyst to regress. By this time try for natural conception. Repeat an ultrasound around day 12 of the cycle after 2 months to see for the cyst as well as any dominant follicle. If spontaneous conception does not occur in next 3-6 months, have yourself as well as your husband investigated for any potential problem. It is better that you consult an infertility specialist at that point.  As of now, I recommend that you wait for at least 2 months before any other active intervention is done.

If it is positive, visit your obstetrician early [immediately if possible] as this is a precious pregnancy and an open cervix may indicate a threatened abortion. If the test is negative, repeat it after another 7 days, if still negative than I suggest the following measures need to be taken.If you are trying to conceive, birth control pills is not the first line treatment for irregular periods.If a couple is not able to conceive after 1 year of regular sexual contact we label them as having problems with fertility. Both you and your husband need to be evaluated regarding the causes. For any couple in my clinic with similar complaints, the first line is a gynec examination and pelvic ultrasound for the woman and her husbands semen analysis. The next is a hormonal evaluation of the woman. Further investigations and treatment are based upon the results of these tests. So get a pregnancy test done and if positive, congratulations!. If negative, do not get disheartened, visit a specialist and get yourself evaluated and you will conceive.

My cycle is of 28 days nd itr regular. I just wanted to know what are my chances of pregnancy. I had released both eggs from both the ovaries. And im having white discharge that i never had before.","Doctor":"Hello PiaThanks for your query.As you have ovulated , chances of conception should be pretty good for you.IUI in good centres has a 15 - 20 % success rate, so your chances of pregnancy also should be the same.Do not stress out, just because you are one day overdue.Wait for a couple of days more, and then take a pregnancy test to confirm.If one more cycle of IUI fails, then you can go for fallopian tube patency testing.If the tubes are found to be blocked, then IVF maybe required.All the best."},{"Patient":"Hi,I am trying to conceive for second child after 5 years. My age is 36 yrs. I am on clomid from day 2 and when the scan was taken on day 9 only one follicle of size 8mm was found. Also last cycle, there was one follicle of size 22 mm on day 9. Why the follicles are irregular every cycle and is thee any chance to conceive this month?","Doctor":"HelloThanks for your query.Just one monitoring scan on day 9 is totally insufficient to tell you about chances of conception.Follicular monitoring includes serial ultrasound scans throughout the cycle.the follicle is followed atleast upto day 14 - 15, when normally ovulation occurs.On day 9, follicle size of 8 mm is normal, but size of 22 mm is too big.22 mm on day 9 indicates a follicular cyst, maybe remnant of previous cycle.Track the entire cycle to know whether cycle is ovulatory or not, if ovulation is not observed, you can go for further testing of ovarian reserve, hormonal assessment of PCOD etc.take care."},{"Patient":"hi doctor im priyanka and had been diagnosed with PCOD and i was under medication for it i go my periods on 7th of October and on 18th i had done the follicular study in which my right side of the ovary was 10 mm and my gynecologist asked to do a follicular study again on 24th of October what should be done next????? will i become pregnant are they any chances in this month??????? plz help me thank you.","Doctor":"Hi Priyanka,Thank you for choosing Healthcaremagic. Chances of pregnancy cannot be predicted right now, you need to have follow up scans, if the follicle grows well and reaches the dominant size, then injection HCG can be given for the ovulation to occur.Please ask if you have more questions.

The ultrasound is not showing any follicle on day 16 so you may have ovulated already. The best test to actually know if a woman is ovulating is ovulation study, where a scan is done every day. Starting from day 10 to see if a follicle is developing and if actual ovulation is taking place. Since this has not been done, prescribing Siphene directly will not give results. This is usually combined with an IUI [Intrauterine insemination procedure], that is direct instillation of semen into the uterus, as sometimes there are certain components in the cervical and vaginal secretions that do not allow ascent of sperms. Any abnormalities in sperm deposition in the vagina are also countered by this. Another important cause is problems in the sperm. If a semen analysis test has not been done, get your husband to do it as early as possible as 30% cases of infertility are due to problems in males. So, I suggest that you do an ovulation study and an IUI if ovulation is occurring after your husbands semen analysis. If there are no results with this, a laproscopy+hysteroscopy and an analysis of the endometrium for infection or abnormalities needs to be done. Hope this was helpful. Keep taking regular treatment and you will conceive. Thanks for using health care magic and best of luck."},{"Patient":"Hi,I am benazir. i have consulted my doctor regarding pregnancy.

I advise you to consult a physician for diagnosis and treatment.                        Take more of green leafy vegetables, pulses, sprouts, and proteine rich foods. Thank you."},{"Patient":"We completed the 1 years of our marriage,we are planning for baby,I have irregular periods.I consulted doctor, after all tests they said i have PCO..my doctor suggested to take folic acid tablets daily and goodova 50mg on day 3 of periods till 7th day,scan on 8th day .. is it right treatment? whether i will pregnant . i am very tensed about this..please suggest me..","Doctor":"Hi, Please do not get tense as PCOS is a common problem nowadays. However there are different varieties of PCO depending upon the type of hormonal imbalance. Let me explain the problem in PCO. Normally every month one ovum is produced and released in the female reproductive organs usually 14 days before the onset of periods. If on that day the sperm unites with it, pregnancy will result. In PCO the ovum remains trapped in the ovary and hence cannot meet the sperm and so pregnancy does not occur. Tablet goodova is a good initial line of treatment for this as it helps the ovum to mature and release [helps ovulation to occur]. It must combined with an ultrasound to see if the ovum is actually released. An HcG injection may be used to help this process. If sexual contact occurs at the time of ovulation then pregnancy may occur. So this treatment may help. If pregnancy does not occur after 3 cycles a laparoscopy and drilling of the cysts has excellent results.There are a few more things that I want to clarify: PCO may  be caused by any of numerous hormonal imbalances. So it is important that a complete hormonal profile called the PCOD profile must be done on day 2 or 3 of periods. If there is any abnormality it must be treated. Drugs like metformin are helpful in some cases. You need to discuss this with your treating Gynecologist. Another thing is lifestyle modification which has amazing results, regular exercise, weight loss of 3-4 kilos, no sugar, no fat diet and meditation help to decrease the imbalance and induce ovulation. So please try these along with the other treatments. Hope this was helpful. Don't worry and best of luck.

Me and my husband have been trying to conceive for the past 3 months...","Doctor":"Hi,If everything else is normal, there is no need to worry about the shortening of the cycles. It happens with slight fluctuation in hormone levels. See a specialist if you fail to conceive after sincerely trying for at least 6 months. Please time your intercourse regularly around the ovulation period. You may also get your thyroid profile done to see if there is any deficiency that needs to be supplemented. Please maintain a healthy body weight and a healthy diet. Hope you find this information helpful. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi my name is Erin, I have not had my period in just about 5 years now.

Weight reduction means, there is no need of drastic reduction. Reduction of 1 to 2 kgs can also help in regularization of the cycles. Then you can gradually decrease the weight. To do IUI also, you have to ovulate.In IUI during the time of ovulation,  your husband's semen will be injected into your uterus. So for that also ovulation is needed. If your doctor suggests you can go for ovulation induction. Then plan for follicular study to track the ovulation.And you can plan IUI at that time with your doctor's advice.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, I'm planning on having a baby. I do have my periods.

In case of regular 28 to 30 days cycles, usually ovulation will occur on around 14th to 16th days.As the ovum can survive for 24 hours, there is some possibility of pregnancy. If the pre ejaculate fluid had few spermatozoa, that may lead to fertilization of the ovum. You wait till your expected date of periods, if you miss the periods go for pregnancy test once. If the test comes positive, consult gynecologist and continue with regular checkups. If the test comes negative, possibly you may get periods. Then in the next cycle, you track the ovulation and plan intercourse around that period. This will increase the possibility of pregnancy.

In this time, you have to undergo regular unprotected sex to maximize the chance of pregnancy.You can use ovulation prediction kit in the mid cycle to track or predict ovulation time and prepare for that.Take balanced diet with vitamin-E & folic acid supplements.

Nipple discharge may be due to high prolactin level and small amount is quite physiological. Here, you must consult with your doctor for other tests and examination if you don't get your period after negative pregnancy test.In the mean time. you must take balanced diet, drink plenty water, avoid stress, keep bowel habit regular, use face wash & cleanser regularly and take adequate rest. Practice safe sex in future.

You have to track down your ovulation through Ovulation Prediction Kit and have to involve in unprotected sex without any contraceptive method at that time (mid cycle or 14 days prior to due date) to maximize the chance.In the mean time, you must take folic acid and vitamin-E supplements for at least 3 months.

Yo have tested early for the result to be obvious. Please wait for a few more days and repeat the test. If you wish for an earlier confirmation, please get the blood pregnancy test done. This is more specific and sensitive as well. This would be better in your case as you have irregular periods and the exact date of ovulation cannot be predicted. Your symptoms suggest very early pregnancy. Hope you find this information useful. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"Hi about 4 months ago me and my gf had protected sex.

Now its october and the shot exspired and she just got her period yesterday and today it just went away and shes been getting bigger and gaining more weight and having stomach aces. Could she be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello,Pregnancy is less likely in the current scenario. The symptoms are more likely to be due to the depo-shot. Weight gain and stomach ache can be seen while on hormonal contraception. After having normal periods after the intercourse, there is usually no need to worry about pregnancy. If you still want to exclude, you should go for the serum beta-hCG assay along with a pelvic/trans-vaginal sonogram and see a specialist for further management.

I am currently 18 weeks pregnant, due March 12th. My LMP was June 5th. I have used many conception calculators and they all say my most probable date of ovulation and was June 19th. Is there any way possible that I could have conceived a week later on the 26th? Thank you for your time reading, advice much needed.","Doctor":"Hi,If you had 28-day cycles prior to conception, you could have ovulated on 18th or 19th of June in all probability. If the length of the cycle was a little longer, the ovulation date would similarly change, but at any time, it is 14 days prior to the due date of the next cycle. So, I think you have understood the strategy behind calculation of ovulation date. Late ovulation does happen occasionally when there is an episodic hormonal disturbance, but is not the usual scene.

It is very safe. If you are pregnant, it will support your pregnancy. If you are not pregnant, it will induce your periods. Periods can get delayed due to stress also. But if your periods are irregular, do a thyroid profile, and prolactin level and an ultrasound done to see uterus and ovaries to rule out any thyroid disorder or polycystic ovarian syndrome.Hope I have answered your query.

If you usually have your periods around a week late, you should perform the test after this week of waiting is over which I think you have already done.

The spotting could be premenstrual. It does happen sometimes when there is a mild hormonal imbalance owing to stress. Please wait for a couple of days for your period to set in.

My fiancé and I started ttc back in May of this year(2013) In June, I had the heaviest period I have ever experienced in my life. I passed large clots for about 2 days with severe back pain. At that point, I honestly figured IF I was pregnant, that I miscarried. July, I had no period at all. I immediately got concerned and went in for an ultrasound. My DR said that I have \\"three small cysts that did not seem alarming, and that they are probably the cause of the new irregular periods.\\"  My fiancé and I decided to ttc again, hoping that the cysts were now gone and that I would be okay. Fast forward through August(no period AGAIN) and September. I was at work and felt an almost gush of fluid. I ran to the bathroom to see that I once again was passing HUGE clots. I was in so so much pain that seemed to radiate from my lower right back to my lower right front. I called the dr. and he said \\"it is prob. another cyst rupturing, that I should not be concerned unless it lasted for more then 3 hours.\\" I honestly went through 9 heavy tampons in 2 hours. The tissue also seemed to, pardon the bluntness, but pass around the tampons! After that, I felt great. WELL, now we are on to October.  My breasts are rediculuously huge. The only weight I have gained besides in my chests, is right along my waist line. Not a fat type weight, but a firm bloated type. I am not passing gas or having stool issues. It almost feels like something on my lower left abdomen side moves randomly.  I took three hpt today just to rule it out. Negative.Go figure. Anyone have any sort of knowledge they can share with me?

Is there a chance of being pregnant? just recently i started to feel sick to the stomach and care of wired in the stomach.Additional DetailsThis was my first pack of pills and started taking the seven day pills first. Am sorry i've wording it wrong. I did not take any pills last month. Is there a change of baby?","Doctor":"Hi, if you came to my clinic with those complaints I would ask you  to stop worrying. Many women that start using the pills for the first time experience similar problems. I understand that you have taken the inactive pills first and then started on the active pills. Also, you have had had intercourse only after your period was over that is about 11 days ago. The chances of pregnancy occurring after a single act of unprotected sexual intercourse are only 4%. Also for women that have regular periods the chance of getting pregnant is more if intercourse occurs after 11-12 days since the first day of the period. Hence the chances of getting pregnant are low if you have had contact before this period. You are also having a sick feeling in the stomach and most probably a cramp like feeling. This may be due to the pills as some females take time to get adjusted and may improve with continuous use and by taking the pills with food. The pills are not known to cause any major effect on the baby if they are inadvertently taken in early pregnancy. Since you have started taking the active pills late, I would recommend that you use a backup contraceptive measure like condoms, for the next 7 days while you still take the pills to avoid pregnancy. I would be pleased to answer any further queries that you may have, enjoy a wonderful day."},{"Patient":"Hi I turned 30 in April( just a couple months ago) and since I remember I've had very regular periods, but it's been about 2.5 months that I haven't got any, the las time I got my period was July 22nd and since then nothingI'm not pregnant got my blood work done everything was absolutely normal and after that I got another blood work to check for my hormones it came back normal.I lost a little bit of weight in the past couple months npbut nothing major and I work out 3-5 times a week( it's been about 6 years that I've been working out regularly).I've been married for 8 years and never tried to make babies but now with all this missing periods thing getting worried!Should I be worried at all or is it normal to miss some periods,when should I be worrie?","Doctor":"Hello,Missed period for 2.5 months is not normal. There are several reasons of missed period like ovarian cyst or PCOS, hormonal imbalance, mental stress or depression, taking psychiatric medication, over weight, pelvic infection, anemia, improper diet habit etc. Here, I suggest you to undergo some investigations like pelvic ultrasound scan, hormone test (thyroid, LH/ FSH, testosterone), blood Hb% & sugar level etc. These will help to make a diagnosis and give proper treatment.

She's been close to 2 weeks late for her period. She's had unprotected sex twice. And she's constantly getting sharp needle pains in her lower back and cramps daily. *she only gets cramps the DAY OF her period*. Her appetite has increased and so has the use of the restroom. But she took 2 e.p.t and they both came out negative. Do you have any suggestions on what it could be? Or do you think she is pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello,Late conception has to be ruled out by one blood test for beta-hCG if she took 2 pregnancy tests in very early weeks.Other possibilities are PMS, pelvic or urinary infection, endometriosis etc. Here, I suggest to undergo one pelvic USG scan and urine test - routine & culture to pinpoint the diagnosis. Kindly, consult with her doctor for proper examination.In the mean time, she must take balanced diet, drink plenty water, keep bowel habit regular, take some anti-spasmodic medication (drotaverine) and apply muscle relaxant gel on the back/ take hot compression.

Age is a major concern regarding fertility as advancing age means reduced fertility as regards ovarian reserve, disrupted hormonal milieu, infrequent ovulation etc.  At your age, you will need assistance and more so as you have been trying for 2 years.

I also suffer badly with depression and this desperation of wanting a baby so badly seems to be making the depression worse please help me","Doctor":"Hi, I think you should reduce your depression first. Stress can drastically affect your ovulation and reduce chances of pregnancy.  Try some yoga and meditation.  Go for a vacation and relax for some time. Do a thyroid profile and prolactin level also. You can try naturally for 6 Months. Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.

Unless pregnancy is excluded, do not go for withdrawal bleeding. If you are trying to conceive, getting a regular withdrawal bleed will not be enough. You need to ovulate regularly.

This month my period started on 5th when I want to go to Gynecologist to check my ovalation?","Doctor":"Hi,Glycomet helps to induce ovulation by lowering insulin resistance in PCOD. This will help in regularizing the cycles in the majority. If you have had your cycle on the 5th, You are likely to ovulate around 18th-20th if you have a 28-30 day cycle. So, you can see your gynecologist after you finish your period for a follow up. You can also track your ovulation status through BBT chart and ovulation kits. Hope you find this information useful.

According to one, if a man masturbates, then washes his hands and immediately stimulates his partner with his fingers it's possible to impregnate her. Another states that sperm near the labia could also lead to impregnation compined with vaginal fluids. However, it's unclear to me whether such possibilities are really substantial.So what I'm actually asking is how safe/unsafe such cases are in terms of sex and ejaculation.","Doctor":"Such possibilities are there but rare. As after the semen ejaculation near labia the sperm has ability to run and his life is just one day. If you see under the microscope they have a very good speed. but the chances are rare as its a big distance to cover but one can't give 100% guarantee for it."},{"Patient":"hiI m 26 year old & i have lots of Cough so Doctor gave me 2 Time Diprofos inj 2ml with in 6 moth, and we are planing a baby . how long will it stay in my Blood ? when can we hope & plan a baby ?what s side effects on Periods Cycles?

This belongs to category C drug in pregnancy according to FDA. It will be excreated through kidney. The half life is 36 to 54 hours.

In case of an early abortion, the pregnancy tests can remain positive for quite some time up to 2-3 weeks as it takes time for the hormone levels to decline, though the sonogram shows empty uterus. Abnormal location of the gestation sac also should be looked for. Please take further suggestions from your consultant.

Now , regarding the intercourse, you can have intercourse every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop. You can also start that from 12th day counting the starting of your period as day 1, not after finishing Siphene. You can track your ovulation by repeated ultrasound and when follicle is more than 17 to 18 mmm, take injection for rupture.

When will it stop bleeding ?","Doctor":"Hello,Rough sex is the possible cause of blunt trauma around cervix or vaginal region. Other reasons are pelvic infection, cervical polyp etc.In most cases, bleeding stops automatically and no treatment is required. If it is continued more than 3 days, then I suggest to consult with gynecologist for pelvic examination and management of the case.Good luck and practice safe sex."},{"Patient":"I took Emkit (emergency contraceptive pill) Levonorgestrel 0.75mg 48 hours after unprotected sex however i took 1 tablet after 48 hours and I was supposed to take the 2nd dose 12 hours later but I took it 48 hours later.

However, taking postinor 2 after 48 hrs gives protection around 58%. You will get a withdrawal bleeding within 7 days.You have to wait for next coming period and if it is delayed more than 7 days, one home pregnancy test is advisable.Practice safe sex.

In this state, you cannot expect a positive urine pregnancy test even if you had conceived owing to delayed ovulation. I would suggest a serum beta-hCG assay as it is more sensitive, specific and confirmatory. If pregnancy is excluded, you should get evaluated for the cause of the recent delayed periods; also please try to maintain a healthy weight and take healthy diet.

I do not see how you can get pregnant (if your description is correct). Stress alone and change lifestyle can cause missed period. Your period will definitely be back before you know it and if it persist (i.e you not seeing your period) after 1-2 weeks from now, it is best you see a gynobs for further investigation. Pregnancy will always be ruled out in any sexually active reproductive woman with a missed period and you are an idle candidate (as one never knows). Just stay calm and continue your daily activities. If pregnancy is not the cause as I suspect, you will be fine.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi, I had unprotected sex on last Thursday and Saturday and I had emergency contraceptive pill on Saturday. my periods were due on Saturday. I still haven't got my periods and I am feeling pukish and lethargic. is there a chance I am pregnent or is can be a side effect of the pill. I am also having brown discharge everyday since Saturday.","Doctor":"Hi,First of all, you cannot get pregnant with an intercourse just before the onset of period as ovulation occurs 14 days before the onset of a period and this is the fertile period which can cause conception. Moreover, emergency pill contains excess hormone and this causes disruption of the normal hormonal milieu of the body. This results in breakthrough bleed, menstrual disturbances and delayed periods. If you do not see a period even 10-14 days after your period is due, you should see a specialist for further help.

There are several factors that influence conception, pregnancy maintenance and delivery. You are slightly overweight and please try to lower your weight by 5-6 kg. through exercise and this also helps to tone up the body since you are young. Maintain a healthy diet and avoid stress.

Should I start taking it again to conceive.","Doctor":"Hello,Above medications are quite helpful to get regular period with proper ovulation and facilitating chance of conception. But, you must consult with your doctor for overall check up with relevant investigation before taking these medication.Do unprotected sex close to ovulation day (14 days prior to due date) or within fertile days for high chance.

I understand your concern.  Conception needs deposition of semen in female genitals   So just touching of the genitals (without eñering or  añy discharge)  can not cause  conception.

Left fallopian tube is outlined in its proximal extent. Venous extravasation of contrast is noted without peritoneal spill\\". My question is, how can this be treated so that normal conception can take place.","Doctor":"Hi,If milking was done to treat the prior ectopic pregnancy, chances of retaining tubal function are very good. Laparoscopic release of any adhesions and restoration of the patency of the tubes can be done. Natural conception can then be tried, but with caution in view of the past history and the tubal blocks that developed. Tubal reconstructive surgery under skilled hands may be needed when there is damage to part of the tube. Hope you find this information useful. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, i was on Depo provera for almost 2 years.

If you can wait for your next period, you can get a urine pregnancy test 3-7 days later if you miss it, with a fresh early morning sample of urine.

Though you had unprotected intercourse around that period, the emergency pill, if taken within the stipulated time, would help. Still, it is better to be cautious and use a regular contraception.

I should say that the prescription of ovulation induction should be done once all the standard investigations are done and ovulation needs to be induced.

As your intercourse happened during the early part of the cycle which is considered the absolutely safe period for her, there was no need for an emergency pill also. It is the time around the mid-cycle that is considered unsafe. As the emergency pill contains excess hormone, the natural hormonal milieu is disturbed and as a result, the next period will get delayed and this is what has happened to your friend. If she does not get her next cycle within a fortnight after she is due, please see a specialist for further support. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello. I am an 18 year old girl, my name is Kelsie. My husband and I have been trying to conceive for about one year and 6 months. I usually have a period every 29-30 days, but i havent had my period at all this month, no spotting or cramping or anything. my last period was August 9th, 2013. It is now September 13th, 2013. I use a \\"period tracker\\" app on my phone to help me keep track. My husband and I try to have sex every day and if not every day its every other day. I am taking multivitamins right now every day. My husband is 21 and very healthy. His last checkup his Dr. told him that his reproductive organs were fine and that his sperm count was high too. I go to a yearly checkup every april, and this past one my Dr. said i was fine and as long as i took at least a multivitamin every day that I would be able to conceive. That is exactally what I have done, so I dont know if my Dr. falsely informed me and something is wrong or that I am simply not doing something right. My periods have never been regular and i usually ovulate between 3-4 days after my period ends, which is usually a 4 day cycle. This month I have felt different. For the past 2 days, periodically throughout the day, I have a queezy feeling and when i even smell my favorite foods, I feel like im going to be sick. What could be wrong? What should I do to higher my chances to conceving? Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Hi there! Welcome to H.C.M.Forum!You say your periods are late by 4-5 days. Have you taken a pregnancy test yet? These days,kits which detect pregnancy as early as the first day of the missed period, are available.Two lines would suggest pregnancy, one line negative and an invalid line would suggest that you may have to repeat the test. If negative, then why dont you conduct a detailed checkup with your gynecologist? Since your husband's report seems to be fine, you can also get yourself tested for your hormonal levels. Your gynecologist may also suggest other tests like ultrasound and the like. Do continue with the multivitamins. As for your symptoms, though they seem to be similar to symptoms associated with morning sickness, 4-5 days after a missed period might be quite early for the symptoms to exhibit ( even if pregnant). But yes, do take a pregnancy test nevertheless. Sometimes, the couple may be perfectly fine yet may take time to conceive. Avoid stress at all costs for it may hamper your chances.Good luck!"},{"Patient":"My last period was on 8-20-13. I had sex on 9-1-13. I ovulated on 9-3-13. I'm also on birth control pill.

It is too early for urine pregnancy tests to come back positive. Please get your serum beta-hCG levels estimated as this gives you definite evidence for confirmation/exclusion of pregnancy.

So, you can track your ovulation by repeated ultrasound or by ovulation detection kits and see if ovulation is happening or not. If ovulation is happening, you can try naturally for 6 months.

After stopping the contraceptive pills,  the time of recurrence of regular periods differ from person to person. As you got periods after stopping the pills,  possibly in one to two months your hormonal levels can come to normal.After that you can plan for pregnancy. Once your cycles become normal,  you track your ovulation and plan intercourse around that period. That will increase the possibility of pregnancy.

The possibility of pregnancy is less in your case, as when you had intercourse you were still under the effect of the implanon. The bleeding you got after removal of the implanon could be withdrawal bleeding. If you do not had intercourse after removal of implanon the possibility of pregnancy is very less.

With the past history of recurrent abortions, hormonal imbalance should be suspected. Metformin corrects ovulation disturbances by maintaining insulin balance. Also, the causes for the abortions in the past should be known for further management. If pregnancy is excluded, and no obvious cause for the excess discharge and pain can be seen, you can use some antispasmodic and take rest.

Keeping in shape is always a healthy way to live. Skipping, like jumping rope, is a wonderful aerobic exercise. Skipping will not be harmful to your uterus nor should it cause any future fertility problems. Like anything, however, taken to an extreme (such as long distance running) addictive aerobic exercise can create hormone imbalances that reduce fertility. If you keep your skipping workouts to a reasonable amount of time, such as 20-30 minutes three times a week, you will avoid these hormone suppression problems.

The birth control implant is very effective unless it's been in place for more than the recommended time period.

I am on birth control but we don't use condoms and I know its supposed to be 99% but I've heard of others getting pregnant while on birth control.. also today i started getting light brown spotting but only when i go to the bathroom.Just wondering with all this information if there's a chance I could be pregnant?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question. It is important to realize that if you are sexually active, there is always the chance of pregnancy, even if you are using birth control. Oral contraceptives are, in fact, 99% effective. They are so effective that if 100 women used a birth control pill as directed, only one of them would become pregnant in any given year. However, that is still 1 percent of women pregnant using a birth control pill as directed.Birth control pill doses have gotten much lighter over the past twenty years, so formation of ovarian cysts is still possible. I did a study on this several years ago, showing that women may still form ovarian cysts on lighter dose birth control pills, although they usually do not ovulate. That is the mechanism for prevention of pregnancy.Ovarian cysts can make hormones which may produce symptoms in women that mimic pregnancy. A pregnancy test for you is in order and your gynecologist may also recommend an ultrasound of the pelvis to detect any ovarian cyst formation. Hormone production from the ovary may also produce the light spotting you are experiencing. Remember, however, that any amount of bleeding on a birth control pill may signify a menstrual period. Menstrual periods on birth control pills are drug induced and not really \\"normal\\". I hope this answers your questions. I am available for further consultation if needed."},{"Patient":"hi mam, i am Dr. Bharathi Vijay had my miscarriage 2 1/2months back. my doc toid me dat i can plan for next after 3 regular periods. but as per her instructions i got my rubella screnning after 1 1/2 month of miscarriage which came to be positive for rubella igG positive 12 iu/ml. so do i have to skip my planning for pregnancy..? if so for how long.?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question. It is recommended after Rubella vaccination that women postpone any future pregnancy for three months since this is a live virus vaccine. If the vaccine is given at the end of a pregnancy, even for a miscarriage, that is the most effective timing. Many women do not resume normal ovulation for approximately three months after the end of a pregnancy.I hope this answers your question but I am available for further consultation."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, I want to learn tailoring, but there are people saying that using a sewing machine (esp foot pedal) will have a negative effect if i am trying to get pregnant. is it true?? not able to find any details on net.  I am planning to get pedal motor for my machine. for that also my friends are saying, that magnet of running motor will have side effect. Please guide me..","Doctor":"Hi,There is no established relationship between using a sewing machine and fertility. It is true that any severe exertion during the early stages of pregnancy when the embryo implants into the uterus can cause a miscarriage. It is perhaps in this context that the notion of fertility being affected exists. A pedal motor causes vibrations and as such can cause miscarriages while it is used during early pregnancy. If you are trying to conceive now, it would be better if you can postpone your plans for the time being. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I have a normal 28 day menstral cycle and my last period started on August 4.  My partner and I have been trying for a baby and as of today my period is a week late.

If all tests normal then get in study of ovarian follicle ( whether they mature or not mature , if mature than they attain full size for ovulation and burst or not for release of ovum) .

Get a thyroid profile and prolactin level and a ultrasound done to see if there is any problem in these things. You can try with Clomid. It is given to increase the size of follicles. Track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound and when follicle is more than 17 to 18 mmm, take injection for rupture.  Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks after rupture is confirmed on ultrasound. Do a urine pregnancy test after that.

However, after ovulation, follicle size does not grow much due to release of ovum.

Reason being that most drugs prescribed for infertility or trial to conceive, could present with some interactions, resulting in modifications of some blood measures or hormones measured in blood., A knowledge of the drugs the patients are taken are important for the interpretation of these results.Secondly, high prolactin level deserve to exclude that you do not have any problem with your small or your sight. In case you do have any of these symptoms, including chronic headaches, a possibility of a brain tumor called a prolactinoma should be raised and excluded. A brain CT scan and MRI could be necessary under these conditions. Using metformin to lose weight to me does not look very healthy.

It may also be that you are perfectly normal and are really pregnant. Let us consider both situations and what needs to be done.1. If you are possibly pregnant:Please do home pregnancy test at least 15 days after probable unprotected sexual intercourse. There is more than 95% chance that it will confirm a positive pregnancy.2. To rule out polycystic ovarian syndrome:Symptoms tend to be mild at first. You may have only a few symptoms or a lot of them. The most common symptoms are:Acne.Weight gain and trouble losing weight.Extra hair on the face and body. Often women get thicker and darker facial hair and more hair on the chest, belly, and back.Thinning hair on the scalp.Irregular periods. Often women with PCOS have fewer than nine periods a year. Some women have no periods. Others have very heavy bleeding.Fertility problems. Many women who have PCOS have trouble getting pregnant (infertility).Depression.Most women with PCOS grow many small cysts and the ovaries enlarge in size.

My husband and I were planning on trying for a baby. Should I put it off until I get the results back from my next colposcopy? I'd prefer not to delay for another 6/7 months but if there is a risk involved my health is more important...","Doctor":"3)  Hi,     The colposcopy with CIN 1 means you have HPV infection.      Mostly, the infection goes by itself, because of your body resistance. That is why the repeat colposcopy after 6 months.       It is better to have a confirmed view, before conceiving.              One can have concern about getting pregnancy/passing the infection to the baby. However, with following care, one can plan for a safe pregnancy & delivery       1) -Plan for yearly pelvic examination & PAP smear.           - Be sure you do not have vaginal warts, while trying to conceive. These warts are highly infective &may infect your partner at the time of sex.               He should be vaccinated for genital warts.       2) Get the warts treated before conception. Electric current, chemicals or surgery are the ways to treat them.       3) If your PAP smear shows precancerous cells, your doctor will take care & avoid its progress during the pregnancy.   Usually after delivery, the cells resolve.       4 )Visit your doctor for regular checkups &advice for preventing pregnancy complications , if any.            HPV mostly does not have adverse effect on pregnancy/delivery.            Normal delivery is possible in absence of vaginal warts, good pelvis, good labour pains.             Normal delivery with vaginal warts may result in infection to baby’s nasal passage.is usually treated by laser treatment.      Wish you all the best.

Please continue folic acid during this process.Wish you all the best, take care!"},{"Patient":"Hi I am a 33 year old female weighing 245 pounds and I have not had a cycle in over 9 years.

I've been on the petogen injection for 4 years. My follow up injection was suppose to be in March 2013 but I didn't go as my husband & I are planning to have another baby. I didn't get my period yet & for the last two weeks my breast has been so painful, heavy & tender so bad I'm finding it hard to get up. Could this be because I stopped the injection or can it be something more serious? Another question I have is can I fall pregnant if I didn't get my period yet?Please advice as I am really worried","Doctor":"Hi,     The Petogen  injection is  for contraception. It's a hormonal preparation.On withdrawal of the injection,the time taken for the periods normalis 4-6 months.     The breast discomfort & the delayed period is mostly due to the hormonal changes brought about by stopping the injection.      The pregnancy is possible only after menses come back to normal.       If you are very much eager a USG can give the clear picture at the moment.

You also took Nordette as emergency contraceptive pill within 12 hrs. Here, chance of pregnancy is quite low.Vaginal bleeding after one week occurs due to withdrawal effect of the pill. It is a normal phenomena. It will stop automatically. Don't be worried. Just maintain your genital hygiene. Next cycle may be delayed for 1-2 weeks due to hormonal imbalance. Do a home pregnancy test if period is delayed more than a week. Practice safe sex in future.

I was expecting that my menstruation is on 19 August 2013. Is there a chance I get pregnant ?","Doctor":"Hi,As you had sex during non fertile period, chance of having pregnancy is less.And as you got your period even less, there iless chance of having pregnancy.Having less period might be due to oral contraceptive pills.You got your period early might be due to not taking last 3 pills and its withdrawal effect came earlier.Ok and take care."},{"Patient":"I have noticed a tube like structure running from my belly button upward, and it is in between my abs. I was wondering if this combined with upper abdominal bloating and pain when pressing are signs of pregnancy. I am supposed to get my period this week, but I am panicking because I messed up my birth control pills but we always wear condoms.","Doctor":"Hi,Tube like structure you mean white lining appearing on your abdomen.If this is there, it might be due to even fat deposition in your abdomen.During pregnancy this type of lining do occur, called Linea striae or alba, but at later stage of pregnancy.So do not become panic and wait till you get your period.Ok and take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, I'm 20 years old and I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend during my ovulation dates. I'm on Orsythia, a birth control pill. This is my second month on it and I have breakthrough bleeding. It's about a week before my period now. And it's also about a week since I had the unprotected sex. I'm just concerned if I may be pregnant or not. I take my birth control very regularly. I've never missed a day or been more than an hour or two late taking it. However, I didn't know that I had sex during the ovulation days till later on. But I guess on birth control you don't ovulate? I'm confused on that. My main question though is if I had unprotected sex during my supposed ovulation days while on birth control, could I be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello,On regular intake of birth control pill gives protection near about 99% against unwanted pregnancy. Here, pregnancy rate is less than 1% and occurs only after failure of the pill.First time pill user may get irregular spotting or bleeding before period for initial 1-2 months until hormone is adjusted to body system. However, you can undergo one home pregnancy test if you miss next period. It helps to clear confusion.

All the signs point to pregnancy but I don’t see how that could happen.","Doctor":"Hello, I would be happy to help you with your question. If you have a Mirena IUD in place AND your husband has had a vasectomy, then your chances of getting pregnant with your husband is almost certainly close to zero.  It is INCREDIBLY unlikely.  Nothing is 100%, but this is pretty close to complete protection. If you think that you are pregnant, then you need to check a pregnancy test.  If the test is negative, then these are likely cycle related symptoms Thank you and good luck!"},{"Patient":"Hello..I have done iui on 26th July and took duphaston for 14days but bad luck I got a negative result..my friends mother being a doctor she told me next time instead of duphaston I should b injected medicine,this is not clear to me..is she saying instead of duphaston there r medicine which can help me in implantation..","Doctor":"Hi,Duphaston is given whenever progesterone deficiency is suspected or expected as in IVF and since you only had IUI and it is not known if you had ovulation induction, it is difficult to comment on your need for progesterone supplements. HCG injections are sometimes given in the hope of sustaining the pregnancy if conception occurs. FSH injections are given to enhance egg release.

It is safer to continue intercourse for a couple of days after evidence of follicular rupture; since there is a chance that the other follicles may rupture even if one chance of fertilization is missed, there would be other. Further sonographic monitoring also would be needed. Hope you find this information useful.

Still, withdrawal method has a high failure rate. As your home pregnancy tests are negative, it is unlikely that you are pregnant. Yet, you may get a better confirmation through serum beta-hCG measurement and a trans-vaginal sonogram.

This is called as secondary infertility. Uterus cannot become small to such an extent after one pregnancy that it cannot hold fetus of second pregnancy. Obesity (more weight) does not directly interfere with fertility, however if obesity is due to some primary cause it can cause infertility, like hypothyroidism. If she has adequate height, 67 kg is not over weight not to talk of obesity. Your wife has already given birth to one child; she should be able to conceive again unless she has developed some other cause of infertility.

It shouldn't interfere with your ability to conceive.In most women, the uterus tips forward at the cervix. About one in four women, however, have a uterus that leans backward, or tilts, at the cervix. In the past, it was thought that a tilted uterus may contribute to infertility. But experts now know that the position of the uterus doesn't affect the ability of sperm to reach an egg. You and your hubby also need thorough evaluation for not getting pregnant.

Its normal to have such things, the emergency drug which you took is intended to make you menstruate earlier so that the embryo will not implant in the uterus.

First the good news that you had sex three days after your last cycle, which was your safe period and chances of pregnancy are very, very less. Bad news is if you have conceived, abortion is difficult, not for the reason that, you are having venous sinus thrombosis but because you’re on oral anticoagulant, which can cause profuse bleeding during abortion process. Secondly if you want to continue pregnancy chances of congenital abnormalities are high as warfarin is known for congenital abnormalities. Chances that you have conceived are very less, as mentioned above. Period could be delayed due to anxiety (tension).45 days have already passed; this is the time pregnancy test turns positive. Get your pregnancy test done to rule out/confirm pregnancy. If test turns out to be positive, you have stop warfarin 3 to 4 days before planned abortion.

In all likelihood, you are not pregnant, and this could represent a persistent ovarian cyst.  It would be best to get into your doctor as soon as possible for a blood test and an ultrasound.

In the current scenario, your ovulation status should be established. Primolut N is not recommended when you are planning to conceive. You can use safer preparations for regularization of cycles. Please discuss with your partner and plan further management. If you are ready to conceive, you can go for induction of ovulation, if you are not regularly ovulating naturally. This needs to be done after all investigation. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"My girlfriend and I (I am demale) are trying to concieve.

It seems to me that you have a prolactinoma. This is a prolactin secreting tumour and thus accounts for your high prolactin level. The prolactin level then causes inhibition of the fsh in some cases. Thus you need to meet a gynecologist who needs to operate and remove the tumour or at least give you some therapy for it. You might also have some symptoms like blurring of vision.

This is very rare. The best way to find out if you are pregnant is to get a pregnancy kit and test yourself. Wait till you have crossed 7 days of your ovulation date. Ovulation is the 14th day after your periods start approximately if you have a regular 28 day cycle. If not it is 16 days before your expected date of mensus. So 9 days before the start of your mensus, you can get tested. If thats negative, you can check again after 5 days. If thats also negative, Then there is no chance that you are pregnant.You will also get your periods shortly after the second test. I hope this helps.

Clomid acts by causing the pituitary gland to produce a higher level of the hormones (FSH and LH) that control ovulation.Occasionally,women taking CLOMID may have side effects like headache,bloating,blurred vision,sometimes a mild depression in few cases etc.CLOMID is safe for child also.CLOMID is highly effective in stimulating ovulation and appox.80% of women treated with clomiphene will ovulate.There are only two recognisable risks associated with its use.They are...Multiple pregnancy ( 8% women with CLOMID treatment can have multiple pregnancies) Ovarian cysts.You must go ahead with treatment of CLOMID as time may be running out for you to try it naturally.Thanks"},{"Patient":"I'm 37 yrs old with normal hormonal profile.Married for 1yr & 3 month.My husband has no issues.I did Ivf that was unsuccessful after producing 5 oocysts,& 4 embryos were produced,3 of them were excellent.And all 4 embryos were transferred.3 wks after my failed ivf i did HSG,That to my shock it came with bilateral distal tubal block with silght swelling on both sides after exerting pressure!!!Would this result be conclusive??Or there may be other confirmatory test?Is this also might be hydrosalpinx??Given that i never had PID.May be only at marriage when in the beggining I had painful intercourse,and I had UTI at that time & took medication for it.But if it was untreated PID isn't it too short time to have blocked tubes within one yr?? Otherwise it could be endometriosis that blocked them?? But I dont have any family History of endometriosis.If they are really blocked what do you advice to try to concieve naturally inbetween ivf cycles","Doctor":"Hi,You may have a laparoscopic chromotubation to check for tubal patency and if the consultant is experienced enough may perform any operative interventions needed to relieve tubal block. Considering your age, it would be better if you do not waste precious time trying for natural conception. Tubal patency as well as tubal motility together have an impact on the tubal function. For endometriosis to affect the tubes, it would be rare. The impact of any pelvic inflammation varies with the severity of the infection and the individual predisposition. You should try ART under the guidance of an expert.

So its clear that your family doctor has given that drug to get your periods, as your UPT is negative.As far as getting pregnant is concerned, if you and your partner is anatomically, physically, and mentally fit, you can get pregnant by having coitus at your most fertile time, which is mostly around days of ovulation.Women with very regular 28-day cycles can just count 14 days from the first day of their period to determine their ovulation date.

I have irregular periods.. Since i started seeing my periods.. It was always like that.. Well actually it started after i started taking contraceptives.. I took them in 2005, twice , from there i started to have irregular periods. In 2008 i had an car accident and i was two months pregnant, i lost the baby and had an internal bleeding.. From there my periods were worse than before, i bleeded heavily in 2009, till i went to hospital and they gave me some pills,then i was well again.. I fell pregnant in November 2009 and miscarried in 2010 January.. From there i started seeing drops.. My periods drifted far worse from before.. Sometimes i would miss my periods for 3months, and each dr i went to told me that its the way my body is.. There is no way they would help me.. I fell pregnant again in 2011.. And lost it again.. In 2012.. And lost the baby, even this year i fell pregnant and im afraid i lost the baby again.. I went to the doctor yesterday and she said i have a bulky uterus.. She did some blood test and were still waiting for the results.. The problem is that my tummy swells frequently.. And it hurts.. I last saw my normal periods lastyear December after i had an womb scrub.. This year from January uptill April there was nothing.. Until mid-April, i saw some few drops.. Even now they come and go..

As per your statement from the year 2005 after taking contraceptive pills 2 times your periods are irregular. Meanwhile you had a car accident in the year 2008 while you were 2 months pregnant. You had internal bleeding from where ? and you lost the baby. Meanwhile you had some miscarriages. Your periods were regular for a few months after uterine curettage last December. Now your Dr doubts that you may have bulky uterus by clinical examination, for which also only blood test was done. Did it a Hormone analysis and I like to know what medicines you were taking so far to regularize your irregular periods.My best advise:1) Do a USG abdomen to assess your reproductive organs and causes for irregular periods, the size of the uterus and ovaries and any abnormality in them2) A complete Thyroid and ovarian hormone analysis along with other routine blood testsWith this you can arrive at a diagnosis. In order to avoid miscarriages, first regularize your periods, then plan for pregnancy.Wishing you all the best"},{"Patient":"Sir/Madam,   I am 38 years old, and am undergoing treatment fo conceive. Now I have chosen IUI, and taking tablets puregest (morning and evening) and folvite (only in the night)  i feel dizziness for about half an hour every day. I dont know what could be the reason?  Also I want to know is this a positive or a negative sign of pregnancy.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM, Feeling dizziness is not a feature of pregnancy. Dizziness can occur due to many reasons. It could be due to hypotension (fall in blood pressure), vasovagal syncope, or ear problem. Inner ear is associated with maintanence of posture. Any infection or inflammation of the inner ear causes imbalance. Hypotension refers to decreased blood flow to brain. Vasovagal attack is caused by loss of tone of blood vessels and hence leads to hypotension. If the dizziness is very frequent and troublesome, you need to consult your doctor for clinical examination and relevant investigations. The condition can be managemed after investigations.

Absence of this effluvium may be normal but we have to make sure that there is semen ejected from your husband. Ask you husband and if he is not sure ask him to ejaculate outside you and see if there is semen. If there is no semen (dry ejaculate), or if the amount is small (If there is semen and the amount is good, I advise you to have intercourse at days 11,13,15 of the cycle (day 1 is the first day of menstruation). Too frequent intercourse delays pregnancy.

Only a slightly greater than 60% of women with effetive sexual intercourse become pregnant after a year of effective intercourse.You and your partner should be on good diet, good psychological state of mind and practice effective sexual intercourse which is having intercourse at least four times each week (every other day with the days spread out during the week).You might consider meeting your doctor for regular follow up and guidance but for now with only three months of trying, there is no problem per se.Pregnancy test can only become positive after missing a period or around the time you are expecting your menses. It can not become positive immediately after having sex or so unless you were previously pregnant.Lower abdominal cramping and frequent urination could be possible in pregnancy but at a little advance stage and not at an early stage.

In addition, if your periods were irregular before taking the pill, your periods may continue to be irregular after stopping the pill.In addition current state of your stress,your body weight and any other illness like polycystic ovary disease,also makes a difference.Generally, your period should start four to six weeks after taking your last birth control pill. If you have not begun menstruating after three months, you may have a condition called post-pill amenorrhea. Birth control pills stop your body from producing hormones that trigger ovulation and menstruation. When you go off the pill, it can take a while for your body to re-adjust to its natural hormone production schedule. Eventually though, your regular menstrual cycle will return.If you don't get periods even after 6 months,then you would need  consultation and examination by your Gynecologist.Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, I am married for 5 years and trying to concieve from last 4 years.

So i first i wiped the precum off my dick and started to rub it on her vagina (no penetration was done) my dick in no way went inside, we only did it for about 30 seconds when i felt my dick slide on the slippery part (sorry not sure what its called but that part of her vagina is always wet, i immediately took it away from her vagina. question is, could it be possible that even after i wiped the precum, more precum developed during the act? and could she get pregnant from this? please answer ASAP. kindaa Freakin out.","Doctor":"Dear user, welcome to healthcare magic.Occurrence of pregnancy depends on many factors, most important of which is if there was ovulation at that time or not.Anyway it is possible to happen so if you do not want this to happen your girlfriend should use the emergency contraceptive pills as soon as possible.It's effect decreases as time passes by.The sure sign that pregnancy did not happen is when menstruation occurs or when a pregnancy test is negative at the time of menstruation.Good luck.Dr. Ahmed Bahaa."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr, I have not got pregnancy, I have gone to hospital for check up on the second day of my normal periods.

She is also taking some meditions for PCOD also. We are planning on a baby since we get married, no sign of concieving. 1.) Are we still able to make baby along with the treatment my wife is undergoing? 2.) But after Three weeks she started taking the thyronorm tablets, she is complaining about her breast pain. The pain is lot. Can tell me the reson?","Doctor":"Hi dear,I have gone through your question and understand the concerns.1. Both hypothyroidism and  PCOS are causes of anovulation and hence inability to conceive.Therefore, if these two conditions are properly treated, then the chances of conception are increased. You can try to conceive with these medications.2.Breast pain is unrelated to the thyroid medication. It can be due to fibroadenosis. Consult a surgeon for proper examination and treatment accordingly.Hope you found the answer helpful.RegardsDr Deepti VermaOBGYN"},{"Patient":"Hi I am 30 years old 4 months ago I had tubal reversal surgery and my husband and I have been trying to conceive every since. I have been charting my cycle which is every 29 days and I ovulated on April 4. At this time I experienced sore nipples/breast  which is normal for me except this time the soreness continued. I began to get sweats and hot flashes. On April 13, I noticed a pink spot while using restroom just the one time which would have been 7 days before my expected period. I also developed very mild cramping. 3 days later April 16th I began to spot regularly it was light pink and brown off and on for 1 day. The next day the flow picked up but wasn't enough to fill a pad. April 18 thru April 21 The bleeding turned moderate brown in color with some clots and I began to cramp badly. This was odd for me because My periods are usually very heavy and usually only 5 days long with the last day being light. On April 22nd I stopped bleeding all together thinking I just had a weird period but on April 23 the spotting came back but was light pink/brown and continued until April 25th with mild cramping. Also My breast/nipples are now heavy full and more sore. I have also developed lower backpain, pimples and I am fatigued all of the time. I took a pregnancy test which came back negative and I have never had these issues before what could it be? I am so afraid because I fear an ectopic and I only have one fallopian tube after reversal surgery. Any help would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us. The pain in the lower back that you ahve could be related to uterine contraction, poor posture, Vitamin D 3 deficiency, etc. Few blood tests and direct examination will help in proper diagnosis.I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you.

Following the information you have given, there was no penetration and defintely there should be no pregnancy. But if at all he did ejaculate with just the tip of his penis inside your vaginal ( not necessarily the whole length of the penis), then there are chances that you could be pregnant.That could be confirm through a pregnancy test using early morning urine and should after missing your period; i.e. about the end of may. It could be possible that the increase in breast are just normal changes due to the hormonal changes in your cycle.Hope this answers your query.Best regardsDr Achuo"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am Nisha.I am 25 years old.

Chlamydial organisms can either damage sperm or affect its motility. It also affects the ciliary movement of the fallopian tube interfering with motility of egg.

Usually withdrawal bleed is seen within one week to 10 days after the completion of hormone therapy.

This can happen when a diluted urine sample is used. Which is when this test kit can be inaccurate.

This process can be repeated at least 2-3 times, on 2-3 consecutive days, to confirm a result.If it has been more than 2 weeks since the last time you had sexual contact, this method should confirm/rule out a pregnancy. Your other symptoms can also be related to pregnancy, and yes, if you are indeed pregnant, then the small amount of blood could be due to the implantation process.

Can I still conceive? I have tried preseed and instead cups to keep the sperm as close to the cervix as I can, but I can't tell if the instead is covering my cervix or not. It is really high and far back and I can't tell if the instead cup is covering if not then it is preventing the sperm from going in..","Doctor":"HelloThanks for your query.Please consult a doctor to know if there is any positional abnormality in the uterus and cervix which would hamper conception.A backward tilted cervix is a normal anatomical variation, and generally does not lead to infertility.Try tilting your knees upto your chest after intercourse, and avoid getting up for 15 minutes after intercourse.Take care."},{"Patient":"I think I may be pregnant.I had unprotected sex with my husband on March 29th, March 30th, and again this past Friday and Saturday (and yes, we are trying to conceive).I've been experiencing symptoms:Aching, tingling, and sore nipples - I know that some women experience this during ovulation, but I've NEVER experienced it. Its on and off. Some days, I can go all day without feeling any discomfort, on other days, I can't even bear to wear a bra.(Very) light nausea - I feel a little queasy first thing in the morning, as well as when I'm hungry. I was also very queasy in the 3 days after I think we conceived (I vomited once, but that was it)Changes in appetite - I normally crave sweets and high-GI/high-GL carbs, but all of a sudden I'm a meat lover. Chicken and eggs seem to be all I want lately (eggs used to make me gag, now I crave them all day long).Light cramping and spotting - Again, I know that some women experience this during ovulation and before their period, but I've never experienced it during ovulation, and my period isn't due til the 20th (and I'm always very regular, I get my period every 28-29 days)Changes in sleep patterns - No matter what time I go to sleep, I wake up at 8:30- 8:45 in the morning (this is new for me), and I CAN'T get enough sleep during the day. I feel the need to nap every 2 hours or so. Frequent urination - This one may just be in my head. I've been going to the bathroom once every hour or so.Discharge - Almost immediately after the first time we had unprotected sex (like within the following 24 hours), I noticed an rapid increase in milky, odorless, translucent white vaginal discharge. Could this be a symptom?Increased libido and vaginal sensitivity - This past weekend (about a week after I think we conceived), sex with my husband was more intense than it ever has been... I was more aroused and sensitive than I've ever been with him, and he commented that I felt tighter than usual. Could this be caused by thickening of the vaginal walls that takes place in pregnancy?Increased attachment to my husband - I'm not sure if this is a symptom, but I've been feeling a need to be with him at all times... I miss him terribly when I leave his house (or when he leaves mine), and I get sad when we get off the phone (I even cried when we got off the phone last night). I toss and turn when I sleep alone, but I sleep very peacefully when I'm with him. This is very new for me, as I've always been very independent. I crave his affection, and when I'm with him, it feels like everything inside me is sighing in relief... I've always been very much in love with him, but my feelings for him seem to be much more intense now.As I said earlier, my period isn't due until the 20th, as my last one started on March 23rd (and ended on March 26th). I know that most women ovulate 14 days after their period, but I also know that other women ovulate almost immediately after. While I'm not exactly sure, I think I may be one of the latter.Also, I'm young (20 years old), so I know that I'm at an advantage when it comes to fertility.I'm in serious need of professional advice... Waiting for my period to arrive (or not arrive) is driving me crazy and I don't want to stress myself out of my period or psych myself into psuedopregnancy.Does it sound like I'm pregnant? Or are these symptoms simply a result of my longing for a baby? How should I deal with the stress and worry of waiting to know for sure?Thank you in advance!","Doctor":"HelloThanks for your query.I appreciate the indepth query posted by you.To be very objective ( at the risk of sounding harsh ),  THE ONLY WAY to confirm a pregnancy is to have a positive pregnancy test.And the earliest that you could perform a pregnancy test is when you miss a period.Yes, you should de stress yourself and relax untill the proper time comes.There is absolutely no point in venturing into the realm of guesswork .All the best."},{"Patient":"I have had icsi with two embryos inserted and I am late by about a week.

My cycle is 29 days plus one thing that i forgot to mention that i have retrovated uterus so my question do i still have hope this cycle and i tested early..?...","Doctor":"Though in the past it was considered significant, retroverted position of uterus is not much of a problem. Do not worry about that.I presume you have Polycystic ovarian disease, which is a derangement of hormonal/ovarian function and in most situations readily correctable. 'Clomid' is one first line drug for the condition used to 'kick start' the ovaries. It is not clear from your query whether you started with 150mg or gradually increased to that level. Usual initial dose is 50mg and only if your ovary fail to respond to that dose, higher doses are used. With higher doses, though there is a higher chance of ovarian stimulation, the fertility rates actually fall. Another thing to remember here is that, though everything is right, the chance to get fertilized is around 35-40% only. So dont get disheartened. Your chances of   pregnancy sure increases with further cycles. Good Luck."},{"Patient":"Hello, My boyfriend and I are engaged in sexual outercourse.

As you had a successful intercourse the same day the prospectus of you getting pregnant is high. Better results are obtained when you already have the sperms inside while ovulating. Sperms survive better in female pelvic peritoneum than the ovum. So dont worry about the failed intercourse.

And moreover you have got this antibody positive. The preferred treatment modalities include the daily aspirin and injectable anticoagulants.

Obstructed Fallopian tube is a common cause for infertility among females. You don't need to worry as it can be completely cured with timely treatment.Do not go for unscientific treatment and magic healers, you may lose your money and time.Consult a gynecologist specialized in infertility treatment. You have to do a test called \\"hysterrosalpingogram\\" to locate the level of the obstruction. Once the location and extent of the problem has detected,surgical correction is required to correct the defect. Nowadays, laparoscopic methods are preferred.Wishing you good health.Regards.Dr.Shana"},{"Patient":"hi i have been trying for a baby for over three years.  i have some signs and now i think i might be pregnant would just like advice ok so two days before my period  i noticed alot of mucus white and yellow with a small bit of blood when i wiped again there was alot more with more blood in the middle i felt this was very strang because i never get mucus i also had bleeding gums once which also never happens and today i have felt alot of muscle ache in my tummy like i have done lots of sit ups which i havent.      the last week i have been so tired i could sleep and sleep but wake up feeling so tired i do have an underactive thyriod gland but it is under control now so dont think its from that","Doctor":"Hello.

Please do not have continuous cycles of Ubiphene indiscriminately. This drug is not without its side effects. The blood you mention could be haemorrhage or cysts in the ovaries. Ubiphene is to be given maximum for 6 cycles, which you have already taken. Before proceeding towards injections, please confirm if your fallopian tube patency has been checked by a laparoscopy.

We are waiting to take a second blood test in 2 weeks time to confirm. I have just ordered fertilaid to try to assist with conceiving. If he starts to take fertilaid will this affect his blood test results. We have been trying to conceive for nearly a year and he has low sperm motility. This is the main reason for trying fertilaid however I don't want his blood test to be effected as I want any issues he has to be diagnosed correctly so he can get the correct treatment.","Doctor":"Madam, Your husband is suffering from low sperm motility (assumed that the cell count and morphology are normal). Your husband's blood test shows Hyperthyroidism. You are waiting to repeat the blood test to confirm the diagnosis. You are trying to conceive for the 1 yr. Meanwhile you have ordered for Fertiaid. You like to know whether Fertiaid will alter your husbands blood test. Hyperthyroid is one of the causes for low sperm motility, due to the hormonal effect of Hyperthyroid. The sperm motility can be increased by so many ways: 1) Avoiding Heat by covering the body 2) Wear loose Pants 3) Dietary supplements - by taking foods rich in Glutothione ( raw eggs, garlic, onions fresh unprocessed meats and raw goat milk) 4) Healthy weight 5) Dental hygiene 6) Oysters - optional - Oysters are an excellent source of zinc, iron, calcium, and selenium, as well as vitamin A and vitamin B12 The Fertiaid is a - blend of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals with the amino acid, L-Carnitine. So it is only a dietary supplement of the above mentioned items without hormone. So it is not going to alter your husband's thyroid reports. If your husband is having other sperm defects like low count consult Endocrinologost If Hyperthyroidism is confirmed, and treatment is given for that, definitely the sperm motility will increase in percentage. I think your husband's problem is solvable. Best wishes"},{"Patient":"Hey!

The altered bleeding pattern that you are facing is due to the double dose of morning after pills. Even a single dose of morning after pills produces irregular and unpredictable bleeding. If you have taken 4 negative pregnancy tests, chances are extremely remote that you would be pregnant now.

Possibilities of pregnancy have always been there with unprotected sex. Pre-ejaculation also contain sperm so chances of pregnancy also be there.

In patients who are not ovulating, this medication is used to help 'recruit' more eggs and increase the chance that ovulation will occur.

You are having unexplained infertility. HUCOG is HCG injection, given to help the mature follicle to rupture. That is, it induces ovulation. Normally,  it takes 36 hours after the injection for ovulation to occur. And the next 3 days are ideally best for you to have intercourse. since you had intercourse yesterday, your doctor might have advised to avoid it today and hence improve the sperm count. SOme practitioners believe in daily sexual activity during the fertile phase, and some believe in alternate sexual activity. Normally ovulation occurs on the 14th day, so its considered the best day for intercourse, however if your doctor has given the shot today, you would ovulate tomorrow. So please have faith and go ahead. Take care."},{"Patient":"I had sore breast two weeks before.and got my period one after the due date.and my period is unusuall.its not spotty but fresh bright pink blood somtimes it dischrged clots.it stoped today.i'm trying to get pregnent.and my pregnancy test came negative.i have crampings and bad gum infection.and also i feel like i have water in my throat.please help me to find out am i pregnent.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for posting your query on healthcare magic. Your symptoms are suggestive of pregnancy but not confirmatory. Causes of missed periods include thyroid problem, stress, ovarian cyst, pregnancy. I recommend her to get a urine pregnancy test once she misses her periods. Transvaginal scan is confirmatory of pregnancy. Transvaginal scan also helps in detecting other causes of missed periods like ovarian cyst.

You need another ultrasound,2 weeks later as you have scheduled ,to determine whether the pregnancy is viable. By 6-7 weeks,the fetal heart beat should be present. I suggest that just wait for the ultrasound you have scheduled. The symptoms you have are common in pregnancy. Be careful though since you are at high risk for early pregnancy loss due to the fibroids,adenomyomas.

Thyroid levels are normal (TSH -1.57).We have been trying for 1 year now, what else could the problem be.","Doctor":"Madam, From your history I understand that you have PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease). This has not become the syndrome (PCOS) and as your TSH result is normal. So Your hypothyroidism is under control with tab. For ovulation to occur other than estrogen and progesterone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone LH) are needed. If even one of these hormones is not produced and released when it should be, ovulation may not occur when expected. Fortunately you are ovulating. You have not mentioned about your menstrual cycle. If your menstrual cycle is not regular, for example once in 40 days, then 23rd day is normal. A healthy ovum can come from a healthy follicle only. Regarding the treatment, if you are obese, reduce the weight by whatever means available - keep your thyroid profile normal, periodical hormone analysis of LH and FSH, get relieved of your stress and tension, reducing insulin resistance by improving insulin sensitivity through medications such as metformin, and the newer thiazolidinedione - glitazones (with consultation of gynecologist) , - are advised.

I came off microgynon 30 nearly 7 months ago and had 3 periods approximately 42 days apart.  It has been 62 days since my last one and I am confused as an ovulation test showed an lh surge on day 29, however 2 home pregnancy tests have shown as negative.  Can you please advise me what to do?  I had a blood test at what I thought was 7 daps past ovulation which showed no hormonal imbalance, although my progesterone was just 2.3 which I understand is a low post ovulation result.  I am starting to worry I am not ovulating at all, despite this positive lh surge on a digital test.  I would appreciate if you could shed some light on this.  Please note, I am 26 and healthy.","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for your query. LH surge is indicative of ovulation, but that does not necessarily result in a conception. Having delayed and irregular periods is a sign that you might need help in regulating periods and also in conceiving. Just relying on progesterone measurement is not enough. Please consult an Infertility specialist and have thorough evaluation for irregular cycles as well as for difficulty in conceiving. Anxiety, stress, ingestion of medications, being on birth control, hectic travelling, changes in weight , recent illness or fever - all are reasons of irregular cycles. Thyroid hormone disturbance, adrenal dysfunction, high prolactin levels, polycystic ovaries , endometrial pathology - all can cause such problems. I would urge you to get professional help at the earliest. Take care."},{"Patient":"Dear doctor, last month my USG was OK. My HSG is also OK. But my doc has asked me to take Siphene from Day 2 of periods. Is it safe to take? Any side effects? does this mean I may not be able to concieve naturally if I go on this medicine once? Also, since this medicine plays with the hormone secreting gland, does that mean it can cause other parameters to go haywire as well?","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for your query. Siphene is clomiphene citrate. It is a medication that stimulates the ovaries to produce egg follicles. it is given to patients who have difficulties in regular menstruation and ovulation. It is sometimes given to patients with unexplained infertility to increase chances of conception. Before starting siphene, the following should be done : 1. Partner's semen analysis 2. Hormonal status and documentation of ovulation status 3. Assessment of fallopian tubes - ideally with laparoscopy, instead of HSG You could go for one cycle of natural planning with follicular monitoring. If ovulation is not proved, you can then consider taking siphene. It does have its side effects, but it is indicated if required. It does not impair your ability to conceive naturally, unless there is some pre existent problem. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi,I have been on Diane 35 for longer than a year to treat my skin.

You have taken Diane 35 irregularly, so you cannot rely on that to offer you optimum protection this month. ALso, with the tear of the condom, it is definitely likely that you might get pregnant. However, combining the Plan B with OC pills is not a good idea, and not of much use either. RIght now, just have protected sex in the future.

During the reproductive age group , the commonest possibility with altered bleeding pattern is pregnancy. THe i pill commonly causes some kind of bleeding within few days of taking it, but it is not the rule. The I pill can delay or prepone your periods by a week or 10 days, so be prepared for this. If you do not have your period 4 weeks after taking the I pill, please take a pregnancy test. Anxiety, stress, travelling, weight changes , hormonal medications - all can cause an abnormal period.

PCOS is characterized by  sonographically evident polycystic ovaries, irregular menstrual cycles and other features such as hirsutism, glucose intolerance etc. It is not compulsory to have irregular cycles to be diagnosed as PCOS. Any 2 out of the 3 cluster of symptoms and signs i mentioned are enough to diagnose PCOS. Also, a potential complication in pregnancy is if you are Rh negative and your partner is Rh positive.

Given that you likely did not have a problem conceiving before, I would not assume that there is a problem at this time.  When you are breast-feeding, this upsets ovulation which will then occur randomly, if at all.  You only stopped this one week ago! The engorgement will subside within a week or two.  It always goes better if you slowly wean your child over the course of weeks as your breast milk production will drop and you breast feed less. Once you stop breast-feeding, your cycles should resume a normal pattern within 1-2 months.  It is certainly possible that the change in cervical discharge represents ovulation, but this is uncertain and will sort itself out over the next couple of months. In the setting of the change in cervical mucus, and the lower abdominal cramping, this might argue that you are, in fact, ovulating.  Make sure you check a pregnancy test now, though, and otherwise be patient! I hope that this helps.

Fertile medicine is Clomiphene citrate given to increase sperm production. Follicular study is done to  assess the size of the mature follicle and  to monitor the growth of the egg follicle. Ovulation releases the egg necessary for fertilization. In PCOD, the cycles are anovulatory creating problems in obtaining egg for IUI. Metformin can stimulate ovulation by improving insulin action. But if the stimulation is inadequate (which will be evident by the follicular study) then, drugs that stimulate ovulation like Clomiphene are given along with HCG injection to stimulate ovulation. The size of the dominant follicle will determine your chances of pregnancy. 20 mm size will indicate that it is capable of rupturing to release the egg. It is better to be  under regular monitoring with your treating Dr and follow his/her  instructions to improve your chances of pregnancy. I hope this is helpful to you."},{"Patient":"....  i had  a  miscarriage at 3  months  of  gestation......i was  rubella igm positive  and  igg positive  when   tested 2  months  later....  but  i  had   no  symptoms  of  the disease....i   repeated  the  test 3  months  later  igm  and   igg   are  still  positive ......  when   should   i   plan   my   pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hello, Rubella IgM  becomes detectable a few days after the infection. The presence of IgM antibodies indicates an acute infection, and will be detectable for approximately 8 weeks or may be 10 weeks.(Rubella IgG will appear almost as early as the IgM, but then persists for life). It looks unlikely that rubella IgM is still positive after 5 months of miscarriage. Because rubella incidence is low, a high proportion of IgM-positive tests will likely be false positive. False-positive serum rubella IgM tests may occur due to the presence of rheumatoid factors or cross-reacting IgM, or infection with other viruses. You must get it repeated again at some different laboratory . Once you find that IgM is negative,which it should be,you may plan your next pregnancy.

What you mention are not the sizes of the ovaries.. These indicate the size of the egg follicles seen in each ovary. According to what you have typed, the follicular growth seems normal as far as day 11 is concerned. The leading dominant follicle in each ovary grows at the rate of 1 - 2 mm per day, normally by day 14, it should reach a size of 20 - 22 mm. That is when ovulation occurs, and the egg ruptures. This is the best time for conception. So far the report is normal. Get back with the remaining follicular study for further assistance. All the best."},{"Patient":"i am suspected to have a closed or block falopian tube because of infection.the doctor has check me and my husband and everythings are ok but i can not still get pregnant the doctor has said i should go for and operation for my falopian tube to be open so that i can get pregnant please i donot want to do operation . is there no other option","Doctor":"Traditionally Fallopian tubal surgery (tuboplasty) was used to restore patency to the tubes and thus possibly normal function. However, in most situations today, in vitro fertilization is used to overcome tubal infertility as it is more cost-effective, less invasive, and results are immediate. With IVF, after stimulation of ovarian follicles, egg cells are removed via a sonographic directed vaginal puncture into the ovary, these eggs are fertiized outside the body, and the resultant embryo placed transcervically into the uterus; - the tubes are bypassed in this process. so if getting pregnant is your main goal, I would say this is a pretty decent option for you. hope it helps"},{"Patient":"hi i am 25.i used to take krimson35 to regulate my periods as well as avoid pregnancy.Now its been 2.5 years for my marriage and we have planned for a baby.But i am unable to concieve. its been 3months that i left taking krimson35.previously my Dr. prescribed me OOSURE AND FOLININE but as i didnt concieve now my Dr. advised me NACFIL FORTE and from 5th day of my periods to take FERTLY SPHERE5gm.what could be wrong with me? my LH is less in comparison Dr. says.","Doctor":"Hello.

In patients with irregular cycles that is related to either absent or irregular ovulation, it is not uncommon to have to use progesterone to induce a cycle, and clomid to induce ovulation.  The usual method is as follows: 1.  The start of your cycle is day#1 2.  You take clomid on days 5-9 3.  You time intercourse on days 10-16 4.  You can track if and when you ovulate with over-the-counter ovulation kits As far as I can tell, the Folgel is a supplement that has little effect on your cycle.  The use of the ultrasound to assess your ovaries and follicles is useful, but not necessary during the first three months on clomid. I hope that this helps.

Today i tried a pregency test were left side was complete red and right side light pink line please suggest me not to get pregent","Doctor":"Hello dhanalakshmi, You missed your period in January and had irregular /scanty (less) bleeding after that. If you are sexually active and you miss a period, the first diagnosis is to rule out pregnancy. If there is a pregnancy, the irregular bleeding could be because of an 'abnormal' pregnancy - either an abortion process or a pregnancy in the tubes. The Urine Pregnancy Test is positive for pregnancy if there is a second red line. Light shade may be in either case - abortion process or pregnancy in the tube. Considering all this information, i suggest you get a Transvaginal Ultrasound tomorrow morning and consult your doctor with the reports. You must first solve this issue or whether you are pregnant; if pregnant then where is this pregnancy - inside uterus or in tube. A pregnancy in the tube is a real emergency and can even take away life. You will need to visit your doctor, who will solve your problem after an examination and ultrasound report. You sound very young. You should use contraception if you do not want to get pregnant. I would suggest Oral Contraceptive Pills available easily in any chemist shop. This is very effective in PREVENTING a pregnancy but it cannot drop a pregnancy if you are pregnant just now. Abortion Pills can do that but they should be taken only under doctor's supervision otherwise there can be complications. So you should take Oral Contraceptive Pills to prevent pregnancy and your partner should use a condom EVERY time you have sex to prevent Sexually Transmitted Disease, HIV and AIDS.

Oosure contains DHEA , which is given to patients with diminished ovarian reserve. this means that the capacity of your ovaries to produce mature eggs is subnormal. This is due to endometriotic cysts which replace normal ovarian tissue. This tablet is supposed to boost ovarian reserve, although its role is not very significant. You have failed to ovulate in this cycle, and most probably it is due to subnormal ovarian response as normal ovarian tissue is replaced with endometriotic cysts. These tablets help somewhat in boosting ovarian function.

If you haven't been able to conceive after 12 cycles then it's time to investigate with your doctor but you're a long way off from that now. With 25 day cycles, you should ovulate around day 11 and you would be potentially fertile 3 days before and 1 day after (so day 8 to 12 ).Having sex every other day during that time frame gives you the best odds. Other than that, try to relax and enjoy the process of baby making. Nothing seems to slow down conception more than when a couple turns conception into chore and stop enjoying each other. Quit smoking and alcohol if any body of you is doing it. Your hormone levels are perfectly all right. Ask your wife to remain lying after sex for at least 30 minutes after sex so that sperms get better chance to go in. There is no need for any HSG or anything other test at the moment.

Diane is more suitable in PCOD with weight gain and androgenic symptoms. Metformin causes nausea, metallic taste and anorexia (loss of appetite). In PCOD, the menstrual cycles are anovulatory. Also they are irregular. Diane regularizes the period. Metformin improves insulin action and also reduces weight. It also improves the chances of ovulation. To improve your chances of conception, you should reduce your weight, take Metformin regularly. Also rule out thyroid problems. Do not worry about conception. Drugs like Clomiphene Citrate are given along with HCG  to stimulate ovulation.  Your treating Dr will know about these drugs. If this fails then procedures like IVF, GIFT, ZIFT and IUI  are available to improve your chances of conception. I hope this is helpful to you."},{"Patient":"usually my periods delays for 15 to 20 days. i got married 1.5 years before and don't have any child yet. before marriage when i consult a doc in Pakistan she advised me few tests and ultrasound as well. when reports came she informed me that my right ovary is 1.5 cm enlarge. she gave me dine1 for three months and primolut n also for 3 months. after that my reports were okay.  now again after 3 years i m fACING the same problem. van u suggest me anything or what is the next step? plzzzzzzzzzzzzz inform me as soon as possible.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us. It seems that you are having a hormonal imbalance or polycystic ovaries.

I have PCOS and am on my 3rd round of clomid 50 mg and HCG shot.  Sadly, we found out this month that my husband also has low sperm count.  So my OB decided to changed the start date of my clomid to day 3.  I am now on CD 5.  I have been a little more uncomfortable as far as \\"achy\\" ovaries.  Today we had intercourse and it actually was uncomfortable for me.  I thought it was odd as that has never happened to me before, but just now I noticed I am spotting again bright red.  Should I be concerned enough to bother my OB tomorrow or is that a common side affect?","Doctor":"Hello, Achy ovary is possible with clomid as its mechanism of action is to induce multiple eggs at a time. But spotting is not due to clomid,it might be ovulation spotting only. If it was just a spotting and no bleeding or pain right now you need not bother your OB. But if it is unbearable pain,or frank bleed then you need to show up your OB immediately. Regarding low sperm count of your husband you can consult your OB for the medication to improve the sperm count. Don't worry, all the best. Take care.

Second advice would be to go for a thyroid function test since you say you are bloating up,as abnormal thyroid levels can also lead to infertility. Meet your doctor with the reports,and follow her advice on further management . It is not a big problem so don't worry it will get solved soon. Take care.

Thanks for posting your query here. So many conditions affect the fertilization of egg. How about the egg or ovum release? In general it is released from the ovary and is transferred to the uterus. If the egg is not fertilized it results in menstruation. To fertilize the egg a motile and viable sperm is necessary. Female factors like cervical mucus  condition, any vaginal infections, vaginal pH will affect the sperm viability within the uterus. Male factors like hypospadias, ejaculated semen volume, sperm count, motile or immotile sperms, the pH of the seminal fluid will determine the fertilizing capacity of the sperm. Timing of intercourse-maximum chances of fertilization in the fertile period and the entry of sperms into the uterine cavity will also determine the fertilization of egg. Please check the conditions what I mentioned above and definitely you will get a clue for the  diagnosis. Hope this is helpful to you.

PCOD is the commonest cause of infertility and hormonal imbalance observed in the reproductive age group and it responds very well to management. Before initiating any treatment, you should get completely investigated; a hormonal profile, glucose tolerance test, tubal patency test, ovarian reserve, serum DHEAS levels, serum prolactin levels and thyroid profile are needed. Your partner also needs to be assessed. You may need priming with dexamethasone or Metformin before induction. If you are overweight, please maintain a proper diet and exercise and regulate your body weight within the normal BMI (19-25). Natural conception is possible; twin pregnancy may sometimes occur with hyper-stimulation of the ovaries and this is why regular monitoring is done during induction.

You should take a pregnancy test with a fresh early morning sample. If it is ambiguous, go for the blood pregnancy test and a trans-vaginal sonogram and report to your consultant for further management. Your symptoms may be premenstrual as well and are not specific for an early pregnancy. Wish you success."},{"Patient":"HiI have just married three months back. We both like to have baby. So I like to get pregnancy. But I had the problem of abnormal menses. I have consulted the doctor. She told me to take glyciphage sr500 and m2 tone for two months. But my worry is, if I take it continuously for two months, is it any chance to get pregnancy now. Please advise","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic. Your menstrual problem may be due to Poly Cystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD). It is due to hormonal imbalance and is characterized by irregular periods, anovulatory cycles, increased androgen production, disturbances in thyroid function and insulin resistance. Glyciphage is Metformin given to improve insulin action. M2tone is a herbal preparation also given in PCOD. M2 tone is claimed to induce ovulation. Metformin also stimulates ovulation by improving estrogen action in addition to its action on insulin. Ovulation means release of egg from ovum. This egg fuses with the sperm, forms zygote and gets implanted (attached) in uterus and develops in to fetus. Failure in ovulation will delay your conception. Since both Metformin and M2tone stimulates ovulation your chances of pregnancy will improve on taking these drugs. Also, you have to take them regularly to conceive. Stopping them will delay your chances of conception. I hope this is useful to you."},{"Patient":"Hi doc.

Since your periods are overdue and you are having a slight spotting, this could be an implantation bleeding. You need to get your urine tested to find out your status of pregnancy.

My pregnency is a big question mark to me. Can i know will i conceive or not?","Doctor":"Hi. thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic. As long as your menstrual cycles are ovulatory, the chances of your conception are high even if your periods are irregular. Ovafar is Clomiphene citrate. It is given to induce ovulation. It is given every monthly. It is started as 50 mg dose and given for 5 days usually from the 2nd day of the cycle. If the response to 50 mg is not satisfactory, then your Dr will increase the dose to 100 mg, the next month. After 2 to 3 months the dose can be increased to 200 mg. If this is not successful then one of the following ways can be adopted. 1. Combination of Clomiphene with Human Chorionic Gonadotropin on the last two days. 2. Menotropin for 10 days followed by  Human Chorionic Gonadotropin on the next day. 3. Pulsatile administration of GnRH analogs like Nafrelin. The success rate of   the above methods are around 90%. If these fail, then assisted reproductive techniques like In-vito Fertilization (IVF), Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT), Zygote Intra fallopian Transfer (ZIFT)  and Intra cytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) are available to improve your chances of conception.

You may receive your normal cycle either as expected or a little later. If you do not get a period 10-14 days within your expected date, you should consult your doctor for an assessment.  It is true that 14 days before the next cycle is the day of ovulation and is the most fertile time for conception. Hope this information is useful.

Please understand that IgG is immunoglobulin G which is elevated in response to an old infection. THe values of IgG do not indicate any recent infection. To know whether you are positive for Rubella and CMV, you have to get Ig M test done, which is immunoglobulin M, which is indicative of a recent infection, if it is elevated. If your IgM levels are increased, you need to avoid pregnancy till you are vaccinated against Rubella and immune to it. Your current values do not mean anything, they merely indicate that you are already immune against the diseases.

The symptoms your are saying about seems to be GI problem -Dyspepsia-where there is fault with the digestion. This is causing bloating, constipation and lower abdominal pain. The lower abdominal pain is because of constipation. It could be relieved by taking laxatives in the night. Cremaffin, dulcolax or lactulose can be used. Bloating of the stomach can be relieved by taking omeprazole or pantoprazole one tablet daily. If the problem persists please visit a gastro for further management.Regarding your periods-how irregular is not mentioned by you. A low Hb value-anaemia- may cause irregularity in the periods.

I believe my last one was either November or December 2012 and it is now APRIL 2013! I'm worried because I've heard and read many different possible causes. I just want to know if there is any possible reasoning for this... I want to have children eventually but I'm extremely nervous that what I'm experiencing won't allow me to.I am also a type 1 diabetic, since september 2009.Thanks!","Doctor":"Dear Cassandra, I hope these words will relieve some of your nervousness and be usefull to you: Abnormal blood sugar levels can cause your cycles to be irregular and consequently may affect your chances of getting pregnant, but the good thing is, once you have optimum blood sugar controll, you are as normal individuals. By optimum blood sugar controll I mean fasting levels not more than 90 mg/dl and the 2 hours postprandial not more than 140 mg/ dl. ( you can divide by 18 to convert to mm/l ), and the HbA1C not more than 6. If you are having irregular cycles inspite of optimum blood sugar controll, there are many other causes and the first thing to start with is to measure these hormone levels at the second day of menstruation (either spontaneous or induced by drugs): FSH, LH, TSH, Prolactin. Finally loosing some weigh and optimizing your BMI (Body Mass Index) may be of very good help. I wish you best of luck Cassandra..

Given the history of fibroids and persistent heavy cycles as well as attempts at conception that are approaching a year, you need repeat evaluate of your uterus with an ultrasound.  Given that the fibroids can also cause blockage of your tubes, it would also be worth considering a test called a hysterosalpingram to assess whether or not the tubes are blocked.  It is not unusual for couples to take up to a year to get pregnant, but in your case, there are reasons to do this evaluation sooner. I hope that this helps.

TB however could be a cause of infertility, but actually contributes a very small percentage to that. Tests evaluating infectious, hormonal, inflammatory, anatomic causes should be evaluated. The male factor i infertility contributes to over 1/3 of these. The sperm count and other parameters in the make also need a critical evaluation. I suggest you book an appointment with the infertility specialist, preferably with your partner for a critical planning and scheduling of the evaluation and management scheme.

Premature greying of your hair is genetic and not associated with any problems related to conception.

As you are ovulating regularly and as all tests are noraml, once check for semen analysis of your husband to rule out the male factor. Sometimes ovulation induction can lead to hyper-stimulation.

If you have done that, as you take the medication, your ovulation status will be monitored by a follicular study and timed intercourse would be advised along with any injections to enhance ovulation.

Nevertheless, it responds very well to treatment and conception is very well possible. You should get a proper protocol work up that includes hormonal profiles, glucose tolerance test, tests for tubal patency and a trans-vaginal sonogram. Assessment of the male factor also is done simultaneously. The medication you are receiving at present is good, but you would need ovulation induction, cycle monitoring and timed intercourse for conception. You have to reduce weight as this definitely helps in correction of the problem to a good extent. Wish you success."},{"Patient":"I had sex for the first time yesterday, & we used a condom.

I am really sorry to hear this and I suggest you not to worry at all!! I thank you for posting your query here and I'm definitely going to help you out.. I being a surgeon, we encounter so many such cases day in and day out.. I read your question completely and have understood it well enough.. I will analyze all your points and provide necessary explanation.. 1. Sex for 1st time and used a condom. That's great, please continue using condoms, it prevents STD too.. 2. Tear in condom but no ejaculation.. If your male partner is so sure that he did not ejaculate then, chill my friend. There's no chance you'll be pregnant.. 3. I can say, with 100% certainty that you won't be pregnant.. Take it from me. 4. And periods after one or two days. Then, it's self explanatory and 100% confirmed that you can not be pregnant. Generally, ovulation occurs 14 days prior or after menstruation cycle in 28 to 30 day cycle. So, going by this logic, you should have ovulated 14 days before you had sex. And remember, ovum or egg can survive maximum for 2 to 3 days!! Hence there was no ovum only to fertilize even if he had ejaculated entire semen inside your vagina. 5. So chill.. And do not worry..

So, chances of pregnancy are almost nil. Moreover, she has ensured herself double protection with the emergency pill. The pill contains excess hormone to disrupt the normal hormonal milieu of the body and this is the cause of the spotting observed. Her cycles may remain disturbed for a month or two.

You should get a trans-vaginal sonogram and see a specialist for a proper appraisal of your situation.

Trying to conceive since then..For about two years i had homeopathic medicine.. but did not get any positive results.. hence we opted for holopathy medicines.. For about 2 and half months am taking the following medicines..(Meprate and Glycomet)..Please advice me what effects will these medicines have in me.. are there any chances in getting pregnant and how long should i take these medicines for getting pregnant..","Doctor":"Hi, Firstly, I would suggest that you see an infertility specialist who can assess you properly with all the necessary investigations before initiating any sort of treatment. Meprate is medroxyprogesterone, a hormone used to treat progesterone deficiency states. Glycomet is metformin, an anti-diabetic medication used when insulin resistance is suspected as a cause of anovulation. By maintaining the blood glucose levels, this drug aids in inducing ovulation. They may be taken until your doctor insists. Medroxyprogesterone may be changed to something safer while metformin can be continued. Please get further suggestions from your doctor.

The cause of that miscarriage should be thoroughly evaluated in order to prevent future complications. There is not much to be worried about the duration of bleeding so long as they are regular and without any further complaint. The beta-hCG level is normal. You should see a specialist and go through a series of investigations that could include a trans-vaginal sonogram, complete hormonal profile and tests of tubal patency. Urinary infection has to be cleared before attempt at conception is contemplated as this can lead to infertility. Please see your doctor for further suggestions.

In that scenario, there's absolutely no way you can end up in pregnancy. Never. 2. Blow job again will not lead to pregnancy.. So do not worry about it. Just chill out.. 3. Touching again won't cause pregnancy even if it's your vagina.

Please help as we are very excited to try and have a baby and are very curious to a rough estimate as to how long it could take to get pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello, I would be happy to help you with your question. You are right, implanon is supposed to remain in place for only 3 years, but there is a certain amount of hormone present that is still active for some time after that.  Over the last 2 years (you did not indicate) I would assume that you had some resumption of normal cycles?  Once you are having regular cycles (which might be delayed if there is still hormone in your system) then the chance of conceiving every month that you try is about 15-20%.  85% of couples will conceive within the first year off of birth control.

The HSG report says that your uterus is mildly deviated to the right, which is of no issue for conception. THe fimbria, that is the distal end of the tube is blocked. HSG cannot determine the cause of block.

Common causes of irregular cycles are stress, anxiety, emotional upheaval, frequent travelling, rapid weight gain or loss. Thyroid disorder, adrenal disorder, high prolactin levels should be ruled out. Polycystic ovaries are a common condition which leads to irregular cycles and difficulty in conceiving.

The emergency pill is mostly effective when taken within the stipulated time only. The pill contains high dose of hormone and can cause breakthrough bleeding as a hormonal disturbance is created.

This can be alleviated by using lubricant creams,but, please remember that certain creams are harmful to the sperms. It is sufficient if you can have unprotected intercourse on alternate days during the fertile period. Some precautions that can be taken are-do not move and lie in a supine position if you have an anteverted uterus and in prone position if you have a retroverted uterus for at least half-an-hour after the act.

We decided to go to Fertility Center of IL; her results all came out positive, even tho she has one ovary (left one). My results came from the SA test were 47.7 Million (Count), 62% ( Motility ) and 2% (Morphology) – I was told my sperm morphology is low as the avg is 14%. I was also told to take CoQ-10 and Fish Oil. Would this really improve my Morphology? And if so, how long until we would be able to conceive? I would really, really appreciate some answers!! Thank you!!!","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for your query. Sperm morphology — the size and shape of sperm — is one of the things checked in a semen analysis for male infertility. Sperm morphology results are reported as the percentage of sperm that appear normal when semen is viewed under a microscope. Normal sperm have an oval head with a long tail. Abnormal sperm have head or tail defects — such as a large or misshapen head or a crooked or double tail. These defects may affect the ability of the sperm to reach and penetrate an egg. However, having a large percentage of misshapen sperm isn't uncommon; in fact, if your sperm sample contains only 4 percent \\"morphologically normal forms,\\" it's considered normal. Morphology is just one piece of a fertility analysis and, by itself, does not determine fertility. Other important factors checked in a sperm analysis are: Semen volume Total sperm number Sperm concentration Vitality of sperm Motility of sperm If a semen analysis shows irregularities in any of these areas, a wait-and-see approach is generally tried first. Another semen analysis is usually done after four to six weeks to see whether sperm quality has improved on its own. If there are still abnormalities, tests may be necessary to look for an underlying problem. Common causes include Infections High fever Usage of illegal drugs Alcohol consumption Congenital testicular abnormalities Varicocele – Enlargement of veins within the scrotum Toxin exposure causes reduced sperm motility Cigarette smoke causes abnormal morphology Organic solvents causes coiled tails An assessment by a Urologist is a must for diagnosis and treatment. Even with abnormal sperm morphology, motility problems or a low sperm count, it's important to remember that an abnormal semen analysis does not mean you are infertile. Many men with low semen analysis values are still able to father children. It just may take longer, a year or more. If you and your partner aren't able to conceive through sexual intercourse, assisted reproductive technology such as in vitro fertilization may be an option."},{"Patient":"Hi My wife and myself are desperate to get a baby.

Insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinaemia are prominent features of PCOS . Metformin won't restore ovulation in all people. it is more likely to do so in those that are overweight, as they have more significant insulin resistance. Long term use can also lower androgen levels which can help, but full effect can take 6-8 weeks. In general, in a lean PCOS patient, it is usually less likely to restore ovulation. If you are trying to conceive, you need to consider other alternatives than just metformin alone. Since you are lean and slim,I have my doubts regarding the use of metformin in you. You should discuss with your doctor regarding this. Metformin  reduces insulin resistance of peripheral tissue and allows muscle and adipose cells to utilize glucose at normal insulin levels. Since type 2 diabetes associated with overweight and diabetes and PCOS patients have marked insulin resistance,this drug is commonly used in both conditions.

I am really confused what is happening on me .please help me.nizmin","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for the query. Scanty flow during periods can occur due to many causes like hormonal imbalance, anemia etc. And also just by symptoms we cannot confirm or rule out the pregnancy. The symptoms you are experiencing can also be due to hormonal effect as part of routine menstrual cycle. So you better go for blood test for pregnancy once. If the test comes negative, you can take symptomatic treatment for current symptoms. If the symptoms persist or become severe you better consult gynecologist and get investigated to find out the actual cause of the problem.

Yet, estrogens are contraindicated when pregnancy is contemplated. Effect of hormones on the embryo has been seen after 45 days, so your doctor may have prescribed this now. Once implantation has occurred, you may not need the medication and supportive treatment is ensued, so as to prevent a miscarriage.

Please consult an expert gynecologist for thorough preconceptional counselling. Commonest cause of miscarriage are genetic reasons. Ideally, karyotyping of products of conception should have been done. You and your partner should undergo genetic evaluation. Intra uterine infections should be ruled out, and treated if present. Uterine and cervical abnormalities should be screened out. Autoimmune causes of abortions should be evaluated by appropriate tests.

Birth control pills if taken regularly are more than 95 % effective in preventing pregnancy. Also, emergency contraceptive pills taken within 24 hours are also similarly highly effective. However, in the first cycle of birth control pill use, it is common to prescribe added barrier method of contraception, because it takes a month for the pills to start working, as they are hormone containing. Still, the chances of your being pregnant are highly remote. But they are not 0 %. There is always a theoretical risk of pregnancy, however negligible.

It appears that you have an ovarian cyst in the left ovary. Without looking at the ultrasound report, it is difficult to say what is causing it. It could be  simple follicular cyst.

Fusion of sperm with ovum to form a fertilized ovum. 2. Implantation of the fertilized ovum in the Uterus. So, the involvement of sperm is needed. If sperm has not entered inside her genital tract, then there is no chance of pregnancy. However, the pre cum (pre ejaculatory fluid) also has low levels of sperm. So, even if this pre ejaculatory fluid (pre cum) enters into the genital tract, the sperms present in it can fertilize the ovum. Hence, resulting in pregnancy. There is no need to worry, you can wait till she gets her periods. If they are delayed, a Pregnancy test can be done to confirm it. In case of pregnancy, it will give a positive result within one week. Wishing a Good Health.

Firstly, understand that Lupron depot has the common side effect of scanty or delayed periods or no periods at all also. So your amenorrhoea is due to Lupron. Please dont worry as you will resume your natural periods once the effect of Lupron wears off. Regarding your conception, it depends on lots of factors. The grade and severity of your endometriosis. Patency of your tubes. Your ovarian reserve and semen analysis of your partner. If your endometriosis was severe enough to warrant Lupron shots, please go in for IUI or IVF after consulting an infertility specialist at the earliest, before the endometriomas recur.

Please stop googling and consult an Infertility specialist at the earliest. First get yourself investigated for the 2 miscarriages. Causes could be genetic, uterine abnormalities, hormonal disturbances, infections, autoimmune conditions etc. Next, have a complete PCOS investigation panel done. Assess your tubal patency by HSG or laparoscopy. Have your partner's semen analysis done. Maintain a healthy BMI and take folic acid tablets. Also, with PCOS, you might need help of ovulation inducing agents to conceive, as PCOS patients have irregular ovulation and irregular cycles. PLease consult an expert at the earliest.

I am currently waiting for my next period and want to know what the chances of being pregnant at this stage are?","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for consulting us. If you have not had any unprotected intercourse during this cycle then pregnancy is extremely unlikely at this stage.

I think you are messing around with your system , with your ' calculations \\" Having sex around ovulation and then taking I pill is funny and unwise. As such, I pill will mess with your menstrual cycles. And nobody can specifiy when they \\" have to be \\" or \\" want to be \\" pregnant, particularly at 37.

As you used medicines for many days, you better give 3 months gap. Try to maintain ideal weight, take insulin sensitizers which will help in regularizing the periods.

If you are not pregnant, and as your hormonal profile is normal, then the cause for the delayed period could be inadequate ovarian function as you have only one ovary left and owing to your age, the ovarian reserve of your other ovary is also likely to be less.

Firstly, you have been trying for only 10 months to conceive, so I wonder why you are getting so anxious. Please relax, because stress is the major reason for not conceiving as I see in your case. Moreover, what medications have you already taken. At present, I would advise you to take regular folic acid supplements and naturally try for a couple of months more. You should be aware of the fertile days ( around ovulation ) during which intercourse should be essential. Maintain a healthy BMI and a positive outlook. An HSG cannot comment on multiple follicles, so something is wrong with the reports you have typed, some error in typing probably. If you fail to conceive within three months more, consult a proper Infertility specialist. get your laparoscopy done to assess tubal function and have a follicular study to detect ovulation. take care."},{"Patient":"hi doctor im 24 years old i got married 4 months before .i have pcos so my doctor gave me metroformin 500 2 pills for a day .but i dint get my period then i checked cravindex but its shown negative then my doctor suggested me to take hyponidd 4 days before..still i dint get my period.could you pls tell me can i concieve ??..im worried alot pls help me","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for your query. PCOS is characterized by irregular periods, delayed periods, scanty menstrual bleeding etc. You need to get yourself thoroughly investigated and treated for PCOS. Women with PCOS often have difficulty in ovulating and hence in conceiving. Weight loss and lifestyle management is the mainstay of treatment for PCOS. You have to maintain a healthy lifestyle, exercise regularly and eat sensibly. Metformin will help you regulate the condition to a certain extent. For conception and ovulation, you might require ovulation inducing agents such as clomiphene citrate. Please consult an Infertility specialist for thorough evaluation.

I experienced the same thing during the second month treatment period without conceiving. It was then that i decided to try it the natural way as before. When I failed to conceive after 4 times trial, I went to a different OBGYNE where I live. He prescribed the same treatment for the first time.

There could be genetic causes, autoimmune disorders, uterine abnormalities in size and shape , intra uterine infections, hormonal imbalances etc. Also, the details of the time of previous abortions, to know exactly if you have a problem in conceiving as well.

You need to wait till you miss periods and then get urine pregnancy test done for confirmation of pregnancy. Wish you good luck.

I don t know why? and every time we have sex he always cums inside me. however nothing happens. I m so sad. and I don t know what to do. I do want to go get a check up but I have no money! please help me as much as possible. thank you.","Doctor":"Endometriosis & Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) are common causes of irregular periods. Irregular periods also indicate mild hormonal imbalance & anaemia & this does not prevent a person from concieving. If your menstural cycles are ovulatory (fertile) & not anovulatory  then the chances for pregnancy is good. Painless periods indicate that your cycles are anovulatory in which case ovulation inducing drugs like Clomiphene citrate will help. You can plan your pregnancy if your cycles are ovulatory. In ovulatory cycles ovulation occurs  14 days prior to the onset of menstural cycle. Chances of fertilisation during ovulation period is very high. Slight morning rise of body temperature  indicates ovulation & 7 days after that is a fertile period. But Brenda, before you proceed, you have to rule out the causes of infertility mentioned here & correct anaemia otherwise the chances of success is minimal."},{"Patient":"me and my boyfriend been trying to conceive after intercourse sometimes the semens flows out and when it does stays in my bowel have white spots that looks like semen in it. But, the semen stayed in all throughout my fertile days and ovalution may i possibly be pregnant or not????HELP PLEASE","Doctor":"Hi,   Thanks for asking. I understand your concern. For conception- -Both semen&ovulation study needs to be normal. -ideally both sex partners should take folic acid 5mg once a day.. for  3 months    -Ovulation day  is 14 days prior to date of comming menses (provided menstrual cycle is regular)   -Start having unprotected sex 3 days before &3 days after the day of ovulation .     The white dots found while bowel movements could be thickend mucus with scanty of seminal fluid thrown out due to strainning.    When the woman gets up .. the  semen deposited in her vagina does come out in few minutes. Only thing is to avoid this spilling out for at least 20-30 minutes .... this allows  thousends of healthy sperms enter in female genital tract...     I hope that answers your question.

D and c used to be done in all cases previously, but now a days with good ultrasound scan, hormonal profile and tube testing by HSG, and husband semen analysis, we can diagnose any factor preventing you from conception. So, depending on the test results, fertility specialist can guide you for further treatment plan. If you need to do d and c, it should better be combined with laparoscopy and hysteroscopy for having complete picture. Hope this information is helpful.

If there is no internal damage of reproductive organs due to the infection, then you may conceive normally after completion of ATT. You better go for endometrial biopsy once on first day of periods followed by hysterosalpingography after completion of ATT.

My gynecologist still advised me for a fractional curettage , but i am doubtful for the procedure, is ist advisable for me to do the said procedure? she still advised me to take duphaston for 21 days from day 5 of my menstruation","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Healthcare Magic.In young women ( who are having monthly bleeds) endometrial thickness vary throughout the month. It is thin after the periods & thick just before the periods. So, best time for you to have a trans-vaginal scan is just after your periods. If thickness is normal at this time you certainly don't need any fractional curettage. As, this test is not usually recommended in women less than 40 years of age.If endometrium is very thick & irregular even after periods,  you have irregular bleeding or inter-menstrual bleeding you may need a hysteroscopy +/- endometrial biopsy which can be done in an out patient department. However, this is a general advise. I don't know your case better than your treating doctor. So, I recommend you to take a second opinion from a specialist Gynecologist.  Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi.

Ovulation happens almost 14 days prior to the next period. Therefore, if you are expecting your period tomorrow, you are unlikely to ovulate today. Hope I am clear to you. I agree to your conscience that you must be taking the morning after pill or plan B. Please take one to be safe.

Since you have irregular periods, it is difficult to predict your ovulation time and hence the fertile period. You should consult a specialist to know the cause of your irregular cycles, have investigations like a complete hormonal profile, thyroid profile, ovarian study and so on. You may use the ovulation kit to predict the ovulation time in the present state of menstruation.

My assumption is that before the polypectomy, your cycles were irregular, or you were having irregular bleeding.  A D&C is limited in terms of its ability to completely remove polyps that might be present.  It is my opinion that you need to be re-evaluated for regular bleeding, and this evaluation needs to include re-evaluation for polyps.  This would include labs to check for thyroid dysfunction, prolactin levels, diabetes screening, labs related to PCOS, and an ultrasound called a sonohysterogram.  Only then can one make a guess as to whether you will need assistance to get pregnant, or whether this will happen on its own.  Do not give up hope!!

Normally polyps do not interfere with pregnancy, particularly the one you have mentioned is too small. However, if symptomatic in the form of inter menstrual bleeding, or heavy menstrual bleeding  - they indicate removal. Also, much depends on the histopathology of the previous polyp which was removed. Some polyps have malignant potential. Also, at 34, apart from the polyp, your ovarian reserve and the status of your fallopian tubes would also affect chances of conception.

Kindly provide the details for me to understand better. THyroxine is given to patients with hypothyroidism, if your TSH is elevated, in order to normalize thyroid function, as hypothyroidism can lead to infertility and abortions. Nitrofurantoin is an antibiotic given for urinary tract infections. Clomid is clomiphene which is given to induce ovulation in case you have difficulty in ovulating.

However in the event that you do conceive, primolut contains norethisterone which has adverse effects on the pregnancy. Your doctor hopes to regulate your current cycle before beginning stimulation with Clomid next month. Hence, primolut which contains progesterone has been prescribed.

Other causes of such altered menstrual bleeding could be : Stress, anxiety, emotional upheavals, frequent travelling, intake of hormonal medications, thyroid disorders, polycystic ovaries etc. Such scant spotting once in a while is a normal occurence also.

At the weekend (2 days after ovulation) I needed to pee frequently and straight away and the gaging heightened. The day my period was due came and went, on the next day i did a test - negative. Two hours later my period appeared with cramps. usually i get cramps first then blood . I feel so confused! Could i still be pregnant. My period is mostly normal - although I have seen dark brown disharge at times and sometimes when i wipe the blood is red but very watery - resembling water colours. If I am pregnant, when could I test again? I have read that sometimes your hcg levels can be too low and the mentruation hormone can over power it. Is this true?","Doctor":"Hello thank you for your query. The symptoms that you describe might be related to periods, but are not confirmatory. Urine pregnancy tests are 97 % reliable - so if your test is negative, then you are most probably not pregnant. In the rare event of an early pregnancy not being detected, you can test again by a pregnancy kit test after a week, but better still is to consult a Gynecologist to have a definitive opinion. She would examine you and check for a pregnancy, at the same time assessing the weird symptoms you have. Pregnancy is best confirmed with a blood test / ultrasound compared to a urine test. take care."},{"Patient":"I am 11 days post embryo transfer (2 embryos).  I have had light bleeding for about 5 days.  Cramps just started 2 days ago.  They are not severe.  There is no clotting.  It is much better sitting with my feet up or lying down.  I developed a rash/splotchy like appearance on my abdomen today.  Am I having a failed transfer or is this implantation bleeding and normal?","Doctor":"Hi, I think you can be having an implantation bleeding. This will become clear by bhcg test only. If it is positive, then it is an implantation bleeding otherwise it is a failed transfer. Get bhcg done 14 days after transfer."},{"Patient":"Hi I m Sheryll, 32 yrs old i was diagnosed bilateral polycystic ovary . I ve tried pills for 5 months to regulate my menstrual cycle but on the 8th month my cycle becomes abnormal. I tried pregnancy test but the result is negative & I was advised to undergo Transvaginal Ultrasound again but still i have PCOS. I also tried taking Metformin but still no effect. I am desperate now. Does a person diagnosed to have PCOS wont get pregnant? Pls help me & enlighten me... Thanks...","Doctor":"Hello Sheryll, Thank you for your query. People diagnosed with PCOS will face difficulty in conceiving, but it is not impossible. You need to consult a proper infertility specialist. Diet and weight loss with regular exercise is the backbone of therapy for PCOS. Moreover, just taking Metformin might not help you conceive. You might require the help of medications which help you ovulate . Also, you should not waste further time, but consult a Fertility specialist for adequate treatment. Since you are 32, do not waste more time Take care."},{"Patient":"dears,,,, i was having an ectopic preg. last year , i made laproscopy without removal of the tube. since last august i was trying to conceive but every month the period was not coming on its time and at last i discovered that i am having pcos ..my doc. had prescribed me glucophage .. and merional this is the third month to use merional .. iam waiting my period today as every month since using merional it comes on 20 th .... i cant wait to have pregnancy .. and if not what could be my next step .. and i am afraid of having ectopic again","Doctor":"Hello Thank you for your query. Firstly, you should consult an Infertility Specialist. PCOS leads to irregular periods and irregular ovulation. Hence, you might need treatment in order to ovulate and conceive in the form of ovulation inducing drugs and / or injections. Moreover, you need to have your fallopian tube patency assessed, as that might lead to infertility, specially since a previous ectopic can damage or block the tube even if it was not removed. Your partner's semen analysis needs to be done. All said and done, consult a Specialist for detailed work up and treatment Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor i have a big question Okay so me and my boyfriend were trying to get pregnant for a while we have tried 3 times and fail this last time we tried was weird my last period was on December 28 2012 I supposed to get my period at the end of January or so but I didn t I was late for 3 weeks and got it on February 13, 2013 for 4 days which was weird cuz my period always last for 6 or 7 days and yes it was dark red like normal when are my fertility days to get pregnant? This last time we had sex when he got up of me something was leaking it looked like water I don t know if it was his sperm or it was me please help me!!!","Doctor":"Hello Thank you for your query. The leaking fluid you describe is seminal fluid, which liquifies after some time, and might appear watery. Regarding your fertile days, if you have a regular 28 day cycle, ovulation occurs on day 14, so for 2 days before and after it, are your fertile days. If your periods are irregular, you cannot count the fertile days in this manner. You should use Ovulation Predictor kit or follicular monitoring for knowing precise dates. Also, you should get yourself investigated for irregular menstrual bleed. It could be early pregnancy which miscarried, stress, anxiety, weight changes, thyroid hormonal fluctuations or polycystic ovaries. The consultation is all the more important since you are trying to conceive. Take care"},{"Patient":"Hi.. My name is Bindiya and i am 32 years of age. Last month my egg ruptued on 21st day of after getting my periods. Usually i ll get my periods in every 27 days. Is it necessary that every month the egg ruptured period will be same as 21st day?.. Many people suggested me to postponed my periods by taking postponed tablets to get conceive? Kindly guide me to get conceive soon..","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for the query. You didn't mention how you verified the ovulation. Usually after ovulation it will take around 14 days for the onset of periods. But according to your previous cycles 27 days cycles, you should have early ovulation. So you better consult gynecologist, undergo follicular study to track the ovulation and plan unprotected intercourse around the period of ovulation. This can increase the possibility of pregnancy. Don't use pills for postponement, that is not correct.

What will be the problem ? , what kind of medicine we try?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for the query. Once check for the positivity of antiphospolipid antibodies in your wife. If that comes positive she has to take steroid treatment for few months. Then your wife can go for ovulation induction with your doctor's advice and you plan intercourse around the time of ovulation. After conceiving let her continue the pregnancy with the support of progesterone and aspirin etc. By these the possibility of future fetal loss can be prevented to some extent.

Now am advised to have Fertyl 50mg from 3rd to 7th day of my menstrual cycle. I want to know the reason why i cud not conceive still and will fertyl be helpful. I want to conceive as early as possible. Kindly advise.","Doctor":"Hi, The reasons for delay in conception could be many. The timing of intercourse should correlate with ovulation, ovulation should be normal, tubes should be patent, uterine factor, cervical factor should be favorable, there should be normal male factor and so on. Fertyl is given to induce ovulation when natural ovulation fails or is low and irregular. Even with natural ovulation, induction will help enhance the process.

I missed a pill about day 13 on my cycle. My boyfriend and I still had unprotected sex. I had also been taking my pills at very different times during the day. It is about a week before my expected period and I am lightly spotting and have cramps . What are the chances I could be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for the query. As you didn't use the pill in prescribed schedule, the complete protection cannot be expected. The symptoms you are experiencing could be withdrawal effects of the pill. But now the possibility of the pregnancy cannot be excluded completely. In that case the spotting you are experiencing could be implantation bleeding also. So, you better wait till your expected date of periods and if you miss the periods, go for pregnancy test once. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, my name is Kasturi.

My husband feels it may be because of him suffering from jaundice three months ago, while I feel it may be due to the anti-depressants I had to take some months back. Kindly help. Many thanks.","Doctor":"Hello Kasturi Thanks for your query. Get a semen analysis of your husband. As far as anti depressants are concerned there is nothing to be concerned. Chances of conception is 20-25 % every cycle even if everything is normal. So you both need not worry and keep trying. Chances of having healthy baby at the end of one year of trying is as high as 85%.

Shifting countries does not lead to infertility. Your cycles are delayed, so you need to be investigated for that. Causes could be stress, anxiety, recent weight gain or weight loss, thyroid disorders, polycystic ovaries etc. If you have been trying for a year now, I suggest you consult a good Fertility specialist for a complete work up and evaluation. Also, you need to continue taking prenatal vitamins. Also, sometimes, during ovulation, you might feel mild period like pain or have slight spotting, but these are not reliable, specially with irregular cycles. take care"},{"Patient":"hi me and my partner have been trying for a baby and i have a strong feeling i am pregnat but recently a day after my period was due i started bleeding a fair bit but not as heavy as normally because i did bleed wih my last pregnant with my daughter and i was pregnant and i didnt show up till i was 7 weeks pregant plus when this happened they said i had miscarryed but if that was true i would have been 4 weeks pregant so i wanted to know i am i pregnant","Doctor":"Hello, As you are trying for pregnancy and you had less than normal bleeding, you should get a urine pregnancy test done or for more confirmatory evidence, get a blood test for pregnancy hormone that is b HCG done As, implantation bleeding around the time of expected period is common. hope this is helpful to you.

You can take estrogen for the growth of endometrium and when it reaches a thickness more than 8.5 mm , you can take 3 or 5 days of progesterone according to the embryos frozen and then transfer can be done.

What should be looked at for figuing this out and what could be causing this?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for the query. Better to undergo ultrasound once to rule out possibilities like poly cystic ovary disease or any other structural abnormalities. Hormonal evaluation should be done, including thyroid profile, prolactin levels, estrogen, progesterone, FSH, LH etc. With this primary workup the possible causes  for your irregular periods can be made out and treatment can be given accordingly.

During that period there is less possibility for ovulation in case of regular periods. When you think of something that can come in our dreams.

Most of your symptoms are non-specific and can be seen in many conditions like premenstrual phase, infections etc. So you better wait till your expected date of periods and if you miss the date, then go for pregnancy test.

I have a daughter who is 12 yrs old. delivery was by C- section. one year after the delivery I conceived again but due to some reasons there was miscarriage ,After this me didn t try to conceive again till 2005. none for last 7-8 years we are trying w/o any luck so far. in 2007 I was operated for endometriosis which was successful. on the advice of doctor ,I also got the HSG done to check of the tubes are fine and even that was also reported to the fine But despite of many tries, I couldn t conceive. Finally we decided to go for IUI(2009), but still no luck.all the test on my husband were also O.K. very recently also we got the IUI done again, but still no result. I am writing this to you to get your valuable advice in this case. I will be very grateful if you can give me an appointment to meet you and discuss the case. I have heard a lot about you. Request you to consider my case. Last week I had gone to AIIMS, and was suggested to get AMH (ANti Mullerian Hormone) test done. I got this test from Dr. Dang s lab (Delhi-Hauz Khas). Result is : 0.37 ng/ml Infertility work up baseline TVS Right Ovary size 17.9 * 13.3 * 16.8 cm AFC 5 Vol 2.4 Laft Ovary size 17.8* 14.6*15.4 cm AFC 3 Vol 2.1 kindly suggest if can be improved with medication , and whether I will be able to conceive naturally? Thanking You Neetu Datta","Doctor":"Hello Neetu Thank you for your query and for your detailed history. Firstly, your chances of natural conception are quite less. You have already had surgery for endometriosis, and HSG is not always reliable. Your tubes could have suffered a damage, which is best confirmed by a diagnostic laparoscopy. ALso , endometriosis surgery affects the ovaries, leading to decreased ovarian reserve. Age 38 also causes decreased efficiency of ovaries to produce eggs. This is reflected in both your AMH, which is very low, and your AFC, which is low too. With these values, it would be foolish to wait for natural conception. ALso, your husband's semen analysis needs to be done. YOu have two options - either straightaway go for IVF ( in vitro fertilization ) or go for a diagnostic laparoscopy and maximum 1 -2 more cycles of IUI if findings are normal, and then IVF. Please consult a leading Infertility specialist in Delhi take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am Madhu. I am trying for my first baby. I did my follicle test and ovulated on the 17th day. I had physical contact during my fertile period. Now my doctor has prescribed susten 200 which I have started taking from yesterday (1st March-26th day). Today I am getting abdominal pain . Is this due to the medicine or the indication of next period? Will I conceive?","Doctor":"Hello, Susten is a natural progesterone and does support healthy conception and pregnancy. Progesterone plays a major role during the two weeks after ovulation because it supports embryo implantation. When the egg is released during ovulation, progesterone is secreted by the follicle that used to contain the mature egg. This follicle now becomes the corpus luteum and produces progesterone for the next 14 days of the menstrual cycle. This part of the menstrual cycle is called the luteal phase and it should last for 14 days. During this time the lining receives the fertilized embryo. By supplementing with progesterone, it is possible to support pregnancy and prevent miscarriage by supporting the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Your pain abdomen doesn't seem to be due to susten and it could be due to impending periods. However,Just wait and watch and pray to the god that pregnancy,if there,gets sustained. Even if you happen to fail this time,there is nothing o get disheartened as you will get plenty of opportunities in future.

After a missed abortion, you can plan for next pregnancy after a gap of 3 months. The torch test results which you mentioned are all IG- G reports, which indicates infection in past and is not significant. The most probable cause of early pregnancy loss is chromosomal abnormalities. You can plan for next pregnancy after a gap of 3 months and you should start taking folic acid tablets pre-conceptionally. Hope I have cleared your doubts.

I think that you should still be concerned about the remaining tube.  For the same reasons that you had the ectopic in 2007, your other tube might be diseased as well in a way that was not detectable on HSG.  There should be consideration of a laparoscopy to look at the other tube, and to assess for adhesions.  I only suggest this because IUI is expensive, and if the remaining tube is not functional or there are adhesions, then it will likely not work or you will be at risk for a recurrent ectopic pregnancy.

Around cycle day 8, one becomes the dominating follicular and will be the one that ovulates. Most of the other follicular have dies or are too small in size to have a chance to ovulate. These remaining small follicular stay around to support the dominating follicle  by producing hormones for it and the lining. This is the nature' s way and nobody can predict on which side of ovary,you are going to ovulate. It is perfectly normal to have one follicle and why it happens,no body knows.

Do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels and a ultrasound for your uterus and ovaries to find out the cause of irregular periods.  It can be due to some thyroid disorder or may be polycystic ovaries.  If anything is abnormal, it can be treated. You can track your ovulation by repeated ultrasound.

Tubal ligation has a failure rate of 2 - 10 per 1000 women ligated. Which means, it is not 100 % effective, though highly effective. Hence, yes, there could be a chance of pregnancy in your case. Other causes of irregular cycles are endometriosis, stress, anxiety, metropathic cycles, weight fluctuations rapidly, polycystic ovaries, endometrial hyperplasia, hormonal medications etc. Also, a word of caution, erratic spotting could herald an ectopic pregnancy, and after tubal ligation, chances of ectopic pregnancy are much higher compared to chances of an intra uterine pregnancy.

Its efficacy when taking at most 48 hours after intercourse is greater than 80% in preventing pregnancies, and even more when taken earlier. Considering the fact that you were exposed to spermatozoa many times during your fertile period, the chance of getting pregnant is a little bit higher. Combining a such times with other methods like the condom could be advisable. However, there are some slim chances that you might get pregnant. Doing a pregnancy test in case you fail to see your periods is sensible. However, your chances of getting pregnant are relatively low but not zero.

First time sex always painful and using water based lubrication is quite helpful. Pregnancy depends on proper timing of ovulation & unprotected sex with ejaculation.

You have taken the birth control pills very erratically, and hence, it would not offer you ideal protection against pregnancy.

I am 5 4 in height and 78 kgs in weight. I had laparoscopic surgery and ovarian drilling. The report result reads as Both tubes patent on CT. Minimal thickening and sacculation of ampullary portion . I had 7 failed IUIs. Doctors have asked me to go for IVF as I am nearing the age of 32. I usually don t ovulate on my own, so it will be induced every time by tablet or injection. I need it to be solved as early as possible. Before trying IVF I thought i can go for some natural treatment. So please let me know whether I can go for ayurveda or siddha or homeopathy to get early results without any side affects. Thanks a lot for your concern. With regards, Priscilla","Doctor":"Hi! Welcome to HCM Your major cause of infertility is anovulation due to PCOS. So the treatment is primarily required for PCOS. The treatment of PCOS can be planed after knowing exactly what the causes that responsible for it. The cause of PCOS - 1)hereditary ( genetical related) 2) Imbalance of hormonal secretion i.e more androgenic secretion. So here the trigors for over secretion of androgenic hormone directly related to our life style ( pressure packed life style), over stressful condition (physical and mental both), high polluted atmosphere, inclination towards more artificial and processed foods etc. So those thing should be rectified by maintaing a healthy food habits, taking more natural fruits and vegetables, avoid of all artificial and processed food, daily breathing exercise ( pranayam) for 15 minutes for more oxygenation of your each and every cells, daily yoga and physical activities to maintain your hormonal system healthy and normal, meditation etc. Regarding treatment side it is required a treatment that can help to modify the hormonal imbalance.   So it can be possible by the homeopathic treatment because the homeopathy treatment treat at the dynamic level. To start a homeopathic treatment it is essential to know all the detail symptoms of the patient not merely the physical symptoms but the mental and psychological aspect of symptoms too. So it is required a long case history. Still some homeopathic medicines here I am suggesting that you can take and update your condition after a 2 month period. 1) Calcarea carb - 200 - liquid- 2 drops directly put on your tongue two times in a day on every Sunday & Monday. 2) Thuja - 200 - liquid- 2 drops directly put on your tongue two times in a day on every Tuesday & Wednesday. 3) Medorrhinum - 200 - liquid- 2 drops directly put on your tongue two times in a day on every Thursday & Friday. After 2 months get the USG of abdomen and update the condition. Thank you"},{"Patient":"I HAVE TAKEN MORE THAN 50 CONTRACEPTIVE PILLS AFTER HAVING SEX WITH MY BOYFRIEND FROM ALMOST 3 YEARS.

My doctor has suggested me follicular study and on 10 day of my period the readings of Left, right and endo were respectively: 15mm, 8mm, 7mm and on 11th day my readings were 17mm, 8mm, 7.5mm. so can you please suggest me the status of my condition and which other steps do i need to take so that i can concive as soon as possible","Doctor":"Hi, thank you for query madam, The follicle needs to reach a size of 18-24mms in order for ovulation to occur.  Anything less than that will not lead to ovulation.  Without ovulation, pregnancy cannot occur.  So, based on the CD#11 ultrasound, your right follicle has not reached an appropriate size and may indicate that it is not growing, which in turn, indicates that the medication you used is not working.  My recommendation would be to repeat the ultrasound at CD#14 and CD#16.  If there is not ovulatory sized follicle at those points, then the cycle should be cancelled due to lack of response, you should be given provera for 10 days to induce a period, then start a new cycle using Clomid at 150 mg per day."},{"Patient":"I was sexually active from February 7th through the 10th without any protection.

However, im afraid that some of this may be wishful thinking. I cant find any definitive answers on when symptoms like this should or would begin. I am trying to wait until my next period is due to take a test. But I would like an opinion. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi, thank you for query; A 1 week pregnant woman is anxious and jittery as she does not know a thing about what changes are going on in her body, especially if this is her first pregnancy. Most of the women do not know the exact day when they conceived. If you are 1 week pregnant, you may not even be certain that you actually are carrying. If you are aware of the day your last period started, you can easily know about your approximate due date to deliver. It will be a bit confusing for everybody to remember to start counting from the day your period starts. But the fact is that you will not become pregnant 2 weeks after the day your period starts. For example, if your doctor says you are 12 weeks pregnant, then the period of conception is approximately 10 weeks ago. Your body will not witness much of physical change when you are only 1 week pregnant. You might not be exactly hungry during this week but the abrupt hormonal changes may make you feel depressed or frustrated. Some women might notice they urinate more often and some may notice a change in the breasts size and sensibility. Blood veins may become more visible on the breasts and some women may feel a slight unbearable tension in the same area Symptom of pregnancy at 1week Mild cramping on one and both side of stomache,tiredness,exhausted, dizzy, faint due to low bp signs of pregnancy: •     You might feel increasingly tired. •     You definitely have missed your period. •     You might feel nauseated. •     You might feel your breasts to be tender. •     You might feel the need to urinate frequently. •     You might feel that your smell is highly sensitive. •     You might feel sleepy and moody. •     You might feel bloated You should do card test for pregnancy confirmation."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor.

Firstly go for a detailed evaluation of yourself and your husband, so that the cause is identified and prevented next time.

Also, you need to have your PCOD under control, with weight reduction, lifestyle modification and Metformin to be added if your doctor agrees.

To confirm that the pregnancy is inside the uterus, to know that it is healthy and growing, and to know the exact dates of pregnancy in weeks, please visit a gynecologist and have an ultrasound. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, Age-25 , Married 2 years and there is no pregnancy . Heard about sukumara lehyam for betterment. Please tell me exactly what is sukumara lehyam Thanks","Doctor":"Hello Thank you for your query. Sukumara lehyam is an ayurvedic medication that is sometimes prescribed by ayurvedic practitioners for various ailments, including infertility. However, no scientific / allopathic studies in medical literature exists to prove its efficacy for conceiving. You should be consulting a Fertility specialist now, as you are trying to conceive since 2 years. Your husband's semen analysis should be done. Your ovulation studies and hormonal profile needs to be studied. Patency of your fallopian tubes has to be assessed. Random intake of any medicine can only cause harm. Please go by evidence based practice. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi I am 28 yr old female, i am trying to conceive for last 1.5 yrs. after my studies we found that i have low AMH. but my cycles are very regular. I always get my periods on time. so my doc suggested me clomid for 5 days along with Osure for a month and i ovulated on 13th day of cycle. also after ovulation she suggested me duphaston for 14 days. its 15th day post ovulation. but i have not got my periods when should i expect them or i don t then when should i test for pregnancy. Please suggest","Doctor":"Hello Thank you for your query. Clomid contains clomiphene citrate which helps to induce ovulation in women with anovulation due to various causes. Oosure is generally given to women with polycystic ovaries, who have a high AMH, so I do not understand why it was given in your case. Women with low AMH are generally prescribed DHEA for support. As you have ovulated with Clomid, chances of pregnancy are there, and as you have regular cycles, you can either do a pregnancy test, or better still, consult your gynecologist to confirm a pregnancy.
