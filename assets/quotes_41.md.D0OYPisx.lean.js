Since a is prime, we get that d=1, a, a^{2} or a^{3}.If d=1, the equation becomes n=a^{3}+1. Since a divides n, a divides n-a^{3}=1 so a=1, which is a contradiction.

Second, we show that there indeed exists a super-regular set of size 4; this step is called the construction or synthesis.In the following, we call the common difference of a regular set the difference between the largest number and the second largest number in that set.## Analysis:We start by showing that there does not exist a super-regular set of size 3 whose elements are all of the same sign.By contradiction, we assume a super-regular set A={a, b, c} such that a0, meaning all three elements are strictly positive. We set r=b-a>0 as the common difference of A. Then, c-b=r, so c=a+2r and b=a+r.We set B=left{frac{1}{a}, frac{1}{a+r}, frac{1}{a+2r}right} as the set composed of the inverses of the elements of A. We verify that frac{1}{a+2r}0 and a1 / b>1 / c. Moreover, the inequality 1 / a>1 / b>1 / c is false precisely when the reals are not of the same sign: if a=-1, b=1, c=3, it does not hold.Therefore, many students used b-a=c-b and 1 / b-1 / a=1 / c-1 / b to obtain a=c, and received 2 points if the inequality 1 / a>1 / b>1 / c was mentioned, 1 point otherwise, as they missed the difficulty of the problem.In fact, it was necessary to use the previous reasoning for a super-regular set of any size and show that having three consecutive elements of the same sign was impossible.

Let dim V=n.i) Prove that for every involution A on V, there exists a basis of V consisting of eigenvectorsof A.ii) Find the maximal number of distinct pairwise commuting involutions on V.","solution":" Part (i)1. Definition and Setup:   - Let ( A ) be an involution on ( V ), meaning ( A^2 = I ), where ( I ) is the identity operator.   - We need to show that there exists a basis of ( V ) consisting of eigenvectors of ( A ).2. Eigenvalues of ( A ):   - Since ( A^2 = I ), the eigenvalues ( lambda ) of ( A ) must satisfy ( lambda^2 = 1 ).   - Therefore, the possible eigenvalues of ( A ) are ( lambda = 1 ) and ( lambda = -1 ).3. Decomposition of ( V ):   - Let ( V_1 ) be the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue ( 1 ), i.e., ( V_1 = { v in V mid Av = v } ).   - Let ( V_{-1} ) be the eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue ( -1 ), i.e., ( V_{-1} = { w in V mid Aw = -w } ).4. Direct Sum of Eigenspaces:   - Any vector ( x in V ) can be written as ( x = frac{x + Ax}{2} + frac{x - Ax}{2} ).   - Define ( v = frac{x + Ax}{2} ) and ( w = frac{x - Ax}{2} ).   - Notice that ( Av = Aleft(frac{x + Ax}{2}right) = frac{Ax + A^2x}{2} = frac{Ax + x}{2} = v ), so ( v in V_1 ).   - Similarly, ( Aw = Aleft(frac{x - Ax}{2}right) = frac{Ax - A^2x}{2} = frac{Ax - x}{2} = -w ), so ( w in V_{-1} ).   - Therefore, ( x = v + w ) with ( v in V_1 ) and ( w in V_{-1} ).5. Basis of Eigenvectors:   - Since ( V_1 ) and ( V_{-1} ) are eigenspaces corresponding to distinct eigenvalues, they are linearly independent.   - The direct sum ( V = V_1 oplus V_{-1} ) spans ( V ).   - Hence, there exists a basis of ( V ) consisting of eigenvectors of ( A ). Part (ii)1. Commuting Involutions:   - We need to find the maximal number of distinct pairwise commuting involutions on ( V ).2. Simultaneous Diagonalization:   - Recall that any set of pairwise commuting, diagonalizable matrices is simultaneously diagonalizable.   - Since involutions are diagonalizable with eigenvalues ( pm 1 ), we can assume that all the matrices are diagonal in some common basis.3. Diagonal Entries:   - In the common basis, each involution ( A_i ) can be represented as a diagonal matrix with entries ( pm 1 ).   - Each diagonal entry can independently be ( 1 ) or ( -1 ).4. Number of Distinct Involutions:   - For an ( n )-dimensional vector space ( V ), there are ( n ) diagonal entries.   - Each entry can be independently ( 1 ) or ( -1 ), leading to ( 2^n ) possible distinct diagonal matrices.   - Therefore, the maximal number of distinct pairwise commuting involutions on ( V ) is ( 2^n ).The final answer is ( boxed{ 2^n } )."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x) = x sin x, find f'(π) ______.","solution":"The function is f(x) = x sin x.

We start with the conditions given in the problem: ( m ) is divisible by every integer from ( 1 ) to ( n ) (inclusive), but not divisible by ( n + 1, n + 2 ), and ( n + 3 ). This can be written as:   [   n! mid m quad text{and} quad d nmid m text{ for } d in {n+1, n+2, n+3}   ]2. From the condition ( n! mid m ), we know that ( m ) must be a multiple of ( n! ).

We need to analyze the greatest common divisor (gcd) conditions. Notice that for any non-prime ( k > 4 ), we have:   [   gcd((k-1)!, k) = k, quad gcd((k-1)!, k+1) = k+1, quad gcd((k-1)!, k+2) = k+2   ]   This is because if ( k ) is non-prime and greater than 4, then ( k ), ( k+1 ), and ( k+2 ) will have prime factors that are less than or equal to ( k ), and thus will divide ((k-1)!).4. Therefore, for ( n+1, n+2, n+3 ) to not divide ( m ), they must be prime numbers. This is because if any of ( n+1, n+2, n+3 ) were composite, their prime factors would be less than or equal to ( n ), and thus would divide ( n! ).5.

We will show that for n geqslant 3, A_{n}=A_{n-1}+A_{n-2}+1.We categorize the sequences into three classes:1. The number of sequences not ending in n is A_{n-1}, because for these, it must be true that 1 leqslant a_{1}<a_{2}<ldots<a_{k} leqslant n-1, and each term must have the same parity as its index.2. The sequence whose last term is n and does not contain any element smaller than (n-1). There is exactly one such sequence: for odd n, it is the sequence consisting of a single n, and for even n, it is the sequence (n-1), n.3. The sequences whose last term is n and contain an element smaller than (n-1). These are obtained by taking a sequence of elements not greater than (n-2) (the number of such sequences is A_{n-2}); if the largest element of this sequence has the same parity as n, then we append the numbers (n-1) and n to the sequence, and if the last element has the opposite parity to n, then we append the number n (in either case, the sequence can be extended in only one way).The total number of sequences from the three classes is A_{n-1}+A_{n-2}+1, thus proving the recursion.Let f_{n} be the n-th Fibonacci number left(f_{0}=0, f_{1}=1, f_{n+1}=f_{n}+f_{n-1}right). We will prove by induction that A_{n}=f_{n+2}-1.If n=1, there is 1 sequence: the single 1, so A_{1}=1=f_{3}-1.If n=2, the sequences (1) and (1,2) satisfy the condition, so A_{2}=2=f_{4}-1.Thus, the statement holds for n=1 and n=2. Let k geqslant 3 and assume the statement holds for n=k-1 and n=k-2.

What is the scheduled speed?","solution":"I. Solution: Let the distance AB be denoted by a. A train traveling at a constant speed will take as many hours to cover this distance as the number of kilometers it travels per hour is contained in a.

If, however, we think through the relationships of the problem before writing down the formulas, we can obtain a simpler equation.Essentially, this is the solution provided by József Békési (Nagykanizsa, D. Irányi).II. Solution: Imagine that three trains depart from A to B at the same time on three parallel tracks. One travels at the actual speed v, the second at v-5, and the third at v+5, and this third train continues its journey without stopping at B. Since the second train covers less distance per hour than the first by the same amount that the third covers more, and the trains travel at a constant speed, the first train is always equidistant from the other two at any point in time.When the first train arrives at B, the third has already left B 20 minutes, or frac{1}{3} of an hour, ago, and is thus frac{1}{3}(v+5) away from B. The second train has 25 minutes, or frac{25}{60}=frac{5}{12} of an hour, left to travel, so it still has to cover frac{5}{12}(v-5) km. Since the first train is always equidistant from the other two, we have:frac{1}{3}(v+5)=frac{5}{12}(v-5)Rearranging this,v=45 text{ km} / text{hour}is obtained."},{"problem":"Among the following functions, the one that is monotonically increasing on mathbb{R} is (　　)A: y=-xB: y=log_{3}xC: y=x^{frac{1}{3}}D: y=left(frac{1}{2}right)^{x}","solution":"Solution: A.

Use geometry to find the points: The line ( x + y = c ) is tangent to the circle when the distance from the origin to the line is 1 (the radius of the circle).

If b can be represented as the product of at least three prime factors (not necessarily distinct), then it is not less than 11^{3}>374, and thus a+b is greater than 374. Now let b be representable as exactly two prime factors. If b=q r for distinct prime numbers q and r, then by the above, a is divisible by both q and r, but then it is divisible by b, which is impossible.The only case left to consider is when b=s^{2} for some prime s geqslant 11.

Indeed, ifP(x)=a_{n} x^{n}+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+ldots+a_{1} x+a_{0}comparing the coefficients in front of the same degrees of x in P(x) . P(x+1) and Pleft(x^{2}right), we get a_{n}=1 and a_{n-1}=-frac{n}{2}. It is easily seen that each of the subsequent coefficients is a solution of an equation of first degree of the form 2 x+b=0, where b is a function of already chosen coefficients. Therefore, if a polynomial of degree n with the desired property exists it is unique one.We prove now that a polynomial P(x) of odd degree such that P(x) cdot P(x+1)=Pleft(x^{2}right) does not exist. Let P(x)=x^{m}(x-1)^{n} cdot Q(x) ( m or n could be zero), where Q(x) is a polynomial such that Q(0) neq 0 and Q(1) neq 0. A substitution gives(x+1)^{m} cdot x^{n} cdot Q(x) cdot Q(x+1)=x^{m} cdot(x+1)^{n} cdot Qleft(x^{2}right)If m neq n the substitution x=0 leeds to a contradiction. Therefore m=n and so Q(x) cdot Q(x+1)=Qleft(x^{2}right), where Q(x) is of odd degree. Therefore there exists a real number x_{0} neq 0,1, such that Qleft(x_{0}right)=0. It is clear that x_{0}=-1 since otherwise the substitution x=-1 shows that Q(1)=0 which is impossible. A substitution x=x_{0} gives that Qleft(x_{0}^{2}right)=0, thus Qleft(x_{0}^{4}right)=0 and so on. Since x_{0} neq pm 1,0 it follows that there are infinitely many distinct terms in the sequence x_{0}, x_{0}^{2}, ldots, x_{0}^{2^{k}}, which is impossible.Direct verification shows that for any even natural number n= 2 k, the polynomial P(x)=x^{k}(x-1)^{k} is of degree n and is a solution of the problem.Therefore all polynomials such that P(x) cdot P(x+1)=Pleft(x^{2}right) are P(x)=x^{k}(x-1)^{k}."},{"problem":"7.

Therefore, if we fix point K, the possible positions of point M fill a certain segment M_{1} M_{2} parallel to side A D.The lower position M_{1} of point M corresponds to the case N_{1}=A, and the upper position M_{2} corresponds to the case L_{2}=C.To determine the positions of points M_{1} and M_{2} depending on the location of point K, we introduce a coordinate system as shown in Fig. 52.Simple calculations show that if the abscissa of point K is x>0, then M_{1}=(-x, sqrt{2 x}), and M_{2}=(-x, sqrt{1-2 x}+1).

Therefore,5 cdot 2^{x}=(n-1)(n+1)Clearly, n must be odd and greater than 1. One of the numbers n-1, n+1 is divisible by 4.

Transforming the Condition: We can rewrite the sum of reciprocals as frac{alpha + beta}{alphabeta} = 1. Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get frac{2(m+1)}{m+4} = 1.5. Solving for m: To find m, we solve the equation frac{2(m+1)}{m+4} = 1. This simplifies to 2(m+1) = m+4. Further simplification gives 2m + 2 = m + 4, leading to m = 2.6. Verification: To verify, we substitute m=2 back into the original equation, yielding x^{2}-6x+6=0. We check the discriminant Delta = b^{2}-4ac = 12 which is greater than 0, confirming that the roots are real and distinct. This verifies that m=2 satisfies all conditions of the problem.Therefore, the value of m that satisfies the given conditions is boxed{2}."},{"problem":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n} with a common difference d neq 0, a_4=10, and a_3, a_6, a_{10} form a geometric sequence, then the sum of the first 9 terms of the sequence {a_n} is ( ).A: 99B: 90C: 84D: 70","solution":"Since {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference d neq 0,therefore a_3=a_4-d=10-d,therefore a_6=a_4+2d=10+2d,a_{10}=a_4+6d=10+6d,Since a_3, a_6, a_{10} form a geometric sequence,it implies (10-d)(10+6d)=(10+2d)^2,simplifying gives 10d^2-10d=0,solving gives d=1 or d=0 (discard d=0).therefore The general formula for the sequence {a_n} is a_n=n+6.Then, the sum of the first 9 terms of the sequence {a_n} is dfrac{1}{2}(a_1+a_9) times 9= dfrac{1}{2} times (7+15) times 9=99.Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{A}.By applying the property of the middle term of a geometric sequence and the general formula of an arithmetic sequence, we can derive the equation for d.

Therefore, on the interval left(0 ; frac{4}{3} Rright) the function V(h) is increasing, and on the interval left(frac{4}{3} R ; 2 Rright) it is decreasing. Thus, at h=frac{4}{3} R the volume of the cone is the largest.

If each of the numbers a and b can be represented as the sum of two squares, then, as noted in the hint, their product can also be represented in such a form. Moreover, the product is usually representable as the sum of two squares in more ways than each of the factors. For example, the number 5 can be represented as the sum of two non-negative squares in only one way, up to the permutation of the summands, namely: 5=2^{2}+1^{2}; the number 13 also in only one way: 13=2^{2}+3^{2}, but their product already in two ways { }^{1}: 65=5 cdot 13=4^{2}+7^{2}=1^{2}+8^{2}.

We are given that the union of sets A and B, denoted as A cup B, has 8 subsets. The number of subsets of a set is given by 2^n, where n is the number of elements in the set. Thus, if A cup B has 8 subsets, we can conclude that:   [2^n = 8]   Solving for n gives us:   [n = 3]   This means A cup B must contain 3 distinct elements.2. Examining set B={x| (x-4)(x-1)=0}, we find its elements by setting each factor equal to zero:   [x - 4 = 0 quad text{or} quad x - 1 = 0]   Which gives us:   [x = 4 quad text{or} quad x = 1]   Therefore, B = {1, 4}.3. For set A={x| (x-3)(x-a)=0}, its elements depend on the value of a. When a=3, we have:   [x - 3 = 0]   Which gives x=3, so A={3}.

Therefore, a must be either 1 or 4, as these values do not increase the total count of distinct elements in A cup B beyond 3.5. Combining the possibilities for a, we have a=1, a=4, or a=3.

Therefore, we need to check ( n = 6 ):   [   2^6 - 1 = 63 = 3^2 times 7   ]   which has prime factors 3 and 7, both less than or equal to 7.7. According to Zsigmondy's Theorem, for ( n > 6 ), there will always be a prime factor of ( 2^n - 1 ) that is greater than 7.8. Thus, the values of ( n ) that satisfy the condition are ( n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ) and ( 6 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 } )"},{"problem":"Patty has 20 coins consisting of nickels and dimes.

This number is coprime with the two odd numbers, and the conclusion holds.Returning to the original problem.For any positive integer m, partition the set{m, m+1, cdots, m+99}into the following 17 sets:A_{i}={m+6(i-1)+j mid j=0,1, cdots, 5}(i=1,2, cdots, 16),A_{17}={m+96, m+97, m+98, m+99} .Let M be a 68-element subset of the set {m, m+1, cdots, m+99}.(1) If set M has four elements from set A_{17}, since when m is odd, m+96, m+97, m+98 are pairwise coprime; and when m is even, m+97, m+98, m+99 are pairwise coprime, therefore, set M contains at least three elements that are pairwise coprime.(2) If set M has at most three elements from set A_{17}, then set M has at least 65 elements from sets A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{16}.By the pigeonhole principle, set M must have at least five elements from one of the sets, say A_{1}. By the lemma, there exist three pairwise coprime elements among them. Therefore, set M always contains three pairwise coprime elements.Thus, n=68 meets the requirement, i.e., for any positive integer m, any 68-element subset of the set {m, m+1, cdots, m+99} contains three elements that are pairwise coprime.In summary, the minimum value of n is 68."},{"problem":"Sedrakyan H.Two parabolas with different vertices are the graphs of quadratic trinomials with leading coefficients p and q.

Now expand the brackets and move all the terms to one side to get (c-a)(a+b+c+d)=0. Since c>a we can divide by c-a to geta+b+c+d=0 .Note that this is equivalent to the frac{a+b}{b+c}=frac{c+d}{d+a} condition. Now assume that (a, b, c, d) is the tuple such that a c is maximised. Since 4 a>a+b+c+d=0 we trivially have a>0. Furthermore if c leq 0 then we would have a c leq 0 which would contradict the definition that a c is maximal. Thereforea>b>c>0 geq d geq-2021 .Now we perform two little proofs by contradiction:- If d>-2021 then we could consider left(a^{prime}, b^{prime}, c^{prime}, d^{prime}right)=(a+1, b, c, d-1) so thata^{prime} c^{prime}=(a+1) c>a c .However this would contradict the definition that a c was maximal.Therefore d=-2021.- If b>c+1 then we could consider left(a^{prime}, b^{prime}, c^{prime}, d^{prime}right)=(a+1, b-1, c, d) so thata^{prime} c^{prime}=(a+1) c>a c .However this would contradict the definition that a c was maximal.Therefore b=c+1.Therefore (a, b, c, d)=(a, c+1, c,-2021), and since a+b+c+d=0, this means a=2020-2 c.

(Two methods are considered different if at least one card is placed in a different colored box.)将上面的文本翻译成英文，请保留源文本的换行和格式，直接输出翻译结果。","solution":"Solution: There are 12 different methods. Consider the integers from 1 to 100. For simplicity, define the color of the box in which integer i is placed as the color of that integer. Use mathrm{r} to represent red, mathrm{w} to represent white, and mathrm{b} to represent blue.(1) There exists some i such that i, i+1, i-2 have mutually different colors, for example, mathrm{wb}. Since i+(i+3)=(i+1)+(i+2), the color of i div 3 cannot be the color of i+1, which is mathrm{w}, nor can it be the color of i+2, which is mathrm{w}. It can only be mathrm{r}. Therefore, as long as three adjacent numbers have mutually different colors, the color of the next number can be determined. Furthermore, this pattern of three numbers' colors must repeat: after rwb, it must be r, then w, b, cdots and so on. Similarly, this process also holds for the opposite direction: before rwb, it must be b, cdots and so on.Therefore, it is only necessary to determine the colors of 1, 2, and 3. There are 6 different ways to do this, and all 6 methods can make the magic trick successful because their sums r+w, w+b, b+r give mutually different remainders modulo 3.(2) There do not exist three consecutive numbers with mutually different colors. Assume 1 is red. Let i be the smallest number that is not red, and assume i is white. Let k be the smallest blue number. By assumption, i+11 must be red, and from t+99=(t-1)+100, it follows that t-1 is blue, which contradicts the assumption that only 100 is blue.Therefore, the colors of these numbers must be rww…wwb. This method indeed works:If the sum of the numbers on the two selected cards leqslant 100, the box from which no card was selected must be blue;If the sum of the numbers is 101, the box from which no card was selected must be white;If the sum of the numbers >101, the box from which no card was selected must be red.Finally, there are 6 different ways to arrange the colors in the above manner. Therefore, the answer is 12."},{"problem":"Given an ellipse C: frac{{x}^{2}}{{a}^{2}}+frac{{y}^{2}}{{b}^{2}}=1left(a gt b gt 0right) with left and right foci F_{1} and F_{2}, and eccentricity frac{1}{3}, a circle with the origin as its center and the length of the minor axis of the ellipse as its radius is tangent to the line x-y-4=0.

Apply the difference of squares identity: Recall that (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2. Applying this identity to the denominator, we get:z = frac{(3 + i)(1 - i)}{1^2 - i^2}3.

In 42 minutes from 12:00 to 12:42, the car traveled no more than 100 km, and in the remaining 18 minutes, it traveled even less (in 42 / 18=7 / 3) times.

Similarly, between the signs with the numbers X O Y and Y X, there are exactly 9(11 X-Y) km.

For this, we choose d=4025 and a_{1}=ldots=a_{4025}=frac{2013}{4025}>frac{1}{2}. Then a_{1}+ldots+a_{4025}=2013 and since a_{i}+a_{j}=frac{4026}{4025}>1 for all 1 leq i neq j leq 4025, 4025 subsets are required.Now we show n leq 4025. For this, we perform a case distinction based on d.For d leq 4025, each a_{i} gets its own subset. Thus, all subsets, some of which may be empty, are disjoint and have sums of at most 1.For d>4025, there must exist two numbers a_{x} and a_{y} such that a_{x}+a_{y} leq 1. Otherwise, in the sum left(a_{1}+a_{2}right)+left(a_{3}+a_{4}right)+ldots+left(a_{4025}+a_{4026}right), each parenthesis would be greater than 1, and the sum of all a_{i} would be greater than 2013, a contradiction!

This step can be repeated until the replacement yields a set with 4025 elements. For this set, and thus also for the original set, the desired partition exists.

A strategy for Horst: Put knights only on black squares, until all black squares get occupied. Colour the squares of the board black and white in the usual way, such that the white and black squares alternate, and let Horst put his knights on black squares as long as it is possible. Two knights on squares of the same colour never attack each other. The number of black squares is (20^2 / 2 = 200). The two players occupy the squares in turn, so Horst will surely find empty black squares in his first 100 steps.A strategy for Queenie: Group the squares into cycles of length 4, and after each step of Horst, occupy the opposite square in the same cycle. Consider the squares of the board as vertices of a graph; let two squares be connected if two knights on those squares would attack each other. Notice that in a (4 times 4) board the squares can be grouped into 4 cycles of length 4, as shown in Figure 1.

From this point, Horst cannot put any knight on (A) or (C) because those squares are already occupied, neither on (B) or (D) because those squares are attacked by the knight standing on (A). Hence, Horst can put at most one knight on each cycle, that is at most 100 knights in total.Comment 1. Queenie's strategy can be prescribed by a simple rule: divide the board into (4 times 4) parts; whenever Horst puts a knight in a part (P), Queenie reflects that square about the centre of (P) and puts her queen on the reflected square.Comment 2. The result remains the same if Queenie moves first. In the first turn, she may put her first queen arbitrarily.

Taking the midpoint of B C as E, we extract the plane figure triangle A E G, as shown in Figure 23-18.The distance from each face of the tetrahedron that is externally tangent to the spheres to the corresponding face of the tetrahedron A B C D is 1, and it is still a regular tetrahedron.

ConsiderM=10^{2 cdot 3^{1+sum_{i=1}^{mathrm{L}} k_{i}}}+10^{3^{1+sum_{i=1}^{mathrm{t}} k_{i}}}+1Then M equiv 3left(bmod p_{i}right), M equiv 3(bmod 9), and M>3. Hence M has a prime factor other than p_{1}, p_{2}, cdots, p_{t}, which contradicts mathrm{T}=left{mathrm{p}_{1}, mathrm{p}_{2}, ldots, mathrm{p}_{mathrm{t}}right}. Therefore, mathrm{T} is an infinite set. The lemma is proved.Now, let's return to the original problem.Take any mathrm{p} in mathrm{T}, mathrm{p}>3, then there exists a positive integer mathrm{k}, such that mathrm{p} midleft(10^{2 cdot 3^{k}}+10^{3^{k}}+1right), thus mathrm{p} midleft(10^{3^{k+1}}-1right). Therefore, delta_{mathrm{p}}(10) mid 3^{mathrm{k}+1}. If 3 nmid delta_{mathrm{p}}(10), then delta_{mathrm{p}}(10)=1, so mathrm{p} mid(10-1), which contradicts mathrm{p}>3. Hence (T backslash{3}) subseteq S. Therefore, S is an infinite set.(2) Let frac{1}{mathrm{p}}=0 . mathrm{a}_{1} mathrm{a}_{2} ldots mathrm{a} dot{3 mathrm{r}}, then delta_{mathrm{p}}(10)=3 mathrm{r}. Thus mathrm{p} midleft(10^{3 mathrm{r}}-1right), and mathrm{p}+left(10^{mathrm{r}}-1right), so mathrm{p} midleft(10^{2 mathrm{r}}+10^{mathrm{r}}+1right).Let x_{i}=frac{10^{1-1}}{p}left(i in Z^{+}right), and let y_{i}=left{x_{i}right}, then a_{i}<10 y_{i}. Therefore:f(k, p)=a_{k}+a_{k+r}+a_{k+2 r}<10left(y_{k}+y_{k+r}+y_{k+2 r}right)Also, x_{k}+x_{k+r}+x_{k+2 r}=frac{10^{k-1}}{p}+frac{10^{k+r-1}}{p}+frac{10^{k}+2 r-1}{p} in Z, so y_{k}+y_{k+r}+y_{k+2 r} in Z. Since y_{k}+ y_{k+r}+y_{k+2 r}<3, it follows that y_{k}+y_{k+r}+y_{k+2 r} leq 2.

Analyze f(x) for its minimum value:   Since both |x-1| and |3x+1| are absolute values, their outputs are always non-negative. This implies that f(x) is minimized when both |x-1| and |3x+1| are minimized simultaneously. However, due to the nature of absolute values, the minimum value each can take is 0. Therefore, we analyze the expression 3|x-1| + |3x+1| for its minimum value:   [   f(x) geqslant |3(x-1) - (3x+1)| = |3x - 3 - 3x - 1| = |-4| = 4   ]   This shows that the minimum value of f(x) is 4.2.

Since (ABCD) is a cyclic quadrilateral, we can use Ptolemy's Theorem, which states that for a cyclic quadrilateral (ABCD):   [   AB cdot CD + AD cdot BC = AC cdot BD   ]3. To apply Ptolemy's Theorem, we need to find the lengths of diagonals (AC) and (BD). However, we can use the fact that the circle's radius is (5) to find these lengths.4.

Since (AB) and (BC) are given, we can use the Law of Cosines in (triangle ABC):   [   AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 cdot AB cdot BC cdot cos(angle ABC)   ]   However, we need (angle ABC), which we can find using the fact that (triangle ABC) is inscribed in a circle.5.

Instead of finding the angles, we can use the fact that the circle's radius is (5) and the given side lengths to find the diagonals directly.7. Using the given solution's hint, we can split (triangle AOB) and (triangle COD) into right triangles. Since the radius is (5), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the diagonals.8. For (triangle AOB), we have:   [   AO = BO = 5   ]   Since (AB = 6), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the altitude from (O) to (AB):   [   left(frac{AB}{2}right)^2 + h^2 = 5^2   ]   [   left(frac{6}{2}right)^2 + h^2 = 25   ]   [   9 + h^2 = 25   ]   [   h^2 = 16   ]   [   h = 4   ]9. Similarly, for (triangle COD), we have:   [   CO = DO = 5   ]   Since (CD = 8), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the altitude from (O) to (CD):   [   left(frac{CD}{2}right)^2 + h^2 = 5^2   ]   [   left(frac{8}{2}right)^2 + h^2 = 25   ]   [   16 + h^2 = 25   ]   [   h^2 = 9   ]   [   h = 3   ]10. Now, using the given solution's hint, we can find (AD) by considering the symmetry and the fact that (triangle AOD) can be split into two right triangles with the same altitude.11.

The areas are given as 9pi and 16pi, so we can deduce the radii of these sections are the square roots of frac{9pi}{pi}=9 and frac{16pi}{pi}=16, which simplifies to radii of 3 and 4, respectively.Given the radius of the sphere as R, the distance from the center of the sphere to the plane of the circular section with radius 3 is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in the context of the right triangle formed by the radius of the sphere, the radius of the circular section, and the distance from the center to the plane. This gives us sqrt{R^{2}-3^{2}}. Similarly, for the section with radius 4, the distance from the center to its plane is sqrt{R^{2}-4^{2}}.Considering the scenario where the two sections are on the same side of the sphere's center, and the distance between the two sections is 1, we set up the equation sqrt{R^{2}-3^{2}}-sqrt{R^{2}-4^{2}}=1.

The negative solution, R=-5, is not physically meaningful for the radius of a sphere and is therefore discarded.In the scenario where the sphere's center is between the two sections, the distance between the sections is represented by the sum of the distances from the center to each section, sqrt{R^{2}-3^{2}}+sqrt{R^{2}-4^{2}}=1.

Understanding the problem: We need to find the largest number ( N ) such that there exist ( 2^N - 1 ) distinct positive integers that sum up to 2014. Each possible nonempty group of students is assigned a unique positive integer, and the sum of all these integers is 2014.2. Sum of first ( k ) positive integers: The sum of the first ( k ) positive integers is given by the formula:   [   S_k = frac{k(k+1)}{2}   ]   We need to find the largest ( N ) such that the sum of ( 2^N - 1 ) distinct positive integers is less than or equal to 2014.3.

Verification for ( N = 6 ): If ( N = 6 ), then we need ( 2^6 - 1 = 63 ) distinct positive integers. The sum of the first 63 positive integers is:   [   S_{63} = frac{63 cdot 64}{2} = 2016   ]   Since 2016 is greater than 2014, ( N = 6 ) is not possible.5. Verification for ( N = 5 ): If ( N = 5 ), then we need ( 2^5 - 1 = 31 ) distinct positive integers. The sum of the first 31 positive integers is:   [   S_{31} = frac{31 cdot 32}{2} = 496   ]   To make the sum 2014, we can add an additional integer:   [   2014 - 496 = 1518   ]   Thus, we can take the first 30 integers (1 through 30) and 1518 as the 31st integer.

Using the notation a+b=c, this can be written as c^{2}-c=c(c-1)=99 a, where c=a+b leq 99, because its square can be written with four digits. Thus, c(c-1) must be divisible by 99, i.e., by 9=3^{2} and 11. Since c and c-1 are relatively prime, only one of them is divisible by 3, and therefore one of them is divisible by 9.If both 9 and 11 divide c, then c=99 and a=98, so b=c-a=1=01. Indeed, (98+01)^{2}=99^{2}=9801 shows the desired equality.If 9 divides c and 11 divides c-1: c=9 x, c-1=11 y, i.e., 9 x-1=11 y, where x, y are positive integers and 9 x<99, 11 y<98. It is easy to show that the only solution to these conditions is c=45, and in this case a=45 cdot 44 / 99=20, b=c-a=25. Indeed, (20+25)^{2}=45^{2}=2025 also satisfies the condition.If 9 divides c-1 and 11 divides c, then similarly c=55, a=30, and we arrive at the example shown. Since c-1 leq 98, this factor cannot be divisible by both 9 and 11.Remark. A similar but longer trial-and-error process leads to the following thought: b can only be a two-digit number such that the tens and units digits of b^{2} match those of b, i.e., b^{2}-b=b(b-1)=100 x=2^{2} cdot 5^{2} x. From b<100, b and b-1 can only be 0,25,50,75. Direct trial-and-error shows that only b=01 and b=25 satisfy, and from the quadratic equation, we get a=98 and a=30 and 20.Horváth Kálmán (Kaposvár, Táncsics M. g. I. o. t.)II. solution: From the equation (a+b)^{2}=100 a+b, we have: a=50-b pm sqrt{2500-99 b}. The discriminant is positive only for b leq 25, and from the requirement 2500-99 b=d^{2} (where d is an integer), we have 2500-d^{2}=(50-d)(50+d)=99 b, and thus a=50-b pm d. Here, on the one hand, d^{2}<2500, d<50, and on the other hand, only one of 50-d and 50+d can be divisible by 3, because otherwise their sum: 100 would also be divisible by 3. From these, similar trial-and-error leads to the already seen representations.Pallós Lajos (Pannonhalma, Bencés g. II. o. t.)Remark.

This implies:[xy^2 = p(x + y)]Rearranging the equation, we get:[xy^2 = px + py implies xy^2 - px - py = 0]We can factorize this equation by setting (x = dm) and (y = dn) where (gcd(m, n) = 1). Substituting these into the equation, we get:[d^3mn^2 = dmp + dnp implies d^2mn^2 = p(m + n)]Since (p) is a prime number, it must divide one of the factors on the left-hand side. We consider the following cases:1. Case 1: (p mid n)   If (p mid n), then (p^2 mid n^2). This implies:   [   p^2 mid d^2mn^2 = p(m + n) implies p mid (m + n)   ]   However, since (gcd(m, n) = 1), (gcd(n, m+n) = 1), which is a contradiction. Therefore, (p nmid n).2. Case 2: (p mid m)   Let (m = pk). Substituting this into the equation, we get:   [   d^2n^2pk = p(pk + n) implies d^2n^2k = pk + n   ]   This implies (k mid n). Since (k mid m) and (k mid n) and (gcd(m, n) = 1), it follows that (k = 1). Therefore, (m = p). Substituting (m = p) into the equation, we get:   [   d^2n^2 = p + n   ]   This implies (n mid p). Since (p) is a prime number, (n) must be 1. Therefore, (x = dp) and (y = d). Substituting these into the original equation, we get:   [   p + 1 = d^2 implies p = (d-1)(d+1)   ]   Since (p) is a prime number, the only possible values are (d-1 = 1) and (d+1 = p). Therefore, (d = 2) and (p = 3). This gives us (x = 6) and (y = 2), which is indeed a solution.3. Case 3: (p mid d^2)   If (p mid d^2), then (p mid d). Let (d = pd_1). Substituting this into the equation, we get:   [   p^2d_1^2n^2m = m + n   ]   For (n geq 2) and (m geq 1), it is clear that (LHS > RHS). Therefore, either (m = 1) or (n = 1) must hold.   - Subcase 3.1: (m = 1)     We have:     [     n + 1 = p^2d_1^2n^2 implies n leq 1     ]     Therefore, (n = 1). This implies (x = y). Substituting (x = y) into the original equation, we get:     [     frac{x^3}{2x} = frac{x^2}{2} = p     ]     Therefore, (x = y = p = 2), which is indeed a solution.   - Subcase 3.2: (n = 1)     Similarly, we have (m = 1) and the same solution.Therefore, the only solutions are ((x, y) in {(2, 2), (6, 2)}).The final answer is ( boxed{ {(2, 2), (6, 2)} } )."},{"problem":"From a pencil case containing 2 pencils and 2 pens, two pens are randomly selected.

How many, at most, such a subdivision can contain isosceles triangles with two good sides?## Solutions to the exercisesTranslate the above text into English, preserving the original text's line breaks and format, and output the translation directly.","solution":"A triangle will be said to be isobon if it is isosceles and has two good sides. By grouping the 2026 sides of P into 1013 groups of two consecutive sides, 1013 isobon triangles are formed, which can then be integrated into a triangulation.Now consider any triangulation, and we set out to prove that it does not contain more than 1013 isobon triangles. In the following, we will identify the sides of P with good diagonals. We then consider the bipartite graph mathcal{G}=(A sqcup B, E) where A is the set of triangles in the triangulation, B is the set of good diagonals, and E is the set of pairs consisting of a triangle a in A and a good side of a.Finally, we associate an integer with each good vertex b in B, that is, each good diagonal, as follows: if b separates P into two parts with x and y vertices, we associate the integer min {x, y} with b. Consequently, a triangle a in A is isobon if it is adjacent to two vertices that have been associated with the same integer.Any triangle a in A divides P into four regions: t and three other regions that do not share any side between them. Therefore, removing a from the graph mathcal{G} disconnects mathcal{G}, which means that mathcal{G} is acyclic: c^{prime} is a forest.Moreover, every triangle a in A has 0 or 2 good sides; its degree in mathcal{G} is therefore 0 or 2. Consequently, each connected component of mathcal{G} is in fact a path, which starts from one side of P and ends at another side of P: there are 1013 such paths. Now, when traversing a path, the integers associated with the vertices b in B encountered start by strictly increasing from 1, then they strictly decrease until they are 1 again. The only time two vertices with the same number could have been encountered was when this number was the highest possible on the path. We conclude that each path contains at most one isobon triangle, and therefore that the maximum sought is 1013.## 8 TD Small Simple Ideas (Aurélien)This course is based on the TD from Baptiste Séraille's 2020 group E course.## 2 Midway Training## Statements"},{"problem":"Given p: frac{1}{2} leqslant x leqslant 1, q: (x-a)(x-a-1) > 0, if p is a sufficient but not necessary condition for neg q, then the range of the real number a is ______.","solution":"AnalysisThis problem examines the judgment of necessary conditions, sufficient conditions, and sufficient and necessary conditions.

Misha, over the course of a week, picked an apple each day and weighed it. Each apple weighed a different amount, but the weight of each apple was a whole number of grams and ranged from 221 grams to 230 grams (inclusive). Misha also calculated the average weight of all the apples he picked, and it was always a whole number. The apple picked on the seventh day weighed 225 grams. How much did the apple picked on the sixth day weigh?","solution":"Answer: 230 grams.Solution: Each apple weighed 220 grams plus an integer from 1 to 10. From the numbers 1 to 10, we need to choose 7 numbers such that their sum is divisible by 7. One of these numbers is 5, so we need to choose 6 from the numbers 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10. The smallest sum of six of these numbers is 23, and the largest is 44. Adding 5, we get numbers from 28 to 49. In this range, there are 4 numbers divisible by 7: 28, 35, 42, 49. Meanwhile, the sum of the weights for the first 6 days must be divisible by 6. From the numbers 23, 30, 37, 44, only the number 30 satisfies this condition. Thus, the total weight for the first 6 days was 220 cdot 6 + 30 (we will simply write 30, and add the multiple of 220 at the end). The sum of the weights for the first 5 days must be divisible by 5. The possible range for 5 days is from 16 to 40, and the numbers that fit are 20, 25, 30, 40. However, the total weight for 5 days is less than that for 6 days, so it must be less than 30, i.e., 20 or 25. However, the difference between 30 and 25 is 5, and the number 5 is already used. Therefore, the weight of the apples for 5 days is 220 cdot 5 + 20, meaning the apple picked on the 6th day weighed 220 cdot 6 + 30 - (220 cdot 5 + 20) = 230 grams. This value is valid, as the apples picked over the week could have weighed 221, 223, 222, 226, 228, 210, 205 grams."},{"problem":"Which of the following statements about propositions is incorrect?

Any number of news items can be shared in one call.What is the minimum number of hours required for everyone to learn all the news? Consider three cases:a) N=64,b) N=55,c) N=100.","solution":"a) A piece of news known to one of the friends will be known to no more than two (including the first) after 1 hour, no more than four after the second hour, ..., and no more than 32 after the fifth hour. Therefore, it will take no less than 6 hours.We will show that 6 hours are sufficient. The conversations can proceed according to the following scheme. Number the participants with six-digit binary numbers. In the k-th hour, people whose numbers differ only in the k-th digit converse (for example, in the 3rd hour, a b c 0 d e converses with a b c 1 d e). Each hour, the number of pieces of news known to each person doubles. (For example, after the 2nd hour, each person knows four pieces of news known to four participants whose numbers differ from his number in the first two digits.)Remark.

As seen from a), the others will need at least 6 more hours to learn his news.Divide the participants into two groups: 32 and 23 people. In the 1st hour, all members of the second group converse with members of the first. Over the next 5 hours, the members of the first group exchange news (according to the scheme from a) or b); as a result, each knows all the news).

On the board, three functions are written: f_{1}(x)=x+1 / x, f_{2}(x)=x^{2}, f_{3}(x)=(x-1)^{2}. You can add, subtract, and multiply these functions (including squaring, cubing, ...), multiply them by any number, add any number to them, and perform these operations on the resulting expressions. Obtain the function 1 / x.Prove that if any of the functions f_{1}, f_{2}, f_{3} is erased from the board, it is impossible to obtain 1 / x.## SolutionSince f_{2}(x)-f_{3}(x)=2 x-1, and since we can add 1 and multiply the resulting expression 2 x by 1 / 2, we can obtain the function x. Subtracting it from f_{1}(x), we get 1 / x = f_{1}(x) - 1 / 2 (f_{2}(x) - f_{3}(x) + 1).Since the division operation is not allowed, it is impossible to express 1 / x using only the functions f_{2} and f_{3}: if you multiply and add polynomials, you will get polynomials again, and the function 1 / x is not a polynomial. The derivatives of the functions f_{1} and f_{3} at the point x=1 are 0. If the derivatives of two functions at the point 1 are 0, then the derivative of both their sum and their product is 0. So, all functions that can be obtained using the specified operations from the functions f_{1} and f_{3} have a zero derivative at the point 1. The derivative of the function 1 / x at the point 1 is not 0.All our functions are defined for all complex x neq 0. If we substitute x=i into f_{1} and f_{2}, we get i + i^{-1} = 0, i^{2} = -1 - real numbers. This means that each of the functions obtained from f_{1} and f_{2} will have a real value at the point i. And it is impossible to express the imaginary number f_{3}(i) = -2i using only real numbers."},{"problem":"2. Let x, y be real numbers.

Lemma:   - Define a function ( f: V rightarrow mathbb{N} ) which associates each vertex with the maximum degree of vertices connected to it in ( G_1 ).   - We need to show that ( sum_{v in V} f(v) ge 2|E_1| ).3. Proof of the Lemma:   - Define a function ( g: V rightarrow mathbb{Q} ) which associates each vertex with the average of the degrees of vertices connected to it in ( G_1 ).   - Clearly, ( g(v) le f(v) ).   - We need to show that ( sum_{v in V} g(v) ge sum_{v in V} deg(v) = 2|E_1| ).4. Calculation:   - Let ( S ) be the set of ordered pairs of connected vertices in ( G_1 ).   - Then, ( sum_{v in V} g(v) = sum_{(u,v) in S} frac{deg(u)}{deg(v)} ).   - Let ( S_1 ) be the set of unordered pairs of connected vertices in ( G_1 ) (i.e., ( S_1 equiv E_1 )).   - Then, ( sum_{v in V} g(v) = sum_{(u,v) in S_1} left( frac{deg(u)}{deg(v)} + frac{deg(v)}{deg(u)} right) ).   - By the AM-GM inequality, ( frac{deg(u)}{deg(v)} + frac{deg(v)}{deg(u)} ge 2 ).   - Therefore, ( sum_{v in V} g(v) ge sum_{(u,v) in S_1} 2 = 2|S_1| = 2|E_1| ).5.

Relate ( h(v) ) and ( f(v) ):   - Note that ( h(v) ge f(v) - 1 ).   - Consider the vertex ( u ) such that ( (u,v) in E_1 ) and its degree in ( G_1 ) is ( f(v) ).   - Define ( V_{1,u} ) as the set of vertices connected to ( u ) in ( G_1 ).   - Then, ( {v} times (V_{1,u} setminus {v}) subseteq E_3 ).7. Calculate ( |E_3| ):   - ( |E_3| = frac{1}{2} sum_{v in V} h(v) ge frac{1}{2} sum_{v in V} (f(v) - 1) ).   - Therefore, ( |E_3| ge frac{1}{2} left( sum_{v in V} f(v) - 2017 right) ).   - By the lemma, ( sum_{v in V} f(v) ge 2|E_1| ).   - Hence, ( |E_3| ge |E_1| - frac{2017}{2} ).8. Minimum average calculation:   - Since ( |E_3| ) is an integer, it must be at least ( |E_1| - 1008 ).   - The minimum average is reached when ( |E_3| ) is minimum.   - Therefore, the minimum average is at least:     [     frac{3(|E_1| - 1008) + |E_1| + 2 left( binom{2017}{2} - 2|E_1| + 1008 right)}{binom{2017}{2}} = frac{4033}{2017}     ]9.

It's a moderately difficult problem. Let's define g(x) = frac{f(x)}{cos x}, where x in (-frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}). We'll use the monotonicity of g(x) to find where g(x) > g(0), which will help us solve the inequality.1. Define g(x) = frac{f(x)}{cos x}. Then, g'(x) = frac{f'''(x) + f(x)tan x}{cos x}.2. Since x in (-frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}), we have cos x > 0.3. Given that f'''(x) + f(x)tan x > 0, it follows that g'(x) > 0, which means g(x) is an increasing function.4. As y = f(x) - 1 is an odd function, we have f(0) - 1 = 0, which implies f(0) = 1.5. Therefore, g(0) = frac{f(0)}{cos 0} = 1.6. The inequality f(x) > cos x is equivalent to g(x) > 1.

Let's call a pair of these integers [i]elegant[/i] if their sum is an integer power of 2. For every n find the largest possible number of elegant pairs.[i]Proposed by Oleksiy Masalitin[/i]","solution":"1. Define the Problem in Graph Theory Terms:   We are given ( n ge 2 ) distinct positive integers. We need to find the largest possible number of pairs whose sum is a power of 2. We can represent this problem using a graph ( G ) with ( n ) vertices, where each vertex represents one of the integers. An edge is drawn between two vertices if and only if their sum is a power of 2.2. Claim 1: The Graph ( G ) has no cycles.   - Proof:     Suppose, for contradiction, that ( G ) contains a cycle. Let the cycle be ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k, a_1 ) with ( k geq 3 ). Assume ( a_1 + a_2 ) is the largest sum among all ( a_i + a_{i+1} ). Since ( a_1 + a_2 ) is a power of 2, let it be ( 2^x ). Similarly, let ( a_2 + a_3 = 2^y ) and ( a_k + a_1 = 2^z ) with ( x > y ) and ( x > z ).     - If ( y > z ), then ( 2^x geq 2^{y+1} > 2^y + 2^z ), which is a contradiction.     - If ( y < z ), then ( 2^x geq 2^{z+1} > 2^y + 2^z ), which is also a contradiction.     Therefore, ( G ) cannot contain any cycles. (blacksquare)3. Claim 2: Any acyclic simple undirected graph ( G ) on ( n ) vertices has at most ( n-1 ) edges.   - Proof:     We proceed by induction on ( n ).     - Base Case: For ( n = 2 ), the graph can have at most 1 edge, which is ( n-1 ). The base case holds.     - Inductive Step: Assume the statement is true for graphs with ( n ) vertices. Consider a graph with ( n+1 ) vertices. We need to show that this graph has at most ( n ) edges.       - Take a maximal path ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_t ) in the graph. Vertex ( v_1 ) has no neighbors among ( v_i ) (for ( i > 2 )) since otherwise, it would form a cycle, contradicting the acyclic property. Therefore, ( v_1 ) can only have ( v_2 ) as a neighbor, implying ( deg(v_1) leq 1 ).       - Remove ( v_1 ) and its edge (if it exists). The remaining subgraph on ( n ) vertices has at most ( n-1 ) edges by the inductive hypothesis. Adding back ( v_1 ) and its edge gives at most ( n ) edges in total.     Thus, any acyclic graph on ( n+1 ) vertices has at most ( n ) edges. (blacksquare)4. Conclusion:   From Claims 1 and 2, the graph ( G ) has at most ( n-1 ) edges. This means the maximum number of elegant pairs is ( n-1 ).5. Constructing a Graph with ( n-1 ) Elegant Pairs:   To show that ( n-1 ) elegant pairs are attainable, consider the following construction:   - Let ( a_1 = 1 ) and ( a_i = 2^n - i ) for ( i = 2, 3, ldots, n ).   - For each ( i neq 1 ), ( a_1 + a_i = 1 + (2^n - i) = 2^n - (i - 1) ), which is a power of 2.   - This construction ensures that there are ( n-1 ) elegant pairs.The final answer is ( boxed{ n-1 } )."},{"problem":"Calculate the value of the following expressions:  (1) 3(-4)^{3} + 8^{ frac {2}{3}} + 25^{- frac {1}{2}}  (2) 3^{log_{3}2} + log_{3}5 - log_{3}15 + log_{3}8 cdot log_{2}3","solution":"For (1), the original expression can be rewritten as -4 + 2^{3 times frac {2}{3}} + 5^{2 times (- frac {1}{2})}  This simplifies to boxed{frac {1}{5}}  For (2), the original expression simplifies to 2 + log_{3} frac {5}{15} + frac {log_{2}2^{3}}{log_{2}3} cdot log_{2}3  This further simplifies to 2 - 1 + 3  Thus, the final answer is boxed{4}"},{"problem":"For any positive integer n, let S_n denote the set of positive integers which cannot be written in the form an+2017b for nonnegative integers a and b.

The set (S_n) consists of positive integers that cannot be written in the form (an + 2017b) for nonnegative integers (a) and (b).2. Identifying (S_n):   - For (n = 1), (S_1 = emptyset) because any positive integer can be written as (a cdot 1 + 2017b).   - For (n = 2), (S_2) consists of all odd numbers less than (2017) because even numbers can be written as (2a + 2017b).3. Generalizing (S_n):   - For (n geq 2), (S_n) consists of numbers that cannot be written as (an + 2017b). The largest number that cannot be written in this form is given by the Frobenius number (g(n, 2017) = n cdot 2016 - n - 2017).4.

There are two possibilities: take two cards with powers of two and one with a power of eleven, or vice versa.Suppose we take two cards with powers of two. Since the number two must be present in an even power in the product of the selected numbers, the powers of two on the selected cards must have the same parity.

Since SO = OD and O is the midpoint of SD, triangle SOD is an isosceles right triangle. Therefore, angle SOD = 45^circ.P is the midpoint of SD, so SP = PD. In triangle SPD, since SP = PD and SO is perpendicular to OD, O is also the midpoint of PD. Thus, triangle SOP sim triangle SOD with a ratio of 1:2. Since angle SOD = 45^circ, angle SOP = 45^circ as well. In right triangle SOP, OP is the height, and SO is the hypotenuse, so cos angle SOP = frac{OP}{SO} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}}, which means angle SOP = 45^circ.The angle between line BC and plane PAC is the complement of angle SOP, which is 90^circ - 45^circ = 45^circ.Therefore, the angle formed by line BC and plane PAC is boxed{30^circ}."},{"problem":"700.

This expression represents the limit of the ratio of displacement (triangle s) to the change in time (triangle t) as triangle t approaches 0. 1. Understanding the Expression: The ratio frac{{triangle s}}{{triangle t}} is the average velocity of the object over the interval from t to t+triangle t. This is because velocity is defined as the rate of change of displacement with respect to time.2. Taking the Limit: As triangle t approaches 0, the interval from t to t+triangle t becomes infinitesimally small. In this limit, the average velocity over the interval becomes the velocity at a specific instant, which is the definition of instantaneous velocity.3. Interpreting the Limit: Therefore, lim_{triangle t to 0}frac{{triangle s}}{{triangle t}} is not just any velocity, but specifically the instantaneous velocity of the object at the initial time t. This is because as triangle t approaches 0, the interval effectively collapses to the point at time t.4.

Ensure ( S(n) ) is a proper divisor of ( P(n) ):   - ( S(n) = k + 17 ) must be a proper divisor of 210.   - The divisors of 210 are ( 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105 ).7. Find the maximum ( k ):   - We need to find the maximum ( k ) such that ( k + 17 ) is a proper divisor of 210.   - The largest proper divisor of 210 is 105.   - Setting ( k + 17 = 105 ) gives ( k = 88 ).8. Calculate the total number of digits:   - The total number of digits in ( n ) is ( k + 4 ) (since we have one each of 2, 3, 5, and 7).   - Therefore, the total number of digits is ( 88 + 4 = 92 ).The final answer is ( boxed{92} )."},{"problem":"18.4.11 * Find the integer solution of the equation left(1+frac{1}{m}right)^{m+1}=left(1+frac{1}{1988}right)^{1988}.","solution":"The original equation is transformed into frac{1989^{1988}}{1988^{1988}}=frac{(m+1)^{m+1}}{m^{m+1}}.If m is a positive integer, then since both sides of (1) are irreducible fractions, it must be thatm^{m+1}=1988^{1988}.However, when m geqslant 1988, m^{m+1}>1988^{1988}.

The derivative is f'(x) = 3x^2 + a.

Therefore, a>1 is a sufficient condition for f(x) to be monotonically increasing on mathbb{R}.We now need to check if it is a necessary condition.

In the second case, f is constantly equal to 1, but then the equation becomes1+x=1 times 1for all x, which is impossible. Therefore, we have f(0)=0. By taking y=0, we then obtain x=f(x) f(1) for all x. In particular, by taking x=1, we get 1=f(1)^{2}, so f(1) is either 1 or -1.If f(1)=1, then x=f(x), so f is the identity function, which is indeed a solution. If f(1)=-1, we get x=-f(x) for all x, so f(x)=-x for all x, and we verify that this function is also a solution to the problem.## Common Exercises"},{"problem":"6.

In the context of right-angled triangles, knowing two acute angles are congruent implies the third angle is also congruent due to the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180^circ. However, congruence of triangles, especially right-angled triangles, requires information about the sides as well. This option only provides information about angles, which is insufficient for determining congruence through the common criteria (SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS, and HL for right-angled triangles). Therefore, this option aligns with the question's requirement for a condition that cannot determine congruence.- Option B: One side and one acute angle are congruent.  This condition can lead to the determination of congruent triangles through either the ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) or AAS (Angle-Angle-Side) criteria, where the given side is between the two angles or one of the angles is the right angle, respectively. Thus, this option provides sufficient information for determining congruence and does not match the question's criteria.- Option C: Two legs are congruent.  For right-angled triangles, having two legs (the two sides other than the hypotenuse) congruent directly satisfies the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) criterion, where the angle is the right angle between the two sides. This condition ensures the congruence of the triangles, making this option incorrect for the question's criteria.- Option D: One leg and the hypotenuse are congruent.

The equations of the given system make sense only if the numbers x, y, z are positive and different from 1.

To do this, we use the well-known fact that for p geqq 0, the function f(t)=t^{p} is non-decreasing (more precisely: increasing for p>0 and constant for p=0) on the set of positive numbers t. Suppose, on the contrary, that for some solution (x, y, z), for example, x < y. Then, from the first equation, we have y+z < x^{p}, and from the second equation, we have z+x = y^{p}.

The \\"stars and bars\\" theorem states that the number of ways to distribute (n) indistinguishable objects into (k) distinguishable bins is given by (binom{n+k-1}{k-1}).3. In this problem, we can think of the integers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_8) as 8 indistinguishable stars that need to be placed into 8 distinguishable bins (the integers from 1 to 8). The condition (1 le a_1 le a_2 le cdots le a_8 le 8) ensures that the stars are placed in non-decreasing order.4. To apply the \\"stars and bars\\" theorem, we need to find the number of ways to place 8 stars into 8 bins.

Simplify the expression by canceling out common factors:   - The (x+y) terms cancel out.   - The (x-y) term in the numerator and denominator cancels out one of the (x-y) factors in the numerator.   - The x in the numerator and the x factor from x(x+y) cancel out.6. After simplification, we are left with:   [   =x-y   ]7. Now, we evaluate x and y given that x=tan^2 60^circ + 1 and y=tan 45^circ - 2cos 30^circ:   - For x, tan^2 60^circ + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4.   - For y, tan 45^circ - 2cos 30^circ = 1 - 2 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 1 - sqrt{3}.8.

For ( xt = -1 ), we have ( a leq -y leq a + k ) for all ( a leq y leq a + k ), implying ( a = -frac{k}{2} ).7. Range of ( t ):   For ( x = 1 ), we have ( -frac{k}{2} leq t leq frac{k}{2} ). Since ( p > 7 ), we have ( -frac{k}{2} leq 2 leq frac{k}{2} ).8. Contradiction:   Now take ( x = 2 ) and move ( x' ) from ( 1 ) to ( frac{k}{2} ). At some point, ( xx't ) will not be in ( [-frac{k}{2}, frac{k}{2}] ), leading to a contradiction.Therefore, the only prime ( p ) for which there exists an integer ( n ) such that there are no integers ( x ) and ( y ) with ( x^3 + y^3 equiv n pmod{p} ) is ( p = 7 ).The final answer is ( boxed{7} )."},{"problem":"Simplify first, then evaluate: left(frac{x}{x+1}-frac{2}{x-1}right) div frac{1}{{x}^{2}-1}, where x satisfies x^{2}-3x-4=0.","solution":"To simplify and then evaluate the given expression left(frac{x}{x+1}-frac{2}{x-1}right) div frac{1}{{x}^{2}-1}, where x satisfies x^{2}-3x-4=0, we follow these steps:1.

The digits are: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and we know that 11 | overline{a b c d e f g h i}. Due to divisibility by 11, the digits of overline{a b c d e f g h i}, when summed with alternating signs, result in a number divisible by 11. Therefore, from the given digits, we need to find sums that are divisible by 11 by taking 4 digits as positive and 5 as negative (or 5 as positive and 4 as negative).In the largest case: 9+8+7+6+5-4-3-2-1=25.In the smallest case: 1+2+3+4-5-6-7-8-9=-25.Thus, the following numbers divisible by 11 can be considered as sums: -22,-11,0,11,22. Since an odd number of odd numbers cannot result in an even number through addition and subtraction, only two sums need to be examined: -11 and 11.If all digit signs are +, the sum is: 1+2+ldots+9=45, from which the sum of the negative-signed digits must be subtracted twice to get -11 or 11.If the sum of the negative-signed digits is frac{45-(-11)}{2}=28, then for four numbers, the possibilities are:9+8+7+4, quad 9+8+6+5These are the only possibilities because smaller numbers would result in a sum less than 28.For five numbers, the possibilities are:begin{array}{lll}9+8+7+3+1, & 9+8+6+4+1, & 9+8+6+3+2 9+8+5+4+2, & 9+7+6+5+1, & 9+7+6+4+2 9+7+5+4+3, & 8+7+6+5+2, & 8+7+6+4+3end{array}These are the only possibilities because smaller numbers would result in a sum less than 28.If the sum of the positive-signed digits is 28, we would get the same 11 arrangements.

The five identical signs can be arranged in 5! ways, and the remaining four different signs in 4! ways.

Therefore, (36^k equiv 1^k equiv 1 pmod{5}).   - This implies (36^k - 5^m equiv 1 - 0 equiv 1 pmod{5}).3. Possible values:    - From the above, (36^k - 5^m) must be congruent to 1 modulo 5. Hence, the possible values are of the form (5n + 1) for some integer (n).4. Modulo 6 analysis:   - Note that (36 equiv 0 pmod{6}). Therefore, (36^k equiv 0 pmod{6}).   - Also, (5 equiv -1 pmod{6}). Therefore, (5^m equiv (-1)^m pmod{6}).   - This implies (36^k - 5^m equiv 0 - (-1)^m equiv (-1)^{m+1} pmod{6}).5. Checking smaller values:   - We need to check if (36^k - 5^m = 1) is possible.   - Assume for contradiction that (36^k - 5^m = 1). This rearranges to ((6^k-1)(6^k+1) = 5^m).6.

Contradiction:   - The smallest difference between two powers of 5 is (5 - 1 = 4), which is greater than 2.   - By induction, the difference between two powers of 5 only increases as the powers increase.   - Therefore, there are no two powers of 5 that differ by 2, leading to a contradiction.8.

Of course, we cannot let the decomposed numbers include 1, because this will not increase the product.We also need to note that if the decomposed numbers happen to be 4, since4=2+2=2 times 2,so, when replacing 4 with 2+2, the product will not decrease.Therefore, the second adjustment is to replace all 4s in x_{i} with 2+2.After these two adjustments, the product will increase, and 1976 will be decomposed entirely into the sum of several 2s and 3s, i.e.,sum x_{j}=1976, x_{j}=2 text { or } 3 text {. }Next, focus on the adjustments for 2 and 3.Clearly,begin{array}{l}2+2+2=3+3, 2 times 2 times 2<3 times 3 .end{array}This shows that in the decomposition of 1976, more 3s are better than more 2s.Thus, the third adjustment is to replace every three 2s in the decomposition of 1976 with two 3s, and to make more 3s appear in the decomposition.Since1976=658 times 3+2Therefore, after these three adjustments, 1976 is decomposed into the sum of 658 3s and 1 2.At this point, the product is maximized, with the maximum value being 2 times 3^{658}.The solution process for this problem is:begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}hline begin{tabular}{l} a set of integersend{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l} first adjustmentend{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l} several 2,3,4end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l} second adjustmentend{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l}begin{tabular}{c} several 2,3end{tabular}end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l} third adjustmentend{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l}begin{tabular}{l}658 3s and 1end{tabular}end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l} maximum productend{tabular} & hline begin{tabular}{l} sum equals 1976end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l} numbers greater than 4 are decomposed into 2,3,4end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l} sum equals 1976end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l}begin{tabular}{l}4 is decomposed into 2+2end{tabular}end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l} sum equals 1976end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l}begin{tabular}{l}3 2s are decomposed into 2 3send{tabular}end{tabular} & begin{tabular}{l} sum equals 1976end{tabular} & & 2 cdot 3^{658} hlineend{tabular}"},{"problem":"Given that the sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence, a_3=5, a_5=9, and the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {b_n} is S_n, S_n=2^{n+1}-2 (n∈N^{}).(1) Find the general term formulas for the sequences {a_n} and {b_n};(2) If c_n=a_n⋅b_n (n∈N^{}), and T_n is the sum of the first n terms of the sequence {c_n}, find T_n.","solution":"(1) In the arithmetic sequence {a_n}, from a_3=5, a_5=9, we get d=frac{a_5-a_3}{5-3}=frac{9-5}{2}=2,therefore a_n=a_3+(n-3)d=5+2(n-3)=2n-1;In the geometric sequence {b_n}, from S_n=2^{n+1}-2, we get b_1=S_1=2,when ngeqslant 2, b_n=S_n-S_{n-1}=2^{n+1}-2-2^{n}+2=2^{n}, verify that it holds for n=1,therefore b_n=2^{n}.(2) because c_n=a_n⋅b_n=(2n-1)⋅2^{n},therefore T_n=1cdot 2^{1}+3cdot 2^{2}+...+(2n-1)2^{n},2T_n=1cdot 2^{2}+3cdot 2^{3}+...+(2n-1)2^{n+1},Subtracting the two equations, we get: -T_n=2+8(1+2+...+2^{n-2})-(2n-1)2^{n+1}=2+8cdot frac{1-2^{n-1}}{1-2}-(2n-1)2^{n+1}.therefore T_n=boxed{(2n-3)2^{n+1}+6}."},{"problem":"52.

Thus, by the Multiplication Principle, there are 10 cdot 6 + 10 cdot 4 + 6 cdot 4 = 124 distinct products of powers. Now we need to count how many products exist between powers of the same base. Given a prime number q and the set P_{q}=left{q^{1}, q^{2}, ldots, q^{k}right}, the smallest product of distinct powers is q^{1} cdot q^{2} = q^{3} and the largest is q^{k-1} cdot q^{k} = q^{2k-1}. We will now verify that all powers q^{t} with exponent t between 3 and 2k-1 can be obtained as a product of two numbers from this set. If t is even, we can write t = 2m and given that 3 < t < 2k-1, we have 1 < m < k-1. Therefore, it suffices to multiply the powers q^{m-1} and q^{m+1}, which are part of the set P_{q}, to obtain q^{m-1} cdot q^{m+1} = q^{2m} = q^{t}. If t is odd, we can write t = 2m+1 and given that 3 < t < 2k-1, we have 0 < m < k-1.

Since f is injective, we have f(c) neq f(d). If f(c) > f(d), then there would exist a z such that c < z < d and f(z) = f(c), which contradicts the injectivity of f. Therefore, f(d) geq f(c), which means that f is increasing.We then set p=inf {f(x): x>0} and q=inf {f(x): x>p}. Since f is increasing, we know that f(x) rightarrow p as x rightarrow 0 and x > 0, and that f(y) rightarrow q as y rightarrow p and y > p. For a fixed real number y > 0, if we let x tend to 0, we deduce that f(x) rightarrow p and that f(xy) rightarrow p, so that x + f(xy) rightarrow p and that f(x + f(xy)) rightarrow q. Consequently, the equality mathbf{E}_{x, y} indicates thaty-1=f(x) f(y)-f(x+f(xy)) rightarrow p f(y)-q,which means that f(y)=y+(q-1)/p.The function f is therefore an affine function, of the form f: t mapsto ut + v.

But then the triple equalityu(v-1) = uv - 1 = uv + v - v^2 - 1 = 0is indeed satisfied.In conclusion, the function f: t mapsto t + 1 is the unique solution to the problem.Comment from the graders This problem was extremely difficult, and no student (nor any mentor from the POFM) managed to pass the crucial step of proving that f is increasing. Several students had excellent reflexes: looking for a particular solution (the function f: t mapsto t + 1), examining particular values of x and y (here, x=1), investigating the injectivity of f, conjecturing that f is increasing (by noticing an infinity of values x < y such that f(x) < f(y)).triangleright Many students looked at what happened when y=1, but not when x=1. Others looked at the case where x=1, but did not think to deduce the injectivity of f, even though they had the equality f(1 + f(x)) + x = 1 + f(1) f(x), which made the injectivity of f immediate.triangleright Several students checked if the identity or constant functions could be solutions. It is a pity that they did not directly treat the case of affine functions, which was just as easy to handle, and which would have allowed them to identify the only solution to the problem."},{"problem":"3.
