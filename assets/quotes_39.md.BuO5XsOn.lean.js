We observe that the last digit of the sum (units place) is 5. Therefore, the sum of the units digits ( c + f + i ) must end in 5. Since ( c, f, i ) are distinct non-zero digits, the only possible sum that ends in 5 is 15. This is because:   [   text{Maximum sum} = 9 + 8 + 7 = 24 quad (text{which is less than 25})   ]   [   text{Minimum sum} = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 quad (text{which is greater than 5})   ]   Therefore, ( c + f + i = 15 ).4. Similarly, the sum of the tens digits ( b + e + h ) must also end in 6 (since the tens place of 1665 is 6). However, since we are dealing with distinct non-zero digits, we need to consider the carry from the units place. Given that ( c + f + i = 15 ), there is a carry of 1 to the tens place.5. Therefore, the sum of the tens digits ( b + e + h ) plus the carry from the units place must end in 6. This means:   [   b + e + h + 1 = 16 implies b + e + h = 15   ]6. To verify, we can consider an example where the digits are distinct and non-zero. For instance, if we take:   [   123 + 564 + 978 = 1665   ]   Here, ( b = 2 ), ( e = 6 ), and ( h = 7 ).

The number of different seating arrangements is    A．8        B．16       C．24       D．60","solution":"Answer CTo solve this problem, we can consider placing an empty seat on both sides of each person. Since there are 4 people, we need to place 4 empty seats on the left side of each person and 4 empty seats on the right side of each person. This means we need to place 8 empty seats in total. However, since the seats on the far left and far right do not require an additional empty seat (because there's no need for an empty seat outside the row), we effectively need to place 6 empty seats for 4 people, which can be seen as placing 6 empty seats among the 5 spaces created by these 4 people (to the left of the first person, between the first and second person, between the second and third person, between the third and fourth person, and to the right of the fourth person).Therefore, we are looking for the number of ways to distribute 6 identical empty seats into these 5 spaces. This is a problem of distributing identical items into different groups, which can be solved using the formula for combinations with repetition: binom{n+r-1}{r}, where n is the number of groups (spaces in our case) and r is the number of items to distribute (empty seats).In our case, n=5 and r=6, so we have:binom{n+r-1}{r} = binom{5+6-1}{6} = binom{10}{6}Calculating this gives us:binom{10}{6} = frac{10!}{6!(10-6)!} = frac{10 times 9 times 8 times 7}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = 210However, this calculation does not match the provided options, indicating a mistake in the interpretation of the problem. The correct approach is to consider that after placing a person with an empty seat on both sides, we effectively reduce the number of available seats for the next person. For 4 people to sit with this condition, we can consider the arrangement as placing 4 people with an empty seat on both sides in a row of 9 seats. This can be visualized as \\"P_E_P_E_P_E_P_E_P\\", where \\"P\\" represents a person and \\"E\\" represents an empty seat. This visualization shows that there are 5 empty seats that are fixed based on the placement of 4 people, leaving us with 4 seats that are actually occupied by people.Given the misunderstanding in the calculation, the correct approach is to consider the constraints of the problem more carefully. The actual solution involves a different combinatorial argument, taking into account the specific requirement that each person must have empty seats on both sides.

It is known that through any point inside the circle, no more than two chords with endpoints at the marked points pass. We will call a matching a set of N chords with endpoints at the marked points such that each marked point is the endpoint of exactly one of these chords. We will call a matching even if the number of points where its chords intersect is even, and odd otherwise. Find the difference between the number of even and odd matchings.(V. Shmarov)","solution":"Answer. 1.First solution. We will prove by induction on N that there is one more even matching than odd. For N=1, the statement is obvious: there is only one matching, and it is even. Now we will prove the statement for 2N points, assuming it is true for 2(N-1) points. Let the marked points be A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{2N} in the order of traversal of the circle clockwise.Lemma. Suppose a chord A_{1}A_{i} is involved in the matching. Then for even i, it intersects an even number of chords, and for odd i, an odd number.Proof. Let the chord A_{1}A_{i} intersect exactly k chords. Consider the points A_{2}, ldots, A_{i-1}; exactly k of them are the endpoints of chords intersecting A_{1}A_{i} (one endpoint of each chord). The remaining i-2-k points are paired with points connected by chords that do not intersect A_{1}A_{i}. Thus, the number i-2-k is even, meaning that the numbers i and k have the same parity. The lemma is proved.Now we will divide all matchings into 2N-1 groups Pi_{2}, ldots, Pi_{2N}: the group Pi_{i} will contain those matchings in which point A_{1} is connected to A_{i}. Now, remove the chord A_{1}A_{i} from each matching in Pi_{i}; we will get all possible matchings on the remaining 2N-2 points. By the induction hypothesis, among them, there is one more even matching than odd. At the same time, if i is even, then according to the lemma, the parity of the matching does not change when removed, and if i is odd, it changes. Thus, in each of the N sets Pi_{2}, ldots, Pi_{2N}, there is one more even matching than odd, and in each of the N-1 sets Pi_{3}, ldots, Pi_{2N-1}, there is one more odd than even. In total, there are more even matchings than odd by N-(N-1)=1, which is what we needed to prove.Second solution. We will provide another proof of the induction step.Let the marked points be A_{1}, ldots, A_{2N}. Consider all matchings in which A_{2N-1} and A_{2N} are connected by a chord. This chord does not intersect any other. Thus, by removing it from each of the considered matchings, we will get all matchings on the points A_{1}, ldots, A_{2N-2}, and the parity of each of them will be preserved. By the induction hypothesis, among our matchings, there is one more even than odd.To complete the proof, it is sufficient to show that among all other matchings, there are equally many even and odd. Consider any of them; suppose it contains chords A_{2N-1}A_{i} and A_{2N}A_{k}. Now, \\"swap\\" the points A_{2N-1} and A_{2N}, that is, replace the chords with A_{2N}A_{i} and A_{2N-1}A_{k}. In this case, if the original chord intersected with some of the others, then the new chord will also intersect with it. On the other hand, if the chords A_{2N-1}A_{i} and A_{2N}A_{k} did not intersect, then the new chords will intersect, and vice versa. Thus, to each remaining even matching, we have associated an odd one, and vice versa; different matchings, obviously, correspond to different ones. Therefore, there are equally many remaining even and odd matchings, which is what we needed to prove."},{"problem":"It is known that for any point on curve C, the difference between its distance to point F(0,1) and its distance to the x-axis is always 1.(1) Find the equation of curve C;(2) Let the line y=kx+m(m > 0) intersect curve C at points A and B.

The number overline{A B} is at least 32, because the square of a smaller natural number has at most three digits. With a little trial and error, we realize that A cannot be less than 9. Indeed, the square of a two-digit number, whose tens digit is 3,4,5,6,7, is respectively less than 40^{2}=1600,50^{2}=2500, 60^{2}=3600,70^{2}=4900, and 80^{2}=6400, while the square of those starting with 8 is at most 89^{2}=7921. Thus, the square of these numbers starts with a smaller digit than the base.Consequently, the number overline{C D^{3}} can only fall between 9000 and 10000. The only cube number between these two limits is 21^{3}=9261, because 20^{3} is still only 8000, while 22^{3} is already 10648. Therefore, the only solution is A=9, C=2, B=6, D=1. From this, overline{A B}=96, and its square is 9216, which satisfies the first condition.Uray Szabolcs (Szentendre, Móricz Zs. g. I. o. t.)Remark. We can arrive at the single possible value of A with fewer trials by the following path. In overline{A B^{2}}=(10 A+B)^{2}= 100 A^{2}+20 A B+B^{2}, since A, B leqq 9, we have 20 A B+B^{2} leqq 1701, meaning that at most 17 hundreds can be added to the A^{2} hundreds. In overline{A B^{2}} in the form overline{A C D B}, the number of hundreds is overline{A C}=10 A+C. Therefore, 10 A+C leqq A^{2}+17, and thus even more so 10 A leqq A^{2}+17, or A^{2}-10 A+17 geqq 0. The left side is negative for values of A=5 pm sqrt{8}, so either A leqq 2 (which we have already ruled out), or A geqq 8. Since 89^{2}<8000, only A=9 can lead to a solution.Szentai Judit (Budapest, Kanizsay D. lg. I. o. t.)II. solution. overline{C D^{3}}-overline{A B^{2}}=overline{B D}-overline{D B}=(B-D) 9, is divisible by 9. We will show that overline{A B}, and thus overline{C D}, is divisible by 3. If e is an integer, e^{3}-e=(e-1) e(e+1) is divisible by 3, because the product of three consecutive integers is divisible by 3.

In this case, however, overline{C D^{3}}-overline{A B^{2}} can only be divisible by 9 if overline{C D} is also divisible by 3. On the other hand,10^{3}=1000 leqq overline{C D^{3}}<10000<22^{3}(=10648)so 10 leqq overline{C D} leqq 21. The numbers divisible by 3 in this range are 12,15,18,21.We also know that the last digit of overline{C D^{3}} is D, which matches the last digit of the base. This is only true for numbers ending in 1,4,5,6,9, so overline{C D} can only be 15 or 21. Among these, 15^{3} ends in 75, and in the case of overline{C D}=15, overline{A B^{2}} would have to end in 57, which is impossible because a square number cannot end in 7.The only remaining possibility is overline{C D}=21.

The coordinates of (B) are ((a, 0)) and the coordinates of (C) are ((a, a)).   - Let (N) be at ((a, y)) on the side (BC).4.

Substituting this back into the expression for ( a ):   [   a = frac{(10^n - 1)(10^n + 1)}{3(10^n + 1)}   ]4.

Thus, the problem is reduced to finding the number of permutations a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{n} that satisfy condition (1). This special type of permutation without repetition is called a derangement of 1,2, cdots, n. Generally, D_{n} denotes the number of all possible derangements of the set {1,2, cdots, n}.

Case 1: One of (a, b, c) is zero:   - Without loss of generality, assume (c = 0).   - Then the equation simplifies to (a + b = 0).   - Therefore, (b = -a).   - We need to prove (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 ge 3(a + b + c)).   - Substituting (b = -a) and (c = 0), we get:     [     a^2 + (-a)^2 + 0^2 = 2a^2     ]     [     3(a + (-a) + 0) = 3 cdot 0 = 0     ]     [     2a^2 ge 0     ]   - This inequality is always true since (a^2 ge 0).4.

Determine the set ( M ) of all points ( C ) in the plane for which ( |AC|^2 + |BC|^2 = 2 cdot |AB|^2 ):   Let ( A ) and ( B ) be two points in the plane, and let ( I ) be the midpoint of ( AB ). We need to find the set of points ( C ) such that ( |AC|^2 + |BC|^2 = 2 cdot |AB|^2 ).   Using the midpoint ( I ), we can express the distances ( |AC| ) and ( |BC| ) in terms of ( |CI| ) and ( |AB| ).

Decide whether there is a point ( C in M ) such that ( angle ACB ) is maximal and if so, determine this angle:   To find the point ( C ) such that ( angle ACB ) is maximal, we consider the geometry of the situation. The circle ( k ) with center ( I ) and radius ( frac{sqrt{3}}{2}|AB| ) intersects the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ) at two points. Let ( M ) be one of these intersection points.   Since ( M ) lies on the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ), ( angle AMB ) is an isosceles triangle with ( AM = MB ). The maximum angle ( angle ACB ) occurs when ( C ) is at one of these intersection points.   We know that ( IM = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}|AB| ) and ( IA = frac{1}{2}|AB| ). In the triangle ( IMA ), we can use the sine rule to find ( angle IMA ):   [   sin angle IMA = frac{IA}{IM} = frac{frac{1}{2}|AB|}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}|AB|} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}   ]   Therefore, ( angle IMA = 30^circ ).   Since ( angle IMA = 30^circ ), the angle ( angle BMA ) is:   [   angle BMA = 2 times angle IMA = 2 times 30^circ = 60^circ   ]   Hence, the maximum angle ( angle ACB ) is ( 60^circ ).The final answer is ( boxed{ 60^circ } )."},{"problem":"In a 3D bar chart, the height of the bars represents ( )A.

How many such arrangements are possible?","solution":"I. solution. Let us denote the four colors by the letters a, b, c, and d, and the four figures by the indices 1, 2, 3, and 4. Then a suitable arrangement of the cards is as follows:begin{array}{cccc}a_{1} & b_{2} & c_{3} & d_{4} b_{3} & a_{4} & d_{1} & c_{2} c_{4} & d_{3} & a_{2} & b_{1} d_{2} & c_{1} & b_{4} & a_{3}end{array}If we permute the columns among themselves, we get a configuration that meets the requirements; but in each of these configurations, the rows can also be permuted among themselves, so we will have 4! times 4! = 576 different arrangements. In all these arrangements, the same cards or elements appear in each column and row; for example, a_{1}, b_{2}, c_{3}, d_{4} always appear in one row, and a_{1}, b_{3}, c_{4}, d_{2} always appear in one column. It is obvious that b_{3} and b_{4} can also be placed in the position of b_{2}, and c_{4} can be placed in the position of c_{3}. Thus, the number of original arrangements - without permutation - is 3 times 2 = 6, and since b_{4} can also stand in the first column instead of b_{3}, the number of original arrangements is 6 times 2 = 12. In each of these arrangements, by permuting the columns and rows in the manner mentioned above, the total number of possible arrangements is4! times 4! times 12 = 576 times 12 = 6912(Lukhaub Gyula, Szeged.)II. solution. According to the problem, there must be one a, one b, one c, and one d in the first row. Starting with a, we can take any of the 4 as, but then, since the bs must have different indices, we can only take 3 of the bs, 2 of the cs, and 1 of the ds. Therefore, there are 4 cdot 3 cdot 2 cdot 1 = 4! different sets of four cards in the first row, and since the order of these cards can be changed in 4! ways, the first row can be arranged in (4!)^2 ways. Since these rows play the same role, it is sufficient to continue the discussion for one case, for example, if the four elements of the first row are a_{1}, b_{2}, c_{3}, d_{4}. Now consider the first column; apart from a_{1}, only (1) b_{3} or (2) b_{4} can go there. In case (1), the third place can be taken by c_{2}, and the fourth place by d_{4} or the third place by c_{4}, and the fourth place by d_{2}, but the former is impossible because d_{4} is already in the first row, so only the latter is possible; in case (2), the third place can only be taken by c_{2} and the fourth place by d_{3}, which is the second possible case. Therefore, if the first row is fixed, the other three cards in the first column can be arranged in only two ways, or considering the order of the three cards, in 2 times 3! ways.After this, it can be shown that the first row and column (if they are arranged according to the problem) determine a unique solution. Therefore, the number of solutions is as many as the number of ways to arrange the first row and column. We have seen that the first row can be arranged in (4!)^2 ways, and the first column in 2 times 3! ways, so the number of solutions is(4!)^2 times 2 times 3! = 4! times 1! times 2! times 3! times 4! = 6912(König Dénes, Budapest.)Note. If we add the condition to our problem that the same figure and color should not appear twice in the direction of the diagonals, then the number of solutions is 576 times 2 = 1152. In one diagonal direction, indeed, 8212; as before in the first row 8212; the number of arrangements is again 576. For example, let one arrangement in the diagonal direction be a_{1} b_{2} c_{3} d_{4}. It can be easily shown that in this arrangement, only a_{4} or d_{1} can go to the 7th place, and in each case, there is only one possible arrangement of the cards. Therefore, in each of the 576 cases, two arrangements are possible, so we get a total of 2 times 576 arrangements.

M. L. VI. 64. 1. and VII. 3. 1.) if we replace the letters with consecutive numbers. If, for example, a_{1}=1, a_{2}=2, a_{3}=3, a_{4}=4, b_{1}=5, b_{2}=6, b_{3}=7, b_{4}=8, c_{1}=9, c_{2}=10, c_{3}=11, c_{4}=12, d_{1}=13, d_{2}=14, d_{3}=15, d_{4}=16, then from the above arrangements we get the following magic squares:| 1 | 15 | 8 | 10 || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || 12 | 6 | 13 | 3 || 14 | 4 | 11 | 5 || 7 | 9 | 2 | 16 || 1 | 12 | 14 | 7 || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || 15 | 6 | 4 | 9 || 8 | 13 | 11 | 2 || 10 | 3 | 5 | 16 |We see that in every row and every column, as well as in the direction of the diagonals, the sum of the numbers is 34.(Károly Rátz, Vienna.)The problem was also solved by: Béla Bayer."},{"problem":"2.

Understanding the Problem:   - There are ( n ) wise men, each wearing either a black or white hat.   - Each wise man can see the hats of all the others but not his own.   - They must simultaneously guess the color of their own hat.   - If at least one wise man does not guess, they will all be executed.   - The goal is to maximize the number of layouts for which everyone guesses correctly.2. Analyzing the Constraints:   - The total number of possible hat layouts is ( 2^n ) since each of the ( n ) wise men can have either a black or white hat.   - Each wise man has a ( frac{1}{2} ) chance of guessing his hat color correctly if he guesses randomly.3. Optimal Strategy:   - The wise men can discuss a strategy beforehand.   - A possible strategy is for each wise man to guess based on the sum of the hat colors he sees.4. Detailed Strategy:   - Let’s denote the hat colors as binary values: 0 for white and 1 for black.   - Each wise man can see the hats of the other ( n-1 ) wise men.   - They can agree on a strategy where each wise man guesses that the sum of all the hats (including his own) is 0 modulo 2 (i.e., even).5. Mathematical Formulation:   - Let ( h_i ) be the hat color of the ( i )-th wise man.   - Each wise man ( i ) sees the sum ( sum_{j neq i} h_j ).   - The strategy is for each wise man to guess that ( h_i = sum_{j neq i} h_j mod 2 ).6. Correctness of the Strategy:   - If the total sum of all hats ( sum_{i=1}^n h_i ) is 0 modulo 2, then each wise man’s guess will be correct.   - This is because ( h_i = sum_{j neq i} h_j mod 2 ) implies ( sum_{i=1}^n h_i = 0 mod 2 ).7. Counting the Successful Layouts:   - The total sum ( sum_{i=1}^n h_i ) can be either 0 or 1 modulo 2.   - There are ( 2^{n-1} ) layouts where the sum is 0 modulo 2 (even number of 1s).   - There are ( 2^{n-1} ) layouts where the sum is 1 modulo 2 (odd number of 1s).8.

For n = 1, we previously found that S_1 = frac{1}{2} which agrees with our conjectured formula S_n = frac{n}{n+1} for n = 1.2. Assuming the conjecture holds for n = k, that is S_k = frac{k}{k+1} for some integer k geq 1,   let's consider n = k + 1. Then, we have:   S_{k+1} = S_k + a_{k+1} = frac{k}{k+1} + frac{1}{(k+1)(k+2)}.   To combine the fractions, we find a common denominator (k+1)(k+2):   begin{align*}   S_{k+1} &= frac{k(k+2)}{(k+1)(k+2)} + frac{1}{(k+1)(k+2)}    &= frac{k(k+2) + 1}{(k+1)(k+2)}    &= frac{k^2 + 2k + 1}{(k+1)(k+2)}    &= frac{(k+1)^2}{(k+1)(k+2)}    &= frac{k+1}{k+2}    &= frac{k+1}{(k+1)+1}.   end{align*}   This means the conjectured formula also holds for n = k + 1.Since both the base case and the inductive step have been confirmed, we conclude that the conjectured formula S_n = frac{n}{n+1} is valid for all positive integers n.boxed{S_n = frac{n}{n+1}}"},{"problem":"Let  a,  b,  c, and  d be real numbers with  |aminus{}b|equal{}2,  |bminus{}c|equal{}3, and  |cminus{}d|equal{}4.

Translate and scale the assignments:   We can assume that the largest number assigned to an edge is 1 and the smallest is 0. This is possible by translating and scaling the assignments.3. Case 1: Non-incident edges:   Suppose the edges with numbers 0 and 1 are not incident. Consider a tetrahedron (complete graph on 4 vertices). We need to check if the edges can form arithmetic progressions.       - Assign numbers to the edges such that they form arithmetic progressions.    - If the edges are (0, 1, frac{1}{3}, frac{2}{3}), some of the numbers must be equal, which contradicts the requirement for distinct numbers.4. Case 2: Incident edges:   Suppose the edges with numbers 0 and 1 are incident, say (0 to AB) and (1 to AC). Then, the edge (BC) must be assigned (frac{1}{2}) to form an arithmetic progression with (AB) and (AC).5. Consider another vertex (X):   - Assign numbers to the edges (XA, XB, XC) such that they form arithmetic progressions with the existing edges.   - Two possible assignments are:     1.

Assign numbers to the edges involving (X) and (Y):     - (XA = frac{1}{5}, XB = frac{2}{5}, XC = frac{3}{5})     - (YA = frac{5}{7}, YB = frac{5}{14}, YC = frac{3}{7})   - Check if there is a number to be assigned to (XY) to satisfy the requirements.

","solution":" Part (a)1. Restate the problem in general terms:   We need to prove that for any prime number ( p ), there exist positive integers ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( a^2 + b^2 + 2018 ) is a multiple of ( p ).2. Define sets ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ):   Let ( S_1 = { a^2 mid 0 leq a leq p-1 } ) and ( S_2 = { -2018 - b^2 mid 0 leq b leq p-1 } ) as subsets of ( mathbb{Z}_p ).3. Cardinality of sets:   Since ( a^2 ) and ( b^2 ) can take on (frac{p+1}{2}) distinct values in ( mathbb{Z}_p ) (as each quadratic residue has exactly two square roots modulo ( p )), we have ( |S_1| = |S_2| = frac{p+1}{2} ).4. Intersection of sets:   If ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) were disjoint, then ( p geq |S_1 cup S_2| = |S_1| + |S_2| = p + 1 ), which is a contradiction. Therefore, ( S_1 ) and ( S_2 ) must have at least one common element.5. Existence of ( a ) and ( b ):   This common element implies there exist ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( a^2 equiv -2018 - b^2 pmod{p} ). Hence, ( a^2 + b^2 + 2018 equiv 0 pmod{p} ).Thus, we have proven that there exist positive integers ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( a^2 + b^2 + 2018 ) is a multiple of ( p ). Part (b)1. Special cases:   - For ( p = 2 ), we can choose ( a = 1 ) and ( b = 1 ), since ( 1^2 + 1^2 + 2018 = 2020 equiv 0 pmod{2} ).   - For ( p = 1009 ), since ( 1009 equiv 1 pmod{4} ), ( -1 ) is a quadratic residue modulo ( 1009 ). Thus, we can find ( b ) such that ( b^2 equiv -1 pmod{1009} ) and choose ( a = 1 ).2. General case analysis:   - We need to check when ( -2018 ) is a quadratic residue modulo ( p ). If ( -2018 ) is not a quadratic residue modulo ( p ), then there exist ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( p nmid a ) and ( p nmid b ) and ( p mid a^2 + b^2 + 2018 ).3. Case when ( -2018 ) is a quadratic residue modulo ( p ):   - If ( -2018 ) is a quadratic residue modulo ( p ), then there exists ( n_0 ) such that ( n_0^2 equiv -2018 pmod{p} ). We can use the Pythagorean triple ( (3, 4, 5) ) to construct ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( a equiv 3 cdot 5^{-1} cdot n_0 pmod{p} ) and ( b equiv 4 cdot 5^{-1} cdot n_0 pmod{p} ).4. Exclusion of specific primes:   - For ( p = 3 ), we must have either ( a ) or ( b ) divisible by ( 3 ). For ( p = 5 ), we can choose ( a equiv 1 pmod{5} ) and ( b equiv 1 pmod{5} ).5. Conclusion:   - Except for ( p = 3 ), the job can be done for every prime ( p ).The final answer is ( boxed{ p neq 3 } )."},{"problem":"In a geometric sequence with positive terms {a_n}, the geometric mean of a_5 and a_{15} is 2sqrt{2}.

Both situations fail to meet the condition that the 65th percentile is 7.9.   - Case 2: x geq 7.9     - If x is equal to or greater than 7.9, the 6th number in the sorted set is guaranteed to be 7.9, satisfying the condition for the 65th percentile.3. Conclusion:   - Based on the above analysis, for the 65th percentile to be 7.9, x must be equal to or greater than 7.9. However, there is no upper limit provided for x, meaning it can extend to infinity.   - Therefore, the range of the real number x is left[7.9,+infty right).Thus, the final answer, following the format and rules specified, is:[boxed{text{A}}]"},{"problem":"3.3 red birds for 4 days eat 36 grams of seed, 5 blue birds for 3 days eat 60 gram of seed.For how many days could be feed 2 red birds and 4 blue birds with 88 gr seed?","solution":"1.

Simplifying the Right-Hand Side:   Notice that each ( x_i^2 ) appears in the sum exactly 3 times (since there are 3 pairs involving ( x_i )), and each ( x_i x_j ) appears exactly once for each pair:   [   sum_{1 le i < j le 4} left( x_i^2 + 6x_i x_j + x_j^2 right) = 3 sum_{i=1}^4 x_i^2 + 6 sum_{1 le i < j le 4} x_i x_j   ]   Since ( sum_{i=1}^4 x_i = 1 ), we have:   [   left( sum_{i=1}^4 x_i right)^2 = sum_{i=1}^4 x_i^2 + 2 sum_{1 le i < j le 4} x_i x_j = 1   ]   Therefore:   [   sum_{1 le i < j le 4} x_i x_j = frac{1 - sum_{i=1}^4 x_i^2}{2}   ]5. Combining Results:   Substituting back, we get:   [   sum_{1 le i < j le 4} left( x_i + x_j right) sqrt{x_i x_j} le frac{1}{4} left( 3 sum_{i=1}^4 x_i^2 + 6 sum_{1 le i < j le 4} x_i x_j right)   ]   [   = frac{1}{4} left( 3 sum_{i=1}^4 x_i^2 + 6 cdot frac{1 - sum_{i=1}^4 x_i^2}{2} right)   ]   [   = frac{1}{4} left( 3 sum_{i=1}^4 x_i^2 + 3 - 3 sum_{i=1}^4 x_i^2 right)   ]   [   = frac{1}{4} cdot 3 = frac{3}{4}   ]6. Achieving the Maximum:   To achieve the maximum value, we need equality in the inequality. This happens when ( left( sqrt{x_i} - sqrt{x_j} right)^4 = 0 ), i.e., ( sqrt{x_i} = sqrt{x_j} ) for all ( i, j ). Thus, ( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = x_4 = frac{1}{4} ).The final answer is ( boxed{ frac{3}{4} } ) with ( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = x_4 = frac{1}{4} )."},{"problem":"1.

Therefore, A subseteq B or B subseteq A cannot hold, and in particular, A neq B. Thus, different theater groups must have different subsets of performance dates.We first prove that n=6 is sufficient.Indeed, one possible set of performance dates for 11 theater groups is:begin{array}{l}{1,2},{1,3},{1,4},{1,5},{2,3}, {2,4},{2,5},{3,4},{3,5},{4,5},{6} .end{array}This is exactly 11 subsets of the date set N={1,2,3,4,5,6}, and no two subsets are contained in each other.Next, we prove that n=5 is not sufficient.

Each subset with 1 or 4 elements appears in 4 times 3 times 2=24 chains, and each subset with 2 or 3 elements appears in 2 times 3 times 2=12 chains (for example, A_{2} contains two numbers, A_{1} contains one of these two numbers, A_{3} contains one of the other three numbers, and A_{4} contains one of the remaining two numbers). Since we have 11 theater groups, each group's set of performance dates appears 12 or 24 times in the 120 chains, so the 11 sets of performance dates appear at least 11 times 12=132 times in total. By the pigeonhole principle, at least two sets of performance dates must appear in the same chain, denoted as A and B, which contradicts the fact that A and B do not contain each other.Therefore, such an arrangement requires at least 6 days."},{"problem":"Five rats competed in a 25 metre race.

Additionally, since the function is linear, the exponent of x in the second term must be 1, which implies |m+2| = 1. Solving this gives two possible cases:   - Case 1: m + 2 = 1 implies m = -1 (which does not satisfy the first condition)   - Case 2: m + 2 = -1 implies m = -3 (which satisfies the first condition)Therefore, combining both conditions, we find that m = -3.

Rearranging to find t in terms of x, we get:   [   t = frac{2}{3-x}-1   ]   Since t > 0, it implies 1 < x < 3. This range for x is crucial for analyzing the profit function later.2. Setting Up the Profit Function:   The selling price per ten thousand units is “150% of the purchase price” plus “half of the average cost of physical store experience installation per product”.

Maximizing Monthly Profit:   To maximize the profit, we analyze the function:   [   y = 45.5 - left[16(3-x) + frac{1}{3-x}right]   ]   Applying the AM-GM inequality, since 16(3-x) and frac{1}{3-x} are positive for 1 < x < 3:   [   16(3-x) + frac{1}{3-x} geq 2sqrt{16(3-x) cdot frac{1}{3-x}}   ]   Simplifying:   [   16(3-x) + frac{1}{3-x} geq 2sqrt{16} = 8   ]   Thus, y leq 45.5 - 8 = 37.5, and equality holds when 16(3-x) = frac{1}{3-x}.

We start with the given condition that for ( n in mathbb{N} ), the function ( f ) is non-negative and defined on the set ({1, 2, ldots, n}) such that ( f(i) geq f(j) ) for ( i > j ).

The first sum is the sum of the first ( n ) natural numbers, which is given by:   [   sum_{i=1}^{n} i = frac{n(n+1)}{2}   ]4.

Therefore,R_{k}=1+10+10^{2}+ldots+10^{k-1}=frac{10^{k}-1}{9}Thus,0frac{k}{10} n-2 n=frac{k-20}{10} cdot nAccording to (2) and (3), similarly, on the one hand,Q_{n}=(n+1) k-R_{k}>n k-2 n=(k-2) nand on the other hand,Q_{n}<(k+1) nBased on these, we can set bounds for the ratio frac{P_{n}}{Q_{n}}:frac{k-20}{k+1} cdot frac{1}{10}<frac{P_{n}}{Q_{n}}<frac{k+12}{k-2} cdot frac{1}{10}Here, the limit of both sides is frac{1}{10}, since k also tends to infinity as n does. This is indeed the case, as for any large number A, there exists an N such that k geqq A for all natural numbers n greater than N. - This completes the proof of the problem statement."},{"problem":"In 2010, the average housing price in Xi'an was 5500 yuan per square meter.

The superdivisor d of a composite number n is obtained when we strike out the smallest represented factor (one, if there are multiple) from the prime factorization of the number n. Therefore, it holds that n = p d, where p is a prime number with the property p leq d?Let n_{1}, n_{2}, n_{3} be any sought triplet. According to the introductory paragraph, for the superdivisor d_{i} of the number n_{i}, the equality n_{i} = p_{i} d_{i} holds, where p_{i} is a prime number and p_{i} leq d_{i} for each i=1,2,3.

From the way the inequality p_{1} p_{2} p_{3} leq d_{1} d_{2} d_{3} was derived, we see that d_{i} = p_{i} or n_{i} = p_{i}^{2} must hold for each i=1,2,3.

For example, f(23) = f(10111 2 ) = 10111 3 = 81 + 9 + 3 + 1 = 94. We have 293 = 101212 3 . If we write this as the sum of two numbers without 2s, then there can be no carries, and both numbers must have 1s where 293 has 2s, so the only possibilities are 101111 + 101, 101101 + 111, 100111 + 1101, 100101 + 1111.

As such:[p = dfrac{text{Number of 12th-grade students}}{text{Total number of students}} = dfrac{400}{300 + 300 + 400} = dfrac{400}{1000} = dfrac{2}{5}.]Thus, the probability p is boxed{dfrac{2}{5}}.This probability calculation leverages the property of stratified sampling and utilizes the classical approach for probability calculations. The question tests the understanding of the probability calculation method, specifically the properties of stratified sampling and the use of classical probability formulas.

We will find the rectangular coordinate equation of the line, the equation of the curve (circle), and then calculate the maximum value of d using the distance from the center of the circle to the line.First, let's find the rectangular coordinate equation of line l. We know that in polar coordinates, x = rho cos theta and y = rho sin theta. Using these relations and the given polar equation, we have:begin{align}rho cos left(theta - frac{pi}{4}right) &= 3 sqrt{2} rho (cos theta cos frac{pi}{4} + sin theta sin frac{pi}{4}) &= 3 sqrt{2} rho (frac{sqrt{2}}{2} cos theta + frac{sqrt{2}}{2} sin theta) &= 3 sqrt{2} x + y &= 6end{align}So, the rectangular coordinate equation of line l is x + y = 6.The equation of the curve C in rectangular coordinates is x^2 + y^2 = 1, which represents a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 1.The maximum value of the distance d between a point on the circle and the line will be achieved when the line is tangent to the circle.

Let ( N = 100x + 10y + z ) be the desired number, for which ( N = x! + y! + z! ). The number ( 7! = 5040 ) is a four-digit number, so no digit of ( N ) exceeds 6. Therefore, the number ( N ) is less than 700. But then no digit of ( N ) exceeds 5, since ( 6! = 720 ). The inequality ( 3 cdot 4! = 72 < 100 ) shows that at least one digit of ( N ) is equal to 5. At the same time, ( x neq 5 ), since ( 3 cdot 5! = 360 < 500 ). The equality ( 3 cdot 5! = 360 ) also shows that ( x leq 3 ). Moreover, ( x leq 2 ), since ( 3! + 2 cdot 5! = 246 < 300 ). The number 255 does not satisfy the condition of the problem, and if only one digit of the desired number is equal to 5, then ( x leq 1 ), since ( 2! + 5! + 4! = 146 < 200 ).

Then, find the radius to obtain the equation of the circle.Step-by-step SolutionLet the center of the circle be denoted as O(x,-4x).First, find the slope of the line connecting the center of the circle and the point of tangency P(3,-2):k_{OP} = frac{2 - (-4x)}{3 - x} = frac{2 + 4x}{3 - x}Next, recall that the slope of the given line l is -1, and since the line and circle are tangent, the product of the slopes should be equal to -1:k_L = -1therefore k_{OP} cdot k_L = -1Substitute the expression for k_{OP} and solve for x:frac{2 + 4x}{3 - x} cdot (-1) = -12 + 4x = 3 - x5x = 1therefore x = 1Now that we have the x-coordinate of the center, find the y-coordinate using the equation of the line y = -4x:y = -4(1)therefore y = -4So, the center of the circle is at O(1, -4). Next, calculate the radius r using the distance formula between points O(1, -4) and P(3, -2):r = sqrt{(1-3)^2 + (-4 - (-2))^2} = sqrt{(1-3)^2 + (-4 + 2)^2} = sqrt{(-2)^2 + (-2)^2} = sqrt{4 + 4} = sqrt{8} = 2sqrt{2}Finally, write the equation of the circle using the standard form:(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2Substitute the values of the center O(h, k) = O(1, -4) and the radius r = 2sqrt{2}:(x - 1)^2 + (y - (-4))^2 = (2sqrt{2})^2boxed{(x - 1)^2 + (y + 4)^2 = 8}"},{"problem":"8.

Each block covers exactly 2 cells.2. Each cell is covered by at least one block.3. If we delete any block, there is at least one cell that is not covered.Let's break down the solution step-by-step:1. Total Number of Cells and Blocks:   - The ( 4 times 4 ) grid has ( 16 ) cells.   - Each block covers ( 2 ) cells, so if we have ( k ) blocks, they cover ( 2k ) cells.2. Condition on Coverage:   - Each cell must be covered by at least one block.   - Therefore, ( 2k geq 16 ), which implies ( k geq 8 ).3. Condition on Removing a Block:   - If we remove any block, there must be at least one cell that is not covered.   - This implies that each block must cover at least one cell that is uniquely covered by that block (singly-covered cell).4. Maximum Coverage:   - Each cell can be covered by multiple blocks, but we need to ensure that removing any block leaves at least one cell uncovered.   - Let's denote the number of singly-covered cells by ( a ). Each block must cover at least one singly-covered cell, so ( k leq a ).5. Upper Bound on Coverage:   - Each cell can be covered by at most 3 blocks. If a cell were covered by 4 blocks, it would imply that all its neighboring cells are singly-covered, which is not possible in a ( 4 times 4 ) grid.   - Therefore, the maximum number of blocks that can cover a cell is 3.6. Counting Blocks:   - There are ( 16 - a ) cells that are not singly-covered.   - Each of these cells can be covered by at most 3 blocks, so the total number of blocks covering these cells is at most ( 3(16 - a) = 48 - 3a ).7.

The term x^{m-1}y implies that m-1 must be the highest power of x, which is 4 in a fourth-degree polynomial. However, since it's a trinomial and considering the degrees of other terms, we adjust our understanding to match the given condition. The presence of y does not affect the degree in x.2. The term x^{m-3} suggests another power of x, which is related to m.3. The term -nx^{2}y^{m-3} introduces a complexity with both n and m affecting the degree. For the polynomial to remain a trinomial, and given it's fourth-degree in terms of x and y, certain conditions must be met.Given the polynomial must be fourth-degree, and considering the structure of the given polynomial, we deduce:- For x^{m-1}y to be part of a fourth-degree polynomial, and considering it's the term with potentially the highest degree in x, we initially might think m-1 = 4. However, the correct approach, considering the trinomial structure and the degrees of other terms, is to find a balance that satisfies the condition of being a fourth-degree polynomial in total, not just in individual terms.- The term -nx^{2}y^{m-3} must not contribute to increasing the degree of the polynomial beyond four, which implies n=0 to eliminate this term, ensuring the polynomial remains a trinomial.Thus, we solve for m with the understanding that the polynomial's degree in terms of x is influenced by the given terms:[m-1 = 3 implies m = 4]And we have n=0 to maintain the trinomial structure without increasing the degree unnecessarily.Therefore, the values of m and n are:[boxed{m = 4, n = 0}] Part 2: Rearranging the polynomial and its constant termGiven the values of m and n found in part (1), we substitute m=4 and n=0 into the polynomial:[-2 + x^{4-1}y + x^{4-3} - 0 cdot x^{2}y^{4-3}]This simplifies to:[-2 + x^{3}y + x^{1}]Rearranging this polynomial in descending powers of x, we already have it in the correct form:[x^{3}y + x - 2]The constant term in this polynomial, when arranged in descending powers of x, is -2.Thus, the rearranged polynomial is x^{3}y + x - 2, and the constant term is boxed{-2}."},{"problem":"Chantal and Jean start hiking from a trailhead toward a fire tower.

Since frac{T_1}{T_2} = 2pi (an irrational number), they do not match, so f(x) is definitely not a periodic function.(4) The smallest positive period of f(x) = A sin (omega x + varphi) (x in mathbf{R}) is T_1 = frac{2pi}{|omega|}, and the smallest positive period of M is T_2. When frac{T_1}{T_2} = frac{2pi}{|omega T_2|} is a rational number, f(x) = A sin (omega x + varphi) (x in M) is a periodic function, and the least common multiple of T_1 and T_2 is a period of f(x).(III) Graphical MethodFor some functions, the period is not easily discernible and does not meet the conditions for using formulas.

This can simplify to frac{6n^5+n^6}{720}, which can further simplify to frac{n^5(6+n)}{720}. Notice that the prime factorization of 720 is 5cdot3cdot3cdot2cdot2cdot2cdot2. In order for frac{n^5(6+n)}{720} to be an integer, one of the parts must divide 5, 3, and 2. Thus, one of the parts must be a multiple of 5, 3, and 2, and the LCM  of these three numbers is 30.

We need to find the value of (n).3. Let's start by analyzing the given angles and the properties of the quadrilateral:   - Since (angle CAB = 30^circ) and (angle ADB = 30^circ), we can infer that (triangle ABD) and (triangle ABC) share some symmetry.   - Given (angle ABD = 77^circ), we can find (angle DBC) because (angle ABD + angle DBC = 180^circ) (since they are supplementary angles in the quadrilateral).4. Calculate (angle DBC):   [   angle DBC = 180^circ - angle ABD = 180^circ - 77^circ = 103^circ   ]5. Since (BC = CD), (triangle BCD) is isosceles with (angle BCD = n^circ).6. In (triangle BCD), the sum of the internal angles is (180^circ):   [   angle BCD + angle DBC + angle BDC = 180^circ   ]7. Let (angle BDC = angle DBC = x). Since (angle DBC = 103^circ), we have:   [   x + x + n = 180^circ   ]   [   2x + n = 180^circ   ]8. Substitute (x = 103^circ):   [   2(103^circ) + n = 180^circ   ]   [   206^circ + n = 180^circ   ]   [   n = 180^circ - 206^circ   ]   [   n = -26^circ   ]9. Since (n) must be a positive integer, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Let's consider the symmetry and properties of the quadrilateral more carefully.10. Given the symmetry and the angles, we can use the fact that (angle BCD) is influenced by the isosceles property and the given angles. We need to find a consistent value for (n) that fits all conditions.11.

The diagonal of the square can be written as the equation of the line y=x, and therefore the point of intersection of this line with the hypotenuse will be obtained by solving the given equations x=7-frac{7}{3} x Leftrightarrow x=frac{21}{10}.## 8th grade"},{"problem":"5.35 (1) Find the possible minimum value of the polynomial P(x, y)=4+x^{2} y^{4}+x^{4} y^{2}-3 x^{2} y^{2}.(2) Prove that this polynomial cannot be expressed as a sum of squares of polynomials in variables x, y.","solution":"［Solution］（1）By the Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean Inequality, we have1+x^{2} y^{4}+x^{4} y^{2} geqslant 3 x^{2} y^{2}and the equality holds when x=y=1.

Initial guess and verification:   The proposed solution is ( f(x) = pm x ). We will verify that these functions work.   - For ( f(x) = x ):     [     f(a)f(b) + f(b)f(c) + f(c)f(a) = ab + bc + ca     ]     Clearly, ( p mid ab + bc + ca iff p mid ab + bc + ca ), so ( f(x) = x ) works.   - For ( f(x) = -x ):     [     f(a)f(b) + f(b)f(c) + f(c)f(a) = (-a)(-b) + (-b)(-c) + (-c)(-a) = ab + bc + ca     ]     Again, ( p mid ab + bc + ca iff p mid ab + bc + ca ), so ( f(x) = -x ) works.3.

We will show that ( f(-2x) equiv -2f(x) pmod{p} ).   - By setting ( a = b = c ) in the original condition, we get ( p mid f(a)^2 ) iff ( p mid a^2 ).

Condition Analysis:   - For the first condition, if ( x_i equiv x_j pmod{11} ), then ( x_i - x_j equiv 0 pmod{11} ). Therefore, all ( x_i ) must have different remainders modulo 11.   - For the second condition, we need to ensure that the sum of the products of all ( x_i ) except one is divisible by 11.3.

This means they must be congruent to ( 0, 1, 2, ldots, 10 ) modulo 11.   - Without loss of generality, assume ( x_1 equiv 0 pmod{11} ). Then the product ( x_2 x_3 cdots x_{11} ) must be divisible by 11.4. Using Wilson's Theorem:   - Wilson's theorem states that for a prime ( p ), ((p-1)! equiv -1 pmod{p}).   - For ( p = 11 ), we have ( 10! equiv -1 pmod{11} ). This implies ( 10! ) is not divisible by 11.5. Conclusion for ( m = 11 ):   - Since ( 10! equiv -1 pmod{11} ), it is not divisible by 11. Therefore, the condition ( x_2 x_3 cdots x_{11} equiv 0 pmod{11} ) cannot be satisfied.   - Hence, ( m = 11 ) is not possible.6.

The condition for k=1 does not impose a restriction. The same is true for k=9, since the sum of the first nine positive integers is 45, and according to the divisibility rule for 9, any number that meets the conditions is divisible by 9. For brevity, the number formed by the first k digits of the number will be referred to as the k-th slice of the number.The fifth slice is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5. Since we cannot use 0, the fifth digit can only be 5.The even slices, according to the condition, are even numbers, so in the sought number, the even positions are occupied by the four even digits. For k=2, this is already sufficient, but for k=4,6,8, additional conditions are also necessary.It is known that a number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits, and by 8 if the last three digits form a number that is divisible by 4, respectively 8. In the latter case, however, an even number stands in the hundreds place - this is the sixth digit of the sought number - so the eighth slice will be divisible by 8 if and only if the two-digit number formed by the seventh and eighth digits is also divisible by 8.In the sought number, odd numbers stand in the odd positions, so according to the above, a number divisible by 4 cannot stand in the fourth and eighth positions.The third slice is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of the first three digits, and since the sixth digit is even, the sixth slice is divisible by 6 if the sum of the first six digits is divisible by 3. The two conditions are simultaneously satisfied if and only if the sum of both the first and the second three digits is divisible by 3.We have not yet used the condition for divisibility by 7. Based on the above, we distinguish two cases according to which of the two even numbers divisible by 4 stands in the sixth position.Case I. The sixth digit is 8. Then the 4 is in the second position. The fifth digit is 5, so for the sum of the second three digits to be divisible by 3, we must choose the 2 from the 2 and 6 for the fourth position. Then the eighth digit is 6.So in this case, we know the following about our number:.4 .258 .6).Let's examine where the remaining four odd numbers can go! The 4 in the second position gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, and since none of the numbers 1, 3, 7, 9 give a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, an odd number divisible by 3 cannot stand in the first or third position if we want the sum of the first three digits to be divisible by 3.The eighth digit is 6, so for the number formed by the seventh and eighth digits to be divisible by 8, the seventh position must be 9. Then the last digit is 3.So we have two possibilities: 147258963 and 741258963. Now only the condition for k=7 remains, and it can be easily seen that it is not satisfied in either case.Case II. The sixth digit is 4. Then the positions of the even numbers can be determined similarly to Case I, and we arrive at the following result:.8 .654 .2The divisibility by 3 now does not exclude any of the remaining odd numbers from the first or third position, we can only say that one of the two positions must be occupied by a number divisible by 3. The eighth digit is 2, so the eighth slice can be divisible by 8 in two ways, with 3 or 7 in the seventh position. In both cases, we have four possibilities. If the seventh digit is 3, then these are:789654321; 987654321; 189654327; 981654327.It can be easily verified that the seventh slice is not divisible by 7 in any of these cases.If the seventh digit is 7, then the following numbers are obtained:189654723; 981654723; 183654729; 381654729.Here we find a solution: the seventh slice of the last number is also divisible by 7: 3816547=7 cdot 545221.Therefore, there is only one number that satisfies the conditions of the problem, and that is 381654729."},{"problem":"(2013•Shanghai) The domain of the function y=log_{2}(x+2) is.","solution":"To ensure the function is meaningful, we need x+2>0.

Given c=1, we have:1. c^2 = a^2 - b^2 Rightarrow 1 = a^2 - b^2.Since PF_{2} is perpendicular to the x-axis, we can use the point P(1,frac{sqrt{2}}{2}) to find a relationship between a and b:2. frac{b^2}{a} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.Substituting b^2 = a^2 - 1 from (1) into (2) gives:3. frac{a^2 - 1}{a} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.Solving for a:4. sqrt{2}a^2 - a - sqrt{2} = 0.Solving this quadratic equation for a gives a = sqrt{2} and subsequently b = 1.Therefore, the standard equation of the ellipse is:boxed{frac{x^2}{2} + y^2 = 1}.# Part 2: Maximizing the Length of Segment ABGiven the line l: y = x + m intersects the ellipse at points A and B.

What is the smallest total number of fish he could have caught on the three days - Monday, Wednesday, and Friday?","solution":"Answer: 50.Solution. If the old man caught 25 fish each of the first four days and caught nothing on Friday, the conditions of the problem are met, and exactly 50 fish were caught over the specified three days.Let's prove that in the specified days, fewer than 50 fish could not have been caught. Indeed, suppose fewer than 50 fish were caught in these days. Since on Tuesday and Thursday the old man caught no more fish than on Monday and Wednesday, on Tuesday and Thursday fewer than 50 fish were also caught. Thus, in total over the five days, fewer than 100 fish were caught, which contradicts the condition.The estimate (the second part of the solution) can be written algebraically in various ways. Let the old man catch a_{1} geqslant a_{2} geqslant a_{3} geqslant a_{4} geqslant a_{5} fish from Monday to Friday. Then:1) If a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+a_{4}+a_{5}=100, then a_{1}+a_{3}+a_{5}=100-left(a_{2}+a_{4}right) geqslant 100-left(a_{1}+a_{3}right). Therefore, 2 a_{1}+2 a_{3}+a_{5} geqslant 100. Since 2 a_{5} geqslant a_{5}, then a_{1}+a_{3}+a_{5} geqslant 50.2) Since a_{1} geqslant frac{a_{1}+a_{2}}{2}, a_{3} geqslant frac{a_{3}+a_{4}}{2}, a_{5} geqslant frac{a_{5}}{2}, then a_{1}+a_{3}+a_{5} geqslant frac{a_{1}+a_{2}}{2}+frac{a_{3}+a_{4}}{2}+frac{a_{5}}{2}= =frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+a_{4}+a_{5}}{2}=50.## Grading Criteria+ Correct answer and a fully justified solution are provided干 Only the correct answer and an example are providedmp Only the estimate is proven- Only the answer is provided- The problem is not solved or is solved incorrectlyThe jury believes that the plot of the problem should not lead the solver to think that the old man necessarily catches at least one fish each day (and in Pushkin's fairy tale, the old man only pulled out mud).

With side length 2, the area is calculated using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle, which is {S}_{triangle ABC} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 2^2. This simplifies as follows:  [  {S}_{triangle ABC} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times 4 = sqrt{3}  ]  Given overrightarrow{PC} = -(overrightarrow{PA} + overrightarrow{PB}), point P acts as the centroid of triangle ABC. The area of triangle PAB is therefore one-third of the area of triangle ABC, because the centroid divides each median into segments that are two-thirds and one-third of the median's length. Hence,   [  {S_{triangle PAB}} = frac{1}{3}{S_{triangle ABC}} = frac{1}{3} times sqrt{3} = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}  ]  So, the area of triangle PAB is boxed{frac{sqrt{3}}{3}}.- (2) For overrightarrow{PB} cdot overrightarrow{PC} = 0, it implies that vectors overrightarrow{PB} and overrightarrow{PC} are perpendicular. Hence, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:  [  |overrightarrow{PB}|^2 + |overrightarrow{PC}|^2 = |overrightarrow{BC}|^2 = 4  ]  Using the AM-GM inequality, we deduce that:  [  (frac{|overrightarrow{PB}| + |overrightarrow{PC}|}{2})^2 leq frac{|overrightarrow{PB}|^2 + |overrightarrow{PC}|^2}{2} = 2  ]  Therefore, we find  [  |overrightarrow{PB}| + |overrightarrow{PC}| leq sqrt{2}sqrt{|overrightarrow{PB}|^2 + |overrightarrow{PC}|^2} = 2sqrt{2}  ]  The maximum value, 2sqrt{2}, is achieved when |overrightarrow{PB}| = |overrightarrow{PC}| = sqrt{2}.

Define the set and function:   Let ( A = {1, 2, ldots, 100} ) and ( f(k) ) be the size of the largest subset of ( A ) such that no two elements differ by ( k ).2. Property ( P1 ):   In a set containing ( k ) consecutive natural numbers, the difference between any two numbers is less than ( k ).3. Property ( P2 ):   For ( k leq 50 ), in a set ( S = {a, a+1, a+2, ldots, a+2k-1} ) containing ( 2k ) consecutive natural numbers, there exist at most ( k ) numbers such that the difference between any two numbers is different from ( k ). Indeed, at most one of the numbers ( b, b+k in S ) can appear in ( B ), where ( a leq b leq a+k-1 ). Thus, ( |S cap B| leq k ).4. Property ( P3 ):   For ( k geq 51 ), using ( P1 ), we can choose ( {1, 2, ldots, k} subset B ), hence ( f(k) geq |B| geq k geq 51 ). Therefore, ( f(k) = 50 ) can have solutions only for ( k leq 50 ).5. Case 1: ( k mid 50 ):   - There exists ( d in mathbb{N} ) such that ( kd = 50 ).   - Denote ( A_m = {2mk+1, 2mk+2, ldots, (2m+2)k} ) for ( 0 leq m leq d-1 ). We observe that ( A = cup_{m=0}^{d-1} A_m ). Using property ( P2 ), we get ( |A_m cap B| leq k ), which implies ( |A cap B| = |B| leq kd = 50 ).   - Construct ( B = cup_{m=0}^{d-1} B_m = cup_{m=0}^{d-1} {2mk+1, 2mk+2, ldots, (2m+1)k} ).   - In each subset ( {2mk+1, 2mk+2, ldots, (2m+1)k} ), the difference between any two numbers is less than ( k ). For ( p, q ) elements in different subsets ( B_m ), we have ( |p-q| > k ). Thus, ( |B| = kd = 50 ).   - Therefore, the set ( B ) constructed above has the maximum size.   - Hence, all ( k in mathbb{N} ) such that ( k mid 50 ) are solutions of the equation ( f(k) = 50 ).6. Case 2: ( k < 50 ) and ( k nmid 50 ):   - There exist ( d, r in mathbb{N} ) such that ( 1 leq r leq k-1 ) and ( 50 = kd + r ). This implies ( 100 = 2kd + 2r ).   - For ( 0 leq m leq d-1 ), denote ( B_m = {2mk+1, 2mk+2, ldots, (2m+1)k} ).   - Let ( B_d = {2kd+1, 2kd+2, ldots, min(2kd+k, 100)} ).   - The set ( B = cup_{m=0}^{d} B_m ) has ( |B| = min(kd+k, kd+100-2kd) ). Since ( kd+k > kd+r = 50 ) and ( kd+100-2kd = kd+2r > kd+r = 50 ), we have ( f(k) geq |B| > 50 ).   - Therefore, ( k ) is not a solution of ( f(k) = 50 ).7. Conclusion:   The solutions of ( f(k) = 50 ) are the numbers ( k ) such that ( k mid 50 ). Since ( 50 = 2 cdot 5^2 ), ( 50 ) has ( (1+1)(2+1) = 6 ) natural divisors.

First, we will show that we can write the number frac{1}{375} on the board. This can be factored into the product of numbers that are already on the board from the beginning: frac{1}{375} = frac{1}{3} cdot frac{1}{5} cdot frac{1}{5} cdot frac{1}{5}.

To the number frac{1}{375}, we can add another such number, specifically as the product of already written numbers 1 and frac{1}{375}.

Therefore, no matter what allowed operations we perform, we will never get a denominator whose prime factorization includes a prime number that was not in the factorization of any previously written denominator.

For the first condition: 15m + 20n = 4302. For the second condition: 10m + 8n = 212Let's solve these equations step by step:- Multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficient of n the same in both equations, getting 20m + 16n = 424.- Subtract the modified second equation from the first equation: (15m + 20n) - (20m + 16n) = 430 - 424, which simplifies to -5m + 4n = 6.- Multiply the original second equation by -5/2 to get -25m - 20n = -530 and add it to the first equation to eliminate n: -10m = -100.- Solving for m, we get m = 10.- Substitute m = 10 into one of the original equations to find n: 10(10) + 8n = 212, which simplifies to 8n = 112, and thus n = 14.Therefore, the values of m and n are m = 10 and n = 14, respectively.

But F C=2 A B (in a regular hexagon, the main diagonal is twice the side length), from which triangles A O B and F O C are similar with a ratio of 2. Since A B and F C are parallel and angle B A O=angle O C F, the point O lies on the diagonal A C (and, similarly, the point O lies on the diagonal B F).

For the first pair, the function f(x) = sqrt{(x - 1)^2} has a domain of mathbb{R} and its range is [0, +∞) because the square root function ensures non-negative output. Meanwhile, the function g(x) = x - 1 has the same domain of mathbb{R}, but its range is (-infty, +infty) because there are no restrictions on the output. These functions are not the same due to having different ranges.2. For the second pair, f(x) = sqrt{x^2 - 1} has a domain of (-infty, -1] cup [1, +infty), since the expression inside the square root must be non-negative. On the other hand, g(x) = sqrt{x + 1} cdot sqrt{x - 1} requires both x + 1 geq 0 and x - 1 geq 0 to be defined, which results in a domain of [1, +infty). The difference in domains indicates that f(x) and g(x) cannot be the same function.3. For the third pair, f(x) = (sqrt{x - 1})^2 simplifies to f(x) = x - 1 and has a domain of [1, +infty), since we can't take the square root of a negative number. The function g(x) = sqrt{(x - 1)^2} has a domain of mathbb{R} because squaring (x - 1) ensures the expression inside the square root is always non-negative. Despite a simplification that makes f(x) seem similar to g(x), these functions are not identical because of their different domains.4. For the fourth pair, f(x) = sqrt{frac{x^2 - 1}{x + 2}} and g(x) = frac{sqrt{x^2 - 1}}{sqrt{x + 2}} appear different at first glance, but we must consider the domains and the equivalence of the functions more carefully. The domain for both functions excludes values that make the denominators zero (i.e., x neq -2) and values that make the numerators of the square roots negative. Notably, these conditions give both functions the same domain. Since the numerator and denominator inside the square root can be independently square-rooted, the functions simplify to the same expression.

Then the length of l_{0} leqslant MN, and MP = ME triangleq alpha, NP = NF triangleq beta, so AM = frac{1}{2} - alpha, AN = frac{1}{2} - beta, MN = alpha + beta, alpha beta neq 0. In the right triangle triangle AMN, MN^2 = AM^2 + AN^2, i.e., (alpha + beta)^2 = left(frac{1}{2} - alpharight)^2 + left(frac{1}{2} - betaright)^2, so alpha + beta = frac{1}{2} - 2alphabeta frac{1}{2}. Take two squares U, V with areas frac{S}{2} each, since frac{S}{2} > frac{1}{4}, according to the lemma, regardless of how squares U, V are placed inside the unit square T, the center O of T must be a common interior point of U, V. When S leqslant frac{1}{2}, we can prove by analogy with the proof in Example 13 that any finite number of squares with a total area of frac{1}{2} can be placed inside a unit square such that no two small squares have a common interior point. Thus, the maximum value of S is frac{1}{2}."},{"problem":"Two functions of x are differentiable and not identically zero. Find an example of two such functions having the property that the derivative of their quotient is the quotient of their derivatives.","solution":"1. We start with two differentiable functions ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ) defined on an interval ( I subseteq mathbb{R} ), where ( g'(x) neq 0 ) for all ( x in I ). We need to find an example where the derivative of their quotient is equal to the quotient of their derivatives:   [   left( frac{f(x)}{g(x)} right)' = frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}   ]2. Using the quotient rule for differentiation, we have:   [   left( frac{f(x)}{g(x)} right)' = frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2}   ]3. According to the problem, this should be equal to:   [   frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}   ]4. Equating the two expressions, we get:   [   frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2} = frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}   ]5. Cross-multiplying to clear the denominators, we obtain:   [   f'(x)g(x)g'(x) - f(x)[g'(x)]^2 = f'(x)g(x)^2   ]6. Rearranging terms, we get:   [   f'(x)g(x)g'(x) - f'(x)g(x)^2 = f(x)[g'(x)]^2   ]7. Factoring out ( f'(x)g(x) ) on the left-hand side, we have:   [   f'(x)g(x)(g'(x) - g(x)) = f(x)[g'(x)]^2   ]8. Dividing both sides by ( f(x)g(x) ), we get:   [   frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} cdot frac{g'(x)}{g(x)} - left( frac{g'(x)}{g(x)} right)^2 = frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}   ]9. Let ( u(x) = ln(f(x)) ) and ( v(x) = ln(g(x)) ). Then ( u'(x) = frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} ) and ( v'(x) = frac{g'(x)}{g(x)} ). Substituting these into the equation, we get:   [   u'(x) v'(x) - [v'(x)]^2 = u'(x)   ]10. Solving for ( u'(x) ), we have:    [    u'(x) = frac{[v'(x)]^2}{v'(x) - 1}    ]11. To find specific functions ( f(x) ) and ( g(x) ), we choose a continuous function ( v'(x) ) such that ( v'(x) neq 1 ) for all ( x in I ). For simplicity, let ( v'(x) = 2 ). Then:    [    v(x) = int 2 , dx = 2x + C    ]    Without loss of generality, let ( C = 0 ), so ( v(x) = 2x ).12. Then ( g(x) = e^{v(x)} = e^{2x} ).13. Next, we find ( u'(x) ):    [    u'(x) = frac{[v'(x)]^2}{v'(x) - 1} = frac{2^2}{2 - 1} = 4    ]14. Integrating ( u'(x) ), we get:    [    u(x) = int 4 , dx = 4x + D    ]    Again, let ( D = 0 ), so ( u(x) = 4x ).15. Then ( f(x) = e^{u(x)} = e^{4x} ).Thus, the functions ( f(x) = e^{4x} ) and ( g(x) = e^{2x} ) satisfy the given condition.The final answer is ( boxed{ f(x) = e^{4x} } ) and ( g(x) = e^{2x} )."},{"problem":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n}, let S_n denote the sum of its first n terms.

Solving for the common difference d, we obtain d = 2.Now, we can express the n-th term of the sequence as a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d = -11 + 2(n - 1) = 2n - 13.The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by S_n = frac{n(a_1 + a_n)}{2}. Substituting our expressions for a_1 and a_n into this formula, we obtain S_n = frac{n(-11 + 2n - 13)}{2} = n^2 - 12n.To find the minimum value of S_n, we complete the square: S_n = n^2 - 12n + 36 - 36 = (n - 6)^2 - 36.

Start by noting the Law of Cosines for side c: c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2abcos C.Now, equating the two expressions for the area, we get:frac{1}{2}absin C = frac{a^2 + b^2 - 2abcos C}{4}.After a little algebra, the equation simplifies to:2absin C = a^2 + b^2 - 2abcos CRightarrow a^2 + b^2 = 2ab(sin C + cos C).Divide both sides by ab:frac{a^2 + b^2}{ab} = 2(sin C + cos C).The sum inside the parentheses can be rewritten using the Sine of a sum formula:2(sin C + cos C) = 2sqrt{2}sinleft(C + frac{pi}{4}right).Consequently,frac{a}{b} + frac{b}{a} = frac{a^2 + b^2}{ab} = 2sqrt{2}sinleft(C + frac{pi}{4}right).For the maximum value, we look at the range of the sine function which is between -1 and 1. The sine function reaches its maximum value of 1 for angles where the sine is positive and increasing. So sinleft(C + frac{pi}{4}right) reaches its maximum when C + frac{pi}{4} = frac{pi}{2}, i.e., C = frac{pi}{4}.Therefore, the maximum value of frac{a}{b} + frac{b}{a} is:boxed{2sqrt{2}}."},{"problem":"Let S be a subset of {1,2,3,...,50} such that no pair of distinct elements in S has a sum divisible by 7.

Understanding that the perpendicular bisector of a chord in a circle must pass through the center of the circle is key to solving this problem. Since circle (C) passes through points (A) and (B), (AB) is a chord of circle (C). To find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of segment (AB), we use the midpoint coordinate formula to find the midpoint of segment (AB), and based on the slope of line (AB), we use the product of the slopes of two perpendicular lines being (-1) to find the slope of the perpendicular bisector of segment (AB). With the coordinates of the midpoint and the slope, we can write the equation of the perpendicular bisector of segment (AB). By solving the system of equations formed with line (l), we can determine the coordinates of the center (C) of the circle. Then, using the distance formula between two points to find the length of (|AC|), which is the radius of circle (C), we can write the standard equation of circle (C).SolutionGiven (A(0,-6)) and (B(1,-5)),  the slope of line (AB) is ( dfrac{-6+5}{0-1}=1), thus the slope of the perpendicular line to (AB) is (-1),  and the midpoint of (A) and (B) is (( dfrac{0+1}{2}, dfrac{-6-5}{2})), which is (( dfrac{1}{2}, -dfrac{11}{2})),  therefore, the equation of the perpendicular line to (AB) is (y+ dfrac{11}{2}=-(x- dfrac{1}{2})), or (x+y+5=0),  solving this together with the equation of line (l) gives ( begin{cases}x+y+5=0  x-y+1=0end{cases}), which results in ( begin{cases}x=-3  y=-2end{cases}), meaning the coordinates of the center (C) are ((-3,-2)),  the radius (r=|AC|= sqrt{3^{2}+(-4)^{2}}=5),  thus, the standard equation of circle (C) is: ((x+3)^{2}+(y+2)^{2}=25).
