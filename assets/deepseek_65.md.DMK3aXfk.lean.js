During this period, I have gained weight from 50 Kgs to 75 Kgs. Currently I am 70 Kg. Over the past 2 years, I got severe knee pain as well as in the heel (both legs) Also, I am getting tired sooner and pain persist in my hands as well. Doctor advised me to take RA test and it was well within the limits. I have tried different medication but no use so far. Recently my doctor advised me to take Vitamin D and Vitamin B12 test and the results as below: Vitamin B12 - 246 pg/ml 25-OH Vitamin D - 21.49 ng/ml Doctor advised me to take DV 60 K (one dose per week for 8 weeks) and Renerve plus (1 tablet per day for 8 weeks). I am 33 and pure vegetarian. I got mild psoriasis in my legs and fingers.. (not even visible for others) OCD since I was 7 but got diagonised only when I was 25. No physical activity (walking, cycling) in the past few years especially after taking the medication for OCD.","Doctor":"HiThank you for asking HCM.I have gone through your query. For OCD you should get a proper counselling by psychologist. Medications are added if counselling alone not helping. A proper follow up should be taken also. Low vitamin D can give skin problems like psoriasis. Get sunlight exposure when intensity of sunlight is low, like in the evening time. You can also take D3 supplements with the advise of your doctor. Decreasing of physical activity is not a good thing. It can decrease your strength. Have a regular exercise. Jogging or brisk walking is good. Absence of physical activity can also weaken and cause quadriceps atrophy and can results in knee pain. Quadriceps strengthening exercise will be helpful in such case also.Hope this may help you. Let me know if anything not clear.Thanks."},{"Patient":"For about a week and a half now my right side of my jaw has been hurting. It s painful to to open my mouth wide, and chew heavy food.

Excuse my Énglish i am French .Thank you!","Doctor":"Dear Grandparent.I understand your concern about amputation. I will explain the line of treatment first. Since Synovial sarcoma is an aggressive malignant tumour the current line of treatment is surgery. The type of surgery -that is how far should we operate depends on the site or location of the tumour. As you have mentioned behind the knee, this means that the popliteal fossa is involved. Synovial sarcomas in such locations spread rapidly through the blood and lymph channels to the lungs. Therefore depending on the location most oncosurgeons prefer amputation in order to save the life of the patient. Please remember that synovial sarcoma is very aggressive, grows and spreads fast . I do not have the biopsy report of your grandchild but from the description you have given I presume that after the first operation, the pathological report and surgical findings may how shown involvement of the popliteal fossa and fascial planes. You may request another specialist opinion if you wish but please do not delay the operation. You may also post the details of the histopathology report for further assistance and guidance. You may also refer websites such as Merck for patients or WebMD which explains further details of this disease in simple English. You may use google translate to convert such explanations into French Best regards"},{"Patient":"I accidentally nicked the side of my toe while doing my own pedicure yesterday.

I saw my Gyn in August 2011 for this and he said it was an infected Iud. Took lots of antibiotics for it and nothing. So got the IUD removed. Got pregnant and had a miscartiage Dec 20,2011. And im having the pains again. It hurst more when i do alot of walking or siting. What can this be?","Doctor":"Hi ! Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.With the history of infected IUD, and a miscarriage, and long term treatment for the PID (pelvic inflammatory disease), there is a possibility of your pelvic organs getting adhered either to each other or surrounding structures, and this adhesion might be responsible for the pain. Usually it is seen that in chronic PID is very difficult to eradicate completely, and the pain  could radiate to the back and lower limbs. If I were your doctor, I would advise you for a urine routine and microscopic test followed by a culture and sensitivity test of both the urine and vaginal swab to be sure of the best possible antibiotic effective against the chronic infection. If you are sexually active, you have to take appropriate precautions so that you do not get or spread the infection on either side. An ultrasound of the abdomen would be helpful in such cases, and if need be a diagnostic laparoscopy might be advised by your gynaecologist in case of intractable pain disturbing your routine activity.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery.

If less than 120/80 she has dizziness and vertigo, has short term memory loss, issues with constipation, fatigue, is a carrier of CF but doesn t have the illness. Person was overdosed on Dimenhydrinat when she was 11 years old, which after that noticed a drastic decline in her short term memory. Also was diagnosed with a whiplash at the age of 16 as well as 19 (both car accidents) Below is the report from the MRI findings: TECHNIQUE Multiplanar, multisequence MR imaging of the brain with and without gadolinium. 15 cc Omniscan administered intravenously. FINDINGS There is no intracranial mass, cerebral edema, hemorrhage, or abnormal extra-axial fluid collection identified. There is no acute ischemia. There is no focal cortical encephalomalacia. After gadolinium administration, there is no abnormal enhancement of the brain parenchyma or meninges. There are at least two punctate foci of signal abnormality in the periventricular white matter, located in the deep right parietal lobe, with no associated enhancement or restricted diffusion. These findings are nonspecific, with broad differential diagnosis which includes but is not limited to vasculitis, a demyelinating process such as multiple sclerosis, migraine headaches, toxic exposure, infectious/inflammatory etiologies, hypertension, and chronic microvascular ischemic disease. Findings must be interpreted in the context of clinical and historic information, with followup imaging when and if clinically indicated. If and when a followup MRI is obtained, it should include a sagittal inversion recovery sequence for most sensitive evaluation of the white matter. There is no focal cortical encephalomalacia. No brainstem lesions are seen. The ventricles are normal in size and configuration. There is no Chiari malformation. There is no sellar or parasellar mass identified. There is no cerebellopontine angle mass. There is no sinus disease or mastoid effusion. The orbital contents are unremarkable. Flow is demonstrated in the vertebrobasilar and carotid arterial systems. IMPRESSION 1. Nonspecific small focal signal abnormalities in the right parietal periventricular white matter, with differential diagnosis including but not limited to vasculitis, a demyelinating process such as multiple sclerosis, migraine headaches, toxic exposure, infectious/inflammatory etiologies, hypertension, and chronic microvascular ischemic disease. In a patient of this age, migraine headaches, vasculitis, and a demyelinating process such as multiple sclerosis would be the primary considerations. Findings must be interpreted in the context of clinical and historic information, with followup imaging when and if clinically indicated. Future followup studies should include a sagittal inversion recovery sequence. 2. No intracranial mass, acute ischemia, enhancing neoplasm, sinus disease, or mastoid effusion.","Doctor":"helloAs the report suggests full history and clinical findings have to co-relate radiological and scan findings by a neuro specialist, there cannot be evaluation based on reports alone as many suggestive findings are there , and often particular disease  findings overlap with other diseases too when not present, hence symptomatology, clinical evaluation, neurological detail examination and history will define the nature of disease, treatment may be done accordingly, please do not worry to get evaluation by correspondence only which may not give correct assessment based advise.thanks"},{"Patient":"One of my family member had an appendix surgery last night, and we just discharged from the hospital this afternoon.

The impact was on my proximal tibia. The area is bruised, with a lump and it feels numb and it hurts if i apply pressure to it. I can walk without any pain, but if i keep my leg straight or bent for some time the area throbs. Also when i first had the fall it felt as though i had badly grazed it but there is no graze at all. The fall happened a week ago. Could this be a fracture?","Doctor":"Hi there , thanks for your question at HCM.The swelling, bruise and the pain will reduce gradually over 7 to 10 days. Rest, Ice and bandage application with limb elevation on two pillows accelerates the process of healing over first 2 to 3 days.I would ask you to follow these four things. However by third day you should experience considerable pain relief and should be able to walk with mild pain.Since you are already able to walk, any major injury/ fracture can be ruled out. Pain after bending for some time and after prolonged extension of knee , can suggests internal derangement of soft tissue structures inside your knee. This can cause pain on movements like bending, squating, geting up from a chair, twisting movements associated with going up and down stairs.In more severe forms it can be associated wity stiffness of knee wity inability to bend fully, giving way or popping sensation and more severe pain.If you cannot manage your daily routine without pain, it will be prudent to meet a sport physician and let her/him evaluate your knee. Also pain while going up and down the stairs can suggest some injury to associated ligaments of the knee. Hope this helps.

Thanks for your question at HCM.Rest, Analgesics, Ice and bandage application usually help relieve the pain and swelling associated with ankle injuries.However if the pain still persists 48 hours after injury, which gets aggravated on standing or walking, it needs further evaluation. I would suggest you to be seen by a physician in person since your pain still persists. Based on the examination an X ray may be required to rule out fractures.

It was a sudden impact type of injury but it was never swollen just very sore and it still hurts and I can not straighten my leg fully. It is just unstable sometimes and I can t jump. Do you think there is something serious wrong?","Doctor":"Hi there . Thanks for your question at HCM.It is possible that your symptoms are caused by a mild meniscal tear. Meniscus is a disc like cushion between the two articulating surfaces of your knee joint. Two menisci in each knee work as shock absorbers during bending and twisting movements of your knee. When it is injured this shock absorbing function is lost and it can get caught or squeezed between the articulating surfaces. This can cause pain on movements like bending, squating, geting up from a chair, twisting movements associated with going up and down stairs.In more severe forms it can be associated wity stiffness of knee wity inability to bend fully, giving way or popping sensation and more severe pain.If you cannot manage your daily routine without pain, it will be prudent to meet a sport physician and let her/him evaluate your knee.

Thanks for your question at HCM.With the history of injury and swollen painful knee( as in your case), an examination by a doctor and an x ray will be needed if:1. You are not able to walk on your affected knee( not able to take any steps without pain). 2. you are not able to bend and straighten your knee to the fullest extent( or your previous normal range of motion). 3. There are any areas of your knee which are very tender to touch( after you feel all the spots of your knee- all around). 4. If you are elderly , say more than 55 years (your chances of major injury increase with age). In the mean time- rest , ice application, elevetion of the affected leg and pain killer medicines can give you some relief.(maximum relief in initial 48 hours)Hope this helps. All the best. Regards.

Rest, Ice and bandage application with limb elevation on two pillows accelerates the process of healing over fort 2 to 3 days.I would ask you to follow these four things.

Pain restricted to neck only and which is not shooting down the arms is suggestive of pain arising from the muscles, joints, bones or disc.Pain arising from the nerves usually shoots down the arm into fingers and associated with numbness.  Physiotherapy usually takes 2 to 4 weeks, to show any kind of meaningful relief . Analgesics medications in tablet form or local applications can increase the amount of relief. Posture modification is one of the things which can add to the benefits of physio and medications.If you are working on a computer, there are several posture related adjustments, which can help you to fasten your recovery and help you maintain your cervical spine strength over time .Ergonomics is the field of science which deals with such adjustments. I would suggest you to go through websites which deal with ergonomics for working on a computer and adopt those postures. Apart from this, you should avoid sitting or standing in the same posture for more than 20 to 30 minus at a stretch, avoid looking into or playing on your phone for more than 2 to 3 minutes. These minor modifications can help you maintain good cervical spine postures If the pain persists for a over 6 weeks, I would suggest her to visit an Orthopaedic, so that at least a baseline X ray and thorough examination can be done . Based on these and her response to medicines and physiotherapy, she might require an MRI. But neck pain usually resolves with medicines, rest and physiotherapy in majority of patients suffering from the same.Also need to see your physician for swollen sensation on left side of your thyroid.

Today though any solid food I swallow especially bread causes what feels like a muscle spasm and pain in that area only what do you think it may be?","Doctor":"Hi there, Thanks for your question at HCM. It is most likely muscle spasm. Ice pack application and gel application( analgesic gels) with rest can help relieve the spasm over initial 24 to 48 hours. If your neck hurts when you bend forwards, you should not use a pillow while sleeping. However you should consider and get evaluated for a pinched nerve if: 1.You have numbness of tingling sensation in your arms or fingers. 3. Any pain which is radiating along your arm downwards.( like sciatica pain in the legs) 3. Any muscle in your limb feels weak. 4. The pain does not subside in first 5 to 7 days after medicines and rest.Hope this helps. All the best.

Thanks for your question at HCM . Pain at the base of Spine is literally a pain for both treating physician and patient.It is known to come back again and again if rest and care is ignored initially. One of the most helpful ways to reduce pain is to use coccyx cushion which is horse shoe shaped and helps relive pressure on tail bone when seated. Make sure it is used every time u sit irrespective of the social situation.I suggest you to use it religiously irrespective of where you are sitting over at least 6 weeks to get any meaningful benefit from it. Also lying down on the sides can help reduce the pressure.Injections help when pain cycle is on the peak, otherwise pain killer medicines should help.Tail bone pain responds best to offloading the pressure over it. Relieving the pressure over the tail bone is the most important step in relieving your pain. You can use any pain killer over initial few days.  Hope this helps.

Last Sunday I had a frightening pain that was between my shoulder blades that lasted approximately 5 minutes. I went to Urgent Care where they did an ECG which they said was slightly abnormal. They transported me to ER where another ECG was done that was slightly abnormal. Cardiac Enzyme testing came back negative and then 4 hours later they did another one which was negative. They referred me to a cardiologist who I saw the next day. They scheduled me for a nuclear stress test and an echocardiogram. I went back for results and I only saw teh Physicians Assistant. She told me the ECG on the stress portion showed a mild old septal wall MI in my past ?? The echocardiogram said I had mild left ventricular hypertrophy with GRADE 1 (relaxation abnormality) diastolic dysfunction. I had some trace tricuspid and mitral regurgitation. I decided to get a second opinion because they wanted to do another test. The new cardiologist stated that he did not think I had a heart attack and only wanted to put me on a Beta Blocker. I m not sure who to believe. Also, I was uncertain as to another thing, on the Nuclear Stress Test it said I had an effusion fraction of 92% and on the echocardiogram it said it had visually a EF of 65%, which one of these is correct. If it is 92% it should be concerning, right? I do not know if I should go to another cardiologist and see what they think or which one to trust.","Doctor":"helloOld MI  may have been missed as often silent heart attacks are there, your current doctor rightly tells you that  at present there is no new heart attack only left ventricular enlargement which may be due to high BP.Diastolic dysfunction is not that risky as a systolic dysfunction and surely your cardiologist know well,.Your EF is normal at 65% means ventricular contraction power is good, so nothing to worry. Nuclear test showing effusion fraction 92% may not be worrying your doctor as may well be within normal confines.Trust the senior cardiologist who has seen you and follow his advice for treatment.Normal cardiac enzymes also rule out new heart attack. Dont worry.

I dont have a history of any kind of stomache problems. Help!","Doctor":"Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.The first advice from me to you is to stop eating from outside completely if you do specially the fried, oily and fast food. This might be causing recurrent intestinal infection because of poor cooking hygiene. Apart from the hygiene, some food components specially in the fast food from outside may induce sensitivity to the intestinal mucosa, leading to all your symptoms which you just described. This sensitivity could be due to anything like a lactose sensitivity, and gluten sensitivity, the incidence of these disorders being under estimated in most of the places.Once intestinal infection is excluded, sensitivity to a particular component of the food can be diagnosed by gradual exclusion of that particular component from your diet. This can be well controlled by a qualified dietician and the moment that particular component is excluded, the person start feeling far better.Thus the treatment varies from one to the other. There has to be a high index of suspicion of these not very uncommon pathology.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery.

A process of trial and error is often necessary to find the right combination of treatments which might include rest, physical therapy, analgesics in oral and topical form, modality based physiotherapy like TENS,Micro wave diathermy etc. Medicines like Pregabalin(LYrica) or Gabapentin or Neurobion prescribed in appropriate doses can help in relieving tingling, You can meet your pain doctor and ask regarding the need and suitability of these medicines for you Earlier surgery will be indicated if  there is progressive major weakness( that is weakness which increases markedly over 1 or 2 days) in the legs due to nerve root pinching. Rarely immediate surgical intervention may also be required in cauda equina syndrome, which is usually marked by progressive weakness in the legs and/or sudden bowel or bladder dysfunction. Otherwise a wait and watch approach is best. It is also important to note that central disc herniation associated with predominant back pain and insignificant leg pain will not respond  well to epidurals, whereas one associated with significant leg symptoms and some back pain responds better. Also if the onset of back pain and central disc herniation was associated with traumatic event, it will be prudent to do a CT scan of your spine , since it is seen that in younger individuals with traumatic central disc herniation minute fractures can be seen in bony end plates adjacent to the disc herniation. This will help understand your tingling sensations better( if traumatic)Hope this helps All the best Regards Dr.SBK"},{"Patient":"I have a very painful right knee because of a Baker s Cyst which developed in September 2013.

Thanks for your question at HCM.X- ray is indicated if 1. You are not able to walk on your affected knee( not able to take any steps without pain). 2. you are not able to bend and straighten your knee to the fullest extent( or your previous normal range of motion). 3. There are any areas of your knee which are very tender to touch( after you feel all the spots of your knee- all around). 4. If you are elderly , say more than 55 years (your chances of major injury increase with age). MRI of the knee may be useful in you case if at all to evaluate specific clinical scenarios like 1. Prolonged, refractory, or unexplained knee pain for more than 6 weeks 2. Mechanical knee symptoms: catching, locking, snapping, crepitus3. Tibiofemoral and/or patellofemoral instability: chronic, recurrent, subacute- associated with difficulty in climbing or getting down stairs etc 4. Swelling with Limited or painful range of motion Since you can walk and bend ok , major ligamentous injury inside your knee is unlikely . Pain on kneeling with tenderness to touch indicate direct trauma at the site of injury which can be seen on x ray. If pain does not subside in 6 weeks , MRI may be indicated.

Would that be a neurosurgeon or what kind of doctor would be the best for that? He has been dealing with this problem for years, and does not like the idea of taking pain pills so much. He has a job where he needs a clear head and doesn t want to be on medication so much. Thank youBecki Turner","Doctor":"Hi there, thanks for your question at HCMFor most spinal problems both specially trained orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons may be considered. In both specialties, the surgeons may sub specialize in pediatrics, cervical spine, lumbar spine etc. So it is advisable to do research on the training of your doctor before your first visit, to choose better. Degenerative disc disease is usually associated with low back pain symptoms that flare up periodically, but don't get worse over time( can stabilize to a plateau after a few years if not associated with instability or nerve compression). The main goals for managing such lower back pain are : 1. Adequate pain relief so as to be able to engage in exercises and rehabilitation program for back- can be achieved through analgesics and  physiotherapy which might include ultrasound massage, short wave diathermy , heat therapy. Also core stabilization and back strengthening exercises will help support his back in the long run.2. Avoid excess stress on the disc through proper ergonomics and posture. I would suggest you to go through websites on ergonomics. Ergonomics is branch of science which deals with posture adjustments according your livelihood. It will help you choose a posture most suited for his daily routine.   Most commonly Low back ache can be attributed to bad posture or muscle pull/ strain due to abnormal stress on back like sudden twisting movements or lifting weights etc. Pain restricted to neck only and which is not shooting down the arms is suggestive of pain arising from the muscles, joints, bones or disc.Pain arising from the nerves usually shoots down the arm into fingers and associated with numbness. Analgesics either taken orally as tablets or as local applications in the form gel or lotions have soothening effect and relive pain most of the times. Ice gel application can help during the initial few days. If the pain still persists after medications for a week physiotherapy under prescription in the form of back strengthening exercises, ultrasonic massage can help. If the pain persists for a over 6 weeks, I would suggest him to visit an Orthopaedic/ neurosurgeon, so that at least a baseline X ray and thorough examination can be done . Based on these and her response to medicines and physiotherapy, he might require an MRI. But back pain usually resolves with medicines, rest and physiotherapy in majority of patients suffering from the same.Hope this helps. All the best.

While observing a youtube video, also saw overlapping toes deformity bilaterally on child. Child was undernourished and very small for age. Not familiar with this birth defect. Surgery was off the table at that time. What are possible treatments?","Doctor":"the most common reason for toes to be deformed at a young age is a tendon imbalance between the flexors and extensors of the foot. for example, having a high arch or a cavus type foot, leads to the extensor tendons bowstringing and hammertoe formation. Using a custom orthotic from a foot and ankle specialist may help balance deforming forces. others have advocated taping the toes in an improved position but I never tape children's toes as it potentially can strangulate the toes and cause gangrene. with a certain type of flatfoot, the fourth and fifth toes turn inward due to imbalance of intrinsic tendons of the foot. although these may be cosmetically unappealing I would never consider surgery until all growth plates close after around 18 years of age, and usually don't ever cause negative symptoms"},{"Patient":"My mother had a knee replacement in 1998.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query. It is possible that few drinks every night might have caused inflammation of the gastro-duodenal mucosa causing gastritis/duodenitis giving rise to the severe stomach pain and cramping. Also it could have been due to some kind of food poisoning as you must be eating outside during your holidays. If I were your doctor, I would first discourage your alcohol intake at least till you become ok, and also prescribe a proton pump inhibitor, a prokinetic drug, and a probiotic.This should relieve you of your symptoms.I would also like to know if you are married or are sexually active. In that case I would also advise you for a serum HCG, and an ultrasound to rule out any chance of a pregnancy.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery.

On a scale of 1 - 10, the pain associated with the sound was about a 6. Each time I stretched my leg it repeated. As the day went on I was almost unable to walk as I could hardly bend that knee or straighten out my leg. I took two Aleve and got some relief. Also put on a substantial knee brace which only kept the popping from being too severe. Again, this is not in the knee itself but seems to be in the ligaments behind the knee. What should I do?","Doctor":"You symptoms suggest a meniscal tear.you need to see an orthopaedic surgeon who would do an MRI to confirm diagnosis. Based on the grading and location of tear it can be treated conservatively or by surgery!"},{"Patient":"My fourth toe on my right foot has been numb for 3 days.

The pain feels like numerous pins sticking me. Cause?","Doctor":"this needs a vascular surgeon to evaluate and treat. it seems like you may have peripheral vascular disease affecting your arteries-the arteries bring blood flow from heart to extremities- when you lay down, your legs elevate from the dependent position and the bloodflow slows to your extremities. at the end of the day your leg may swell from venous insufficiency and that may further compress the arteries."},{"Patient":"Area effected is one toe only. Began with itchy area at cuticle on big toe. Sm blister followed a few days after itchy onset. Now have blister on side of toe. Not really itchy. I say blisters, but none have popped and present fluid. Has not spread to any other toe or hands for that matter secondary to scratching (have washed hands after scratching...FYI). Considered contact dermatitis, but very odd that only single toe on single foot has presented. Have taken benedryl, applied cortisone, anti-fungal, and anti-bacterial to no improvement at all. This has been going on for approx 1 month. Any suggestions? Also, no swelling, pain or redness associated.","Doctor":"this needs to be seen physically by a foot and ankle specialist as there are too many differential diagnosis that can be made from your description. what you describe most commonly can be as benign as vesicular tinea pedis, a callus, a wart among others or rarely it can be something more dangerous. Oral medicine may be of benefit in cases that topical did not respond."},{"Patient":"i have been having a sensation in my foot and lower leg that started few weeks ago. it started in my foot near my ankle and felt like the blood pulsing. now i feel that same feeling in my lower leg its almost like a fluttering,pulse. no pain no swelling. also occasional sensations of heat in that leg","Doctor":"I would suggest being seen by a vascular surgeon. the first thing that needs to be ruled out is a deep vein thrombosis- which is a clot- though from your description seems unlikely as there is no pain or swelling. If vascular etiologies are ruled out, then consider tarsal tunnel syndrome which often can mimic vascular sensations by affecting the nerve.

Being genetically determined doesn't mean one cannot do anything about it.So my recommendation is to start an exercise programme and meticulously follow it. It's a slow step in developing the body to desired shape and the most fruitful one. For exercising different group of lower limb muscle either start at home work out or join a gym.Exercise will not only help your lower torso but also help in shaping upper body and will redistribute fat.Healthy foods- Dietary intake is of utmost importance since fast foods can lead to central or abdominal fat deposition which may further hamper your state. Intake of proteins is desired by the body during strengthening to build up new tissues.Be confident of yourself and carry yourself with attitude. It's something that matters most and above all. don't judge yourself by the eyes of others.Try out these above tips and forget what the world thinks about you.

First it is due to vitamin b 12 deficiency. Other cause is lack of calcium. So get your B12 and calcium test. if there is lack of vitamin D and B 12 then you need to start taking methylcobal one daily and tablet Pregabalin m one daily.

I was surprise that my chiropractors (several) and my physical medicine doctor could not see it and diagnosed it until I went looking for a second opinion yesterday with a new doctor. The reason I saw him is to find out if he could treat me with the lower pain back that had become chronic, regardless sessions over sessions of chiropractic and physical therapy . could you please let me know the cause of my calcification? the treatment? or any way to stop the progress of it? I jumped to the conclusion that I had pain caused by this calcification. What is your opinion?","Doctor":"Hi welcome to HCMI have gone thru your query regarding calcium deposits in your tailbone .Dear you have not mentioned your age which can help determine the right diagnosis and treatment .Why your doctor and Chiro could not read the MRI film  because it is a field of a specialist . So advance forward to know the cause, remove and  solve the problem . A hormonal disorder causes calcium from the bones to move into the blood stream .A variety of calcium buildup is harmless and may be considered a normal part of aging. However, calcification can disrupt organ function and affect blood vessels.Longstanding kidney failure and excessive intake of vitamin D, which results in excessive absorption of calcium from the intestines, can also lead to this type of calcification .According to the specialists , about 99 percent of calcium in the body is transported to teeth and bones. The remaining 1 percent is in the blood, muscles, fluid outside the cells, and other body tissues. This 1 percent can add up and cause problems over time . For your info , our faulty food habits and derailed life style also  is responsible for low immunity and  cause of sufferings .I would like  to suggest you to modify your life style and food habits . Include essential nutrient and antioxidants  in proper proportion according to a qualified dietitian  and regular exercise , walk , yoga - Bhujangasan Ushtrasan ,Back beding postures  ,Pranayam- Deep Breathing exercises - Inhale deep - Hold 2sec - Exhale deep- Hold 2 sec .Kapalbhati , Agnisaar , Anulom Vilom are also life giver postures  to be done under a qualified trainer .A spoon of turmeric powder in a cup of hot cow's  milk is good  to alley pain and inflammation also  Homeopathic  Arnica 30 /thrice / in half cup of water/ for 2-3 days day very effective in pains .Only a doctor can determine whether your if  case warrants any other . treatment.Hope this helps solve your query .Don't hesitate to get back if have any other doubt ."},{"Patient":"I am a 37 year old man and I got hit by a lacrosse shot two weeks ago tomorrow.

I have also had diarrhea off and on for a few weeks now.","Doctor":"Hi ! Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.As regards your diarrhea is concerned, I would advise you not to eat from outside if you do, as most of the intestinal infections come from food and water which are prepared and kept in unhygienic conditions unlike at home. If I were your doctor, I would advise you for a routine stool test for ova and cyst, and give appropriate antibiotics if need be to cure the intestinal infection.The pain in the lower abdomen could also be part of the symptoms of intestinal infection and not necessarily due to the ovaries. I do not know why the thought of ovaries came to your mind. However, to clear your doubts and to have peace of mind, you can go for an abdominal ultrasound if need be after getting assessed by a gynaecologist.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Good monring. I am Dr Shaeef answering your query. A pain of the intensity you have described on the right side upper abdomen and under the ribs could be due some pathological process in the hepatobiliary system.If I were your doctor,after a clinical examination I would advise you for an ultrasound of abdomen to rule out a gallstone cholecystitis, or an inflammation in the liver. Further management would depend on the clinical findings, and reports of the investigations.As your pain is high in intensity, I would suggest you to go the ER of the nearest hospital to get assessed and proper immediate management of your pain. Any elective procedure could be done after you get through your insurance papers and depends on your doctor's advice as well.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

They are mostly unilateral on my left side but some pains are also on my right. Started out with single symptoms that were far apart like chest pain(mostly musclskeletol), headaches, numbing left arm, stiff left neck, numb painful left leg, burning hip pain, painful ribs(left) and back between the the shoulder blades, nausea. These symptoms continued and became more frequent to the point of almost daily. Also seem to get attacks/flares/episodes that seem to be aggravated by most foods and afternoon naps or extreme stress. I can only eat fruits, fruit juices, cottage cheese and flaxseed oil with symptoms of attacks. Anything else... literally anything else would give me the initial sensation of a attack. Description and pattern of Attacks: They start with a slight floaty, woozy, and slowed down reaction that gradually increase. If i continue to eat or keep up the activity that aggravates it. It will go full blown to the point it renders me immobile because of super muscle weakness(body and limbs feel like lead) and fatigue that causes you not to be able to function mentally and physical sometimes with nausea. This full blown attack can last anywhere from an hour to 6 hours. Once the attacks wears off it is simutaneously replaced with chest, ribs, back, hip and head aches and pains. Testing and Imaging scans: -MRI of the head with and without contrast(2 weeks ago) -Neck MRI of cervical neck without contrast(3 weeks ago) -Chest and Lumbar spine X-rays (3 months ago) -CT scan of abdominal (6 months ago) -Multiple blood work all coming back good Only thing that was abnormal was POSITIVE ANAs which most of my doctors don t think is a problem. Lumps: I have also recently within the last month discovered a Hard Bony Rock Lump on my lower left rib. The very lowest part of the rib nearest my left hip. It is connected to my rib and immovable and is currently size of large peach pit and over the last month it has noticiably grown about 10 percent in size. It never bothered me until i found it and as i prodded it start to give a dull ache. Not it is a constant pressure and ache at the lump. It seems like I have one on the exact same location on the right rib but it is mobile and movable but not as hard but seems to aches very rarely and also has slightly grown! I have been managing my attacks by only eating Juices, fruits and cottage cheese and some bodyaches diminished from accupunture. But the only pains that are constant and seems to get worse are the lump on the lower left rib(dull aching pressure) and left hip(burning nagging pain) that has caused my buttocks to be numb. Help! I was told if it was bone cancer that my calcium and alkaline phostatase would be elevated and also if it was luekemia or a blood cancer it would show up in my extensive blood test. I have a appointment with rheumatologist soon and am requesting a bone scan. Do you have any idea what this could be! Should the the lower rib lumps be a concern? The lump is smooth and round and there is always a dullache that increases if i push or press on it. Stretching or movement that are quick in the are causes the aches to increase. I am very weak and need help with daily normal activities. What could this be and what direction or next step should I take to help diagnose this?","Doctor":"I would like to examine you in detail & investigate.There seem to be an element of periphral neuropathy which could be associated with with diabetes or any other metabolic disorder.Endocrinal  disorders like hypoadrenalism should also be kept in mind.A biopsy from the lump could clinch the diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hi doc.

No. I don't assume the pain abdomen is related to the disc herniation. If I were your doctor, I would rather advise you for a routine stool test for ova and cyst, and an ultrasound abdomen to rule out any significant intra-abdominal pathology. Also I would advise you not to eat from outside if you do, and to add more of roughage and liquids in your routine diet. Depending on your age, if all investigations are inconclusive, I would not hesitate to advise you for an endoscopic evaluation of your gut by a gastroenterologist if your symptoms persist or increase in intensity. Till that you can go for some over the counter anti spasmodic drug for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.There has to be a source of infection to get persistent fever, and in your case, with the history you have narrated of evening rise of temperature specially with a known history of diabetes, the most likely source looks to be a urinary tract infection which could also give rise to both your lower back and abdominal pain.If I were your doctor, I would advise you to monitor your blood sugar level very closely, go for a urine routine/microscopic/culture and sensitivity test so that appropriate antibiotic could be instituted if need be, and possibly an ultrasound abdomen. I would also advise you for a fever profile like a CBC, ESR, Typhi dot, and blood for MP, with a peripheral smear as well. The management in your case would depend on the results of a physical examination and reports of the related investigations.

I did some internet research on the male pelvic area, and I m guessing its around the publis. I m an active gym goer and worked out last week without notice of any injury to anything. This just came on slightly. I m very mobile without pain, but do notice when I stand and place my fingers inside that area and push hard and feel the soreness. I have no leg pain either. However, my uper and lower back were extremely sore after a workout this past sunday. I saw my very knowledgeable and trusted massagne therapist last night and he a very thorough massage just on my back and feel much better today, a bit sore but getting better. He mentioned that he does advance massage on the male pelvic floor so considering that. I m just perplexed that it s just a small isolated area that sore only when I push fard against the public bone and not other issues in that area?

I have a heart condition. Since last 2 days iam having stomach pains and fever. I havent been able to go doctors but was concerned whether this may be related to my heart condition. Please advise me on this and the best medicine to take.","Doctor":"Hi Nashat ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. Even though heart problem could also mimic as a gases or acidity in the upper abdomen (epigastric region), we can not conclude on it without related investigations and a physical examination by your treating doctor. The fever with stomach pain points more to an infective origin like a food poisoning if you had any food from outside recently. I would also advise for an ultrasound of abdomen to rule any chances of a cholecystitis/cilelithiasis for the pain and fever. Till the reports of clinical examination and investigation reports are ready, you can take some proton pump inhibitor, a probiotic, and an antispasmodic drug. Further management would depend on the results of investigations and physical examination.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery.

The ankels are so swollen that they have become thick folds of skin like tires, my feet and toes and ankels prior to this were very nice looking. I am overweight (morbidly obese) but I was also very over weight priort to this. I have on the front of my calves a purple/red/dull red areas now with pimple like extrusions? and sometimes the skin seems to weep. I am taking water pills prescribed by my GP who seems indifferent to anything else this could be. My left arch (I have high arches) is very painful and when I found out I have osteo arthritis, which had progressed to being without any cartilege when x-rays were taken and naturally it also makes walking painful. While I am so over weight I gained even more when my husband first suffered a concussion which took three years and in 2012 he had pancreatic cancer and died in September of that year. I have now lost 70 pounds, eat sensibly most of the time, drink a good 8 glasses of water daily, fruits/veg very little if any meat (I more or less stopped several years ago wanting to eat meat). I m five foot four, 65 years old, I now have high blood pressure, and recently had an allergic reaction to the BP pills I ve taken for five years (my tonque became so thick and big I couldn t breath and thankfully I was at the ER before it became that critical. The second time it happened I woke up with half my mouth filled and could not breath by the time the ambulance reached the Hospitals ER. The ER doctor treating me told me that it was an allergic reaction and I am now taking a different BP medication. I deal with depression and take pills for that, I also take Nexium for acid reflux, and since I ve changed my diet have fewer headaches. I have had stress for a very long time and my husband 22 months ago, died from pancreatic cancer. The GP I have (we moved to a new town in June 2011) is not someone I like but the system here is one cannot change. He appears to be a nice person I think, but as a GP I have the strong impression he is just putting in time until he can retire. I can t go back there too often I want to become angry with him for not being a good care giver with my husband and now with me. Becoming angry and telling him how I feel he did not look after Craig and he is not looking after me I don t think will help. I have the strong feeling he dislikes fat women which should not enter into his profession (in my opinion). Unless I draw pointed attention to my legs he doesn t even ask and he has not referred me to any other doctor that might have seen this before. If this type of skin discolouration which seems permanent, is an indication of (for example) heart problems I wouldn t know as he hasn t even addressed any of the common problems associated with these symptons.

Thanks for your question at HCM.Rest, Analgesics, Ice and bandage application usually help relieve the pain and swelling associated with ankle injuries.However if the pain still persists 48 hours after injury, which gets aggravated on  standing or walking, it needs further evaluation.

The pain associated with foot and ankle injuries usually subsides in 2 to 3 days with analgesics medicines, rest, ice application and a compressive bandage. If the pain persists after 48 hours, it suggests slightly more severe form of soft tissue for bony injury.If you have any pain when you stand or walk on your injured feet, it suggests severity of injury and warrants further work up which will include an X ray at the least.

Thanks for your question at HCMPain in the shoulder and upper arm radiating along the arm associated with numbness suggests compression of nerve in your neck. Analgesics either taken orally as tablets or as local applications in the form gel or lotions can provide considerable pain relief. They have soothening effect and relive pain most of the times.

If the pain still persists after medications for a week physiotherapy under prescription in the form of neck strengthening exercises, ultrasonic massage can help provided u have no contraindications such therapy. Since your pain and numbness has persisted for a over 6 weeks, I would suggest you to visit your Orthopaedic, so that at least a baseline X ray and thorough examination can be done .

I was wondering if something is not right with my knee replacement or if something is pushing against something in my leg to cause the numbness? Thank you","Doctor":"HiWelcome to healthcaremagicI have gone through your query and understand your concern.The numbness in the foot is unlikely to be directly related to your bilateral knee replacement. This can be due to some pressure on the nerves in the leg. You should also get your tests for thyroid function test and blood sugar to exclude diabetes as these are causes of numbness.

I had visited my primary doctor for a few times and did not solve my problem. So I try to solve by myself by looking all of my blood test result and searching from internet. My beginning problem is waking up in the early morning (only sleep 3 hours) about 2:30 am when feel the shoulder joint bone reducing and it disappear right away after standing up no more sleep and it come again when I go to bed to sleep again. After one month it developed to litter pain on shoulder to wake me up in the early morning. My doctor said that my thyroid function is normal because TSH 2, T4 0.85 . the vitamin d 28.9 little lower but I already took the vitamind3 2000iu more per day and my doctor said it is about enough vitamin d3 now but my problem even become more serious. I then went to emergency room because feel stress sex needed , short breath, and high blood pressure . Doctor want me bring all of the blood test result back to see my primary doctor. He did not say anything but no infection . I feel I am dying and no help because the following days is independent day and holiday. By overview my blood test I had found Sodium 135 (lower), Potassium (3.3) lower, Chloride95(lower), CO2 (25) normal, Anion Gap 15 (higher). I think I am lack of electrolyte, and buy the electrolyte concentrate to dilute with water to drink. After I drink a big cup of electrolyte water I feel much better no more stress. I continue my internet search about why short electrolyte and found that I need take more sea salt food and potassium food and I continue to search why Anion Gap higher. I had found my blood pressure medicine losartan may cause RTA and cause Anion Gap higher. After I take off my blood pressure medicine losartan and take amlodipine in stead of it , my shoulder pain disappear that night (My blood pressure medicine is amlodipine 5mg and losartan 50mg generally, now I change to take amlodipine 10 mg ). I had solved my shoulder pain but I still wake up in the early morning can not sleep enough. I think I might have Hypothyroid problem. By self-test of early morning 1st wake up temperature of my body , 95.2 F , 95.1F, 95.F. From the book if the body temperature in this self test is lower than 97F is hypothyroid.

About an hour after eating the tomato I felt a sharp pain in my stomach. Later I felt nauseous; however I did not throw up. I also felt a strong discomfort in my stomach as well. After taking a nap, the situation resolved itself and I felt better. However now (since the tomato episode) when I eat almost anything, the discomfort comes back, yet I do not feel nearly as nauseous as compared to the tomato episode and the pain is completely gone. Also I feel like there is a lump between the border of my neck and my esophagus. Another thing that is troubling about my situation is when I eat certain foods like buckwheat porridge or potatoes, I get the feeling that something is about to go down (for example I might throw up) and I need to stop eating and take a break/lie down. Foods like eggs and oatmeal go down a little better. Lastly my burping (I always had the burps) has increased to the point where I feel uncomfortable. I went to the gastroenterologist* and he originally suspected an ulcer, however after performing an upperoscopy/colonoscopy and a biopsy of my stomach, he informed me I had h.pylori and prescribed me three drugs/antibiotics (Amoxicillin, Clarithromycin and Omeprazole) . After doing some research on h.pylori, I was able to learn that a lot of people have it, yet they do not even know about it. *Besides going the gastroenterologist, I also went to the ER two times and they performed some scans (don’t know the specific names) and of course drew my blood, which was normal UPDATE: After following treatment It has been determined that I m free of the h.pylori virus. This has been determined with the help of a breath test--Also my GI recommended I take a Gastric Emptying Solid test in order to test for the Gastroparesis diagnose. That came back negative as well, even showing that my food digests (goes thur) faster than liquid. My question to you is what do you think I have?---as I m not feeling any better and have lost a lot of weight due to not being able to eat properly.","Doctor":"You had H. pylori infection and got treated but you may still suffer from acidity (gastritis) and indigetion.

I AM ONLY 51 YRS, SO KNEE REPLACEMENT IS NOT AN OPTION NOW~OR SO MY DR SAYS. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION IN THIS MATTER.","Doctor":"I suggest taking the pain medication as needed for the pain in your knee. Norcos are specifically designed to serve for purposes like knee inflamation in the joints, and also for other pains in the body which are chronic. Taking aleve and other tylenol over the counter meds will damage your liver, and probably don't supply nearly half the relief as a small amount of vicodin would. If your doctor says you can't have surgery because of your age, this is rather bias and is a form of descrimination. If you are facing long term chronic pain for the rest of your life, and surgery is on the market; you should take surgery without a doubt.Ask for a second opinion from a specialist who has experience in the region of the body you are experiencing problems with. Bones and cartilage are a good area to start as far as what type of specialist you should seek advice from. You don't have to settle for one opinion, you can ask for a second opinion on any remark your primary care physician makes about a condition you may have or any pain you are experiencing. They should supply you with a referal to a specific type of doctor who can help you, or who can offer you more indepth insight if your doctor couldn't already do that.The truth is, any good doctor would research before making a hasty decision about surgery for a patient. If your dr. doesn't give your chart some thought and suggest letting him or her sleep on it, then chances are you are just a number that they have to care for in order to get paid by insurance or you. Feel free to seek a patient-advocate if you feel that your doctor is treating you with little respect to your person rather than your chart number.Good luck!"},{"Patient":"Hi, I fill during a hike last Friday today is Wednesday, I cut my leg in the middle of my shin bone and its swollen down to my ankle.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, I would disuade you from eating from outside if you do specially spicy, fried and fast food. Plenty of bowel motions could be due to an infection of your intestines, which usually comes from food in hotels not cooked hygienically. In that case a stool test for ova and cyst, and a broad spectrum antibiotic depending on the organism detected would solve the problem. At the same time I would suggest you following changes in your dietary routine like:1) more of roughage, enough liquids, avoidance of oily, fried, and fast food2) Regular routine exercises like morning walk depending on your medical fitness.If the frequency of motions persist, then I would suggest you get your blood sugar and thyroid status tested in a medical laboratory. Apart from that you might need to get assessed by a gastro enterologist in case of persistence of severe symptoms.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Add more of roughage to your food along with sufficient liquids. Also depending on your medical fitness, go for regular exercises like a morning or evening walk. Till that you can go for a proton pump inhibitor,a prokinetic drug, and a probiotic which should help you in giving you symptomatic relief.

From you history, it seems that you have developed a fissure in ano ( a cut in the perianal skin) due to passage of hard stool due to which there is pain over there and bleeding due to the ulcer. If I were your doctor, I would first examine the area clinically, and after confirming that it was a fissure, would go for some anti inflammatory drug along with a proton pump inhibitor, a broad spectrum antibiotic, and a stool softener like lactulose liquid at bed time. Add sitz bath to it (sitting on a luke warm water filled tub) three to four time a day for five minutes each. I am hopeful that you would get relief with this strategy, but I am afraid it would return if constipation (hard stool) occurs again for you. Therefore, to prevent the constipation, please avoid high protein diet, add a lot of roughage and fresh fruits along with sufficient liquids.

Since I am so short, I literally had to pull myself up & climb on & off the trailer which we rode on. I was on & off as I was tending to the kids. Sunday, I woke up w/soreness in my left chest area--to the left of my breastbone (about armpit level), which somewhat radiates outward toward my left arm pit. I am able to carry on my normal, nonstrenuous daily routine. However, if I bend over & lower my left arm while in the bent over position, the pain worsens...especially closest to my breastbone. I can run my fingers along the area & somewhat feel the soreness. I see no swelling or bruising. Also, it is painful in the area when I cough. It feels like a strained or pulled muscle? (it does NOT feel deep within my chest) However, I am also a cervical cancer survivor. I just finished chemo, radiation, & brachytherapy in early Sept. and was given the all clear (cancer free) on Sept. 19. Everyday, I live w/the fear of the cancer returning. I notice every little twinge and automatically fear its cancer related. Since this chest pain started right after Saturday night s strenuous activities, I would like to think the pain is most likely related to over doing myself. I do think I lost strength while going thru cancer treatments as I recently had strained muscle in my lower back. The pain from the lower back strain went away within just a few days, tho. Today is my 4th day of having this type of chest discomfort. Does it sound like the chest pain is related to climbing on & off the hayride? What could it be? COuld it be a strained muscle of some kind? If so, when should I see improvement and is there anything I can do to expedite the healing? Motrin does help the pain, btw.","Doctor":"From the clinical history you give here I suspect it may be due to Herpes sister reactivation in these areas or it may be a musculoskeletal pain. Don't worry its not related to cancer. Anyway you must visit a doctor to not miss something you missing to mention here.

Please type your query here... Hi IÃ¢??m very worried about my husband by a process of elimination we have concluded that he may have a problem with his pancreas although he has undergone many tests that donÃ¢??t show anything. Ã¢?Â¢     When he drinks alcohol not very much maybe 5 beers the following day he is very sick he vomits up to 20 times very strongly almost projectile and it is acid, this varies in strength and colour. It takes him 2/3 days to recover and leaves him very weak he worries about the effect it has on his head as he suffers with pain from the force of vomiting and has strange dreams in the following days. Also he worries about the effect the strength of the vomiting has on his heart as it leaves him so weak Ã¢?Â¢     We think it is the pancreas because he has pain in this area on the left hand side at the back high up opposite the liver. He also suffers pain in the area above the stomach. He attempted to have a camera investigate the problem but the camera could not pass they attempted 4 times and gave up, surely this indicates some kind of blockage? When he is well enough to eat again, if he eats for example soup he is left with a burning sensation inside. Ã¢?Â¢     This whole situation leaves him feeling very sad sometimes even depressed I think itÃ¢??s not knowing what is causing it and he worries about his health I really want to help him sort it out hope you can help . Should you need any further clarification please do not hesitate to contact me. Regards Catherine","Doctor":"Hi, your husband couldn't digest alcohol thats why he vomits violently thereafter. Many of people does have this kind of problem. You have to avoid alcohol or keep it minimal. Try pantop 40 and emset for vomitting.

Any activity that leaves your feet on the floor, such as sitting in a chair, standing or walking can lead to swelling.1. Swelling in the foot, ankle, knee and thigh are common after total joint replacement.2. To prevent swelling, recline or lie down with your feet higher than the level of your heart for 45 to 60 minutes. Do this 2 times each day.  3. wear elastic stockings to reduce swelling. If so, wear the stockings during the day and remove them at night. Wash the stockings with soap and water and hang them to dry. 4. Avoid long car trips. If you must travel, stop every 30 minutes. Get out of the car and move around. This will prevent blood clots, decrease swelling and help decrease joint stiffness.  5. do ankle movement upward and downward direction every one hour . it will improve your circulation and lymphatic drainage and decreases the inflammation6. put one pillow below the ankle during sleep which increases the venous return towards the heart and decreases the swelling. it will prevent fluid accumulation in distal limbi think this information may help youthank u"},{"Patient":"Hello, I have had trigger finger surgery on my index and ring fingers.

Good morning. I am Dr shareef answering your query.

As you had a blunt injury several months ago, an underlying fracture might have healed by this time. If you still have pain then healing is not proper.

Visualised spinal cord show normal bulk and signal intensity. Can you please tell me how she can be treated as all the doctors till give medicine and there is no sign of recovery . Now she cant even stand for more than 5 minutes. Thankyou Navdeep kamboj 0000","Doctor":"Hi there.  Thsnks for your question at HCM. Her MRI findings suggest that one of the discs is bulging. But her management will depend on her pain distribution, severity, duration and response to treatment like medicines and physiotherapy.  It is also important to know whether she has only bavk pain or back pan wiyh pain radiating to legs or buttocks. IlScenario 1: if her pain is only in the back wity no leg pain or numbness, it is best to wait and watch. She will get better with medicines, corr stabilisation back exercises, physiotherapy modalities like ultrasonic massage and micro wave diathermy. ( if she has no contraindications. Surgery is very seldom indicated in only back pain.Scenario 2: She has back pain with radiation to legs.  Same protocol of medicines and physiotherapy to be followed for 6 to 8 weeks. If she does not improve next step would be steroid injectionw in her back( 2 to 3 shots over 2 to 3 months. If still no improvement final step in management ladder would be surgery.  In both the scenarios urgent surgery required if she develops weakness in legs, signficant numbness, unrelenting severe pain, urine or stool pasing problems. Hope this helps you. All the best.

Your nerves numbness is a common condition that can be caused by vitamin B12 deficiency, injured nerves or sitting is the same position for a long time .When your bandaging is too tight creating numbness and uneasiness  for you by hamperring the process of circulation  this is why it felt better when you loosened the compression straps blood circulation to your ankle & toes  which needs blood to heal .And include  proper nutrition - Vitamins , minerals , and  also slow activity can help mobility and strength to recover fast . So , If you feel relief by loosening  the compression straps , apprise your your doctor of the situation  If you have any concerns, don’t hesitate to call a doctor .Hope this helps solves your query .Take care , All the best .Don't hesitate to get back if have any further query"},{"Patient":"Hello, have a question regarding my head. Was riding my motorcycle at very low speed. Car in front slammed on brakes, and I did the same. Slick road so bike slipped out, I went over the bars. I felt completely fine. It wasn t until 3 hrs later my head started hurting mildly and has continued to. I saw no indication of any blow to the helmet and I m almost sure I didn t hit my head. I m a bit sore today, but my head has a constant but very mild ache. This includes my neck too.

But as you said there is no external injury or any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting or feeling dizzy it does not look to be concerned about.Some blunt muscular injury will continue to pain for 4 to 5 days but will disappear with time.Meanwhile you can take analgesics available over the counter whenever pain increases.

CDS may, however be due to intervertebral disc space reduction due to any reason that restricts free movement of neck and exerting pressure on nerves emanating from cervical spine and going to arm. It may be due to osteophytes too but that's generally in later age. Symptoms are similar.Physiotherapy and herbal decoctions are the best bet. Otherwise pain killers will make you dependable on them and cause side effects. Pain killers will also render ineffective after some time.If interested, pl ask direct question to know more about cervical support, herbals and decoction etc to keep life happy by prevention of progress of intervertebral disc disease.All the best.rajeshchoda@gmail.com"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor Hope that you are fine with the best of your health .
