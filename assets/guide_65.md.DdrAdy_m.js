In 2005 I consulted a herbal doctor who told me the sysmptoms were as a result of prolonged use of antibiotics and the std, he treated the std and after months on several test the result shows no staphilococcus growth. However, the skin lession, dandrouph on my hair and aging continue though I used a cream call Andix G (formally Nacilon Q) to clear the lession but it reappears once i stop using the creaam. In 2007 I started developing pain arround my abdomen and bowel area, so I consulted another doctor who carried out test and told me i had a yeast infection and the yeast count is very leathal, so he started treating me after few months the condition first improve and then went back to what it was( as do most of the other treatments) so I stopped.

I recently went to the doctor for stomach cramps, frequent and urgent bowl movements (10-20 a day), and diarhea (pure liquid).

Stool was semi-solid at that time.A couple weeks later, I find myself with a semi solid stool, going about 3-5 times a day.  no abdominal pain (except for the feeling of having to go urgently).  I have found the stool to be of the correct color (mid brown, not too light or dark), fairly solid with a little liquid.

The results were negative. Our doctor then said to let him know if the pain didn t go away,or got worse. There was no additional information provided as to the cause of the elevated d dimer number. My wife has RA, which we understand might effect the d dimer number, but no one has told us anything additional to calm our fears which are born out of our ignorance of the situation. Can you offer any possible explanations in this matter?","Doctor":"Dear patient elevated d dimers level is sign of acute pulmonary embolism. This.may happen in patients with increased susceptibility for clot formation in blood ie increased clotting factors in blood.  Steroid intake for long time may have side effect of increased coagulability in blood. Since some of patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis are prescribed steroids this may be reason. Are you taking steroids? Ct scan of chest will help to confirm diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. So that may  be the reason for ordering ct scan.

Right now i m  on medication indomethycin, preninjolefor one month, still i get stiffness in knee and ankles and  swelling  on long walks.pls may i know is it completely curable and how much time it will take ?","Doctor":"Dear patient reactive arthritis can be controlled with medication and takes longer time. You are taking indomethacin which is pain moderator and prednisone is steroidal drug which is disease modifier. If both this drugs are not helping you need to start tab hydroxy chloroquine 250 mg twice a day plus tab sulfasalazine 500 mg twice a day if not contraindicated. Both drugs takes 2 to 3 weeks to show action hence indomethacin should be continued with them. Prednisone should be tapered in dosage and discontinued slowly as it has many side effects. Physiotherapy like short wave diathermy and range of motion excercises helps in reducing stiffness and pain. If possible You need to consult rheumatologist nearby you and is the right person your condition. Hope this is useful."},{"Patient":"Hello , I Had c5 & c6 antr. fussion in 09.

They need to be taken in proper dosages and frequency to be effective.Generally both generic drugs and branded  drugs are effective if taken in proper dosage but sometimes bioavalability may differ. Bioavalability is like when u take two different company drugs in same amount, the final amount reaching blood may differ.Thia happens due to difference in absorption at intestine level.

I have an undiagnosed pain in my right side flank area. It radiates from bottom of my rib cage, down my side through to my lower back and hip, with constant burning and sharp pain. It feels like either one of my organs is in pain and isn t functioning right or like there is an infection spreading in that area, and I can t pinpoint the source of the pain, as it radiates throughout that area. The pain is sharp and constant, it about a 6 and builds, goes through a cycle of increasing from a 6 to a 10, only calming back to a 6 after I relieve myself. During the cycle my body temp. skyrockets (no fever though) and it feels like my blood is boiling, again, only calming after I relieve myself. Night time is bad and early morning is worse, until I relieve myself. I feel nauseous many times throughout the day and dizzy occasionally. I feel weak and the pain has spread and gotten worse over a 6 month period, while the doctors (internal med., gastroentrologist, ortho) order tests, but no diagnosis. I ve had a CT scan, an MRI of my back, an abdominal ultrasound, kidneys checked, and a colonoscopy. None of these revealed the cause of the pain, though mild ulcers were discovered in my stomach, and a right-side kidney infection; treatments for those were provided. A HIDA scan was recently performed to check my gallbladder function...waiting for the results. Questions: 1. What other tests, could you suggest, to help discover what is causing this pain? 2. What tests could/should I ask for, to check for an infection in my blood or in an organ?, for functionality of my adreanal gland, liver, appendix, small intestines, or other organs on my right side flank area? 3. Are there tests that could show what is happening within, as waste moves through my intestines to the point of excrement (which is when the pain is at its worst). 4.

I had an MRI and results came back that I have calcification and Tendernitious.

About a week ago he had some pain in his lower abdominal area for few days, it got so bad at one point that we had to take him to ER for pain management. The doctor requested a full blood test and an ultra sound. The ultra sound came back ok but in his blood test his CPK came up very high, to be exact it was 1740. We don t know what it means but being so much higher than average range worries us a lot. He hasn t had a chance to go back to doctor yet but is this scary number means anything bad? Thanks","Doctor":"Dr. Hanif warmly welcomes you!Thanks for consulting at my virtual clinic HCM. I have carefully worked through your case, and can well realize your health worries. Being your physician, I want to assure, I will take care all of your medical concerns.What CPK means?It is Creatine Phosphokinase and is an enzyme mainly found in heart, muscles and brain tissues.What these scary high numbers means?There is some damage to brain, skeletal muscles or to the heart muscles.Possibilities:Mostly the damaged muscles are the reason for leakage of the CPK into the blood and that is picked up in blood work. Usually physicians order this test to rule out the cause of chest pain to be a heart attack and to see the extent of damages done to the muscles. The high values are seen in brain and skeletal muscles disorders, lung tissue infarction (death), thyroid diseases.Final suggestion:-Your brother needs to go for a follow up with his treating physician (PCP) as soon as possible.Hope I answered all of your questions. Please don't forget to add your precious positive feedback to help me able to assist you better in future too. Have a wonderful time ahead. Keep in touch for a follow-up too to let me know if you have any doubts & need further assistance. I am available 24/7 for your help. Have a blessed time ahead. Regards!DR.

The muscle spasms under your right breast following your rib cage below your armpit associated with rash break out, are suggestive of herpetic rash. Please contact your doctor as you might need prescription antivirals. Please send a photo to me of the affected area, so I can analyze it further.

When can I expect to be able to bend my toe down again?","Doctor":"As you rightly said, the bone, that is the operated 1st Metatarsal is still healing. It would take a minimum of 6 to 8 weeks for complete bone union at the operated site.

The trauma or fall can have injury to  disc, if you directly fell on your back.2. If you have pinching sensation behind your knees, the disc is pressing on the nerves and may be causing radiating pain in the nerves.3. Due to disc problem, you may have difficulty in moving your hips.4. Standing and walking will put more pressure on the disc and nerves.5. Please consult an orthopaedic surgeon immediately and do a MRI. If the disc is pressing the nerves, i.e. radiculopathy, you may need surgical treatment. It is possible that your earlier Lumbar disc problem has increased with the fall.6. Please consult your orthopaedic surgeon again and explain your problems. If the chiropractor had advised treatment and it is not helping, you should inform immediately.Wish you a best recovery"},{"Patient":"I'm 48 and my body feels stiff and sore especially in the morning.

You can get such insole inserts of EVA, Plastazote, Silicon, Poron from special foot wear institutes, and please wear these when you are on your feet. Never use hard insoled foot wear or walk bare foot.The other aspect is to gradually stretch the plantar fascia, which is in a contracted state to is normal length in about 4 weeks, when pain will disappear.

I had gone through your question I can understand your concern about your hand tingling sensation. As per your history you had tight rope around your risk, Because of that compression  there is transient nerve block. This block can cause numbness and tingling sensations of hand. So you don't need to worry it will be normal after some time. Tingling sensation can also be because of the deficiency of certain nutrients like vitamin B 12 and calcium. You need to visit a general physician in case you feel continous numbness or tingling sensations. Hope my answer will help you and you can write to us if you feel any need for further assistance.

Around the time it began, I received a CT scan which revealed nothing. I lived with it for the next 11 years. Last year I mentioned it to my GP and didn t get much info. She tested my liver, pancreas, ect. levels which again were normal. It seems lately to be more annoying/painful/bothersome than it has in the past and seems to be changing in its symptoms. It began feeling like part of my lower rib cage was stuck under the rest of the rib cage, and upon manipulation, it actually moves, which the other side does not. This offers some temporary relief. Now it gives me abdominal pain that does not feel digestive related. This pain is located to the left of my navel about 1.5 inches and can extend up above my navel in between the breastbone and navel. It feels more of a pulled muscle, but is constant and is not only occurring when the muscle is pulled. I also sometimes feel the pain radiating to the back side almost exactly where I feel the stuck rib pain and sometimes I feel a twinge on my left side just below the ribcage. All of these feel related to one another. I have a physical on the 25th, and I want to know what questions to ask and/or what tests to ask to have done. As a side note, I recently had the symptoms of a UTI including hematuria and flank pain. I noticed increased flank pain before the symptoms of painful urination and hematuria, but I attributed it to my ribcage thing because it felt similar, only more intense. After visiting the dr, she confirmed a high pH and I began antibiotics to clear it up. I received the results a few days later and my doctor stated no specific bacteria was found. However, my symptoms have cleared with regards to the UTI. Please help, it s gone on long enough!

However, in general the main indication for a hip replacement is pain arising from the hip or a fracture around the hip. Some patients do come in with horrible X-rays but do not have much pain, as is in your case. My opinion is that these patients would less benefit of going through surgery as they would not experience much pain relief compared to those who are in significant pain. My advise would be to start flexibility exercises to help stretch the muscles and improve your stiffness. Should your pain continue to worsen and you find that you have difficulty in performing your daily activities then surgery is always an option."},{"Patient":"Hi, I had meniscus repair in 2015 and was told I have arthritis in knee and had bone spurs that were removed and would probable need a knee replacement in a few years.

When I apply pressure to the joint for a few minutes then it loosens up but then to poop when I bend and unbend the joint. I usually apply pressure to the joint and then flex the joint for a bit before the poop goes away but the pain still stays.","Doctor":"Thank you for your question.Locking of the fingers and pain located over the base is commonly symptoms of trigger finger, or in your case trigger thumb.In my consultation i would usually assess the pinpoint area of tenderness to confirm the diagnosis. There is also higher risk of getting the condition if you are female and diabetic. I would also exclude other possibilities such as arthitis which causes pain on movement but not typically locking. The pain would also be more diffuse.Once the diagnosis is confirmed, I would refer to a hand therapist for focused range of movement and some heat therapy. I would also prescribe some anti inflammatories if not contraindicated. Most of my patients would respond well to this. However in cases where the pain and locking persists, we can either attempt an injection to reduce the pain and inflammation or a release of the culprit tendon with a mini surgical incision. This usually will address the symptoms and improve the function.

He is diabetic and does have heart problems. What are is risk facture for this operation?","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for your question.Amputations in diabetics are quite commonly performed, mainly for limbs that are dangerous (severely infected), or functionless.Regarding your concern about the risk of the operation, the risks can be divided into short and long term complications.short term:1. bleeding, which can be avoided with careful dissection and ligation2. anaesthetic risks - this is relevant to your information regarding his ECHO, i/m assuming his ejection fraction is around 15-20% which indicates that his heart reserves is quite limited and he can suffer from low blood pressure leading to a heart attack or a stroke during the operation. These risks are avoided by staying away from blood pressure lowering drugs, performing a regional anaesthetic instead of general anaesthesia etc. I'm sure the anaesthesiologist will inform him about their plan of attack to avoid such complications.long term complications:1. wound breakdown - diabetic have a higher risk of non-healing wounds, I advise for strict control of his blood sugars in the immediate days following the operation2. phantom pain - a known risk for amputees, having sensation or even pain at the amputated limbs.however, we generally recommend amputation as a last resort and only if the benefits of surgery outweigh the risks. If an infected foot is left alone, the infection can harbour and ascend up, affecting more than just the foot."},{"Patient":"Female, mid 50 s overweight. Have continuous pain in heel area of foot.

This is mainly due to inappropriate footwear and also tight Achilles tendon.I would recommend footwear with soft soles to reduce the load on the area. you can also use soft insoles with a good arch.Secondly, regular achilles tendon and gastrocnemius muscle stretching will help to allow the microtears around the plantar fascia to heal. My experience is that this condition needs persistent stretching and modification of footwear to resolve so be patient and persistent with the physiotherapy."},{"Patient":"My daughter gets mottled skin on her legs with exercise, and says they get real heavy and feel tight like rubberbands and she can hardly move them.

I have been operated on the day of my accident and after that on 8/3/17 the later fractured parts. Know after recovering from hospital.my doctor feels that my right knee ligament is being damaged and I need to consult an sportsmed doctor. Can u suggest me what shall I do do further treatment or ne other therapies I go for. I heard that my ligament operation will cost a higher amount! I am in dilemma, plz help me out.","Doctor":"Hi i have read your question and understood your concerns.Seems that the initial injury has done quite a bit of damage to your leg. The main issues that i can see are:1. fracture of the right tibia2. fracture of the left femur3. dislocation of the right hip4. dislocation of the kneeIn the initial part the main objective is to reduce the dislocation and treat the fractures, which was performed as you stated. I will also assess for any nerve or circulation damage which does not seem to be there. However, it will take a few weeks to months for the bone to regain adequate strength to allow for weightbearing. Once bones are healed and you are ambulating without any aid, you will notice that the knee is more \\"loose\\" than usual or compared to the other side. With a history of knee dislocation there is a high likelihood that you have injured at least two or more of the ligaments around the knee.The treatment will basically depend on your level of daily activities and also your symptoms. However, performing the surgery will not be as urgent as the initial surgeries to treat your fractures. You can opt to go for physical therapy and strengthen your muscles which can help in stabilising your knee and reduce your symptoms. Some ligaments do eventually scar down and you will have less symptoms of a loose knee. However, if you are a very active person who does demand a lot from your knee than I do suggest you go ahead with the reconstruction. Earlier stabilisation will lead to earlier rehabilitation and better function."},{"Patient":"My father right arm bone (Between shoulder & elbow) was fracture last week and doctor advice to make surgery and fix the plate.

Is that the cause for the flare up. How can I relieve the pain?","Doctor":"your symptoms sound typical of plantar fasciitis. its a common condition related to footwear and ageing.basically the culprit is tight ankle flexors, ie the achilles tendon. this leads to microtears in the plantar fascia especially where it attaches to the heel. the inflammation and further microtears from a tight achilles tendon make the symptoms worse and worse.i would recommend:1. anti-inflammatories to reduce the inflammation2. regular achilles tendon stretching. this can be either done by pulling with a towel (while sitting) or using your body weight to extend the ankle against the floor (standing, leaning forwards with straight hip and knees). regular stretching exercises will relax the muscle and fascia, allowing it to heal properly.3. for very acute debilitating pain, an injection can be performed to numb the area and also reduce the inflammation. however it the proper exercises are not performed after the injection, the symptoms will recur."},{"Patient":"Hi, I ve been told I have a rare condition where my bones are crumbling in my hips and I have to have two new ones.My doctor didn t tell me what it was called and I was too shocked to ask. Could you tell me what it is as I would be most greatful.

What is causing this","Doctor":"painful clicking around the ankle most commonly is cause by subluxation of the peroneal tendons. it can occur after an ankle sprain, due to injury to the envelope holding it in place. the pain and clicking is mostly at the lateral aspect of the ankle. other causes can be due to a cartilage tear around the ankle, which can impinge causing the clicking and pain. A thorough examination and ultrasound can help to achieve the diagnosis.in cases of tendon subluxation, a trial of immobilisation can help to allow the envelope of retinaculum to heal. if it does heal then your symptoms will resolve. however, as your symptoms have been present for 7 months, i suspect that you might need surgical repair or reconstruction of the retinaculum."},{"Patient":"I am 68, female, had a hip replacement three weeks ago.

It s been 4 days now & quite a lot of bruising has developed around his knee & ankle even though the pain is primarily in his calf. Should he see a doctor... or is this normal healing??","Doctor":"it sounds to me that the pain and redness around the calf only started 24 hours after the fall. if so, it might not be related to the initial fall itself. in my consult i would be worried of deep vein thrombosis which developed due to an injury to the vein and precipitated by a period of immobilisation post-fall. i would examine to see if it is only localised to the calf or if it has extended to the thigh. also i need to examine the lungs to make sure it has not dislodged and travelled to the lungs, causing an obstruction. to confirm my diagnosis i would order a doppler ultrasound plus other investigations as indicated. the treatment if the diagnosis is confirmed is to start on blood thinners and observe his condition until the clot has dissolved. he would probably have to be investigated to as why he is prone to develop such clots in the first place."},{"Patient":"playing football, I reached to tag someone and my arm was pushed sideways when fully extended.

A bone spur is an extra growth of bone over a bone that has been exposed to trauma or stress. This usually doesn't cause any problem unless it grows enough to compress surrounding tissues like nerves. In your case, this would need to be removed if it is causing significant pain on nerve compression. The procedure usually involves general anesthesia with removal of the spur and any damaged tissue surrounding it. If the spine in that area is unstable after removal of affected bone and tissue, you will need a fusion or reconstruction surgery to keep your normal spinal functions. This will be followed with rigorous Physiotherapy as indicated. As with any surgery, risk of bleeding, nerve damage (for spinal surgery) and cardiovascular risks are present. This also depends on your current health status and other co-existing illnesses, if any. The first step is to asses the level of neurological affliction & how it affects your daily life. The benefits must outweigh the risks before proceeding with the surgery. Please discuss options and post operative care (short term and long term) with you doctor before making a decision.

Normal recommendations for Morton's Neuroma include resting your foot, using something called Metatarsal pad inside your shoe which takes pressure off the nerve bundle, and occasionally anti-inflammatories to decreased the pain and inflammation.  You should consider consultation with a specialist as you have pain that is shooting up your leg which may be a sign that the nerve is extremely irritated."},{"Patient":"I have been having foot pain. It s not when I walk on it but first thing in the morning or anytime I have been off my feet for any amount of time. When I get up to walk pain in my right foot hurts bad its all the way down the side of my foot to my ankle.","Doctor":"Foot pain is extremely common and can be pretty uncomfortable.  Since your foot pain comes after long periods of inactivity like getting up in the morning or after having been off your feet for some time, it is likely from a combination of muscle tightness and tendonitis.Tendons are the structures that connect muscle to bone to help joints move.  You have tendons on the inside and outside of your foot to help your foot move and to keep your foot stable.  These tendons can become inflamed in some situations of overuse or other situations where they are being overworked.The mainstay of treatment for tendonitis is ice(20min 4 times a day) and anti-inflammatories.  In addition, I like to recommend a combination of soft tissue treatments and exercises for the foot.  You can use a lacrosse ball on the bottom and sides of your feet to work out tight areas.  You can then follow by strengthening the foot by grabbing a towel using your toes and the releasing and repeating for 3 sets of 10 twice a day.  If you continue to have pain, I recommend Xrays to rule out other causes and an examination by a specialist."},{"Patient":"Hi. I ve been doing a lot of sitting recently and have developed some edema, mostly in the lower right let. Today the swelling was accompanied by pain at the front of the leg and some numbness in the area. Probably unrelated but I ve also had a breakout of a chronic, undiagnosed ichy hot red rash on the shin. How to I get this under control?","Doctor":"It is possible the rash and the edema are related.  Edema normally develops from an overflow of fluid from your vascular system to your soft tissue area.  Your lymphatics are normally when swell up.  You are very astute to attribute the swelling to increased sitting as the veins of your leg get compressed when you sit making edema more likely.  The edema itself can cause skin change over time such as you are describing.  If you have significant enough swelling, you should consider seeing your doctor so ultrasound can be performed on the legs to rule out a blood clot.  Edema can otherwise be reduced by reducing your sodium intake(cut down on breads, cheese, and canned food), exercising, and foam rolling the inside of your thighs.  You can also try compression socks to help the blood flow back to your heart."},{"Patient":"i think i might have an in grown toenail and i hasnt healed for weeks. i constantly pour peroxide on it or whatever its called.

With a history of diverticulitis and pain that is relieved by passing gas, I suspect the pain originates from your bowel - it can be some obstruction with gaseous distension of the bowel, and passing wind will make it feel better. My advice is go for a checkup and Xrays will be able to pick up distension, fecal loading or a mass in the abdomen. Your doctor will be able to manage further.Hope that helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, I had surgery on my hammertoe and torn ligaments earlier today. My pain med is hydrocondon/acetaminophen 5-325.

But to have conformation you can visit your ortho and check with the material he has kept and do a allergy test with it.Now at present she can take symptomatic treatment and i suggest ask her to do regular walking or cycling exercises. Because doing regular exercises also helps for reducing inflammation in body. Also check with the rhematologist and dermatologist for further use of medication as well to check other causes of this. And if there is anything which can be done to identify the kind of allergy apart from allergy test.Here I told that it can not be total knee replacement as a cause of this because after replacement she was fine for more then 6 month if there is some thing related to it then it will start immediate after replacement with in a week time.So I suggest to have close look on allergy test and visit a different doctor if one is not able to treat it properly.Take care."},{"Patient":"I am 52 years old female.

I read your question and understood your concern. Until now we are told that muscle cramps are caused by low magnesium and low calcium in our bodies.The newest and most scientifically supported theory is that muscle cramps are caused by premature fatigue.

The results show a 3.2cm fibroid in the mid posterior myometrium, with no free fluid. All my Dr wrote on the report was \\"follow up with OBGYN\\" What is this really saying?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.Fibroid is a growth on the uterus. It can be lying on the outside when ther eis no symptoms. It can be in the wall of uterus or projecting inside the uterine cavity when it can cause pains , bleeding. Your Doctor has referred you to the Gynecologist as She can help to determine the nature and any relation to the pain you have. If this is the reason , you have to surgery for removal of the fibroid if you are in the reproductive age group and want a child; r hysterectomy if you do not want to extend the family. If the reason for your pain is not fibroid, we have to find out.This can be done by a clinical examination by a Surgeon, CT scan of abdomen, diagnostic laparoscopy and related blood, urine and stool tests. The treatment will depend upon the diagnosis."},{"Patient":"I have occasional perception of weakness in my limbs since the last few years (particularly in the left upper & lower limbs), with a slightly increased frequency over the past few months. I have no problem with gripping or lifting an object etc. as such, just that the left hand feel a little more tired when I lift it as compared to the right. I also get tingling and burning sensation in my palms and feet sometimes and also in certain parts of the body, which are non specific and transient. Of late, I am also experiencing occasional gentle transient pain or a sudden pulse of pain in my limbs (probably along the nerves)  , neck and sometimes inside the head too, though, this are non-location specific (meaning, the pain is not in the same spot all the time. eg. sometimes it's the right side of the head, sometimes left, sometimes around the cheek bone etc. I am non-diabetic with normal BP and 40 years of age. I have been detected with dyslipidemia some 6-7 years back and since then I am on Atorvastatin 10 mg ( was briefly in 5 mg dose too in between) and have my lipid profile under control. I have also been prescribed with aspirin 75 mg, since the last 4 months. I have consulted neurologist for my problem and my problem, mentioned here, has been attributed to stress / anxiety. Is the diagnosis correct? For the problem, I have been prescribed Tryptomer 10 mg, which I am yet to start, as I read somewhere it is an anit-depressant, has a sedative effect and can be addictive.

My opinion is that you might be having a hemiparesis- ie weakness on one side of the body. This is usually a sign of an area in your brain that is not getting enough blood supply. With a history of dyslipidaemia there is a possibility of a mild stroke or transient ischaemic attacks. My advise is to have a brain scan to verify if there is no central lesion in the brain.

The lumps are lymphnodes in the groin that are helping to clear the bruising and eliminate dead tissue of infection. They will be painful as they are swollen, but they should get smaller as you heal.

Based on the information that you provide it looks like the origin of the problem is on your neck. The first diagnosis that comes in my mind is cervical spondyloarthropathies in your neck where the nerves on your neck impinges and causes pain in the neck and arm. So the pain in the arm is a referred pain or radiating pain from the neck. This hypothesis can be confirmed or excluded through a neck MRI. If that is the case you should do a consultation with a neurology specialist and depending on the grade or stage of the disease you can treat with physical therapy and medication in the beginning. Other less frequent diagnosis might be triggerpoints or muscular pain.

The sprain is going down my neck, shoulder and upper back bad.","Doctor":"if any inflammation please apply ice.. if muscles are tight give hot fomentaion. please check you posture. probably your pectoralis muscle is too tight. releasing and stretching would help.start with scapular repositioning exercises before doing heavy weights again."},{"Patient":"My husband had a fall 25 years ago off our porch and landed on his back. He had therapy and saw a chiropractor. Has not had any problems until recently. Also had right hip surgery 6 years ago and developed bursitis in his hip. He has had several steroid shots for the hip pain. Recently he complains about right hip pain. He went to a second doctor who took an x-ray of his right hip. After looking at the X-ray, he said that his hip is in tact and could see no wearing of his hip. Bursitis is possible but he also suggested that it could be a problem with his back. My question - could the pain he is experiencing in his right hip and crotch area be caused from his back? Thanks - I am really perplexed and do not know where to turn. Could there be something else wrong? Do we need to see a special doctor and if so what should the doctor specialize in?

It hurts to walk, and when I went to Urgent Care, they said to walk it off and come back if it worsens. It is turning blue and black, and getting more swollen. What should I do? Should I get a knee brace, or crutches?","Doctor":"Hello,You need to find out the cause. This needs to be done at a primary care doctor's office. Urgent care is really only for acute problems.

She may need other testing as well.Regards"},{"Patient":"I noticed Sunday, 2/2/14 that my 7yr old Daughters ring toe and pinky toe on her right foot were swollen. She has fingers for toes, long and skinny and they were both swelled up like sausages. I could not find any bruising, she can bend them, she doesn t remember hitting them on anything, but she does say it hurts when she bends them and when I push on them. I gave her some Motrin hoping that it would reduce the swelling. Monday, they were still swollen, so I tried giving her Benadryl to see if that would reduce the swelling, thinking maybe it s something allergy related. Tuesday, the pinky toe is not swollen anymore, but the ring toe is still fat. Still no bruising, but she still says it hurts when I touch it. I am at a loss on what it could be or why its not going away. I don t know if something bit her, or did she stub it? I don t know what I should do. Do I take her to have it checked out or give it more time? This is now day 4.","Doctor":"Hi. My opinion is that it should be checked to exclude insect bites, allergy, Fungal infections or even trauma. Even if she does not recall bumping her foot, it is possible she did and sustained a ligament injury, especially as it is sore when touched. Rather let your doctor have a look. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"i am 82 yr s old. my legs are swollen from ankles up - i wear compression hose but don t seem to help. i have been in the hospital for c-def twice in which they put iv s in me - i believe 5 - i was in the hospital for 5 days (mon.to fri.) i am trying not to eat anything with salt in it but some soups have 350 or more--help needed","Doctor":"Hi. This is a complex one without all the tests done. If you are hypertensive or have a heart problem, you could be in heart failure which presents with swelling of the legs and short breath. The other cause could be lymphoedema which causes elephantiasis. You need to get a proper diagnosis from the hospital and we can then work around that.

For this and other possible causes a diagnostic laparoscopy is the best option and many times helps the patients psychologically.One of the most important causes is IBS / related to Psychiatric problem/ attention deficit and may be psychological trauma- The age at which this started is very typical - age of 14 as per your history.

He has a black eye and numbness in his left cheek. He has felt something loose in his cheek area, except for today. It seems to have gone away. Also, right after the fall, he had a bloody nose for 2 days. Please advise. Thank you.","Doctor":"Dear friend, I have gone through your question..Your husband had a history of fall. It would have been better if you have mentioned whether there was any loss of consciousness, vomiting, weakness and seizures after the fall.The things mentioned in the history given are significant. It seems like there is some facial bone fracture. As there is a black eye, we have to rule out a intracranial brain injury(especially the frontal lobe). Black eye can also be due to facial bone fracture.Kindly get a non contrast CT scan of the head and CT of face and paranasal sinuses to assess the bones.Then consult your physician with the reports.Thank you."},{"Patient":"I've been experiencing some changes in my body for the past year and one of my problems are with my legs. My feet and legs would swell up from time to while i'm just sitting down, my legs would be very sensitive and week, and my veins have been a lot more visible for about three months now. What could this mean?","Doctor":"Dear friend, I have gone through your question..Sitting causes blood to pool up in our legs. When we walk the calf muscles act as pumps which helps the blood in our leg veins to go back to heart.As you have said the veins in your legs are becoming prominent, which point towards venous insufficiency(veins are less effective in pumping blood back to heart). If there is venous insufficiency the legs swell up more on sitting and swelling increases towards the end of the day.As the venous insufficiency increases there can be color changes in ankle skin,itching,prominent small reticular veins visible, eczematous changes.You have to undergo a venous Doppler to assess your leg veins.Rest by keeping your leg in elevated position is important. Compression stockings can also be used. Consult your surgeon with venous Doppler reports and always try to use compression stockings.Thank you"},{"Patient":"I hurt my ribs playing soccer (body on body collision).  My ribs were sore/tender for a couple days.  On the third day, my ribs cracked when i was stretching in the spot that was sore.

I have no problems breathing or excercising, but it really hurts when i get up out of bed or try to do any ab excercises.","Doctor":"Dear friend.. I have gone through your question..Pain in ribs which is increasing in character is a matter of concern.It can be a contusion of skin and subcutaneous tissue which is causing you the pain.It can also be a minor hairline fracture in the ribs which is causing the pain(as you have mentioned cracking) and increasing pain.As there is no breathing difficulty, the pleura underlying the ribs is not injured it seems.Since the ribs enclose the vital organs in our body it is always better to get a chest Xray done to rule out any major injuries.Also you have to take adequate rest and analgesics for pain relief and faster recovery.Thank you."},{"Patient":"My joints are achy on the right side of my boddy, from my ankle to knee to hip, to back to shoulder.

It is sensitive to the touch but not with movement. It developed after 3 months of both arms falling asleep very easily and becoming numb when bent for long periods especially at night. This never used to happen. Recently a tingling sensation in my neck, shoulder and sometimes jaw has started and seems to be related to the forearm pain and rapid falling asleep of arms.","Doctor":"thanks for choosing HCM for your querryi understand your concern.Your forearm contains 2 long bones, many nerves and multiple muscles as well as ligaments and tendons that connect these structures together. Injury to any of these structures can be a cause  of pain between your wrist and elbow.In your case you didnt mentioned any history of trauma so other causes related to trauma are more unlikely but one cause is more likely as per your history and that is nerve compression at elbow joint. Nerve injury may occur with trauma, however is more commonly caused by compression -- prolonged pressure -- in the forearm. These nerves are often compressed in the elbow and wrist joints, causing pain along the forearm. These injuries also cause tingling or numbness, and eventually muscle weakness. Nerve compression injuries may be treated with physical therapy, however severe cases may require surgery. I would advise you to take simple analgesics as per need basis and get yourself examined by an orthopedic doctor in your area so that he may physically examine you.I hope i am able to explain your querry in detail but still if you have any ambiguity feel free to contact me.

I took more Motrin hoping it will ease up some.  Is there anything I can do to help this.   Never have I had pain like this.  Thank you.","Doctor":"Thanks for choosing healthcare magic.I understand your concern.Your pain is more likely due to muscle spasm of your neck as a result of poor posture during sleep. It is very painful condition but it is totally recoverable and is not associated with any serious complications.Following are some of the ways that can help you treat yourself.Stretching: Spasms are best treated with stretching exercises.Massage: You may be able to massage your neck yourself by finding the tight muscles and putting deep pressure on these muscles. You might also get a massage from a friend or therapist.Medicine: You started taking mortin but in addition to painkillers you need to take muscle relaxant too which i mostly prescribe is moovax (tizanidine) 2-4 mg twice daily for three days.Remeber Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) may cause stomach bleeding and other problems. These risks increase with age. Read the label and take as directed. Do not take for more than 10 days.Ice: Put an ice pack, gel pack, or package of frozen vegetables wrapped in a cloth on your neck every 3 to 4 hours for up to 20 minutes at a time.Moist heat: Sometimes, especially with recurrent spasms, moist heat can help. Moist heat includes heat patches or moist heating pads that you can purchase at most drugstores, a wet washcloth or towel that has been heated in the dryer, or a hot shower. Don’t use heat if you have swelling.Physical therapy: Your healthcare provider may recommend seeing a physical therapist for an exercise program and other treatments.Stress management: Neck spasms are a common physical symptom caused by stress or depression so try to avoid excessive stress.I hope my answer is helpful for you but if you have any ambiguity do contact me.

My opinion is that a vastus medialis strain would have healed with physical therapy, but a meniscal injury can cause persistent pain or discomfort. An MRI will give a definite diagnosis.

You should have gone to ER immediately to rule out a fracture of the lateral malleolus or other ankle bones, and have proper immobilisation and management.

My opinion is that burning pain with twitching is from irritation of the nerve. It can be due to a low back problem with resultant pressure on the sciatic nerve, and this leads to pain down the leg.

Abdominal pain can be cramp-like, achy, dull, or sharp. It is often called stomachache.These studies suggest that people who get frequent headaches may be predisposed to gastrointestinal problems.

It gives numbness in the thumb, second finger, third finger and half of the ring finger. If your numbness is on the fifth finger and other half of the ring finger that is ulnar tunnel syndrome which is compression of other nerve (ulnar) in the wrist.I would recommend to see a neurosurgeon or hand surgeon which will consult you and order nerve tests such as EMG and nerve conduction velocity studies. If these are the diagnosis, the initial treatment is non-operative with rest (splints, brace), anti-inflammatory drugs such as Ibuprofen. After 2 or 3 weeks if not better, I would do 2 cortisone injections around the nerve in the wrist region, 1 week apart from each other.If not better after the cortisone injection then I would start to discuss surgery. The surgery can be done by a hand surgeon or neurosurgeon or orthopedic surgeon. This is the treatment plan.Hope I have answered your query.

You should check out every night your feet if you have a starting pressure wound that you have not noticed before. Also, I would suggest you to use custom made shoe insert (insoles) which will help the comfort on the shoe.

I think you have trigger finger syndrome which is an inflammation of flexor tendon sheath caused by overuse (may be profession) and is manifested with locking of the fingers. In the beginning we treat it with medication and cortisone injection in the fingers, if no results found then we do a small surgery on the palm of the hand.

It does hurt when I'm Walking, but not so much when I'm sitting. And it hurts really bad when I touch certain spots. Is it broken?","Doctor":"Hello,Most probably it is not broken. It needs a more high energy trauma for it to break such as falls or car accidents. I think probably you had some muscle or ligament sprain or tear.

Since you had a compound fracture the most probable diagnosis is a post-traumatic arthritis which is that the joints involved in the fractures start to wear the cartilage surface and rub bone on bone. This is outcome in 20% of these fractures. The second option is that the pin left inside has migrated (moved) and causes pain and inflammation and need to remove it.

A kiropractor in Norwy Olso (where I live) said I should not have done this?? He recommended electtro shock treatment as a first step your thoughts would be most appreciated","Doctor":"Hello,I would like to know the diagnosis that your treatment doctor that did cortisone shots, gave you. I presume that it was epicondylitis either lateral (tennis elbow syndrome) or medial (golfer's elbow). Cortisone shots are indicated for both of them.Personally, I like to discuss with the patient other treatment modalities such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as Ibuprofen using braces or tennis elbow straps and other physical therapy devices such as ultrasound and magnet therapy. This may take longer to heal. If the patient is not willing to wait and prefers a quicker result, then I would do 2 cortisone injections one week apart (explaning the risks of cortisone shots). When your chiropractor says electroshock, I suppose he meant electrotherapy (tens), because electroshock is used in psychiatry patients.Depending on your time schedule that you want to spend with physical therapy it is not mistake to proceed with all the physical therapy appliances that I mention for 15 sessions. Then if no improvement you can do cortisone shots later. So I leave it up to the patient to decide if he wants to start with physical therapy first or cortisone shots first. It is not mistake either option.Hope I have answered your query.

I can only stand and bare weight for semi long periods of time. My question is last night I was lying down and I noticed my heel and my ankle was hot. It was litterally hotter than the rest of my body. What does this mean?","Doctor":"Hello,The hot sensation or local temperature in the ankle is one of the signs of the inflammation of the ankle joint and tendons. Other signs are swelling, red color, and pain. So presuming that you did not had a fracture 2 months ago (x-ray would show it), I think this is a bad ankle sprain that needed more careful treatment with bed rest the first days, ice pack and elevation of the leg above the heart level in the first weeks and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.May be you continued to go to work next day and standing all the day causes swelling and inflammation around the ankle.

When can I start full weight bearing?","Doctor":"Hello,Since your doctor removed these plates and screws I presume that the fracture was completely healed. Usually, I remove the metal implants when the fracture is healed and I tell the patient to start weight bearing after 2 weeks when you remove the skin stitches.There are other cases that we may remove the implants before the fracture is healed such as infection or allergic reactions from the metal. If that is the case I tell the patient not to weight bear after 2 weeks as usual but when the radiograph will show the healing of the fracture.Hope I have answered your query.

Usually, this happens after a high energy impact such as a fall or car accident. If so you cannot move the elbow or arm and it is very painful. I think you may have a lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) or extensor tendinitis which is overuse syndromes from your work or sport (tennis).The treatment of these syndromes is easy and simple.

In other words is overuse of muscle that participates in weight lifting activities. Maybe you are doing heavy weights or very intensive exercises.I would like to have more information regarding which movement causes you more pain. Is it painful when you lift the arm in front on the side or backward? It might be also biceps tendonitis if the pain is in the front part of the shoulder and pain is worse when you bend the arm against resistance.My initial treatment would be rest from weight lifting activities and switch to other sports such as running for a while.

Anterior cruciate ligament is the ligament that links the tibia bone and femur bone in the knee.When it is tear, the knee swells up immediately and you cannot continue the game. It causes the knee to \\"give away\\" often. If that is the case I would recommend to do an MRI of the knee and consult an orthopedic surgeon for possible treatment. The second option is a fracture of the bones around the knee that usually happen with a more high energy mechanism such as fall from height or car accident. Third option might be meniscus tear. Usually, the swelling of the knee here is not immediately like anterior cruciate ligament tear right away, but later in the evening or next morning.

Then you should start physical therapy. You mention that you have been on bed rest for several weeks which is not a good thing as it may increase the risk of complications of other things such as deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in your leg veins). The fact that you say the color of the leg below the knee is blue is a sign of poor blood circulation.

From the information you gave, the first diagnosis that comes in my mind is arthritis of the foot bones, could be mid foot, forefoot or hind foot. Normally, in the x-ray that you did arthritis should have been visible. The second option is stress fracture of foot bones, but only if you had prolonged walking or running recently. This cannot be seen on x-ray, but only on bone CT scan or scintigraphy.There is even more rare disease such as infection or tumors that need to be distinguish.

This is the cartilage on the side of the knee that may give you pain and limitation of range of motion. A second option and rarer might be an osteochondritis descant, which is a piece of cartilage that is detached from the knee and floats around the knee and may block your movements.Normally, a knee MRI would confirm or exclude any of these options.

Usually, this kind of hip pain travels down in to thigh and knee but not below the knee (unless you have knee arthritis too). Normally, a pelvic x-ray and consultation with orthopedic surgeon will confirm or exclude this diagnosis. If the pelvic x-ray does not show any hip arthritis then I would go to the second most common problem which is sciatica from lower back problems such as lumbar discal hernia or spondylarthrosis or other lower back problems.Even though you do not have any lower back pain, sometimes lower back disease can refer the pain to the hip, knee, and foot and toes like you have.

Maybe you did not use ice and rest that day so now the hematoma gets harder after 2 weeks. If you continued to walk and work the next day is normal for this situation to happen. Now this hematoma needs more time to be absorbed from your body.I recommend you to massage the place gently 3 or 4 times a day and use warm therapy.

I foolishly did not rest it properly when I first did it, but I did use a cold compress at the time of injury. The following day I had an egg sized swell on my outer ankle bone. I continued to play roller derby at least once a week, avoiding certain moves which enhance the permanent mostly low level pain I suffer. I have not seen a doctor, because I convinced myself that it was just a sprain and it will get better eventually. I stopped doing most other forms of exercise when I got the injury, because of the pain, but roller derby is my life, and have found it impossible not to take part except for a four week rest period the whole team have had over Christmas. Of course I thought my ankle would fix itself during this time, but actually it feels worse some days. There is a constant almost burning sensation over the ankle bone which hugely intensifies and take hours to settle if I accidently put pressure on my ankle, for example, crouching down to pick something up with my foot flat on the floor, or walking down stairs. It has always be most uncomfortable at bedtime, throughout the night and mild (ish) and irritating pain often wakes me up several times. So I guess this problem is not just going to go away now and you are going to advise me to see a doctor, right?! It may be worth mentioning that a visit to the doctors where I live cost £40 each time, and I guess another reason for not going to see my doctor is the belief that I would have had to visit several times with this problem, and it still not being cured! Does this injury just sound like an aggravated sprain?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Based on the information that you give about your injury it could be from a bad ankle sprain, syndesmosis injury, to ankle fracture.

I have seen many people with ankle fracture walking around and presenting to the doctor days after the initial injury with swelling and bruising of the ankle but still able to bear weight.I understand that it is expensive in your country to see the doctor. I would recommend you to first do the x-ray of ankle to rule out the fracture. If x-ray is okay than we are left with the option of a bad ankle sprain not treated properly with rest 3 to 6 weeks and then physical therapy.

This means that you have neck pain especially, it aggravates when you move your head and neck from some sleep positions or when you wake up from the bed in the morning. When it has radical compression that means that the root of the nerves gets compressed, the pain radiates in the arm. This is called cervical radiculitis. The pain is associated with numbness. In order to find the cause it is important to do radiography in 4 positions: profile, in front, oblique dexter, and oblique sinister to see how the space between the vertebras is narrowed, to see the presence of osteophytes, and to do the differential diagnosis of the cervical syndrome. The three most frequent diseases are: the degeneration of the discs, spondylarthrosis cervicalis, which happens mostly in people over age 40 years old, and discal cervical hernia. Then the doctor will find the cause and give a treatment by doing a differential diagnosis.

Should I make appt. w/ my doctor?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.The main cause of this bump behind your knee is what a Baker's cyst which is increased synovial fluid of the knee which accumulated behind the knee but originated from inside the knee. This is not problematic. Main cause may be due to overuse activities or arthritis.Other less common conditions are vascular problems such as aneurysm or varicose veins. A Doppler ultrasound examination will rule these blood vessels conditions.My opinion is that you go to the doctor and exclude the vascular problems. Then if Baker's cyst results, you can treat it first with anti-inflammatory medication and if persist then surgery is the next step.Wish you quick recovery.Hope I have answered your query.

ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD DO?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Usually, advanced arthritis means the bones wear out so much that is rubbing bone against bone in the small joints of the spine. Also, it may have osteophytes that are bone spur that create more stiffness in the neck. Besides your physical therapy you can add medication from mouth such as Tylenol or Ibuprofen.If the pain does not go away after 1 month then I would do a neck MRI to exclude any cervical disc hernia that may need surgery.Wish you quick recovery.Hope I have answered your query.

He also constantly moves his feet and toes without being conscientious of doing so. what would cause the numbness and tingling in these toes on both feet? What is restless leg syndrome ?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.I would like to have more detailed information about it. For example, the time when it happens. If these symptoms happen during the sleep then this is strong evidence that it might be the restless leg syndrome. This syndrome urges the person to keep moving the leg and may wake him up from the sleep or have difficulty to sleep. It may happen also during the daytime and the person constantly moves the legs and pace the floor.In fact, women are more affected than men.This is a diagnosis made by the doctor not with any blood test or examination, but only through the history and interview. So, I would first exclude 2 other conditions such as diabetes and lower back discal hernia and then would conclude that this is restless leg syndrome.Hope I have answered your query.

By the end of the 8 hr drive, I could hardly walk on it. The pain has not completely gone away at all & sometimes it s as bad as it started. It feels like I tripped over a cord or vine, but I didn t. I m wondering what it is?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.I would like to know more information such as swelling, redness of the skin, and fever. Also, if you have a previous history of trauma or sprain in your ankle.Anyway based on limited information that you gave, the only conditions that comes in my mind is deep vein thrombosis or thrombophlebitis. This is a condition that happens in long hours of flight or position of legs downward and small blood clots are created in the deep veins of the leg causing pain, swelling, and redness of the skin.Usually, a Doppler ultrasound and blood test can confirm or exclude this diagnosis. The second option might be a lower back discal hernia but the pain pattern would be a bit different like you are describing. Sometimes, long drive can aggravate discal lumbar hernia so an MRI of the lower back would exclude that diagnosis.Hope I have answered your query.

He needs an urgent CT scan , and if the appendicular abscess it present , it has to be drained immediately otherwise this will be life-threatening. Septic Shock, green stools, painful urination are all indicating this. Request the Surgeon to operate him the moment they feel he can be.

Timely intervention will save him"},{"Patient":"Hi I have very tired legs with a slight burning sensation this has been going on for a few months and I am getting a burning on the medial aspect of my right foot from the medial malleolus going up to the medial epicondyle. Several months ago I had a large bruise running along this same area. What do you think this is and what should I do.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Based on the information given I can suggest you the most probable diagnosis.First, I would think for a deep vein thrombosis or thrombophlebitis since your pain is on the medial side of the leg and you had a bruise some time ago. Usually, you would have swelling and redness and local temperature in that trajectory of vein. A Doppler ultrasound of vein of the leg would confirm that diagnosis.Second, I would rule out diabetes since you have numbness and burning sensation in the legs. Diabetes damages the peripheral nerves of the legs so you may have such symptoms. A complete check-up, blood analyses for diabetes would rule out that diagnosis.Third, option might be a spinal discal hernia of the lower back that compresses the nerve root of that region manifesting the burning sensation and numbness in your leg. An MRI of lower back may rule out that diagnosis. With limited information provided, I could come up with this three main possible diagnosis.Hope I have answered your query.

Maybe your foot was swollen on the cast and some type of secondary infection may have developed due to stasis (low circulation) and the doctor has given you 6 weeks antibiotics.To help that you should keep the leg up above the level of the heart and move the toes all the time to increase circulation. Some side effects of Keflex may be diarrhea, nausea, fungal infection from dysbacteriosis. If you have fever you should do blood tests for infection and see the doctor.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Edvin Selmani"},{"Patient":"Prolia.

Usually, the treatment is long and the improvement is gradual and not quick. Once a year you can do the DEXA (osteodensitometry) to see the effect of drop and to stop it.As all the drugs have side effects like dizziness, nausea, osteonecrosis (bone loss) of the jaw, etc.I suggest you to continue the treatment and do not interrupt it. You may be at risk of fracture. Consult your orthopedist and discuss the side effects if you have any and pros and cons of it.

Usually, the tingling or numbness sensation goes way after few minutes when you change the position of the leg or arm.You should not be concerned unless it happens too often even during the daytime when you are not sleeping.

Scaphoid bone is one of the small bones (bean shaped) near the base of the thumb and wrist.In the x-rays on the first day of surgery it may not be visible, but after 3 weeks and x-ray with magnification, doctors can see it if suspected.

Rotator cuff help the arm to elevate and can tear after a fall or even gradually from degeneration in older ages. The onset of it is not so much immediate as you describe.An MRI of shoulder would confirm or exclude this diagnosis.The second reason might be a nerve problem of brachial plexus that originates from the neck. Nerve compression syndrome of the cervical spine from herniated discs may cause such picture as you describe in some cases.Third cause cause might be from the disease of the brain such as tumors , stokes , bleeding , aneurisms etc.Again an MRI of Head and Neck would clarify your situation and exclude most of serious conditions affecting you.I wish you quick recovery."},{"Patient":"I have a burning sensation that runs from my cheeks down my neck, shoulders, arms to the back of my hands.

More rare cause may be an herniated cervical disc that may cause nerve compression/ impingement that radiates along the arm.If the pain does not resolve during the course of 3 or 4 weeks I would suggest you to go ahead with more investigation with examination and consultation.Meanwhile during this time you can take pain killers such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen.I wish you a quick recovery."},{"Patient":"my hands are weak sometimes its the left hand & sometimes its the right hand, i can't even drive car/bike or hold anything long enough because i totally loose grip & it eventually falls or i've to switch with my other hand, this all started back in 2010 when i collapsed after masturbating, I've also consulted a Dr & have done my EEG & CT scan and they're all clear, I dont knw what to do next. Plz Help","Doctor":"Hello,I am Dr. Selmani and I read carefully your question.I would like to know more information when you say doctors did CT scan, do you mean of the head or neck or both?.My opinion is that when you had the fall back in 2010 you may have damaged the neck and that may have caused an herniated disc that compresses the nerves the go along the arms causing weakens of the arms and hands. This may be confirmed with a neck MRI or CT scan.If you have done a head CT scan and EEG that does not exclude the neck problem that may have been missed.I suggest you to contact the orthopedic spine doctor to order an Neck MRI for you.I wish you quick recovery."},{"Patient":"My mom has been diagnosed with Fybromyalgia about 7 months ago so she always has head aches but they have been more severe just three days ago she started bleeding from the left side of her noes and is becoming more frequent and just today we discovered her left to be bleeding what could be the cause of this???","Doctor":"Hello,I am Dr. Selmani and I read carefuly your questions.in order to give you a better answer for your question, i would like more infornation regarding what medication takes your mother for fibromyalgia treatment.I presume that she is taking non steroidal antinflamatory drugs which may have side effects on rasing the  blood presure and making the blood thinner.So i suppose that this two side effects of medication may have caused the nose bleeding.I suggest you to check the blood presure and medication for fibromyalgia.All the best"},{"Patient":"I m a 44 year old formerly active male who used to play basketball and run 20 miles per week. I had an ACL and medial meniscus repair 12 months ago and a complete medial menisectomy 4 months ago. I m still having bone-on-bone pain on the inside of my knee, and haven t been able to do any athletic activity in a year. My orthopedist recommended gel shots? Any opinion if that will help?","Doctor":"Hello,i am dr. Selmani and I read carefully you question.It seems to me that due to sports activities and previous ACL and meniscus tears you may have developed also an early arthritis sighs even though you are young in age. it may have starteg as what we call chondromalatia or chondropathy which in the first stages is softening of the snoth layer of the joint cartlidge abd later erods more until the bone rubs agains bone.i would like to have more information from your previous arthroscopy.Anyway, since your doctor has recomended to you the gel injection which i think you mean Acid Hyaluronic, I suppose that during the surgery he has observed some sort of cartlidge erosion or wear so I would recommend you to go ahead and do the gel injection.Prior to that , you should discuss with your doctor about risk for any alergic reaction from the injection especialy if you alergic from eggs or chicken meet.The injection is in 2 forms. You can either do the single shot or 3 separated doses with 2 weeks interval each. The later one is more time consuming as you have to go 3 to 5 times to the doctor'office but has less chance for complicarion since the dose is smaller.The effect of the gel lasts 6 months at least and you may need to repeat it if pain continues.Also i would recommend you to take from month some pills with Condroitine and Glucosamine for at least 3 to 6 month to help regenerate the smoth layer of cartlidge.i wish you all the best."},{"Patient":"extreme pain30 yrs old.

The area under your skull is possibly where your cervical spine starts and meets the skull.

Nerve injuries during gynecologic procedures happen 1 to 2 % of cases.The nerve can  be damaged either by compression , or stretch or entrapment or even more rare from cutting the nerve or nomination of all these.Most of these complains will go away itself gradually over weeks until maximum 6 months, unless the nerve is completely cut.During this period I suggest you to keep moving and do exercise and walking and you can take some medication to calm down the nerve pain such as Lyrica ( Gabapentine).Sometimes treatment with complex of vitamins B will help the regeneration of the nerve.If the pain is the same after 6 months I suggest you to see a neurologist for further evaluation of the nerve status."},{"Patient":"My mom ,92 has a compression fracture in T 12.

What are your thoughts? She hates the way it feels around her neck and sternum area.","Doctor":"Hello ,I am Dr. Selmani and I read carefully your question.T 12 compression fracture happens from forces when spine bends forward so the purpose of treatment is to immobilize the spine with a brace in a position not to allow the patient to bend forward which may risk the patient to displace the fracture and cause nerve injuries.Usually the principle of these braces is the \\"three point pressure\\" like the tool that bends the wire.The brace should have 2 points of contact forward the body, which one is up in the sternum and one is down in the pubic symphysis in lower belly. The third point is on the back in the level of T12 vertebra that is compressed. The 2 points in front push the 3-rd point in the back of the brace to straighten the spine.Usually the brace should not be high until the chin but until the sternum.If it goes until the sternum you should shorten if possible or go to the ortho technician to repair it. Also your mother should not spend much time sitting in the first 3 months as this is a position that increases the forces of the spine to compress more the fracture. Your mother can do some back muscle strengthening exercises , walking and laying down.and some water aerobic or water gym exercises.I hope she will recover quickly."},{"Patient":"My son had just gotton over cellulitis in his foot,but was still taken his course of antibiotics.Yesterday,he went to stand up and had the worst pain around the heel of foot and ankle area...would that be associated with that?...or possibly plantar fascitis (sure i spelled that wrong).","Doctor":"Hello,I am Dr. Selmani and I read your question carefullyThe plantar fasciitis has other signs different with what your son presents.Usually plantar fasciitis pain on the heal is in the mornings , when you do the first steps and you feel like walking on nails , then after some minutes it warms up and the pain goes away. Females have more plantar fasciitis then males and overweight and sports activities on concrete are related with plantar fasciitis.Your son's pain looks different from plantar fasciitis.I would like to know what is the age of your son and what antibiotic he is taking. If he is taking Ciproflaxacin ( or other drugs from this family) and is young age below 12 years old, the antibiotic may cause Achilles tendon rupture and pain behind the heel.Also other information that I do not know is , how much lasted the pain , seconds , minutes ?.

Thank you for writing! Frim the signs, swelling, pain and warmth of the knee it may be an arthritis. When has the pain appeared? Are other joints involved? Does your daughter has stiffness when she wakes up in the morning? I suggest you to see a rheumatologist doctor. Diagnosis is made by clinical examination from an appropriate health professional, and may be supported by other tests such as radiology and blood tests, depending on the type of suspected arthritis. All arthritides potentially feature pain. Pain patterns may differ depending on the arthritides and the location. Rheumatoid arthritis is generally worse in the morning and associated with stiffness; in the early stages, patients often have no symptoms after a morning shower. Osteoarthritis, on the other hand, tends to be worse after exercise.Elements of the history of the disorder guide diagnosis. Important features are speed and time of onset, pattern of joint involvement, symmetry of symptoms, early morning stiffness, tenderness, gelling or locking with inactivity, aggravating and relieving factors, and other systemic symptoms. Physical examination may confirm the diagnosis, or may indicate systemic disease. Radiographs are often used to follow progression or help assess severity.Blood tests and X-rays of the affected joints often are performed to make the diagnosis. Screening blood tests are indicated if certain arthritides are suspected. These might include: rheumatoid factor, antinuclear factor (ANF), extractable nuclear antigen, and specific antibodies.Wish your daughter good health. Thank you!"},{"Patient":"I am diabetic. recently have changed/improved my diet, lost a lot of weight. Seem to have wrenched my back on one side. Now have pain from the left hip down to that toe.

The blood work was good high calestarol blood sugar ok thyroid ok what more should I do what could this bee I feel like its getting worse","Doctor":"Hi. The numbness and blue discolouration could both be due to be arterial insufficiency since they detected sluggish flow in the popliteal artery behind the knee. With a high cholesterol you may have plaques in the arteries and you need to work on bringing that down. Exercise is advised to help improve the pumping action of the muscles to improve blood flow.The buldging discs in the lumbar area can cause backache and pain radiating down your legs.I suggest get physio and good back care and strengthening exercises."},{"Patient":"My friend has muscle pain up when his leg meets his body .

Now @ that same area my skin is slowly losing color??? But the pain in my upper arm is my main concern.","Doctor":"Hi. Pain in upper arm when lifting your arm up could be due to impingement in the rotator cuff. These are the tendons of the muscles that attach in the upper arm to lift or rotate the arm. Tests by a doctor can help isolate which one is impinging, and usually a cortisone infiltration in the shoulder can help, plus physio. Discolouration is a worrying problem( left/right??) as that might be due to insufficient blood supply, or possibly side effect of the cortisone. You must have this assessed properly."},{"Patient":"I was kneeling, lost my balance, fell back onto my feet with my butt, and heard three loud pops in my knee (I \\"over-bent\\" my knee....

Now I have pain in my calf, my knee hurts, and there is a bruide around the area. I can walk, and stand on it, but my knee does not feel stable (feels like i bends backwards more than normal).","Doctor":"Hi. You could have torn a muscle(quadriceps) or the quadriceps tendon - hence the bump which is probably a haematoma(bleeding). With the unstable knee bending backwards, you could have torn one of the cruciate ligaments inside the knee, most likely the Posterior Cruciate ligament, which is responsible for stabilising backward movement of the knee. You need an MRI to assess the ligaments."},{"Patient":"severe pain I am a 23yo female with severe joint pain. the pain is in my arms, upper back, neck, and right leg. this is not a muscle ache it is an actual joint pain. the pain started last Saturday when I had a random rash appear on random spots on my body. the rash comes and goes but never appears in the same place, the rash is a red, raised, very painful circular like spot. since the rash has appeared the joint pain has been very severe the only time I get comfort is when I am sleeping.

Knee cap and inner lright side. When I fell, did not hear a pop; now however, I do hear some clicking when I extend","Doctor":"Hi. The hard lump could be the new insertion of the ACL where they attached the ligament - remember they drill the new attachment in and put a screw there, so that is expected. It is important to check if the attachments have not loosened to make that click. I advise you go back for a review by the Orthopod."},{"Patient":"I have been having pelvic pain now for a month.

A feeling of a tugging on testicles (both testicles). Sometimes sharp pain in lower groin area. The pain can last anywhere from a few minutes to a while.

I just looking for possible answers or suggestions i could bring up to general surgen when I go see him. Thanks","Doctor":"Hi. The surgeon will probably exclude the usual groin hernias - direct and indirect hernias. We also have what is called Gilmore's or Sportsmen hernia which is at the back of the inguinal canal and may not present with the usual bulge that inguinal ones have.

Low backache can be due to any one of the Spondylo-arthropathies like Ankylosing Spondylopathy and you need a proper evaluation and tests like ANF. A Rheumatologist can do these and then you will get proper medication to address the problem. Just getting pain medication will not address the real problem.

Then 2 years ago I had the other hip done and after I noticed that the leg between the ankle and knee is about 1 inch or more larger than the other leg, why is that?","Doctor":"Your dominant leg, calf or thigh muscles is expected to be slightly bigger in circumference than the non-dominant one. So after your 1st hip replacement you probably used the other leg more to compensate for weakness or pain on the operated side, hence the bigger muscle bulk. You should have a Biokineticist work on your muscle balance and strengthening."},{"Patient":"This past Friday I was in a motorcycle crash in which I broke 4 lower left ribs.

X-ray abdomen in a standing position to see any gas under diaphragm; this is the cheapest and the simplest investigation to see is there any perforation of the intestines, ground glass appearance of the abdomen in peritonitis or collection of blood.Ultrasonography of abdomen along with CT scan to confirm the diagnosis.

Presence of repeated carpopedal spasms with tingling sensations as your daughter has been experiencing can be because of chronic hypocalcemia. This is a condition where there are low blood calcium levels. There are multiple causes to this, starting from low dietary intake of calcium, to drug interactions with anticonvulsants,endocrine disorders to certain familial syndromes or kidney disorders. So i suggest you get her blood checked.Other associated manifestations in the body which can occur are coarse hair, brittle nails, mood changes and dry skin.

I am also menopausal. Approximately 3 years ago, I had similar symptoms and thought it was a long drawn out flue. Perplexed in MI. I am 47...","Doctor":"Hi there. Firstly congratulations on losing an appreciable amount of weight. Keep it up and its really inspiring that you have managed to do so. Now coming to your problems.From what i have gathered after reading about your situation,you might be having a problem with your spine which may be compressing a nerve that supplies the area around the anterior aspect of the thigh, which is likely to be at the lower lumbar spine region. This problem could either be due to degenerative changes in your spine or a disc related problem. The thigh muscles are responsible for extending your knee and are part of the anti-gravity muscles that help you in standing up. Also given that you are post menopausal, i hope that you are taking supplements and adequate hormone replacement therapy. If not please consult your doctor about starting the same. Post menopausal osteoporosis can lead you to have compression fractures of the vertebrae and that may worsen an already underlying problem that you might have been having till now. If your problems are not progressively worsening, then conservative management with initial period of rest followed by physiotherapy for the back muscles such as extension exercises will be useful for you. Do remember some important danger signs, if you end up having any disturbances in your bowel/ bladder habits, such as loss of control, increasing frequency of urination or progressive weakness you will need to consult your doctor immediately. For your current problem, i suggest you get x rays of your hip joints and spine taken and get a neurological evaluation for the same.

My father had an accident more than two years ago. He fell off his motorbike, which resulted in a head injury. The head injury later caused paralysis that affected the left side of his body. He has not recovered from the paralysis since then, despite the fact that we got the services of many physiotherapists and consulted neurosurgeons. My father is nearly 67 and feels too much disappointed.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query.Paralysis occurs due to affection of certain part of the brain due to lack of blood supply to that part either due to a rupture of vessel or blockage. High BP is one of the reasons. In this case accidental injury has affected the area. Usually most of the coarse movements return fairly rapiidly as collaterals restore the supply. But finer movements may return very slowly or may not come back at all depending upon the extent of damage. There is no permanent cure for this condition. The return of movements and strength is a slow process. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I'm 9 dpo I have been having pinching like sensation in my sides when I lay down.

It is quite rare to see a yellow discharge in pure uti infection.One explanation i have is that is quite possibly a trichomonas infection of the vagina which has now involved the uti which explain your itching, discharge and burning urination"},{"Patient":"Hello Dr. Deepak. The orthopedic surgeon who did the knee replacement surgery (both knees) on mom 12 days back has prescribed wysolone. I realized that this is a steroid drug.

Thank you for your question.Let me start off by saying I am not DR. deepak and since you have posted this  question in a public forum any orthopedic surgeon can answer it.Post replacement steroids is rare as steroids decrease immunity by increasing blood sugar and inhibiting the production of white blood cells which fight off infection. Post replacement the chances of infection increase.The only conditions where steroids should be given is1) Your mother os a patient of rheumatoid arthritis and was on steroids before the operation2) She was on steroids for a different reason.STeroids , post replacement if given should not be given for more than 3 days and that too low dosage so please ask your doctor the reason for giving steroids and to stop them before 2 weeks are up"},{"Patient":"i have pain in my right side of my waist.its pain comes like a stitch settled in the side of the waist.three weeks ago i had an abortion using the pill method.i was about nine to ten weeks old.is it because of the abortion  the pain insist or is it something else.","Doctor":"Dear patient thank you for your question.THe pill method of abortion usually uses mifipristone and misoprostol and muscle cramping and myalgia is a known and fairly common side effect of both these medications.Therefore you are right when you say that is because of the abortion.Treatment is ibuprofen 800mg twice a day for a minimum of 4 weeksAlso please discuss this with your obgyn as soon as you can so he/she is informed about the complication"},{"Patient":"I have swollen glands on the left side of my neck, for 12 days now.

She is being operated and rod is placec in her leg. I want to know how much time will it take to heal the fracture that are totally broken. When will she be able to walk. Any suggestion that what we shud take care off.","Doctor":"Dear patient thank you for your questionSome tibial shaft fractures heal within 4 months, yet many may take 6 months or longer to heal. Here are some things to take care of during the recovery:Pain ManagementPain after an injury or surgery is a natural part of the healing process. Your doctor and nurses will work to reduce your pain, which can help you recover faster.Your doctor may use a combination of NSAID,opiods and local anaesthetics to improve pain relief, as well as minimize the need for opioids.Be aware that although opioids help relieve pain after surgery or an injury, they are a narcotic and can be addictiveEarly MotionMany doctors encourage leg motion early in the recovery period.Physical TherapyWhile you are wearing your cast or splint, you will likely lose muscle strength in the injured area. Exercises during the healing process and after your cast is removed are important. They will help you restore normal muscle strength, joint motion, and flexibility.Weight BearingWhen you begin walking, you will most likely need to use crutches or a walker.It is very important to follow your doctor's instructions for putting weight on your injured leg to avoid problems. Fracture pain usually stops long before the bone is solid enough to handle the stresses of everyday activities. If the bone is not healed and you put weight on it too soon, it could fail to heal. If that occurs, you may need a secondary surgical procedure, such as bone grafting or revision fixation.I hope this helped"},{"Patient":"I have a sore thumb (alOng the outside) it feels a bit numb but more like its bruised. Its been this way for about a month. I think i have either been bitten by something or i have a splinter as theres a small black dot in my thumb print and its a little raised. Is it something i should be worried about?","Doctor":"Dear patientA black raised dot certainly signifies a trauma of some kind and as you rightly pointed out a splinter or a bite.If it is indeed a splinter it could become infected easily and the only solution is getting it removed under sterile measures.A feeling of numbness is due to involvement if a nerve and this could be due to impingement by the local swelling.Therefore take ibuprofen 800mg twice a day and see if it helps with the numbness as well. Also go see your go to remove what is possibly a splinter"},{"Patient":"I'm having pain in the very lower part of abdomen. Between bellybutton and groin. Painful to walk, painful to push on.

The length of your treatment with oral antibiotics will depend on the severity of your condition. Even if symptoms improve within a few days, it’s important to take all of the medication prescribed to ensure proper treatment. While you’re taking antibiotics, monitor your condition to see if symptoms improve. In most cases, symptoms will improve or disappear within a few days.In some cases, pain relievers are prescribed. You should rest until your symptoms improve. While you rest, you should raise the affected limb higher than your heart to reduce any swelling.Contact your doctor immediately if you don’t respond to treatment within three days after beginning a round of antibiotics, if your symptoms get worse, or if you develop a fever.Cellulitis should go away within seven to 10 days of starting antibiotics. Longer treatment could be necessary if your infection is severe. This can occur if you suffer from a chronic disease or if your immune system isn’t working properly.
