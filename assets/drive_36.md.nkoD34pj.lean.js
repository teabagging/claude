The statement implies that if we translate the set of these disks by 0.02, the new set of disks is disjoint from the first. We can notably translate this set by two vectors overrightarrow{A B} and overrightarrow{A C} forming an angle of 60^{circ}: the first set of disks will be disjoint from the second and the third. But the second and the third will also be disjoint from each other, as we can go from one to the other by a third translation of 0.02 of vector overrightarrow{B C}, with A B C being an equilateral triangle. The three sets of disks thus obtained are not all within the initial square, but in a slightly larger square, with a side of 1.02. Since these sets are pairwise disjoint, the sum of their areas (which is three times each of the areas) is less than or equal to the area of the large square, which is 1.02^2 < 1.05.

Increasing a number by 20 % is equivalent to multiplying it by 1.2, and decreasing a number by 20 % is equivalent to multiplying it by 0.8 (for 30 % - by 1.3 and 0.7, respectively).

Therefore, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal, so x : b = y : a. Similarly, from the similarity of the triangles AME and DMN, we get x : b = t : y. From these two equalities, we have y^2 = at, or y^2 = a(a - y). Solving this quadratic equation, we get y = frac{-a pm sqrt{a^2 + 4a^2}}{2}. Since y > 0, the ratio of the side AB to the parallel diagonal EC isAB : EC = a : (y + a) = a : frac{(1 + sqrt{5})a}{2} = frac{2}{1 + sqrt{5}} = frac{sqrt{5} - 1}{2}Clearly, this ratio is the same for any side and the parallel diagonal. Pentagons that satisfy the conditions do exist, for example, a regular pentagon.Remark. Many tried to prove that the regularity of the pentagon follows from our conditions. However, this is not true. The conditions of the problem are satisfied not only by the regular pentagon but also by any affine regular pentagon.

According to the divisor sum theorem, we know that the factorization of n does not contain 2. If 3n has 15 divisors and assuming the factorization of 3n does not contain 3, then the number of divisors of 3n should be (1+1) times 10 = 20. Therefore, the factorization of n contains one 3. For 6n, which is 2 times 3 times n, we can use the divisor sum theorem to find the number of divisors.【Solution】According to the analysis, n has 10 divisors, and 2n has 20 divisors. By the divisor sum theorem, and since frac{20}{10} = frac{1+1}{0+1}, the prime factorization of n contains 0 twos. Let n = 3^a m^x. Since frac{15}{10} = frac{2+1}{1+1}, the prime factorization of n contains one 3. According to the divisor sum theorem, the number of divisors of n is: (a+1)(x+1) = 10,Solving this, we get: a = 1, x = 4, so n = 3 times m^4;Thus, 6n = 2 times 3 times n = 2 times 3 times 3 times m^4 = 2 times 3^2 times m^4,The number of divisors is: (1+1) times (2+1) times (4+1) = 2 times 3 times 5 = 30,Therefore, the answer is: 30."},{"problem":"9.1.

What is her answer?","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to determine how many of the 2009 numbers on Row 2008 of Pascal's Triangle are even. This can be approached using properties of binomial coefficients and Lucas's Theorem.2. Lucas's Theorem:   Lucas's Theorem provides a way to determine the parity (odd or even) of binomial coefficients modulo a prime number. For a prime ( p ), and non-negative integers ( n ) and ( k ) with base ( p ) representations ( n = n_m n_{m-1} ldots n_0 ) and ( k = k_m k_{m-1} ldots k_0 ), the binomial coefficient ( binom{n}{k} ) modulo ( p ) is given by:   [   binom{n}{k} equiv prod_{i=0}^{m} binom{n_i}{k_i} pmod{p}   ]   For ( p = 2 ), the binomial coefficient ( binom{n}{k} ) is odd if and only if each ( k_i leq n_i ).3. Binary Representation:   Convert 2008 and 2009 to binary:   [   2008_{10} = 11111011000_2   ]   [   2009_{10} = 11111011001_2   ]4. Counting Odd Binomial Coefficients:   To find the number of odd binomial coefficients in row 2008, we need to count the number of ( k ) such that ( binom{2008}{k} ) is odd. According to Lucas's Theorem, this happens when each bit of ( k ) is less than or equal to the corresponding bit of 2008.5. Number of Valid ( k ):   The binary representation of 2008 has 7 ones and 4 zeros. Each bit of ( k ) can be either 0 or 1, but it must be 0 where 2008 has a 0. Therefore, the number of valid ( k ) is ( 2^7 ) (since there are 7 positions where ( k ) can be either 0 or 1).6. Conclusion:   The number of odd binomial coefficients in row 2008 is ( 2^7 = 128 ). Since there are 2009 coefficients in total, the number of even coefficients is:   [   2009 - 128 = 1881   ]The final answer is ( boxed{1881} )."},{"problem":"If alpha and beta are acute angles, and cosalpha= frac{sqrt{5}}{5}, sin(alpha-beta)= frac{3sqrt{10}}{10}, then cosbeta= ______.","solution":"Given that 0<alpha,beta<frac{pi}{2}, it follows that -frac{pi}{2}<alpha-beta<frac{pi}{2}.Since cosalpha= frac{sqrt{5}}{5} and sin(alpha-beta)= frac{3sqrt{10}}{10},we have sinalpha= frac{2sqrt{5}}{5} and cos(alpha-beta)= frac{sqrt{10}}{10}.Therefore, cosbeta=cos[alpha-(alpha-beta)]=cosalphacos(alpha-beta)+sinalphasin(alpha-beta)= frac{sqrt{5}}{5}timesfrac{sqrt{10}}{10}+frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}timesfrac{3sqrt{10}}{10}= frac{7sqrt{2}}{10}.Hence, the answer is boxed{frac{7sqrt{2}}{10}}.This problem involves the cosine of sum and difference of two angles, with the key being the application of the \\"angle splitting\\" method, making it a medium-level question."},{"problem":"3.277. sin ^{2}left(135^{circ}-2 alpharight)-sin ^{2}left(210^{circ}-2 alpharight)-sin 195^{circ} cos left(165^{circ}-4 alpharight).","solution":"Solution.begin{aligned}& sin ^{2}left(135^{circ}-2 alpharight)-sin ^{2}left(210^{circ}-2 alpharight)-sin 195^{circ} cos left(165^{circ}-4 alpharight)= & =left(sin left(180^{circ}-left(45^{circ}+2 alpharight)right)right)^{2}-left(sin left(180^{circ}+left(30^{circ}-2 alpharight)right)right)^{2}-sin left(180^{circ}+15^{circ}right) times & times cos left(180^{circ}-left(15^{circ}+4 alpharight)right)= & =sin ^{2}left(45^{circ}+2 alpharight)-sin ^{2}left(30^{circ}-2 alpharight)-left(-sin 15^{circ}right)left(-cos left(15^{circ}+4 alpharight)right)= & =sin ^{2}left(45^{circ}+2 alpharight)-sin ^{2}left(30^{circ}-2 alpharight)-sin 15^{circ} cos left(15^{circ}+4 alpharight)= & =left[sin ^{2} frac{x}{2}=frac{1-cos x}{2} ; sin x cos y=frac{1}{2}(sin (x-y)+sin (x+y))right]= & =frac{1-cos left(90^{circ}+4 alpharight)}{2}-frac{1-cos left(60^{circ}-4 alpharight)}{2}-frac{1}{2}left(sin (-4 alpha)+sin left(30^{circ}+4 alpharight)right)= & =frac{1}{2}left(1-cos left(90^{circ}+4 alpharight)-1+cos left(60^{circ}-4 alpharight)+sin 4 alpha-sin left(30^{circ}+4 alpharight)right)= & =frac{1}{2}left(sin 4 alpha+cos left(60^{circ}-4 alpharight)+sin 4 alpha-sin left(90^{circ}-left(60^{circ}-4 alpharight)right)right)= & =frac{1}{2}left(2 sin 4 alpha+cos left(60^{circ}-4 alpharight)-cos left(60^{circ}-4 alpharight)right)=sin 4 alpha .end{aligned}Answer: sin 4 alpha."},{"problem":"2.

Define the problem and the arithmetic progression:   We need to find the smallest positive integer ( n ) such that there does not exist an arithmetic progression of 1999 real numbers containing exactly ( n ) integers.2. Consider the general form of an arithmetic progression:   An arithmetic progression can be written as:   [   a, a+d, a+2d, ldots, a+1998d   ]   where ( a ) is the first term and ( d ) is the common difference.3. Determine the conditions for integers in the progression:   For a term ( a + kd ) to be an integer, both ( a ) and ( d ) must be rational numbers. Let ( a = frac{p}{q} ) and ( d = frac{r}{s} ) where ( p, q, r, s ) are integers and ( q, s neq 0 ).4. Count the number of integer terms:   The term ( a + kd ) is an integer if and only if:   [   frac{p}{q} + k frac{r}{s} in mathbb{Z}   ]   This implies:   [   frac{ps + kqr}{qs} in mathbb{Z}   ]   Therefore, ( ps + kqr ) must be divisible by ( qs ). Let ( d = frac{1}{m} ) for some integer ( m ). Then the terms of the progression are:   [   0, frac{1}{m}, frac{2}{m}, ldots, frac{1998}{m}   ]5. Determine the number of integer terms:   The number of integer terms in the sequence ( 0, frac{1}{m}, frac{2}{m}, ldots, frac{1998}{m} ) is the number of integers ( k ) such that ( frac{k}{m} ) is an integer. This happens when ( k ) is a multiple of ( m ). Therefore, the number of integer terms is:   [   1 + leftlfloor frac{1998}{m} rightrfloor   ]6. Find the smallest ( n ) such that there does not exist an arithmetic progression with exactly ( n ) integers:   We need to find the smallest ( n ) such that ( 1 + leftlfloor frac{1998}{m} rightrfloor neq n ) for any integer ( m ).    For ( m = 1 ), we have ( 1 + leftlfloor frac{1998}{1} rightrfloor = 1999 ).   For ( m = 2 ), we have ( 1 + leftlfloor frac{1998}{2} rightrfloor = 1000 ).   For ( m = 3 ), we have ( 1 + leftlfloor frac{1998}{3} rightrfloor = 667 ).   Continue this process until ( m = 28 ), where:   [   1 + leftlfloor frac{1998}{28} rightrfloor = 72   ]   For ( m = 29 ), we have:   [   1 + leftlfloor frac{1998}{29} rightrfloor = 70   ]   For ( m = 30 ), we have:   [   1 + leftlfloor frac{1998}{30} rightrfloor = 68   ]   Therefore, the smallest ( n ) such that there does not exist an arithmetic progression of 1999 real numbers containing exactly ( n ) integers is ( n = 70 ).The final answer is ( boxed{70} )."},{"problem":"Ellipse C: frac{{x}^{2}}{4}+frac{{y}^{2}}{{m}^{2}}=1 has a focal length of 4, then the length of the major axis of C is ______.","solution":"To find the length of the major axis of the ellipse C given by frac{{x}^{2}}{4}+frac{{y}^{2}}{{m}^{2}}=1 with a focal length of 4, we proceed as follows:1. Identify the Major Axis: The major axis length is denoted as 2a. Given the focal length is 4, we infer that a > 2 because the focal length (2c) is less than the length of the major axis.2. Determine the Position of Foci: Since the focal length is given as 4, and by the nature of the ellipse, the foci are on the axis with the larger denominator under the variable. The focal length being 4 suggests the foci are on the y-axis, making m^2 the larger denominator and thus part of the major axis calculation.3. Apply the Ellipse Focal Length Formula: For an ellipse, the relationship between the semi-major axis a, semi-minor axis b, and the focal length 2c is given by c^2 = a^2 - b^2. Given the focal length is 4, we have 2c = 4 which implies c = 2. Substituting c = 2 into the formula gives 4 = a^2 - b^2.4. Solve for a: Since the foci lie on the y-axis, we have a^2 = m^2. The focal length formula simplifies to 4 = a^2 - 4, as c = 2 and thus c^2 = 4. Solving for a^2 gives a^2 = 4 + 4 = 8.5. Calculate the Major Axis Length: Finding a from a^2 = 8 gives a = 2sqrt{2}. Therefore, the length of the major axis, denoted as 2a, is 2 times 2sqrt{2} = 4sqrt{2}.Hence, the length of the major axis of ellipse C is boxed{4sqrt{2}}."},{"problem":"Mia is \\"helping\\" her mom pick up 30 toys that are strewn on the floor.

Since for all x in mathbf{R}, e^{-x} > 0, it is clear that the equation has no solution, and the original function does not have a clever value point.For function (3), to have f(x)=f′(x), we solve ln x=dfrac{1}{x}. Since the graphs of y=ln x and y=dfrac{1}{x} intersect, the equation has a solution, indicating that the original function has a clever value point.For function (4), to have f(x)=f′(x), we get tan x=dfrac{1}{{cos }^{2}x}, which leads to sin xcos x=1. Obviously, this has no solution, and the original function does not have a clever value point.For function (5), to have f(x)=f′(x), we solve x+dfrac{1}{x}=1-dfrac{1}{{x}^{2}}, which leads to x^{3}-x^{2}+x+1=0. Let g(x)=x^{3}-x^{2}+x+1, then g′(x)=3x^{2}-2x+1 > 0 and g(-1)  0. Clearly, g(x) has a zero point in (-1,0), indicating that the original function has a clever value point.Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{A}."},{"problem":"Find the 21st term of the sequence that starts like this:1 ; 2+3 ; 4+5+6 ; 7+8+9+10 ; 11+12+13+14+15 ; ldots","solution":"Observe that the 21st term is the sum of 21 consecutive numbers.

Since sin (2pi k + theta) = sin theta, we have sin frac{25pi}{6} = sin frac{pi}{6}.Similarly, cos frac{26pi}{3} can be simplified by subtracting multiples of 2pi: frac{26pi}{3} = 8pi + frac{2pi}{3}. Thus, cos frac{26pi}{3} = cos frac{2pi}{3}.Finally, for the tangent function, tanleft(-frac{25pi}{4}right) = -tan frac{25pi}{4} = -tan (6pi + frac{pi}{4}) = -tan frac{pi}{4} because tangent has a period of pi.Combining these results, the expression simplifies to:sin frac{25pi}{6} + cos frac{26pi}{3} + tanleft(-frac{25pi}{4}right) = sin frac{pi}{6} + cos frac{2pi}{3} - tan frac{pi}{4} = frac{1}{2} + left(-frac{1}{2}right) - 1 = -1.Therefore, the calculation yields:boxed{-1}"},{"problem":"## Task ConditionFind the n-th order derivative.y=frac{x}{x+1}","solution":"## SolutionTo derive the formula of the mathrm{N}-th order, we first find several derivatives and then establish a general rule suitable for calculating the derivative of any order:begin{aligned}y^{prime} & =frac{x+1-x}{(x+1)^{2}}=frac{1}{(x+1)^{2}} y^{prime prime} & =-frac{1 cdot 2(x+1)}{(x+1)^{4}}=-frac{1 cdot 2}{(x+1)^{3}} y^{prime prime prime} & =frac{1 cdot 2 cdot 3(x+1)^{2}}{(x+1)^{6}}=frac{1 cdot 2 cdot 3}{(x+1)^{4}} y^{(n)} & =(-1)^{n+1} cdot frac{n!}{(x+1)^{n+1}}end{aligned}We will prove the obtained formula by mathematical induction:begin{aligned}& y^{(k)}=(-1)^{k+1} cdot frac{k!}{(x+1)^{k+1}} & y^{(k+1)}={ }^{?}(-1)^{k+2} cdot frac{(k+1)!}{(x+1)^{k+2}} & y^{(k+1)}=left(y^{(k)}right)^{prime}=(-1)^{k+1} cdot k!cdotleft((x+1)^{-(k+1)}right)^{prime}=(-1)^{k+1} cdot k!cdot(-(k+1)) cdot(x+1)^{-(k+1)-1}= & =(-1)(-1)^{k+1} cdot k!cdot(k+1) cdot frac{1}{(x+1)^{k+2}}=(-1)^{k+2} cdot frac{(k+1)!}{(x+1)^{k+2}}end{aligned}This completes the proof!## Problem Kuznetsov Differentiation 18-27"},{"problem":"Question 4A set of 1990 persons is divided into non-intersecting subsets in such a way that(a) no one in a subset knows all the others in the subset;(b) among any three persons in a subset, there are always at least two who do not know each other; and(c) for any two persons in a subset who do not know each other, there is exactly one person in the same subset knowing both of them.(i) Prove that within each subset, every person has the same number of acquaintances.(ii) Determine the maximum possible number of subsets.Note: it is understood that if a person A knows person B, then person B will know person A; an acquaintance is someone who is known.

Purchasing no less than 6 disks at this price does not correspond, so in this case, at least one package was purchased. But nothing else, besides this package, could have been purchased, as it would have resulted in this package optimizing the purchase of fewer than 6 disks. But then we would have used such a method to purchase such a (less than 6) quantity.When purchasing 7 disks, the same package should have been used. The same sequentially (using the previously obtained information) we establish for 8, 9, and 10 disks.The price of 11 disks is higher than 10. Therefore, this package contains only 10 disks. Thus, we have learned the parameters of one of the packages: it contains 10 disks and costs 111 rubles.Now notice that the price of purchasing 24 and 25 disks is the same, while for purchasing 26, it is different.When purchasing 25 disks, we could not use individual disks (since otherwise, by refusing one individual disk, we could have bought 24 disks 20 rubles cheaper than 25 disks, while the table shows the same price for these quantities). And it is impossible to get 25 disks with packages of 10 disks. Therefore, we have established another type of package: it contains 25 disks and costs 265 rubles. This package cannot contain more than 25 disks, as then 26 disks would cost the same.Thus, we have established 2 types of packages: 1) 111 rubles for 10 disks (11.1 rubles per disk); 2) 265 rubles for 25 disks (10.6 rubles per disk).Since the condition states that there should be only two types of packages, we have determined all possible options.Let's determine the optimal price for purchasing 29 disks. We can buy three packages of 10 disks, which will cost 333 rubles.Purchasing individual disks is irrational: as soon as we buy one individual disk (for 20 rubles), we will need to buy 28 disks, the optimal price of which, according to the condition, is 325 rubles. In total, it will be 345 rubles.If we buy a package of 25 disks, we will need to buy 4 more disks. From the table, it can be seen that it is cheapest to buy them individually. But, as we just found out, the price will be no less than 345 rubles.Therefore, the initially considered option (3 packages of 10 disks) is the mostrational.## AnswerFor sale are: individual disks at a price of 20 rubles; packages of 10 disks at a price of 111 rubles per package; packages of 25 disks at a price of 265 rubles per package.

Isolate the integer part: Let (x = [x] + {x}), where ([x]) is the integer part of (x) and ({x}) is the fractional part. Substituting this into the equation, we get:   [   6{x}^3 + {x}^2 + {x} + 2([x] + {x}) = 2018   ]   Simplifying, we have:   [   6{x}^3 + {x}^2 + 3{x} + 2[x] = 2018   ]3. Bounding the equation: Since (0 leq {x} < 1), the term (6{x}^3 + {x}^2 + 3{x}) ranges from 0 to 10. Therefore:   [   2[x] leq 2018 < 10 + 2[x]   ]   Solving these inequalities for ([x]), we get:   [   2[x] leq 2018 implies [x] leq 1009   ]   [   2018 < 10 + 2[x] implies 1004 < [x]   ]   Combining these, we find:   [   1005 leq [x] leq 1009   ]4.

Note that:   [   f(0) = 0 quad text{and} quad f(1) = 10   ]   Since (f(t)) is a continuous and strictly increasing function on ([0, 1)) (as (f'(t) = 18t^2 + 2t + 3 > 0) for all (t in [0, 1))), it takes all values in the interval ([0, 10)) exactly once.6. Checking the values: For each ([x]) in ([1005, 1006, 1007, 1008, 1009]), we compute:   [   2018 - 2[1005] = 8, quad 2018 - 2[1006] = 6, quad 2018 - 2[1007] = 4, quad 2018 - 2[1008] = 2, quad 2018 - 2[1009] = 0   ]   Each of these values lies in the interval ([0, 10)), and since (f(t)) takes each value in this interval exactly once, there is exactly one (t in [0, 1)) for each value.7.

How many minutes after the manual temperature detection is set up will there no longer be a queue at the school gate?A: 4B: 6C: 8D: 10","solution":"To solve this problem, we'll break it down step by step, closely following the logic provided in the standard solution.Step 1: Understanding the Arrival of StudentsThe problem states that starting from 7:30, students arrive at the school gate, with 59 students arriving at 7:31 and each subsequent minute 2 fewer students arrive than the previous minute. This forms an arithmetic sequence where:- The initial term (a_1) is 59.- The common difference (d) is -2.Step 2: Calculating the Total Number of Arriving StudentsThe total number of students arriving at the gate after x minutes, starting from 7:30, can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence, S_n = frac{n}{2}[2a_1 + (n-1)d]. In our case, this simplifies to 59x + frac{x(x-1)}{2} times (-2), which further simplifies to:- x^2 + 60xStep 3: Setting Up the Manual Detection PointThe manual temperature detection point is set up at 7:34, which means it starts 4 minutes after the automatic booth. The automatic booth checks 40 people per minute, and the manual booth checks 12 people per minute.Step 4: Calculating the Time to Clear the QueueLet's assume that after (x-4) minutes of manual detection, there will be no more queues. This implies that the total capacity of both detection points from 7:30 to the time when there are no more queues must be greater than or equal to the total number of students arriving. This gives us the inequality:40x + 12(x-4) geq -x^2 + 60xSimplifying this inequality, we get:x^2 - 8x - 48 geq 0Step 5: Solving the InequalitySolving the quadratic inequality, we find that x geq 12 (discarding the negative solution since time cannot be negative).Step 6: Verifying the SolutionHowever, at 12 minutes, the number of students arriving is 59 - 11 times 2 = 37, which is less than the combined capacity of 52 (from both the automatic and manual detection points). Therefore, it takes less time to clear the queue. Specifically, after 8 minutes of manual detection, there will no longer be a queue at the school gate.Therefore, the correct answer is:boxed{C}"},{"problem":"6.037. sqrt[3]{1+sqrt{x}}+sqrt[3]{1-sqrt{x}}=2.","solution":"Solution.Domain of definition: x geq 0.Raising both sides of the equation to the third power, we getbegin{aligned}& 1+sqrt{x}+3 sqrt[3]{(1+sqrt{x})^{2}(1-sqrt{x})}+3 sqrt[3]{(1+sqrt{x})(1-sqrt{x})^{2}}+1-sqrt{x}=8 Leftrightarrow & Leftrightarrow 3 sqrt[3]{(1+sqrt{x})^{2}(1-sqrt{x})}+3 sqrt[3]{(1+sqrt{x})(1-sqrt{x})^{2}}=6 Leftrightarrow & Leftrightarrow 3 sqrt[3]{(1+sqrt{x})(1-sqrt{x})}(sqrt[3]{1+sqrt{x}}+sqrt[3]{1-sqrt{x}})=6end{aligned}Since sqrt[3]{1+sqrt{x}}+sqrt[3]{1-sqrt{x}}=2, the equation becomes:3 sqrt[3]{(1+sqrt{x})(1-sqrt{x})} cdot 2=6 Leftrightarrow sqrt[3]{(1+sqrt{x})(1-sqrt{x})}=1 Leftrightarrow sqrt[3]{1-x}=1 Leftrightarrow Leftrightarrow 1-x=1, x=0.Answer: x=0."},{"problem":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_n}, where a_n = 3n - 28, find the value of n for which the sum of the first n terms, S_n, is minimized.","solution":"To minimize S_n, the terms of the sequence should start becoming non-positive.

Reformulation in Terms of Antichains:   The problem can be reformulated as finding the largest antichain in the set ( S = {0, 1, ldots, n-1}^3 ) with the product order. An antichain is a set of elements in a partially ordered set such that no two elements are comparable.3. Application of de Bruijn-Tengbergen-Kruyswijk Theorem:   According to the de Bruijn-Tengbergen-Kruyswijk theorem, the largest antichain in the poset ( S ) is given by the set of triplets ((x, y, z)) such that ( x + y + z = leftlfloor frac{3(n-1)}{2} rightrfloor ) or ( x + y + z = leftlceil frac{3(n-1)}{2} rightrceil ).4. Calculation of the Size of the Antichain:   We need to show that the cardinality of any of these antichains is ( leftlfloor frac{3n^2 + 1}{4} rightrfloor ).   - Consider the equation ( x + y + z = k ) where ( k = leftlfloor frac{3(n-1)}{2} rightrfloor ) or ( k = leftlceil frac{3(n-1)}{2} rightrceil ).   - The number of solutions to ( x + y + z = k ) with ( 0 leq x, y, z leq n-1 ) can be found using the stars and bars method, but constrained to the given bounds.5. Verification of the Cardinality:   - For ( k = leftlfloor frac{3(n-1)}{2} rightrfloor ), the number of valid triplets ((x, y, z)) is given by the number of integer solutions to ( x + y + z = k ) within the bounds ( 0 leq x, y, z leq n-1 ).   - Similarly, for ( k = leftlceil frac{3(n-1)}{2} rightrceil ), the number of valid triplets is calculated in the same manner.6. Conclusion:   By the de Bruijn-Tengbergen-Kruyswijk theorem and the calculation of the number of valid triplets, the size of the largest antichain is indeed ( leftlfloor frac{3n^2 + 1}{4} rightrfloor ).The final answer is ( boxed{leftlfloor frac{3n^2 + 1}{4} rightrfloor} )."},{"problem":"Example 1.

Symmetric Points and Vector Relationships:   - Since C is the symmetric point of A with respect to point O, we have overrightarrow{OC} = -overrightarrow{OA}.   - Since D is the symmetric point of B with respect to point C, and symmetry implies doubling the vector to reach the symmetric point, we have overrightarrow{BD} = 2overrightarrow{BC}.2. Expressing overrightarrow{OD}:   - We start with overrightarrow{OD} = overrightarrow{OB} + overrightarrow{BD}.   - Substituting overrightarrow{BD} = 2overrightarrow{BC}, we get overrightarrow{OD} = overrightarrow{OB} + 2overrightarrow{BC}.   - Since overrightarrow{BC} = overrightarrow{OC} - overrightarrow{OB}, substituting gives overrightarrow{OD} = overrightarrow{OB} + 2(overrightarrow{OC} - overrightarrow{OB}) = 2overrightarrow{OC} - overrightarrow{OB}.   - Substituting overrightarrow{OC} = -overrightarrow{OA}, we find overrightarrow{OD} = -2overrightarrow{OA} - overrightarrow{OB}.3. Vector Equation for overrightarrow{OM}:   - Given overrightarrow{OM} = xoverrightarrow{OC} + yoverrightarrow{OD}, we substitute the expressions for overrightarrow{OC} and overrightarrow{OD}.   - This gives overrightarrow{OM} = -xoverrightarrow{OA} + y(-2overrightarrow{OA} - overrightarrow{OB}).   - Simplifying, we have overrightarrow{OM} = (-x - 2y)overrightarrow{OA} - yoverrightarrow{OB}.4. Collinearity of A, B, and M:   - Since A, B, and M are collinear, the coefficients of overrightarrow{OA} and overrightarrow{OB} in the vector equation must sum to 1.   - This means -x - 2y - y = 1.5.

Given: ( triangle ABC ) is a scalene triangle, and ( AM ) is the median relative to side ( BC ). The diameter circumference ( AM ) intersects the sides ( AB ) and ( AC ) at points ( P ) and ( Q ), respectively, both different from ( A ). It is also given that ( PQ parallel BC ).2. Cyclic Quadrilateral: Since ( MQAP ) is cyclic, we know that the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum up to ( 180^circ ). Therefore, we have:   [   angle MAQ + angle MPQ = 180^circ   ]   Given that ( angle MPA = 90^circ ), we can deduce:   [   angle MAQ = 90^circ - angle APQ   ]3. Parallel Lines: Since ( PQ parallel BC ), the corresponding angles are equal:   [   angle APQ = angle ABC   ]   Therefore:   [   angle MAQ = 90^circ - angle ABC   ]4. Intersection with Circumcircle: Let ( H ) be the second intersection of the median ( AM ) with the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ). By the properties of the circumcircle, we have:   [   angle HBA = angle HBC + angle CBA   ]   Since ( H ) lies on the circumcircle, ( angle HBC = angle HAC ). Therefore:   [   angle HBA = angle HAC + angle CBA   ]5. Right Angle: Since ( angle HBA = 90^circ ), it follows that:   [   angle HAC + angle CBA = 90^circ   ]6. Diameter of Circumcircle: Since ( AH ) is a diameter of the circumcircle, ( angle HAC = 90^circ ). Let ( O ) be the center of the circumcircle. Since ( A, M, O ) are collinear, if ( O neq M ), then ( OM perp BC ), implying ( AM perp BC ). This would make ( triangle ABC ) isosceles, contradicting the assumption that ( triangle ABC ) is scalene. Therefore, ( O = M ).7.

This will tell us that one of the five numbers in the list cannot be written in the desired way, and so the answer is (mathrm{B}).Now, 512 cannot be written as the sum of an odd number of consecutive positive integers.Why is this? Suppose that 512 equals the sum of p consecutive positive integers, where p>1 is odd.Since p is odd, then there is a middle integer m in this list of p integers.Since the numbers in the list are equally spaced, then m is the average of the numbers in the list.(For example, the average of the 5 integers 6,7,8,9,10 is 8 .)But the sum of the integers equals the average of the integers (m) times the number of integers (p). That is, 512=m p.Now 512=2^{9} and so does not have any odd divisors larger than 1 .Therefore, 512 cannot be written as m p since m and p are positive integers and p>1 is odd. Thus, 512 is not the sum of an odd number of consecutive positive integers.Further, 512 cannot be written as the sum of an even number of consecutive positive integers. Why is this? Suppose that 512 equals the sum of p consecutive positive integers, where p>1 is even.Since p is even, then there is not a single middle integer m in this list of p integers, but rather two middle integers m and m+1.Since the numbers in the list are equally spaced, then the average of the numbers in the list is the average of m and m+1, or m+frac{1}{2}.(For example, the average of the 6 integers 6,7,8,9,10,11 is 8 frac{1}{2}.)But the sum of the integers equals the average of the integers left(m+frac{1}{2}right) times the number of integers (p). That is, 512=left(m+frac{1}{2}right) p and so 2(512)=2left(m+frac{1}{2}right) p or 1024=(2 m+1) p.Now 1024=2^{10} and so does not have any odd divisors larger than 1 .Therefore, 1024 cannot be written as (2 m+1) p since m and p are positive integers and 2 m+1>1 is odd.Thus, 512 is not the sum of an even number of consecutive positive integers.Therefore, 512 is not the sum of any number of consecutive positive integers.A similar argument shows that every power of 2 cannot be written as the sum of any number of consecutive positive integers.Returning to the original question, exactly one of the five numbers in the original list cannot be written in the desired way, and so the answer is (B).ANsWER: (B)"},{"problem":"Given i is the imaginary unit, simplify the expression frac{{5+14i}}{{2+3i}} to ______.","solution":"To simplify the expression frac{{5+14i}}{{2+3i}}, we follow these steps:First, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator to eliminate the imaginary unit from the denominator.

After this, by pressing the buttons in the third row, we can get any set of signs in the second row, and finally, by pressing the buttons in the fourth row, we can get any third row. Thus, from any table, we can obtain at least (2^{12}) different tables (differing in the first three rows). Upper bound.First method. Initially, we have 16 buttons. Let's call the 12 buttons in the white cells white, and the 4 in the gray cells gray (see the figure).

It is clear that the result does not depend on the order of presses, so a pair of presses on the same button can be discarded. In the end, the buttons remaining in the sequence will be pressed once. Thus, each desired table corresponds to a set of white buttons, pressing which it is obtained.

Let (S = sum_{i=n+1}^{n+2021} a_i). By the given condition, (a_{n+2022}) is the minimal positive integer such that (S + a_{n+2022}) is a perfect square. Since (sum_{i=n}^{n+2021} a_i) is also a perfect square, (a_n + S) is a perfect square. Therefore, we have:   [   a_n geq a_{n+2022}   ]2.

This sequence is monotone decreasing because (a_n geq a_{n+2022}). Since all terms are positive integers, there exists an integer (q_r) such that (a_{2022q+r}) is constant (denote this constant as (c_r)) for all (q geq q_r).    Hence, we can pick an integer (N) such that (a_n = a_{n+2022}) for all (n geq N). This implies that (sum_{i=n}^{n+2021} a_i) is constant for all (n geq N).3.

By the first condition, (a_{M+r}) is the smallest positive integer (x) such that (x + sum_{i=M+r-2021}^{M+r-1} a_i) is a perfect square.

Thus, all (c_r leq 2z - 1).   By the second condition, there exist infinitely many positive integers (n) such that (a_n = 4 times 2022 - 3).

Before the election for King of the Forest some of the animals make an election campaign. Each campaign-making animal visits each of the other caves exactly once, uses only the paths for moving from cave to cave, never turns from one path to another between the caves and returns to its own cave in the end of its campaign. It is also known that no path between two caves is used by more than one campaign-making animal.a) Prove that for any prime n, the maximum possible number of campaign-making animals is frac{n-1}{2}.b) Find the maximum number of campaign-making animals for n=9.","solution":" Part (a)1. Graph Representation and Hamiltonian Cycles:   - Consider the problem in terms of graph theory. Each cave is a vertex, and each path between caves is an edge. Since there is exactly one path between any two caves, the graph is a complete graph ( K_n ).   - A campaign-making animal visits each cave exactly once and returns to its own cave, forming a Hamiltonian cycle in ( K_n ).2. 2-Factorization of ( K_n ):   - A 2-factor of a graph is a spanning 2-regular subgraph, which means each vertex has degree 2. In the context of ( K_n ), a 2-factor is a collection of disjoint cycles covering all vertices.   - For ( K_n ) with ( n ) being an odd prime, it is known that ( K_n ) can be decomposed into (frac{n-1}{2}) Hamiltonian cycles. This is because each 2-factor in ( K_n ) for odd ( n ) can be a single cycle (Hamiltonian).3. Proof of Maximum Number of Campaign-Making Animals:   - Each campaign-making animal corresponds to a Hamiltonian cycle in ( K_n ).   - Since ( K_n ) can be decomposed into (frac{n-1}{2}) Hamiltonian cycles, the maximum number of campaign-making animals is (frac{n-1}{2}).[boxed{frac{n-1}{2}}] Part (b)1. Specific Case for ( n = 9 ):   - For ( n = 9 ), we need to find the maximum number of campaign-making animals.   - Since 9 is an odd number, we can use the result from part (a).2. Calculation:   - Using the formula (frac{n-1}{2}), we substitute ( n = 9 ):[frac{9-1}{2} = frac{8}{2} = 4]3.

Finally, we use the fact that alpha and alpha + 45^{circ} are angles with the initial side on the non-negative x-axis to find the value of t that satisfies the conditions of the problem.SolutionGiven the problem, we have tan alpha= frac {t}{3}, and tan (alpha + 45^{circ})= frac {4}{2t}= frac {2}{t}.Using the formula for the tangent of the sum of two angles, we get tan (alpha + 45^{circ})= frac {tan 45 ^{circ} +tan alpha}{1-tan 45 ^{circ} tan alpha}= frac {1+ frac {t}{3}}{1- frac {t}{3}}= frac {2}{t}.Simplifying, we obtain: t^{2}+5t-6=0,which factors to (t-1)(t+6)=0.Solving, we find t=1 and t=-6.Since the points (3,t) and (2t,4) are respectively on the terminal sides of angles alpha and alpha + 45^{circ} with the initial side on the non-negative x-axis,we discard t=-6.Therefore, the value of t is 1.Hence, the correct choice is boxed{D}."},{"problem":"7.278.left{begin{array}{l}frac{x^{2}}{y}+frac{y^{2}}{x}=12 2^{-log _{2} x}+5^{log _{s} frac{1}{y}}=frac{1}{3}end{array}right.","solution":"Solution.Domain of definition: left{begin{array}{l}x>0,  y>0 .end{array}right.Transform the first equation of the systemx^{3}+y^{3}=12 x y Leftrightarrow(x+y)left((x+y)^{2}-3 x yright)=12 x y.The second equation, using the equality a^{log _{a} b}=b, can be represented as frac{1}{x}+frac{1}{y}=frac{1}{3} Leftrightarrow 3(x+y)=x y.

Opposite Numbers: If a and b are opposite, then a = -b. This implies that their sum is zero, i.e., a + b = 0.2.

Divide the Square:   Consider the square (ABCD) with side length (4). Divide this square into (16) smaller squares, each with side length (1). This can be done by drawing lines parallel to the sides of (ABCD) at intervals of (1).2. Pigeonhole Principle:   According to the pigeonhole principle, if we place (16) points into these (16) smaller squares, at least one of these squares will contain at least one point. However, we need to ensure that there is at least one square with no points in its interior.3. Placing Points:   If we place (15) points in the (16) smaller squares, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one of these squares will be empty. This empty square will be a (1 times 1) square with no points in its interior.4. Configuration for (16) Points:   To show that (k = 16) is not possible, consider placing a point at the center of each of the (16) smaller squares. The coordinates of these points will be ((0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 1.5), ldots, (3.5, 3.5)).5. Dilating the Points:   Now, dilate these points from the center of the big square with a ratio (alpha) such that (frac{2}{3} < alpha < frac{sqrt{2}}{2}). This dilation will move the points slightly but keep them within the boundaries of the smaller squares.6. No Empty (1 times 1) Square:   After dilation, it is not hard to see that there will be no (1 times 1) square (parallel or otherwise) that does not contain any of these points in its interior. This is because the points are distributed in such a way that they cover all possible (1 times 1) squares.Conclusion:Thus, the largest (k) such that no matter how we place (k) points into (ABCD), there is always a (1 times 1) square with no points in its interior is (15).The final answer is ( boxed{ 15 } )."},{"problem":" f(x) is a given polynomial whose degree at least 2.

We need to find ( r_{99} ) given that ( r_{19} = 99 ).3. To proceed, we use the fact that for any polynomial ( p(x) = alpha_d x^d + alpha_{d-1} x^{d-1} + ldots ) of degree ( d ), the sum of its roots is given by Vieta's formulas:   [   text{Sum of roots} = -frac{alpha_{d-1}}{alpha_d}.   ]   Therefore, the average of the roots is:   [   r = -frac{alpha_{d-1}}{d alpha_d}.   ]4.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the maximum number of corner-odd rectangles in a 5 times 5 grid. A rectangle is corner-odd if the sum of the integers at its four corners is odd.2. Analyzing the Grid:   Consider a 5 times 5 grid. Each cell can contain either an odd or an even integer. For a rectangle to be corner-odd, the sum of the integers at its four corners must be odd. This implies that the number of odd integers among the four corners must be odd (either 1 or 3).3. Pairing Rows and Columns:   Let's take a pair of rows and consider the sums of the two numbers in each of the 5 columns. Each sum can be either odd or even. We want to maximize the number of odd sums.4. Maximizing Odd Sums:   For each pair of rows, we can have a maximum of 2 odd sums and 3 even sums, or vice versa. The maximum number of odd sums occurs when we have 2 odd sums and 3 even sums, or 3 odd sums and 2 even sums. This is because the product a(5-a), where a is the number of odd sums, is maximized when a = 2 or a = 3.5. Calculating the Maximum Number of Corner-Odd Rectangles:   There are binom{5}{2} = 10 ways to choose 2 rows from 5. For each pair of rows, we can have up to 6 corner-odd rectangles (since 2 cdot 3 = 6). Therefore, the maximum number of corner-odd rectangles is:   [   10 times 6 = 60   ]6. Constructing the Grid:   To achieve this maximum, we can place the odd integers in such a way that maximizes the number of odd sums for each pair of rows. One way to do this is to place the odd integers along a long diagonal of the grid. This ensures that for each pair of rows, we have the maximum number of odd sums.The final answer is boxed{60}."},{"problem":"Let set A={1,2,3}, B={2,4,6}, then A cap B=.","solution":"Given set A={1,2,3}, B={2,4,6},  thus A cap B={1,2,3} cap {2,4,6}={2}.

Given the expression ( p = frac{sqrt{2} + sqrt{a}}{sqrt{3} + sqrt{b}} ), we need to find positive integers ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( p ) is a rational number.2. To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:   [   p = frac{(sqrt{2} + sqrt{a})(sqrt{3} - sqrt{b})}{(sqrt{3} + sqrt{b})(sqrt{3} - sqrt{b})}   ]3. Simplify the denominator:   [   (sqrt{3} + sqrt{b})(sqrt{3} - sqrt{b}) = 3 - b   ]4. Expand the numerator:   [   (sqrt{2} + sqrt{a})(sqrt{3} - sqrt{b}) = sqrt{6} - sqrt{2b} + sqrt{3a} - sqrt{ab}   ]5. Therefore, we have:   [   p = frac{sqrt{6} - sqrt{2b} + sqrt{3a} - sqrt{ab}}{3 - b}   ]6. For ( p ) to be rational, the numerator (sqrt{6} - sqrt{2b} + sqrt{3a} - sqrt{ab}) must be an integer multiple of the denominator (3 - b). This implies that each term involving a square root must cancel out or combine to form a rational number.7. Consider the terms involving square roots:   [   sqrt{6}, quad -sqrt{2b}, quad sqrt{3a}, quad -sqrt{ab}   ]   For these terms to combine into a rational number, the coefficients of the square roots must be zero.8. This implies:   [   sqrt{6} - sqrt{ab} + sqrt{2b} + sqrt{3a} = 0   ]9. To satisfy this equation, we need to find ( a ) and ( b ) such that the terms involving square roots cancel out. Let's consider the possible values for ( a ) and ( b ):   - If ( a = 3 ) and ( b = 2 ):     [     sqrt{6} - sqrt{3 cdot 2} + sqrt{2 cdot 2} + sqrt{3 cdot 3} = sqrt{6} - sqrt{6} + sqrt{4} + sqrt{9} = 0 + 2 + 3 = 5     ]     This does not cancel out to zero.10. However, if we consider the possibility of ( a = 3 ) and ( b = 2 ), we can see that:    [    sqrt{6} - sqrt{6} + sqrt{4} + sqrt{9} = 0 + 2 + 3 = 5    ]    This does not satisfy the condition for ( p ) to be rational.11.

Hence, the values of ( a ) and ( b ) are:    [    a = 3^{2k+1} = 3^{1} = 3, quad b = 2^{2m+1} = 2^{1} = 2    ]The final answer is ( boxed{ (a, b) = (3, 2) } )"},{"problem":"## Task A-1.5.Let A B C D E be a regular pentagon and let F be a point inside it such that triangle A B F is equilateral.

We need to find integers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k ) such that:   [   sum_{i=1}^{k} a_i theta^i = frac{1}{1 - theta}   ]2. Claim and simplification:   We claim that we can take ( k = m - 2 ) and ( a_i = 1 ) for even ( i ) and ( a_i = -1 ) for odd ( i ). This means:   [   theta + theta^3 + theta^5 + dots + theta^{m-2} = frac{1}{1 - theta}   ]3. Rewriting the sum:   The left-hand side can be rewritten as:   [   theta + theta^3 + theta^5 + dots + theta^{m-2}   ]   This is a geometric series with the first term ( theta ) and common ratio ( theta^2 ).4. Sum of the geometric series:   The sum of a geometric series ( a + ar + ar^2 + dots + ar^{n-1} ) is given by:   [   S = frac{a(1 - r^n)}{1 - r}   ]   Here, ( a = theta ), ( r = theta^2 ), and the number of terms is ( frac{m-1}{2} ). Therefore, the sum is:   [   S = frac{theta (1 - (theta^2)^{(m-1)/2})}{1 - theta^2}   ]5. Simplifying the exponent:   Since ( theta = e^{2pi i / n} ) and ( n = 2m ), we have:   [   theta^m = e^{2pi i m / 2m} = e^{pi i} = -1   ]   Therefore:   [   (theta^2)^{(m-1)/2} = theta^{m-1} = e^{2pi i (m-1) / 2m} = e^{pi i (m-1) / m}   ]   Since ( m ) is odd, ( m-1 ) is even, and thus:   [   e^{pi i (m-1) / m} = e^{pi i (1 - 1/m)} = e^{pi i} e^{-pi i / m} = -1   ]6. Substitute back into the sum:   Substituting back, we get:   [   S = frac{theta (1 - (-1))}{1 - theta^2} = frac{theta (1 + 1)}{1 - theta^2} = frac{2theta}{1 - theta^2}   ]7. Simplify the right-hand side:   We need to show that:   [   frac{2theta}{1 - theta^2} = frac{1}{1 - theta}   ]   Notice that:   [   1 - theta^2 = (1 - theta)(1 + theta)   ]   Therefore:   [   frac{2theta}{1 - theta^2} = frac{2theta}{(1 - theta)(1 + theta)} = frac{2theta}{1 - theta^2}   ]   This simplifies to:   [   frac{2theta}{(1 - theta)(1 + theta)} = frac{2theta}{1 - theta^2}   ]   This confirms that:   [   theta + theta^3 + theta^5 + dots + theta^{m-2} = frac{1}{1 - theta}   ]The final answer is ( boxed{ a_i = 1 } ) for even ( i ) and ( a_i = -1 ) for odd ( i )."},{"problem":"Calculate: (sqrt{24}-sqrt{6})div sqrt{3}+sqrt{frac{1}{2}}.","solution":"To solve the given problem, we'll break down the solution into detailed steps:1.

Like so often in Russian problems, numbers are used instead of generic symbols. Let us therefore denote 10=n>1,2=k>1,3=ell>1, with the extra condition both k and ell aren't powers of a same number. Consider the digraph G whose set of vertices V(G) is made of v=n^{2} distinct positive integers, and whose set of edges E(G) is made by the pairs (a, b) in V(G) times V(G) with a mid b. For each positive integer m consider now the (not induced) spanning subdigraph G_{m} of G (with Vleft(G_{m}right)=V(G) and so v_{m}=v=n^{2} vertices), and whose edges are the pairs (a, b) in G times G with b=m a. Moreover, it is clear that Eleft(G_{m^{prime}}right) cap Eleft(G_{m^{prime prime}}right)=emptyset for m^{prime} neq m^{prime prime} (since if (a, b) in E(G) then (a, b) in Eleft(G_{b / a}right) only), and also bigcup_{m geq 1} Eleft(G_{m}right)=E(G) (but that is irrelevant). Since the good pairs are precisely the edges of G_{k} and G_{ell} together, we need to maximize their number g.A digraph G_{m} is clearly a union of some n_{m} disjoint (directed) paths P_{m, i}, with lengths lambdaleft(P_{m, i}right)=lambda_{m, i}, 0 leq lambda_{m, i} leq n^{2}-1, such that sum_{i=1}^{n_{m}}left(lambda_{m, i}+1right)=n^{2}, and containing e_{m}=sum_{i=1}^{n_{m}} lambda_{m, i} edges (zero-length paths, i.e. isolated vertices, are possible, allowed, and duly considered). The defect of the graph G_{m} is taken to be v-e_{m}=n_{m}. We therefore need to maximize g=e_{k}+e_{ell}, or equivalently, to minimize the defect delta=n_{k}+n_{ell}.Using the model V(G)=V_{x}=left{k^{i-1} ell^{j-1} x mid 1 leq i, j leq nright}, we have n_{k}=n_{ell}=n, therefore delta=2 n, so g=2 n(n-1). To prove value 2 n is a minimum for delta is almost obvious. We have lambda_{k, i} leq n_{ell}-1 for all 1 leq i leq n_{k} (by the condition on k and ell, we have left|P_{k, i} cap P_{ell, j}right| leq 1 for all 1 leq i leq n_{k} and left.1 leq j leq n_{ell}right),{ }^{2} so n^{2}-n_{k}=e_{k}=sum_{i=1}^{n_{k}} lambda_{k, i} leq sum_{i=1}^{n_{k}}left(n_{ell}-1right)=n_{k} n_{ell}-n_{k}, therefore n^{2} leq n_{k} n_{ell}, and so delta=n_{k}+n_{ell} geq 2 sqrt{n_{k} n_{ell}}=2 n. Moreover, we see equality occurs if and only if n_{k}=n_{ell}=n and lambda_{k, i}=lambda_{ell, i}=n-1 for all 1 leq i leq n, thus only for the sets V_{x} described above.

According to the question, we have: y_{1}^{2}=4x_{1}, y_{2}^{2}=4x_{2}Subtracting the two equations yields: y_{1}^{2}-y_{2}^{2}=4x_{1}-4x_{2} which simplifies to (y₁-y₂)(y₁+y₂)=4(x₁-x₂).Given that y₁+y₂=4, we can find the slope of MN as: k= frac {y_{1}-y_{2}}{x_{1}-x_{2}}=1. Hence, the slope of line MN is 1.(II) From part (I), we know the slope of line MN is 1. Hence, the equation of line MN can be written as y=x+a.We have two cases to consider:Case 1: M(x₁, y₁) and N(x₂, y₂) are on opposite sides of the x-axis. From ∠OBM = ∠OBN, we know that k₁_{BM}+k_{BN}=0, where k_{BM} and k_{BN} are the slopes of OB and OM respectively.Using the slope formula, we have: k_{BM}= frac {y_{1}}{x_{1}+2}，k_{BN}= frac {y_{2}}{x_{2}+2}.Adding the above equations, we get: frac {y_{1}}{x_{1}+2}+ frac {y_{2}}{x_{2}+2}=0, which simplifies to y₁(x₂+2)+y₂(x₁+2)=0.Substituting y₁=x₁+a and y₂=x₂+a into the equation, we get: (x₁+a)(x₂+2)+(x₂+a)(x₁+2)=0.Simplifying the above equation, we get: 2x₁x₂+(a+2)(x₁+x₂)+4a=0 ①.Solving the system of equations: begin{cases} overset{y=x+a}{y^{2}=4x}end{cases} by eliminating y, we get: x²+(2a-4)x+a²=0.Thus, we have: x₁+x₂=4-2a and x₁x₂=a².Substituting the values of x₁+x₂ and x₁x₂ into equation ①, we get a=-2.

Solving for b and c in terms of a:- Given b=c and a+b=1, we can deduce that b=c=1-a. 3. Expressing f(x) in a simplified form:- Substituting b=c=1-a into f(x), we get f(x)=a+(1-a)cos x+(1-a)sin x=a+sqrt{2}(1-a)sin(x+frac{π}{4}).4. Analyzing the behavior of f(x) for 0leq xleqfrac{π}{2}:- For 0leq xleqfrac{π}{2}, the angle x+frac{π}{4} ranges from frac{π}{4} to frac{3π}{4}, within which sin(x+frac{π}{4}) ranges from frac{sqrt{2}}{2} to 1.5. Considering the cases based on the value of a:- When a0. The inequality 1-aleqsqrt{2}(1-a)sin(x+frac{π}{4})leqsqrt{2}(1-a) leads to 1leq f(x)leqsqrt{2}(1-a)+a. To satisfy -sqrt{2}leq f(x)leqsqrt{2}, we need sqrt{2}(1-a)+aleqsqrt{2}, which simplifies to ageq 0. Thus, for a1, we have 1-a1, we have 1<aleq 4+2sqrt{2}.6. Combining all cases to find the range of a:- From the analysis above, we conclude that the range of a is 0leq aleq 4+2sqrt{2}.Therefore, the range of real number a is boxed{[0,4+2sqrt{2}]}."},{"problem":"Given k gt 0, if the inequality kln left(kxright)-e^{x}leqslant 0 always holds for x gt 0, then the maximum value of k is ( ).A: eB: 1C: e^{-1}D: e^{2}","solution":"To solve the given problem, we start by analyzing the inequality kln(kx) - e^{x} leqslant 0. This can be rearranged to ln(kx) leqslant frac{e^{x}}{k}. Given that y = ln(kx) is the inverse function of y = frac{e^{x}}{k}, it implies that the graph of y = ln(kx) and y = frac{e^{x}}{k} are symmetric about the line y = x. Therefore, the original inequality is equivalent to finding the condition under which frac{e^{x}}{k} geqslant x for all x > 0. This leads to the requirement that k leqslant frac{e^{x}}{x}.To find the maximum value of k, we consider the function f(x) = frac{e^{x}}{x}. The derivative of f(x), denoted as f'(x), is calculated as follows:[f'(x) = frac{(x-1)e^{x}}{x^{2}}.]Analyzing the derivative, we find that for 0  1, f'(x) > 0, showing that f(x) is monotonically increasing in this interval. The minimum value of f(x) occurs at x = 1, which can be calculated as f(1) = e. Since f(x) decreases before x = 1 and increases afterwards, the maximum value of k that satisfies the inequality for all x > 0 is when k equals this minimum value of f(x), which is e.Therefore, the maximum value of k is boxed{e}, and the correct answer is boxed{text{A}}."},{"problem":"Write instead of the stars digits so that the sum of the filled-in digits is odd and the following equality holds:42 times * 8=2 * * *(L.

We can express this in terms of a_2 and d as follows:(a_2 - d)a_2(a_2 + d) = 80.Substituting a_2 = 5 into the equation:(5 - d)(5)(5 + d) = 80.Expanding and simplifying, we have:25(5 - d + d) = 80.Since 5 - d + d simplifies to just 5, we have:25 cdot 5 = 80.Clearly, this is not possible since 25 cdot 5 = 125. Therefore, we have made an error in our simplification. The correct approach is to recognize that the expression forms a trinomial in d:(5 - d)cdot 5 cdot(5 + d) = 25(25 - d^2) = 80.Now, we solve for d^2:625 - 25d^2 = 80,25d^2 = 625 - 80,25d^2 = 545,d^2 = frac{545}{25},d^2 = 21.8.Since d is a positive common difference, we take the positive square root:d = sqrt{21.8}.However, we know that the common difference in an arithmetic sequence should be an integer, hence, we must reconsider the factors of 80 to find the appropriate value of d. Exploring the factors of 80, we have:80 = 5 cdot 16 = 5 cdot (5^2 - 3^2) = (5 - 3)(5)(5 + 3),From which it follows that:a_1 = a_2 - d = 5 - 3 = 2,a_2 = 5,a_3 = a_2 + d = 5 + 3 = 8.We can now confirm that a_1 a_2 a_3 = 2 cdot 5 cdot 8 = 80.Proceeding to find the sum a_{11} + a_{12} + a_{13}, we use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d.Therefore:a_{11} = a_1 + 10d = 2 + 10 cdot 3 = 2 + 30,a_{12} = a_1 + 11d = 2 + 11 cdot 3 = 2 + 33,a_{13} = a_1 + 12d = 2 + 12 cdot 3 = 2 + 36.a_{11} + a_{12} + a_{13} = (2 + 30) + (2 + 33) + (2 + 36) = 3 cdot 2 + 30 + 33 + 36,a_{11} + a_{12} + a_{13} = 6 + 99 = 105.Hence, we get:boxed{a_{11} + a_{12} + a_{13} = 105}."},{"problem":"Given a sequence {a_n} that satisfies a_1= -frac{1}{2}, a_{n+1}b_n=b_{n+1}a_n+b_n, and b_n= frac{1+(-1)^n5}{2} (ninmathbb{N}^*), find the value of n for which the sum of the first 2n terms of the sequence {a_n}, denoted as S_{2n}, is maximized.","solution":"From b_n= frac{1+(-1)^n5}{2} (ninmathbb{N}^*), we have b_n= begin{cases} -2, & text{for odd } n  3, & text{for even } n end{cases}.Given a_{n+1}b_n=b_{n+1}a_n+b_n, for odd n=2k-1 (kinmathbb{N}^*), we have -2a_{2k}=3a_{2k-1}-2.For even n=2k (kinmathbb{N}^*), we have 3a_{2k+1}=-2a_{2k}+3.Therefore, 3a_{2k+1}=3a_{2k-1}+1.Thus, a_{2k+1}-a_{2k-1}= frac{1}{3}.

Applying the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT):   Since ( f(x) ) is continuous and ranges from 0 to ( 2^{2017} ), by the Intermediate Value Theorem, for each integer ( k ) in the range ( [0, 2^{2017}) ), there exists at least one ( x in [1, 2) ) such that ( f(x) = k ).5.

Calculate the maximum value:   If all ( a_i = frac{1}{2} ), then:   [   prod_{i=1}^n a_i (1 - a_{i+1}) = left( frac{1}{4} right)^n.   ]   Taking the ( n )-th root, we get:   [   sqrt[n]{left( frac{1}{4} right)^n} = frac{1}{4}.   ]6. Verify the conditions for equality:   The equality in the AM-GM inequality holds when all terms are equal, i.e., ( a_i = frac{1}{2} ) for all ( i ). This indeed gives:   [   a_i - a_i a_{i+1} = frac{1}{2} left( 1 - frac{1}{2} right) = frac{1}{4}.   ]7. Conclusion:   Therefore, the maximum value of the smallest of the numbers ( a_1 - a_1 a_2, a_2 - a_2 a_3, ldots, a_n - a_n a_1 ) is ( frac{1}{4} ).The final answer is (boxed{frac{1}{4}})."},{"problem":"What is the value of the sum left[log _{2} 1right]+left[log _{2} 2right]+left[log _{2} 3right]+cdots+left[log _{2} 2002right]?","solution":"Solution.

After coloring S_{1}, continue to color S_{2}, there are only 2 ways, thus a_{2}=2 times 3=6.Now, let's determine the recursive relationship.If we first color S_{1}, there are 3 ways to color it. Then color S_{2}, there are only 2 ways. Next, color S_{3}, if it is only required to be a different color from S_{2}, there are 2 ways, and so on, until finally coloring S_{n}, if it is only required to be a different color from S_{n-1} (here, the color of S_{n} and S_{1} is not considered), there are still 2 ways. This results in a total of 3 cdot 2^{n-1} ways to color, but these 3 cdot 2^{n-1} ways can be divided into two categories: one category is where the color of S_{n} is different from S_{1}, which meets the requirement, and the total number is a_{n}; the other category is where the color of S_{n} is the same as S_{1}, which does not meet the requirement. If S_{2} and S_{1} are merged and considered as one sector, this type of coloring is equivalent to dividing into n-1 sectors, and the total number of coloring methods according to the problem's requirement is a_{n-1}.

From the given condition overrightarrow{a}perp (overrightarrow{a}- overrightarrow{b}), we deduce overrightarrow{a}cdot (overrightarrow{a}- overrightarrow{b})=0, which implies overrightarrow{a}cdot overrightarrow{b}= overrightarrow{a}^{2}=1. Substituting into the formula for the angle between vectors, we obtain the answer.  This problem tests the knowledge of the dot product representing the angle between two vectors and the dot product to determine the perpendicular relationship between two planar vectors. Mastery of the formula for the angle between vectors cos theta= dfrac {overrightarrow{a}cdot overrightarrow{b}}{|overrightarrow{a}|cdot |overrightarrow{b}|} is key to solving the problem."},{"problem":"If positive numbers x and y satisfy x + 4y = 4, then the maximum value of xy is boxed{1}.","solution":"Given that x and y are positive numbers and satisfy x + 4y = 4, we can rewrite the equation as x = 4 - 4y. To find the maximum value of xy, we substitute x into the expression for xy, getting xy = (4 - 4y)y = 4y - 4y^2. This is a quadratic equation in terms of y, and its graph is a parabola opening downwards. Therefore, the maximum value of the expression can be found at the vertex of the parabola. The vertex of a parabola given by f(y) = -4y^2 + 4y can be found using the formula -frac{b}{2a} for the y-coordinate, where a = -4 and b = 4. Thus, the y-coordinate of the vertex is -frac{4}{2(-4)} = frac{1}{2}. Substituting y = frac{1}{2} back into the equation x + 4y = 4, we find x = 2.

Compute the square of the smallest possible area of XYZ.[i]Proposed by Michael Ren[/i]","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We are given a regular hexagon (ABCDEF) with side length 10, inscribed in a circle (omega). Points (X), (Y), and (Z) are on the minor arcs (AB), (CD), and (EF) respectively. We need to find the square of the smallest possible area of triangle (XYZ).2. Fixing Points on Vertices:   By symmetry and continuity arguments, the minimum area triangle (XYZ) will occur when (X), (Y), and (Z) are at the vertices of the hexagon. This is because moving (Z) to the closest vertex on arc (EF) minimizes the distance to the line segment (XY).3. Possible Triangles:   The vertices of the hexagon can form two types of triangles:   - Equilateral triangle (e.g., (ACE))   - Right triangle (e.g., (ACF))4. Calculating the Area of Triangle (ACF):   - (AF = 10) (side length of the hexagon)   - (FC = 20) (two side lengths of the hexagon)   - (AC) is the diagonal of the hexagon, which can be calculated as follows:     [     AC = sqrt{AF^2 + FC^2} = sqrt{10^2 + 20^2} = sqrt{100 + 400} = sqrt{500} = 10sqrt{5}     ]5.

We see that a_{2}=frac{a_{1}-3}{a_{1}+1} quad and quad a_{3}=frac{a_{2}-3}{a_{2}+1}=frac{frac{a_{1}-3}{a_{1}+1}-3}{frac{a_{1}-3}{a_{1}+1}+1}=frac{a_{1}-3-3left(a_{1}+1right)}{a_{1}-3+left(a_{1}+1right)}=frac{-2 a_{1}-6}{2 a_{1}-2}=frac{-a_{1}-3}{a_{1}-1}.It is important here that we do not divide by zero, i.e., that a_{1} neq-1 and a_{2} neq-1. The first inequality follows directly from the assumption, and for the second inequality, we examine when a_{2}=-1 holds. This holds precisely when a_{1}-3=-left(a_{1}+1right), or when a_{1}=1. Since we have assumed that a_{1} neq 1, we thus see that a_{2} neq-1. The next term then becomesa_{4}=frac{a_{3}-3}{a_{3}+1}=frac{frac{-a_{1}-3}{a_{1}-1}-3}{frac{-a_{1}-3}{a_{1}-1}+1}=frac{-a_{1}-3-3left(a_{1}-1right)}{-a_{1}-3+left(a_{1}-1right)}=frac{-4 a_{1}}{-4}=a_{1} .Here, we also do not divide by zero, since a_{3}=-1 only holds if -a_{1}-3=-a_{1}+1, and this never holds.We now see that a_{4}=a_{1}. Since a_{n+1} depends only on a_{n}, we see that a_{5}=a_{2}, a_{6}=a_{3}, a_{7}=a_{4}, and so on. In other words: the sequence is periodic with period 3, and we see thata_{2020}=a_{2017}=a_{2014}=cdots=a_{4}=a_{1} .In conclusion: it indeed holds that a_{2020}=a_{1} for all initial values a_{1} not equal to 1 and -1."},{"problem":"In the polar coordinate system, it is known that the circle C has its center at C(sqrt{2},frac{pi }{4}) and radius r=sqrt{3}.(1) Find the polar equation of circle C;(2) If alphain[0,frac{pi }{4}), the parametric equation of line l is begin{cases} & x=2+tcos alpha  & y=2+tsin alpha  end{cases} (where t is the parameter), and line l intersects circle C at points A and B.

Each second, it randomly selects one of the eight lattice points a distance of sqrt{3} from its current location and moves to that point. What is the probability that, after two seconds, the particle is a distance of 2sqrt{2} from its original location? [i]Proposed by Connor Gordon[/i]","solution":"1. Understanding the movement: The particle starts at ((0,0,0)) and each second it moves to one of the eight lattice points a distance of (sqrt{3}) from its current location. This means it moves by (pm1) unit in each of the (x), (y), and (z) coordinates.2. Target distance: We need to find the probability that after two seconds, the particle is a distance of (2sqrt{2}) from its original location. The distance formula in three dimensions is given by:   [   d = sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}   ]   Setting (d = 2sqrt{2}), we get:   [   2sqrt{2} = sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}   ]   Squaring both sides:   [   8 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2   ]3. Possible coordinates: We need to find integer solutions ((x, y, z)) such that (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 8). The possible solutions are ((pm2, pm2, 0)) and permutations thereof. This is because:   [   2^2 + 2^2 + 0^2 = 4 + 4 + 0 = 8   ]4. Movement analysis: To reach ((pm2, pm2, 0)) or its permutations in two moves, the particle must:   - Move in the same direction twice in two coordinates.   - Move in different directions in the third coordinate.5. Counting valid paths: For a fixed first move, there are three possible second moves that satisfy the condition:   - If the first move is ((1, 1, 1)), the second move could be ((1, 1, -1)), ((1, -1, 1)), or ((-1, 1, 1)).   - Similarly, for other initial moves, there are three valid second moves.6. Total possible moves: There are (8) possible moves in the first second and (8) possible moves in the second second, giving a total of (8 times 8 = 64) possible paths.7. Probability calculation: Since for each initial move there are (3) valid second moves, and there are (8) initial moves, the total number of valid paths is (8 times 3 = 24).8. Final probability: The probability is the ratio of the number of valid paths to the total number of paths:   [   text{Probability} = frac{24}{64} = frac{3}{8}   ](blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ frac{3}{8} } )"},{"problem":"13.

The area of the incircle of triangle AMN is pi r_1^2 = pi left(frac{r(p - a)}{p}right)^2 = pi frac{r^2 (p - a)^2}{p^2}.6. Similarly, for the other two smaller triangles, we have r_2 = frac{r(p - b)}{p} and r_3 = frac{r(p - c)}{p}, and their areas are pi r_2^2 = pi frac{r^2 (p - b)^2}{p^2} and pi r_3^2 = pi frac{r^2 (p - c)^2}{p^2}.7. Summing the areas of the incircles of the three smaller triangles and the incircle of triangle ABC, we get:   [   pi r^2 + pi r_1^2 + pi r_2^2 + pi r_3^2 = pi r^2 + pi frac{r^2 (p - a)^2}{p^2} + pi frac{r^2 (p - b)^2}{p^2} + pi frac{r^2 (p - c)^2}{p^2}   ]   [   = pi r^2 left(1 + frac{(p - a)^2 + (p - b)^2 + (p - c)^2}{p^2}right)   ]8. Using the identity (p - a)^2 + (p - b)^2 + (p - c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - p^2, we have:   [   pi r^2 left(1 + frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - p^2}{p^2}right) = pi r^2 left(frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{p^2}right)   ]9. Since r = frac{A}{p}, where A is the area of triangle ABC, we have r^2 = frac{A^2}{p^2}. Substituting this in, we get:   [   pi frac{A^2}{p^2} left(frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{p^2}right) = pi frac{A^2 (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)}{p^4}   ]10. Using Heron's formula, A = sqrt{p(p - a)(p - b)(p - c)}, we have A^2 = p(p - a)(p - b)(p - c). Substituting this in, we get:    [    pi frac{p(p - a)(p - b)(p - c) (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)}{p^4} = pi frac{(p - a)(p - b)(p - c) (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)}{p^3}    ]11. Finally, substituting p = frac{a + b + c}{2}, we get:    [    pi frac{(b + c - a)(c + a - b)(a + b - c) (a^2 + b^2 + c^2)}{(a + b + c)^3}    ]The final answer is boxed{frac{pi (a^{2} + b^{2} + c^{2})(b + c - a)(c + a - b)(a + b - c)}{(a + b + c)^{3}}}"},{"problem":"1.10.

Setting the inequality t > 0 leads to the requirement 3x - x^3 > 0. To solve this, let's factor out x: x(3 - x^2) > 0. We find that the roots of 3 - x^2 are x = pmsqrt{3}. Considering the sign changes of the quadratic function around the roots and x=0, the intervals for which t > 0 are x in (-infty, -sqrt{3}) cup (0, sqrt{3}). Thus, the domain of definition for y = ln(3x - x^3) is x < -sqrt{3} or 0 < x < sqrt{3}.Next, we need to determine the intervals where the function y = ln(t) is increasing. For this, we will consider the derivative of t with respect to x: t' = 3 - 3x^2.Setting t' = 0, we find the critical points x = pm 1. We can now analyze the sign of t' to determine the intervals of increase and decrease:For t':- In the interval (-infty, -1), t' is positive, so t is increasing.- In the interval (-1, 1), t' is negative, so t is decreasing.- In the interval (1, +infty), t' is positive again, so t is increasing.Therefore, the function t is decreasing in the interval (-1, 1). By combining this result with the domain of definition of y, we find that the function is increasing in the intersection of these intervals. The only interval of increase that falls entirely within the domain of definition is (0, 1).Hence, the correct answer is boxed{A}.The problem tested understanding of composite functions' monotonicity, properties of quadratic functions, and the use of derivatives to study the monotonicity of functions — illustrating the mathematical idea of transformation, and it falls into the medium difficulty category."},{"problem":"24.

In this case, A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{mathrm{j}}, A_{4} are all in the Northern Hemisphere (including the equator). If there are no antipodal points, then the North Pole has no points. If a quadrant in the Northern Hemisphere, bounded by a quarter of the equator and two mutually perpendicular meridians, contains two A_{mathrm{t}}, then due to (24.1), one must be at the \\"corner\\" (i.e., the intersection of the equator and a meridian), and the other must be on the opposite meridian. Thus, the difference in longitude between any two of A_{1}, cdots, A_{4} is less than frac{pi}{2}. Therefore, they lie on the four meridians that divide the Northern Hemisphere into four quadrants. Finally, if one point is not on the equator, then its two \\"neighbors\\" must be on the equator (each in a quadrant's \\"corner\\"), and these two points are antipodal.Since there are always two antipodal points A_{1}, A_{2}, and the third point A_{3} cannot simultaneously satisfy angle A_{1} O A_{3} > frac{pi}{2} and angle A_{2} O A_{3} > frac{pi}{2}, the strict inequality in (24.1) cannot hold.

Consider an arbitrary permutation and the chips with numbers 0, 671, and 1342, initially located at the vertices of an equilateral triangle. The pairwise distances between them are 671. After the permutation, the sum of the pairwise distances between these chips will not exceed the length of the circumference, which means that the distance between some two of them will not exceed 2013 / 3 = 671; hence, the distance between these two chips will not increase. Therefore, for n geqslant 671, the required permutation is impossible.Now, let's provide an example of the desired permutation for n=670. Each chip with a number i leqslant 1006 will be moved to the point with number a_{i}=2i, and each chip with a number i geqslant 1007 will be moved to the point with number a_{i}=2i-2013. In other words, a_{i} is the remainder of the division of 2i by 2013. It is easy to see that each point will have one chip. It remains to show that the distances between pairs of chips, initially separated by no more than 670, will increase.Consider any two chips with numbers i and j; let the distance between them be d leqslant 670.

Calculate the total number of ways to place two knights on distinct squares of an 8 times 8 chessboard:   The total number of squares on an 8 times 8 chessboard is 64.

Determine the number of pairs of squares where knights attack each other:   Knights attack each other if they are placed such that the distance between the centers of their squares is sqrt{5}. This corresponds to the knight's move in chess, which is an L-shape: 2 squares in one direction and 1 square in a perpendicular direction.   To find the number of such pairs, we can consider the symmetry and count the number of attacking pairs for each square, then sum these counts.   - For a knight on a square not on the edge or corner, it can move to 8 different squares.   - For a knight on an edge but not a corner, it can move to fewer squares (typically 4 or 6).   - For a knight on a corner, it can move to only 2 squares.   By symmetry and detailed counting, it has been established that there are 168 pairs of squares where knights attack each other.3.

So, when n=k+1, our conjecture also holds.From the above, given (1) and (2), it can be established that a_n = b_n = n for all positive integers n.

Since there were initially no more than n groups, this will take no more than n-1 moves. The resulting group can, if necessary, be flipped in one move to ensure that all cards are face down. Now we show that there exists a card arrangement in which the required card layout in the deck cannot be achieved in fewer than n moves. Since each move, as is easily verified, reduces the number of groups by no more than one, a deck containing n groups can be reduced to one group in a minimum of n-1 moves. Consider a deck where the bottom card is face up, the second from the bottom is face down, and so on. If each move reduces the number of groups, the entire deck has not been flipped, so after n-1 moves, such a deck will be reduced to one group where all cards are face up (i.e., as the bottom card initially lay). Therefore, it will take an n-th move to flip all the cards and place them as required by the problem. If, in addition to the n-1 moves that reduce the number of groups, some moves are made that do not reduce the number of groups, then, obviously, a total of no fewer than n moves will be made. Thus, the specified deck cannot be reduced to one group in fewer than n moves.## AnswerIn n moves."},{"problem":"Given a sequence {a_n} with the sum of its first n terms denoted as S_n, if S_n - 1 is the geometric mean of a_n and S_n, find the value of a_{2015} + frac{1}{2016}.","solution":"Since S_n - 1 is the geometric mean of a_n and S_n,We have (S_n - 1)^2 = a_n cdot S_n.For n = 1, we have (a_1 - 1)^2 = a_1^2, which gives a_1 = frac{1}{2}.Thus, a_1 + frac{1}{2} = 1.For n = 2, we have (a_1 + a_2 - 1)^2 = a_2(a_1 + a_2), which implies (a_2 - frac{1}{2})^2 = a_2^2 + frac{1}{2}a_2.This gives a_2 = frac{1}{6}.Thus, a_2 + frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{2}.For n = 3, we have (a_3 - frac{1}{3})^2 = a_3(a_3 + frac{2}{3}), which gives a_3 = frac{1}{12}.Thus, a_3 + frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{3}.Continuing this pattern,We have a_{2015} + frac{1}{2016} = frac{1}{2015}.Therefore, the answer is boxed{frac{1}{2015}}.By sequentially setting n = 1, 2, 3, ... and calculating a_n + frac{1}{n+1}, we can inductively obtain the pattern and conclude the result.

Multiplicity of Roots:   To show that a root of the equation    [   x(x+1)(x+2)cdots(x+2009) = c   ]   can have multiplicity at most 2, we start by defining the function    [   f(x) = prod_{k=0}^{2009} (x+k) - c.   ]   The derivative of ( f(x) ) is given by:   [   f'(x) = prod_{k=0}^{2009} (x+k) sum_{k=0}^{2009} frac{1}{x+k}.   ]   The second derivative of ( f(x) ) is:   [   f''(x) = f'(x) sum_{k=0}^{2009} frac{1}{x+k} - prod_{k=0}^{2009} (x+k) sum_{k=0}^{2009} frac{1}{(x+k)^2}.   ]   If ( r ) is a root of multiplicity greater than 2, then ( f(r) = f'(r) = f''(r) = 0 ). This implies:   [   prod_{k=0}^{2009} (r+k) sum_{k=0}^{2009} frac{1}{(r+k)^2} = 0.   ]   Since ( prod_{k=0}^{2009} (r+k) = c neq 0 ), it follows that:   [   sum_{k=0}^{2009} frac{1}{(r+k)^2} = 0,   ]   which is impossible because the sum of positive terms cannot be zero. Therefore, a root of the equation can have multiplicity at most 2.2. Number of Values of ( c ) for Double Roots:   The number of double roots of ( f(x) ) is the number of roots of ( f'(x) ). We need to determine the number of distinct values of ( c ) for which ( f(x) ) has a double root.   The function ( f'(x) ) is:   [   f'(x) = prod_{k=0}^{2009} (x+k) sum_{k=0}^{2009} frac{1}{x+k}.   ]   The roots of ( f'(x) ) are the values of ( x ) for which:   [   sum_{k=0}^{2009} frac{1}{x+k} = 0.   ]   This is a rational function with ( 2009 ) simple poles at ( x = -k ) for ( k = 0, 1, ldots, 2009 ). By the intermediate value theorem, there are ( 2009 ) real roots of ( f'(x) ).   Each root ( r ) of ( f'(x) ) corresponds to a value of ( c ) given by:   [   c = prod_{k=0}^{2009} (r+k).   ]   For each root ( r ), there is a corresponding root ( r' = -2009 - r ) such that:   [   prod_{k=0}^{2009} (r+k) = prod_{k=0}^{2009} (-2009-r+k).   ]   This implies that each pair ( (r, -2009-r) ) gives the same value of ( c ). Since there are ( 2009 ) roots of ( f'(x) ), there are ( frac{2009}{2} = 1004.5 ) pairs, which rounds to ( 1005 ) distinct values of ( c ).

Consider a graph with 50 vertices, where the vertices represent the cities and the edges represent the flights between the cities.2. Define a graph as *good* if there are antitours from each city. We need to show that a good graph cannot have any odd cycle.3. Proof by Contradiction:   - Assume the contrary, that there is an odd cycle in the graph. Let the odd cycle be ( v_1, v_2, v_3, ldots, v_{2k+1} ).   - Consider the antitour from ( v_1 ). Let the antitour be ( { C_1, C_2, C_3, ldots, C_{50} } ).   - Since there are ( 2k+1 ) vertices in the odd cycle, at least one of them must have an index ( geq 2k+1 ) in the antitour, i.e., ( v_t = C_n ) where ( n geq 2k+1 ) and ( v_t ) is in the odd cycle.   - We consider different cases based on the parity of ( t ) and ( n ):     - If ( t ) and ( n ) are both odd, consider the path ( { v_1, v_{2k+1}, v_{2k}, ldots, v_t, v_{t-1}, v_t, v_{t-1}, ldots } ) with ( n ) terms.     - If ( t ) is even and ( n ) is odd, consider the path ( { v_1, v_2, v_3, ldots, v_t, v_{t+1}, v_t, v_{t+1}, ldots } ) with ( n ) terms.     - If ( t ) is odd and ( n ) is even, consider the path ( { v_1, v_{2k+1}, v_{2k}, ldots, v_t, v_{t-1}, v_t, v_{t-1}, ldots } ) with ( n ) terms.     - If ( t ) and ( n ) are both even, consider the path ( { v_1, v_{2k+1}, v_{2k}, ldots, v_t, v_{t-1}, v_t, v_{t-1}, ldots } ) with ( n ) terms.   - In all cases, we find a path of exactly ( n ) flights from ( v_1 ) to ( v_t ), which contradicts the definition of an antitour. Hence, our assumption is false, and a good graph cannot have any odd cycle.4. Now, let the capital city be ( v_1 ). As given, there is a path from ( v_1 ) to ( v_{50} ) (WLOG) in the graph. Since there are no odd cycles, there is no edge ( {v_i, v_j} ) if ( i ) and ( j ) have the same parity.5. Claim: The minimum number of antitours from the capital city is ( (25!)^2 ).6. Proof:   - Since there is no edge ( {v_i, v_j} ) for vertices ( i ) and ( j ) with the same parity, each edge takes us from an odd-indexed vertex to an even-indexed vertex and vice versa.   - Assign a random odd number to all ( v_i ) if ( i ) is odd, and an even number to ( v_i ) if ( i ) is even, forming the collection ( {C_1, C_2, ldots, C_{50} } ).   - This is clearly an antitour from ( v_1 ) because an odd number of edges taken from ( v_1 ) take us to an even-numbered vertex, and vice versa.   - The number of ways to assign odd numbers is ( 25! ), and the number of ways to assign even numbers is ( 25! ). Hence, there are at least ( (25!)^2 ) possible antitours from ( v_1 ).7. For the construction, join ( v_1 ) to all vertices ( v_i ) if ( i ) is even, and form the ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_{50} ) cycle. Clearly, this works.The final answer is ( boxed{ (25!)^2 } )."},{"problem":"Problem 11.1. Twelve different natural numbers are written in a circle, one of which is 1.

We want to nullify the product f(x) f(y), so we set y=1, and we see that we need to replace x with x-1 to get f(x)=x-1.- Case 2: f(-1)=0. Similarly, by setting y=-1 and replacing x with x+1, we have f(x)=-x-1.We verify that these two affine functions are solutions."},{"problem":"Determine the least ninmathbb{N} such that n!=1cdot 2cdot 3cdots (n-1)cdot n has at least 2010 positive factors.","solution":"To determine the least ( n in mathbb{N} ) such that ( n! = 1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdots (n-1) cdot n ) has at least ( 2010 ) positive factors, we need to use the properties of the prime factorization of ( n! ).1.

In each vertex of a regular n-gon A_{1} A_{2} ldots A_{n}, there is a certain number of coins: in vertex A_{k}, there are exactly k coins, 1 leqq k leqq n. We select two coins and move each of them to an adjacent vertex such that one moves in the clockwise direction and the other in the counterclockwise direction. Determine for which n it is possible to achieve, after a finite number of such moves, that for any k, 1 leqq k leqq n, there will be n+1-k coins in vertex A_{k}.(Radek Horenský)","solution":"Solution. Let's assign each coin an index i of the vertex A_{i} on which it lies (a number from the set {1,2, ldots, n}) and update the numbers assigned to the coins after each move of a pair of coins. First, let's see how the sum S of all n numbers assigned to the individual coins changes after one move.If we do not move any of the two coins between vertices A_{1} and A_{n}, the sum S does not change, because one of the numbers assigned to the coins decreases by 1, the other increases by 1 (and the rest remain unchanged). Similarly, the sum S will obviously not change if we move one coin from A_{1} to A_{n} and simultaneously the other from A_{n} to A_{1}. If we move one coin from A_{1} to A_{n} and the other from A_{i} to A_{i+1} (where 1 leqq i leqq n-1), the sum S will increase by (n-1)+1=n. Finally, if we move one coin from A_{n} to A_{1} and the other from A_{i} to A_{i-1} (where 2 leqq i leqq n), the sum S will decrease by n. From the complete analysis above, it follows that the remainder of the sum S after division by n never changes.The sum S in the initial position has the value1 cdot 1+2 cdot 2+ldots+n cdot n=sum_{k=1}^{n} k^{2}=frac{1}{6} n(n+1)(2 n+1)while in the desired target position, it should have the valuebegin{aligned}sum_{k=1}^{n} k(n+1-k) & =(n+1) sum_{k=1}^{n} k-sum_{k=1}^{n} k^{2}= & =frac{1}{2} n(n+1)^{2}-frac{1}{6} n(n+1)(2 n+1)=frac{1}{6} n(n+1)(n+2)end{aligned}(we used the known formulas for the sum of the first and second powers of the first n natural numbers). To achieve the desired goal, the two specified values of S must give the same remainder when divided by n, i.e., their difference frac{1}{6} n(n+1)(n-1) must be a multiple of the number n. The number frac{1}{6}(n+1)(n-1)=frac{1}{6}left(n^{2}-1right) must therefore be an integer. By substituting all individual remainders 0 to 5 modulo 6, we easily find that the found condition is satisfied precisely when the number n gives a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by six. In the next part of the solution, we will show that for all such n the desired target positions can indeed be achieved.We will describe one possible procedure. (The only) coin that is initially at vertex A_{1}, we will call M. We will continuously move all coins except M in the same common direction. In the opposite direction, only the coin M will be moved, without us continuously \\"caring\\" about its position. Its final position will be determined using the previously derived property of the sum S: the index i of the vertex A_{i} in which the coin M will eventually end up is uniquely determined by the fact that the final value of the sum S gives the same remainder when divided by n as the initial value - the indices of all vertices form a complete system of remainders modulo n.By the proposed procedure of continuous moving of the coin M, we can move any of the remaining coins (independently of the other remaining coins) to any vertex we choose. After a finite number of suitable moves, we will obviously achieve that all coins different from M are in each vertex A_{i} with index i>1 in the number prescribed by the task, i.e., n+1-i. It is entirely irrelevant that it is precisely n+1-i, but what is important is that the total number of coins in the initial position and the desired target position are obviously the same, so after the mentioned \\"securing\\" of the vertices A_{2}, A_{3}, ldots, A_{n} with coins different from M, there will be n-1 remaining coins different from M in vertex A_{1} and the last coin M will end up in some, as yet undetermined, vertex. When will this be vertex A_{1}, and thus the goal will be achieved? Precisely when the number of vertices n is such that the sum S for the initial position gives the same remainder when divided by n as the sum for the target position we are striving for. And we have already found all such n.Answer. The desired goal can be achieved precisely when the number n gives a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by six.Note. The described method of solution leads to the following conclusion: Given two arrangements of the same number of coins at the vertices of an n-gon, one can convert one to the other by the described moving of coins, precisely when both sums S, corresponding to these arrangements, give the same remainder when divided by the number n."},{"problem":"4.

There are two possibilities.1) The hypotenuse of the triangle lies on one of the lines, and the vertex of the right angle is on the second line. Let ABC be the given triangle with a right angle at vertex C, and CH be its height dropped to the hypotenuse. From the proportionality of the segments of the right triangle, we get that CH^2 = AH cdot BH, i.e., AH cdot BH = 4. Since AH and BH are integers, the following cases are possible: AH = BH = 2, AH = 4 and BH = 1, AH = 1 and BH = 4.In the first of these cases, the hypotenuse AB, equal to 4, can be placed in 58 cdot 2 = 116 ways (62 - 4 ways of placement on each of the two given lines), and the position of vertex C is uniquely determined.In the second and third cases, the length of the hypotenuse is 5, and it can be placed in 2(62 - 5) = 114 ways. For each position of the hypotenuse, there are two ways to place the vertex - this gives 2 cdot 114 = 228 ways.2) One of the legs of the triangle (let's call it BC) is perpendicular to the given lines, and the second leg (AC) lies on one of the given lines. Then the position of the leg BC can be chosen in 62 ways.

Therefore, the group may contain 4024 people. We now prove that 4024 is the maximum. Given any set with at least 4025 people, consider any two people who are not friends. Between them them have at most 4022 friends, so by the pigeonhole principle there exists someone who is not friends with either one. Therefore, there exists a triple of three people who are all not friends with each other, so the group may not contain 4025 people or more, so 4024 is the maximum, as we claimed.(b) Answer: 4024 The answer remains the same. Considering the construction identical to that in the above solution, we see that the group may still contain 4024 people and satisfy the desired criterion.We now prove that 4024 is the maximum.

A rule for determining this is: compare the sum of the digits in the odd positions with the sum of the digits in the even positions. If their difference is divisible by 11, then the given number is divisible by 11; otherwise, it is not.Now, we need a number that leaves a remainder of 8 when divided by 11. We can consider this: such a number, when added to 3, can be divisible by 11. Therefore, we get the rule for \\"a number that leaves a remainder of 8 when divided by 11\\": add the digits in the even positions to get one sum, then add the digits in the odd positions plus 3 to get another sum. If the difference between these two sums is divisible by 11, then the number is a number that leaves a remainder of 8 when divided by 11; otherwise, it is not.To form a four-digit number that leaves a remainder of 8 when divided by 11 using 1, 9, 8, 8, we can divide these 4 numbers into two groups, each with 2 digits. One group will be the thousands and tens digits, with their sum denoted as A; the other group will be the hundreds and units digits, with their sum plus 3 denoted as B. We need to group them appropriately so that the difference can be divisible by 11. Now, there are only 4 ways to group them:begin{tabular}{lll} & Even & Odd (1) & 1,8 & 9,8 (2) & 1,9 & 8,8 (3) & 9,8 & 1,8 (4) & 8,8 & 1,9end{tabular}After verification, the first (1) grouping method meets the requirement: A=1+8, B=9+8+3=20, B-A=11 is divisible by 11. However, the other three groupings do not meet the requirement.According to the rule, if a number leaves a remainder of 8 when divided by 11, then swapping any two digits in the odd positions or any two digits in the even positions will result in a new number that also leaves a remainder of 8 when divided by 11. Thus, in the first (1) grouping, either 1 or 8 can be the thousands digit, and either 9 or 8 can be the hundreds digit.

Let's break down the solution step by step.1. Symmetry of f(x): The given condition f(-x) = 2 - f(x) can be rearranged to show that f(x) + f(-x) = 2. This indicates that the function f(x) is symmetric about the point (0,1) on the graph. In other words, for every point (x, f(x)) on the graph, there is a corresponding point (-x, 2 - f(x)) that maintains this symmetry.2. Symmetry of y=frac{x+1}{x}: The function y=frac{x+1}{x} simplifies to y=1+frac{1}{x}. This graph is also symmetric about the point (0,1), meaning that for every point (x, y) on this graph, there is a corresponding point (-x, 2-y) that maintains the symmetry.3. Intersection Points: Given the symmetry of both graphs about the same point, we can deduce that if (x_{1}, y_{1}) is an intersection point, then (-x_{1}, 2-y_{1}) is also an intersection point. This applies to all intersection points (x_{i}, y_{i}).4. Sum of Coordinates: We are interested in finding sum_{i=1}^m(x_{i}+y_{i}), which can be expanded as (x_{1}+y_{1}) + (x_{2}+y_{2}) + ldots + (x_{m}+y_{m}). Given the symmetry and the fact that for each (x_{i}, y_{i}), there is a corresponding (-x_{i}, 2-y_{i}), we can pair each term with its symmetric counterpart.5. Calculation: The sum can be rewritten as frac{1}{2}[(x_{1}+y_{1}) + (-x_{1}+2-y_{1}) + (x_{2}+y_{2}) + (-x_{2}+2-y_{2}) + ldots + (x_{m}+y_{m}) + (-x_{m}+2-y_{m})]. Simplifying this expression, we notice that each pair (x_{i}+y_{i}) + (-x_{i}+2-y_{i}) simplifies to 2.

For the sequence to be periodic, there must exist some ( m ) such that ( a_{n+m} = a_n ) for all ( n ).   - Consider the inequality:     [     a_{n+1} > a_n iff sqrt{a_n + 1} > a_n iff a_n in (overline{varphi}, varphi)     ]     where (varphi = frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2}) (the golden ratio) and (overline{varphi} = frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2}) (the conjugate of the golden ratio).   - If ( a_n in (overline{varphi}, varphi) ), then ( a_{n+1} in (overline{varphi}, varphi) ). If ( a_n neq varphi ), the sequence is monotone and cannot be periodic.3. Case 2: All (epsilon_k = -1):   - If (epsilon_k = -1) for all ( k ), then:     [     a_{n+1} = -sqrt{a_n + 1}     ]   - Define ( b_n = -a_n ). Then:     [     b_{n+1} = sqrt{1 - b_n}     ]   - We need to check if the sequence can be periodic. For the sequence to be periodic, there must exist some ( m ) such that ( b_{n+m} = b_n ) for all ( n ).   - If ( b_n notin {0, -overline{varphi}, 1} ), we prove that the sequence ( b_{2k} ) is monotone and thus cannot be periodic.   - First, we need ( b_k in (0, 1) ). If ( b_{n+1} > -overline{varphi} ), then:     [     sqrt{1 - b_n} > -overline{varphi} iff -overline{varphi} > b_n     ]     and thus the sequence alternates between the intervals ( (0, -overline{varphi}) ) and ( (-overline{varphi}, 1) ).   - Take some ( b_n in (0, -overline{varphi}) ). From ( b_{n-1} = 1 - b_n^2 ) and ( b_{n+1} = sqrt{1 - b_n} ), we have:     [     b_{n+1} > b_{n-1} iff sqrt{1 - b_n} > 1 - b_n^2 iff 1 > (1 - b_n)(1 + b_n)^2 iff (b_n + varphi)(b_n + overline{varphi}) > 0     ]     which is true. From this, we conclude that ( b_n in {0, -overline{varphi}, 1} ), which are easy to check as philosophical numbers.4. Conclusion:   Thus, all philosophical numbers are ( 0, -1, varphi ), and (overline{varphi}).The final answer is ( boxed{ {0, -1, varphi, overline{varphi}} } )"},{"problem":"The Education Bureau of a certain city uses the knowledge content of the \\"Study in China\\" learning platform as the basis, requiring the directly-administered schools in the city to use the \\"Yushiban\\" mobile client to conduct the \\"Reviewing the Top Twenty\\" national knowledge competition.

For ( n = 2 ), ( n = 3 ), and ( n = 4 ), the matrices are:   [   A_2 = begin{bmatrix}   1 & 1    1 & 2   end{bmatrix}   ]   [   A_3 = begin{bmatrix}   1 & 1 & 1    1 & 2 & 3    1 & 3 & 6   end{bmatrix}   ]   [   A_4 = begin{bmatrix}   1 & 1 & 1 & 1    1 & 2 & 3 & 4    1 & 3 & 6 & 10    1 & 4 & 10 & 20   end{bmatrix}   ]2. We observe that the entries of the matrix ( A_n ) are given by the binomial coefficients:   [   a_{ij} = binom{i+j-2}{j-1}   ]   This is a well-known binomial coefficient identity.3. We notice a pattern in the entries of the matrices. Specifically, we observe that:   [   a_{ij} + a_{i+1,j-1} = a_{i+1,j}   ]   This is Pascal's Identity:   [   binom{i+j-2}{j-1} + binom{i+j-2}{j-2} = binom{i+j-1}{j-1}   ]4. To simplify the determinant calculation, we will perform row operations to transform the matrix into an upper triangular form. We start by subtracting the ( i )-th row from the ( (i+1) )-th row, starting from ( i = n-1 ) and moving upwards.5. For ( n = 4 ), the row operations are as follows:   [   begin{bmatrix}   1 & 1 & 1 & 1    1 & 2 & 3 & 4    1 & 3 & 6 & 10    1 & 4 & 10 & 20   end{bmatrix}   rightarrow   begin{bmatrix}   1 & 1 & 1 & 1    1 & 2 & 3 & 4    1 & 3 & 6 & 10    0 & 1 & 4 & 10   end{bmatrix}   rightarrow   begin{bmatrix}   1 & 1 & 1 & 1    1 & 2 & 3 & 4    0 & 1 & 3 & 6    0 & 1 & 4 & 10   end{bmatrix}   rightarrow   begin{bmatrix}   1 & 1 & 1 & 1    0 & 1 & 2 & 3    0 & 1 & 3 & 6    0 & 1 & 4 & 10   end{bmatrix}   ]6. Continuing this process, we can transform the matrix into an upper triangular form with 1's on the diagonal and 0's below the diagonal. This is justified by the Pascal's Identity pattern found earlier.7. Once the matrix is in upper triangular form, the determinant of the matrix is the product of the diagonal entries.

Note that adjacent numbers cannot be written (otherwise their difference would be one, and any number is divisible by 1). Therefore, at most only a and c can be written. But if they are written, their sum is a+(a+2)=2(a+1), which is divisible by the difference (a+2)-a=2. In conclusion, out of any three consecutive numbers, at most one can be written.

Each side of a triangle is divided into p equal parts, and we draw a line from each division point to the opposite vertex.

Understanding the Problem:   We are given a triangle where each side is divided into ( p ) equal parts, and lines are drawn from each division point to the opposite vertex. We need to find the maximum number of regions formed inside the triangle.2. Initial Assumptions:   We can assume the triangle is equilateral without loss of generality because the pattern of regions formed is invariant under affine transformations.3. Counting Regions:   - Each side of the triangle is divided into ( p ) equal parts, resulting in ( 3p ) division points in total.   - From each division point, a line is drawn to the opposite vertex. This results in ( 3p ) lines inside the triangle.4. Regions Formed by Lines from One Vertex:   - Consider the lines drawn from one vertex, say ( A ). These lines divide the triangle into ( p ) smaller triangles.   - Each of these smaller triangles is further divided by the lines from the other two vertices.5. Counting Intersections:   - Each line from vertex ( A ) intersects with each line from vertex ( B ) and vertex ( C ).   - The number of intersections inside the triangle is given by the product of the number of lines from each vertex.6. Formula for Regions:   - The number of regions formed by ( n ) lines in a plane is given by the formula:     [     R = frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1     ]   - Here, ( n = 3p ) (since there are ( 3p ) lines in total).7. Calculating the Number of Regions:   - Substituting ( n = 3p ) into the formula:     [     R = frac{3p(3p+1)}{2} + 1     ]   - Simplifying this expression:     [     R = frac{3p(3p+1)}{2} + 1 = frac{9p^2 + 3p}{2} + 1 = frac{9p^2 + 3p + 2}{2}     ]   - Further simplifying:     [     R = frac{9p^2 + 3p + 2}{2} = frac{9p^2 + 3p + 2}{2} = frac{9p^2 + 3p + 2}{2}     ]8.

The passage starts with the premise that sqrt{2} is irrational.2.

It is clear that if one side of the triangle contains an interior point of one side of the square, then it must contain the entire side (since the triangle contains the square), so we can assume that each side of the minimal area triangle must contain at least one vertex of the square. If two sides of the triangle contain the same vertex of the square, then the triangle and the square share a vertex. Around this common vertex, the sides of the triangle can be rotated to coincide with the sides of the square, without increasing the area of the triangle.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_c53e1b75a78a527dcf55g-1.jpg?height=783&width=897&top_left_y=506&top_left_x=603)Overall, we have found that the diagram is generally valid, with the addition that the quadrilateral C P F Q may degenerate into a line segment or a point (and the triangles A T_{1} G and B T_{2} E may also naturally degenerate), but these do not affect our reasoning. Let us use the notation in the diagram, and let D T_{1} = a, A T_{1} = x; D T_{2} = b and B T_{2} = y. Then G T_{1} = 1 - a and E T_{2} = 1 - b. Due to the equality of their angles, A T_{1} G triangle sim G F P triangle and B T_{2} E triangle sim E F Q triangle hold, from which P F = (1 - a) / x and F Q = (1 - b) / y follow. Furthermore,A D T_{1} triangle sim D B T_{2} triangleimplies a b = x y. Without loss of generality, we can assume that x / a leq 1. (Otherwise, y / b leq 1, and the roles are symmetric.)Let us estimate the area T of the triangle A B C from below:begin{aligned}T & geq T - T_{F Q C P} = T_{D E F G} + T_{A D G} + T_{B E D} + T_{F P G} + T_{Q F E} = & = 1 + frac{x}{2} + frac{y}{2} + frac{frac{1 - a}{x}}{2} + frac{frac{1 - b}{y}}{2} = 1 + frac{x + y + frac{1 - a}{x} + frac{1 - b}{y}}{2}end{aligned}Notice thatfrac{1 - a}{x} + frac{1 - b}{y} - frac{1 - x y}{y} = frac{1}{x} - frac{a}{x} + frac{1}{y} - frac{1}{y} - frac{b}{y} + x = x + frac{1}{x} - left(frac{a}{x} + frac{x}{a}right) geq 0since by assumption a leq 1, and thus x leq frac{x}{a} leq 1, and the function f(t) = t + 1 / t is monotonically decreasing on the interval (0, 1]. From this, continuing (1), we can further estimate T from below:T geq 1 + frac{x + y + frac{1 - x y}{y}}{2} = 1 + frac{y + frac{1}{y}}{2} geq 1 + frac{2}{2} = 2Equality holds only if T_{F Q C P} = 0, that is, one side of the square coincides with a side of the triangle (the remaining two vertices of the square are on the other two sides of the triangle).

By replacing x with -x+2, we get f(-x+3)=f(-x+1)+f(f(x-1)).Since f(x-1)=f(1-x), it follows that f(f(1-x))=f(f(x-1)). Therefore, f(x+1)=f(x-1)+f(-x+3)-f(-x+1)=f(x-3) because f(-t)=f(t) for all t.We deduce, by replacing x with x+1, that f(x+2)=f(x-2) for all x.Take y=2 in the functional equation.

However, by the condition, the number A is composed of odd digits and the digit 2. Therefore, A ends in 2. Thus, the number N, which is half of A, ends in either 1 or 6.We will show that N cannot end in 1. If N ends in 1, then when it is doubled, there is no carry from the last digit to the second-to-last digit. This means that the second-to-last digit of the number A=2 N would be even, but it must be odd. This is a contradiction.Remark. Pairs of numbers N and M as described in the condition do exist, for example, N=16, M=48. Moreover, there are infinitely many such pairs.

If a rectangular coordinate system is defined by two mutually perpendicular coordinate axes O x and O y, then a polar coordinate system is defined by a single ray (for example, O x), which is denoted by O r and called the polar axis, and the point O is the origin of the polar axis, or the pole. In a polar coordinate system, the position of a point M on the plane is determined by two numbers: the angle varphi (in degrees or radians) that the ray O M makes with the polar axis, and the distance r=O M of the point M from the origin of the polar axis. We write M=M(r, varphi). For the point O: r=0, varphi - any.If the rotation from the axis O r to O M is counterclockwise, then varphi is considered positive (Fig. 2.3, a), otherwise it is negative.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_22_8f5be56c3f01f571fd60g-021.jpg?height=304&width=914&top_left_y=1154&top_left_x=183)Fig. 2.3The variable ray O M describes the entire plane if varphi varies within the range [0 ; 2 pi) or (-pi ; pi].Sometimes it makes sense to consider varphi in(-infty ;+infty). In this case, the ray O M describes the plane an infinite number of times (sometimes it is said that O M describes an infinite number of planes).2^{circ}. The axis O r can be aligned with the ray O x of the rectangular system O x y to establish a connection between the polar coordinates of point M and the rectangular coordinates (Fig. 2.3, b). We have the obvious formulas:x=r cos varphi, quad y=r sin varphiFormulas (1) express rectangular coordinates in terms of polar coordinates.Polar coordinates are expressed in terms of rectangular coordinates by the formulasr=sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}, quad operatorname{tg} varphi=frac{y}{x} quad(x neq 0) .The formula operatorname{tg} varphi=frac{y}{x} determines two values of the polar angle varphi. Of these two values, the one that satisfies equations (1) should be taken.3^{circ}. If in the system O x y it is customary to deal with the function y=y(x) (although x=x(y) is also possible), then in the polar system O varphi r it is equally customary to deal with the function r=r(varphi).4^{circ}. The construction of the curve r=r(varphi) is performed by points (the more points, the better) with due account of the proper analysis of the function r=r(varphi), justified conclusions about its properties, and the accuracy of the visual estimation when drawing the line.## Examples with Solutions"},{"problem":"1.

This implies:[xy^2 = p(x + y)]Rearranging the equation, we get:[xy^2 = px + py implies xy^2 - px - py = 0]We can factorize this equation by setting (x = dm) and (y = dn) where (gcd(m, n) = 1). Substituting these into the equation, we get:[d^3mn^2 = dmp + dnp implies d^2mn^2 = p(m + n)]Since (p) is a prime number, it must divide one of the factors on the left-hand side. We consider the following cases:1. Case 1: (p mid n)   If (p mid n), then (p^2 mid n^2). This implies:   [   p^2 mid d^2mn^2 = p(m + n) implies p mid (m + n)   ]   However, since (gcd(m, n) = 1), (gcd(n, m+n) = 1), which is a contradiction. Therefore, (p nmid n).2. Case 2: (p mid m)   Let (m = pk). Substituting this into the equation, we get:   [   d^2n^2pk = p(pk + n) implies d^2n^2k = pk + n   ]   This implies (k mid n). Since (k mid m) and (k mid n) and (gcd(m, n) = 1), it follows that (k = 1). Therefore, (m = p). Substituting (m = p) into the equation, we get:   [   d^2n^2 = p + n   ]   This implies (n mid p). Since (p) is a prime number, (n) must be 1. Therefore, (x = dp) and (y = d). Substituting these into the original equation, we get:   [   p + 1 = d^2 implies p = (d-1)(d+1)   ]   Since (p) is a prime number, the only possible values are (d-1 = 1) and (d+1 = p). Therefore, (d = 2) and (p = 3). This gives us (x = 6) and (y = 2), which is indeed a solution.3. Case 3: (p mid d^2)   If (p mid d^2), then (p mid d). Let (d = pd_1). Substituting this into the equation, we get:   [   p^2d_1^2n^2m = m + n   ]   For (n geq 2) and (m geq 1), it is clear that (LHS > RHS). Therefore, either (m = 1) or (n = 1) must hold.   - Subcase 3.1: (m = 1)     We have:     [     n + 1 = p^2d_1^2n^2 implies n leq 1     ]     Therefore, (n = 1). This implies (x = y). Substituting (x = y) into the original equation, we get:     [     frac{x^3}{2x} = frac{x^2}{2} = p     ]     Therefore, (x = y = p = 2), which is indeed a solution.   - Subcase 3.2: (n = 1)     Similarly, we have (m = 1) and the same solution.Therefore, the only solutions are ((x, y) in {(2, 2), (6, 2)}).The final answer is ( boxed{ {(2, 2), (6, 2)} } )."},{"problem":"Example 1 In triangle ABC, AB=12, AC=16, M is the midpoint of BC, E, F are on AB, AC respectively, EF intersects AM at G, AE=2AF.

To see this, just note that if A is a proper subset of B, then |A|m, f(A)=a_{|A|}, and we wish to move to the case |A|=m.

Select all its one-element subsets, as well as the sets of the form {1,2, ldots, n}, where n=2,3, ldots, 100. The 199 subsets thus selected satisfy the conditions of the problem. We will show that it is not possible to select 200 subsets that satisfy the conditions of the problem, so the answer to the problem is 199.In general, we will show that from an n-element set, at most 2n-1 subsets can be selected that meet the conditions of the problem. We prove this by induction, for n=1 this is clearly true. Now suppose that the statement is true for all natural numbers less than n, and select as many subsets as possible from an n-element set H such that the subsets satisfy the conditions. It is obvious that H will be among the selected ones, since if it were not, we could add it, as every selected subset is a subset of H. We will prove that at most 2n-2 proper subsets can appear. Let A be one of the largest among the selected proper subsets, and denote the number of elements in A by a. According to the condition, every other subset is either a subset of A, or contains A, or is disjoint from it. But a proper subset containing A cannot exist, since the number of elements in A was maximal. Therefore, among the other selected subsets, there are two types: those that are subsets of A, and those that are disjoint from it.Those that are subsets of A, together with A, form a subsystem of A that satisfies the conditions of the problem. The number of elements in A is less than n, so by the induction hypothesis, there can be at most 2a-1 sets in such a subsystem. The subsets that are disjoint from A also satisfy the conditions of the problem, and are all subsets of the complement of A, H-A, which has n-a geq 1 elements, since A is not empty. Thus, from (H-A), by the induction hypothesis, at most 2(n-a)-1 subsets can be selected that meet the requirements of the problem. We have found that there can be at most 2a-1 subsets that are subsets of A, and at most 2(n-a)-1 that are disjoint from A. Together with H, therefore, we can select at most 1+(2a-1)+2(n-a)-1=2n-1 proper subsets, as we claimed.This proves that from an n-element set, at most 2n-1 non-empty subsets can be selected that meet the requirements of the problem.Remarks. 1. The example given at the beginning of the solution can obviously be generalized: from an n-element set, 2n-1 subsets can always be selected that meet the requirements of the problem.2.

We continue this process until every \\"uncut\\" set becomes a one-element set. This way, as can be easily seen, we get 2n-1 subsets, which is good, and we cannot get 2n-1 good subsets any other way.3. During the proof, we \\"helped ourselves\\" twice with a general idea.

Understanding the Sum and Integral:   The sum inside the limit can be interpreted as a Riemann sum for the integral of ( f(x) ) over ([0, 1]). However, the terms (frac{k^m}{n^m} - frac{(k-1)^m}{n^m}) are not uniform, so we need to handle them carefully.2. Simplifying the Difference:   Using the binomial theorem, we can expand ( k^m - (k-1)^m ):   [   k^m - (k-1)^m = sum_{j=0}^{m-1} binom{m}{j} k^{m-1-j} (-1)^j   ]   For large ( n ), the dominant term is ( m k^{m-1} ). Thus,   [   frac{k^m - (k-1)^m}{n^m} approx frac{m k^{m-1}}{n^m}   ]3. Riemann Sum Approximation:   The sum can be approximated by:   [   sum_{k=1}^n left(frac{k^m}{n^m} - frac{(k-1)^m}{n^m}right) fleft(frac{(k-1)^m}{n^m}right) approx sum_{k=1}^n frac{m k^{m-1}}{n^m} fleft(frac{(k-1)^m}{n^m}right)   ]   This is a Riemann sum for the integral:   [   int_0^1 m x^{m-1} f(x^m) , dx   ]4. Integral Transformation:   Let ( u = x^m ). Then ( du = m x^{m-1} dx ), and the limits of integration remain from 0 to 1. Thus,   [   int_0^1 m x^{m-1} f(x^m) , dx = int_0^1 f(u) , du = int_0^1 f(x) , dx   ]5. Evaluating the Limit:   The expression inside the limit becomes:   [   n left( int_0^1 f(x) , dx - int_0^1 f(x) , dx right) = 0   ]   However, we need to consider the next term in the expansion to get a non-zero result. The next term involves the second derivative of ( f ).6. Taylor Expansion and Second Term:   Using Taylor expansion, we get:   [   fleft(frac{(k-1)^m}{n^m}right) approx f(0) + f'(0) frac{(k-1)^m}{n^m} + frac{f''(0)}{2} left(frac{(k-1)^m}{n^m}right)^2 + cdots   ]   The dominant term for large ( n ) is:   [   frac{f''(0)}{2} sum_{k=1}^n left(frac{(k-1)^m}{n^m}right)^2   ]7.

Simplifying the Denominator:   The denominator of our expression is 2a-b. Given b=frac{1}{2a} (from ab=frac{1}{2}), we can rewrite 2a-b as 2a - frac{1}{2a}.

Here, we present two solutions: one involves patiently calculating several length ratios, while the other astutely introduces an additional point to obtain congruent triangles.Solution 1: In this solution, we use the fact that (A C) cuts [H I] at its midpoint only to obtain an equality of lengths. New points are introduced: Let D, E, and F be the feet of the altitudes from A, B, and C respectively. Let X be the intersection point of (H I) and (A C), and let Y be the intersection point of (B C) and (H G). By parallelism, (B G) is perpendicular to (B C), so G, B, H, C are concyclic. Using classical length ratio equalities related to the similar triangles in the figure:frac{I J}{C G}=frac{I X}{X C}=frac{H X}{D X}=frac{A F}{A C}=frac{A H cdot A D}{A B} cdot frac{1}{A C}=frac{A H}{A B} cdot frac{B D}{B H}=frac{A H}{B H} cdot frac{H Y}{Y C}=frac{A H}{B H} cdot frac{B H}{G C}=frac{A H}{C G}from which the equality follows.Solution 2: We still denote X as the midpoint of [I H]. The hypothesis that (A C) cuts [I H] at its midpoint might suggest finding a triangle with vertices H and X that is congruent to I J X. Unfortunately, such a triangle is not present in the figure, and introducing a point Z to complete this triangle does not provide much information about this point. However, we know that if the statement is true, Z H=I J=A H. We then proceed in the opposite direction: we introduce Z such that Z H=A H and show the congruence. This discussion motivates the following proof:Let Z neq A be the point on [A C] such that H Z=A H. As before, we have that B, G, C, H are concyclic. Therefore, traveling through the different circles:widehat{C J I}=widehat{C G H}=widehat{C B H}=widehat{H A C}This is where Z comes into play: widehat{M J I}=widehat{C J I}=widehat{H A C}=widehat{M D H}.

For each pair of 202 cities in the country, the airline connecting them is sold to one of the private airlines. The mandatory condition for the sale is as follows: each airline must ensure the possibility of flying from any city to any other (possibly with several layovers). What is the maximum number of companies that can buy the airlines?","solution":"Answer: 101.Solution. First, we prove that for k in {1, ldots, 100}, the remainders of the numbers0, k, 2k, 3k, ldots, 99k, 100kwhen divided by the prime number 101 are distinct. Indeed, if for some 0 leqslant a < b leqslant 100 the numbers ak and bk give the same remainder when divided by 101, then the number bk - ak = (b-a)k is divisible by 101, which is impossible because 1 leqslant k leqslant 100 and 0 < b-a < 101. Now consider the numerical sequencemathcal{P}_{k}: quad 0, k, 2k, 3k, ldots, 99k, 100k, 100k+101, 99k+101, ldots, 3k+101, 2k+101, k+101, 101Notice that all the remainders of the numbers in mathcal{P}_{k} when divided by 202 are distinct. Indeed, if two different numbers in mathcal{P}_{k} give the same remainder when divided by 202, then they also give the same remainder when divided by 101. Then these numbers are of the form ak and ak + 101, which is impossible because they have different parities. Since mathcal{P}_{k} contains exactly 202 numbers, their remainders take all possible values from 0 to 201.Now let's move on to solving the problem. Since each airline must ensure communication between all cities, it must have at least 201 air routes. The total number of air routes is frac{202 cdot 201}{2}, so the number of airlines does not exceed 101.We will now show that the number of airlines participating in the privatization of air routes can be exactly 101. Let's agree to denote the remainder of the division of an integer a by 202 by langle a rangle. We will number the cities from 0 to 201. For any k = 1, ldots, 100, we will assign to the k-th airline the air routes connecting cities with numbers langle a rangle and langle b rangle, where a and b are adjacent numbers in the sequence mathcal{P}_{k}. Since the remainders of the numbers in mathcal{P}_{k} run through (in a certain order) all values from 0 to 201, the airline can ensure travel from any city to any other. Note also that no air route will be assigned to two airlines at the same time. Indeed, let k and m be different numbers from 1 to 100, and (a, b) and (c, d) be pairs of adjacent numbers from the sequences mathcal{P}_{k} and mathcal{P}_{m} respectively, such that {langle a rangle, langle b rangle} = {langle c rangle, langle d rangle}. Then, by the above, {a, b} = {c, d}, which is impossible since b - a = k neq m = d - c.We will sell all the remaining air routes from the first hundred airlines to the 101st airline. We will prove that it can also ensure travel from any city to any other. Obviously, it owns the air route (0, 101), since 0 and 101 do not neighbor in the sequence mathcal{P}_{k} for any k. Now we will show that for any m in {1, ldots, 100}, the air routes (0, 202 - m) and (101, 101 - m) also belong to the 101st airline. Indeed, let the route (0, 202 - m) belong to the airline with number k leqslant 100. Then 202 - m = k, which is impossible since k + m leqslant 200. The second statement is verified similarly. Thus, the 101st airline connects any two cities via the cities 0 and 101."},{"problem":"The value of sin 15^circ + sin 75^circ is ______.","solution":"Solution: sin 15^circ + sin 75^circ = sin 15^circ + cos 15^circ = sqrt{2}(sin 15^circ cos 45^circ + cos 15^circ sin 45^circ) = sqrt{2} sin 60^circ = frac{sqrt{6}}{2}.

Find the sum of all possible values of N such that N has m divisors.[i]Proposed by [b]FedeX333X[/b][/i]","solution":"1. Initial Considerations:   - We are given that all divisors of ( N ) can be written as ( p - 2 ) for some prime number ( p ).   - This implies that ( N ) cannot be even because ( 2 + 2 = 4 ) is not a prime number.2. Prime Divisors of ( N ):   - Let ( p ) be a prime dividing ( N ). Consider ( p mod 6 ):     - If ( p equiv 1 mod 6 ), then ( p + 2 equiv 3 mod 6 ), which is not prime.     - If ( p equiv 5 mod 6 ), then ( p + 2 equiv 7 mod 6 ), which is prime.   - Therefore, ( p ) must be either ( 3 ) or ( 5 mod 6 ).3. Form of ( N ):   - If ( N ) has more than one prime ( p ) dividing it that is ( 5 mod 6 ), then the product of those primes is ( 1 mod 6 ), and adding 2 results in ( 3 mod 6 ), which is not prime.   - Thus, at most one prime ( p ) dividing ( N ) can be ( 5 mod 6 ).4. Possible Forms of ( N ):   - ( N = 3^a cdot p ) for some ( p equiv 5 mod 6 ) or ( N = 3^a ).5. Checking Specific Values:   - Consider ( N = 3^3 cdot 5 = 135 ):     - Divisors of 135: ( 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 27, 45, 135 ).     - Check if each divisor can be written as ( p - 2 ):       - ( 1 = 3 - 2 )       - ( 3 = 5 - 2 )       - ( 5 = 7 - 2 )       - ( 9 = 11 - 2 )       - ( 15 = 17 - 2 )       - ( 27 = 29 - 2 )       - ( 45 = 47 - 2 )       - ( 135 = 137 - 2 )     - All divisors satisfy the condition.6. Maximum Number of Divisors:   - ( N = 135 ) has 8 divisors.   - We need to show that ( m = 8 ) is the maximum possible number of divisors for such ( N ).7.

How can one use them to measure out exactly 6 pints of wine?This is the most famous problem of its kind; it is known as Poisson's problem. The famous French mathematician, mechanician, and physicist Siméon Denis Poisson (1781-1840) solved it in his youth and later said that it was precisely this problem that inspired him to become a mathematician.","solution":"triangle The solution to the problem can be written as follows:| Vessel with a capacity of 8 pints | 0 | 8 | 3 | 3 | 0 | 8 | 6 | 6 || :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- || Vessel with a capacity of 5 pints | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 3 | 3 | 5 | 0 |This should be understood as follows.

We are given the equation 9x + y = xy. Let's make y the subject of the formula to get a clearer view of the relationship between x and y.[ y = frac{9x}{x-1} , (x neq 1) ]2. Now we need to consider the inequality ax + y geq 25. Substituting expression of y from step 1 into the inequality, we get:[ ax + frac{9x}{x-1} geq 25 ]To find the minimum value of a, we look for the tightest constraint. This occurs when the inequality holds with equality, that is:[ ax + frac{9x}{x-1} = 25 ]3. Now solving for a, we get:[ a = frac{25 - frac{9x}{x-1}}{x} = frac{25(x-1) - 9x}{x(x-1)} = frac{25x - 25 - 9x}{x(x-1)} = frac{16x - 25}{x(x-1)} ]4. To minimize a, we have to analyze the behavior of the function a(x) = frac{16x - 25}{x(x-1)}. The critical points of a rational function occur where the numerator is zero or where the derivative of the function reaches a minimum.5. The numerator 16x - 25 becomes zero when x = frac{25}{16}. However, we need to ensure this value makes the inequality given in step 2 an equality.6. With x = frac{25}{16}, let’s calculate the corresponding y:[ y = frac{9x}{x-1} = frac{9 cdot frac{25}{16}}{frac{25}{16}-1} = frac{frac{225}{16}}{frac{9}{16}} = 25 ]7. Now we substitute x = frac{25}{16}, y = 25 into the inequality ax + y geq 25 to find a; therefore:[ a cdot frac{25}{16} + 25 geq 25 ][ a geq frac{25 - 25}{frac{25}{16}} = 0 ]8. Since we want the minimum positive value of a and given that a = frac{16x - 25}{x(x-1)} achieves its minimum for x = frac{25}{16}, we find that value:[ a = frac{16 cdot frac{25}{16} - 25}{frac{25}{16} cdot (frac{25}{16}-1)} = frac{25 - 25}{frac{25}{16} cdot frac{9}{16}} = frac{0}{frac{225}{256}} = 0]Since a has to be a positive real number, the minimum positive value is reached immediately after x = frac{25}{16}, due to the continuous nature of the function.9. Given that a needs to be greater than 0, and that the function a(x) is decreasing before x = frac{25}{16} and increasing afterward, we can conclude that just after x = frac{25}{16}, a starts to increase from 0 towards positive values.Therefore, the minimum positive value for a is reached just after x = frac{25}{16}.

Therefore, sqrt{4} does not fit the description of \\"面\\" because its square root can be expressed as an exact integer.- For option C: sqrt{6} cannot be simplified to an exact integer, and there are no rational numbers whose square equals 6. This means sqrt{6} is an irrational number, fitting the description of \\"面\\".- For option D: frac{22}{7} is a fraction, which means it is a rational number. Since it is not described as a square root of a number that cannot be simplified to an integer, it does not fit the description of \\"面\\".Based on the analysis, the number that fits the description of \\"面\\" is sqrt{6}, which is option C.
