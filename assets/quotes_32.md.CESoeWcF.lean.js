Determine the Condition for Other Quasi-Singular Points: For other quasi-singular points to exist, the graph of y=6x-x^{3} (for xleq 0) mirrored across the origin (to cover x geq 0) must intersect the graph of y=16-ax (for x>0) at exactly two points.

Solution","solution":": odd. Easy. Suppose that there are s unequal values for the a i , with m 1 equal to the first value, m 2 equal to the second and so on. Then there are n!/(m 1 ! ... m s !) distinct arrangements of the a i . But n!/(m 1 ! ... m s !) = nCm i x integer, so it is only odd if all the nCm i are odd [where nCm is the binomial coefficient n!/(m!(n- m)!).] But the only values m in the range 1, 2, ... , 10 for which 10Cm is odd are 2, 8 and 10.

If adding the product of each digit of A to A gives a multiple of 9, then find the possible minimum value of A.","solution":"1. Let ( A ) be a positive integer which is a multiple of 3 but not a multiple of 9. This implies that the sum of the digits of ( A ) is congruent to 3 or 6 modulo 9.2. Let ( A = a_1a_2cdots a_n ) where ( a_i ) are the digits of ( A ). The sum of the digits of ( A ) is ( S = a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n ).3. Given that adding the product of the digits of ( A ) to ( A ) gives a multiple of 9, we have:   [   A + P equiv 0 pmod{9}   ]   where ( P = a_1 cdot a_2 cdot cdots cdot a_n ).4. Since ( A equiv S pmod{9} ), we can rewrite the condition as:   [   S + P equiv 0 pmod{9}   ]5. Given ( S equiv 3 pmod{9} ) or ( S equiv 6 pmod{9} ), we need:   [   P equiv -S pmod{9}   ]   which means ( P equiv 6 pmod{9} ) or ( P equiv 3 pmod{9} ).6. Since ( 3 ) is a prime number, exactly one digit of ( A ) must be ( 3 ) or ( 6 ). This rules out 2-digit numbers because if one digit is ( 3 ) or ( 6 ), the other digit would have to be ( 0, 3, 6, ) or ( 9 ), which would make ( A ) a multiple of 9, contradicting the given condition.7.

Counting the number of ( n )-tuples of integers whose largest value is ( 7 ) and whose smallest value is ( 0 ):   - Each of the ( n ) digits in the tuple must be an integer in the range ([0, 7]), giving ( 8 ) choices for each digit. Thus, there are ( 8^n ) ways to form the ( n )-tuple.   - We need to subtract the cases where there is no ( 7 ) or no ( 0 ). If there is no ( 7 ), we only have ( 7 ) choices for each digit, resulting in ( 7^n ) ways. Similarly, there are ( 7^n ) ways to have no ( 0 ) in the tuple.   - By the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (PIE), we must add back the cases where there is neither ( 7 ) nor ( 0 ). This gives ( 6 ) choices for each digit, resulting in ( 6^n ) ways.   - Therefore, the total count for (1) is:     [     8^n - 2 cdot 7^n + 6^n     ]2. Counting the number of ordered triples ((A, B, C)) that satisfy the given property:   - For each of the ( n ) elements in the set ({1, 2, ldots, n}), each element can be part of ( A ) or not, giving ( 2^n ) possible sets for ( A ). Similarly, there are ( 2^n ) possible sets for ( B ) and ( 2^n ) possible sets for ( C ), resulting in ( 2^n cdot 2^n cdot 2^n = 8^n ) ways to have subsets ( A, B, C ).   - We need to subtract the cases where ( C subseteq A cup B ) or ( B subseteq A cup C ).   - To count the number of ways in which ( C subseteq A cup B ), we consider the cardinality of the set ( A cup B ). Let this cardinality be ( k ). There are (binom{n}{k}) possible sets of ( A cup B ) with cardinality ( k ). The number of ways ( A cup B ) can occur given cardinality ( k ) is:     [     sum_{m=0}^{k} binom{k}{m} 2^m = 3^k     ]     by the binomial theorem.   - The number of ways ( C ) can be chosen such that ( C subseteq A cup B ) is ( 2^k ). Considering all valid ( k ) and adding cases for each ( k ), the total number of ways to have ( C subseteq A cup B ) is:     [     sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} 2^k 3^k = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} 6^k = 7^n     ]     by the binomial theorem.   - By symmetry, the number of ways ( B subseteq A cup C ) is also ( 7^n ). Hence, we must subtract ( 2 cdot 7^n ) from our total count of ( 8^n ).   - We need to add back the cases where both ( C subseteq A cup B ) and ( B subseteq A cup C ). The number of ways this happens is:     [     sum_{j=0}^{n} binom{n}{j} 3^j 3^{n-j} = sum_{j=0}^{n} binom{n}{j} 3^n = 6^n     ]     by the binomial theorem.   - Therefore, the total count for (2) is:     [     8^n - 2 cdot 7^n + 6^n     ]Since both counts are equal for all ( n ), the answer is:The final answer is (boxed{text{both counts are equal}})"},{"problem":"If [ begin {eqnarray*} x + y + z + w = 20  y + 2z - 3w = 28  x - 2y + z = 36  -7x - y + 5z + 3w = 84 ]then what is (x,y,z,w)?","solution":"1.

Identify the given information and the goal:   - We have an acute triangle triangle ABC.   - D is the foot of the perpendicular from A to BC.   - Points K, L, M are on segment AD such that AK = KL = LM = MD.   - The sum of the areas of the shaded regions equals the sum of the areas of the unshaded regions.   - We need to prove that BD = DC.2.

Calculate the areas of the triangles formed:   - The triangles formed by these segments are similar to triangle ABD and triangle ACD.   - The area of a triangle is proportional to the square of the corresponding side length.4. Express the areas of the smaller triangles:   - Let S_{ABD} be the area of triangle ABD and S_{ACD} be the area of triangle ACD.   - The area of triangle AKD is frac{1}{16}S_{ABD} because AK = frac{AD}{4}.   - The area of triangle ALD is frac{9}{16}S_{ABD} because AL = frac{3AD}{4}.   - The area of triangle AMD is frac{1}{4}S_{ABD} because AM = frac{AD}{2}.5.

The system then takes the formleft{begin{aligned}sin alpha cdot cos beta & =frac{1}{4}(sqrt{3}+1) sin beta cdot cos alpha & =frac{1}{4}(sqrt{3}-1)end{aligned}right.By adding the left and right parts of the equations, we get sin (alpha+beta)=frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, and by subtracting, we find that sin (alpha-beta)=frac{1}{2}. Since the number alpha-beta lies on the interval left[-frac{pi}{2} ; frac{pi}{2}right],it equals frac{pi}{6}. The number alpha+beta lies on the interval [0 ; pi], and therefore equals either frac{pi}{3} or frac{2 pi}{3}. Then alpha=frac{(alpha+beta)+(alpha-beta)}{2} is either frac{5 pi}{12} or frac{pi}{4}.

The product of the digits of ( n ) is given by ( p(n) = a_0 cdot a_1 cdots a_m ).3. Since each ( a_i leq 9 ), we have:   [   p(n) = a_0 cdot a_1 cdots a_m leq 9 cdot 9 cdots 9 = 9^{m+1}   ]4. Note that ( 9^{m+1} leq 10^m cdot a_m leq n ) because ( n ) is at least ( 10^m ) and at most ( 10^m cdot 9 ).5. Therefore, ( p(n) leq n ). Part (b)1.

Combining the two inequalities, we get:   [   43 leq n leq 66   ]6.

Hence we may consider the case where f(x) neq 0 for all x neq 0.Since fleft(x^{2}-x f(x)right)=0, we conclude that x^{2}-x f(x)=0 for all x neq 0. This implies that f(x)=x for all x neq 0.

Let's denote the length of the third stick as x cm. Given two sides of the triangle are 7 cm and 10 cm, we can set up the following inequalities:1. The sum of the lengths of the two shorter sides must be greater than the length of the longest side. This gives us 7 + x > 10 and 10 + x > 7.2. The difference between the lengths of the two longer sides must be less than the length of the shortest side. This gives us 10 - 7 < x and 10 - x < 7 (though the latter doesn't apply since x must be less than 10 to be the shortest side).Combining these inequalities, we find that 3 < x < 17. This means the length of the third stick must be greater than 3 cm but less than 17 cm.Looking at the options provided:A: 20 cm is too long, as it exceeds 17 cm.B: 3 cm does not satisfy the condition since x must be greater than 3 cm.C: 11 cm fits perfectly within our range of 3 < x < 17.D: 2 cm is too short, as it is less than 3 cm.Therefore, the only length that satisfies the condition for the third stick is 11 cm.Hence, the correct answer is boxed{C}."},{"problem":"p1.

As n=0 is trivial, we focus on n=frac{20}{3}. To determine whether this critical point corresponds to a maximum or minimum, we can evaluate points around n=frac{20}{3}. Simply checking values such as f(6) and f(7) makes sense since the function will behave similarly on either side of the critical point:f(6) = frac{1}{3}(6)^3 - frac{10}{3}(6)^2 = -48,f(7) = frac{1}{3}(7)^3 - frac{10}{3}(7)^2 = -49.Comparing the two values, we see that the function f(n) has its minimum value at n=7.

But squares are always congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3, so this can only happen if x^{2} equiv y^{2} equiv 0 bmod 3. Therefore, x and y are both divisible by 3. Write x=3 a and y=3 b and substitute:9 a^{2}+9 b^{2}+3^{3}=456 sqrt{3 a-3 b} .Square roots of integers are generally either integers or irrational. But sqrt{3 a-3 b} cannot be irrational, as it equals frac{9 a^{2}+9 b^{2}+3^{3}}{456}, so it must be an integer. Therefore, 3 a-3 b is a square, and since it is also divisible by 3, it must be divisible by 9. We can now divide both sides of the equation by 9:a^{2}+b^{2}+3=152 sqrt{frac{a-b}{3}} .Write a-b=3 c^{2} and substitute a=b+3 c^{2}:9 c^{4}+6 c^{2} b+2 b^{2}+3=152 c .Since all terms on the left side are positive, we must have 9 c^{4}+6 c^{2} b+2 b^{2}+3 geq 152 c. Since 9 c^{4}+6 c^{2} b+2 b^{2}+3 geq 9 c^{4}+3 geq 16+frac{8}{9}, it follows that c leq 2. Furthermore, 152 c is even, as is 6 c^{2} b+2 b^{2}, so 9 c^{4}+3 must also be even, which means c must be odd. Therefore, the only possibility is c=1. Substituting this, we get9+6 b+2 b^{2}+3=152orb^{2}+3 b-70=0 .This can also be written as (b-7)(b+10)=0. So b=7 or b=-10. In the first case, we get a=b+3 c^{2}=10 and thus x=30 and y=21. In the second case, we get a=b+3 c^{2}=-7 and thus x=-21 and y=-30. Checking shows that both pairs satisfy the equation. Therefore, the solutions are (x, y)=(30,21) and (x, y)=(-21,-30)."},{"problem":"Given lines l, m and planes alpha, beta, and l perp alpha, m parallel beta, then among the following propositions, the correct one is (quad)A: If alpha perp beta, then l parallel mB: If alpha parallel beta, then l perp mC: If l parallel beta, then m perp alphaD: If l perp m, then alpha parallel beta","solution":"AnalysisThis question examines the parallel and perpendicular relationships between lines and planes in space.

Proof: Without loss of generality, we consider the cases where (gcd(a, b, c) = 1). By checking modulo (3), we must have (3 mid a) or (3 mid b). By checking modulo (4), we must have (4 mid a) or (4 mid b). By checking modulo (5), we must have (5 mid a) or (5 mid b) or (5 mid c). Therefore, (60 mid abc).2. Now we consider (dfrac{n}{d_{22}} = d_{k-21}).3. So, we have (d_7^2 + d_{10}^2 = d_{k-21}^2). This implies (60 mid (d_7)(d_{10})(d_{k-21})).4. This gives us that (d_2 = 2, d_3 = 3, d_4 = 4, d_5 = 5, d_6 = 6), and (10) is a sure factor of (n). Thus (d_7 = 7, 8, 9, text{or} 10). Case 1: (d_7 = 7)5. If (d_7 = 7), then ((d_{k-21} - d_{10})(d_{k-21} + d_{10}) = 49). This implies ((d_{k-21} - d_{10}) = 1) and ((d_{k-21} + d_{10}) = 49). Solving these, we get (d_{10} = 24) and (d_{k-21} = 25). This implies ((k-21) = 11) or (k = 32).6. But, if (24 mid n) and (25 mid n), then it implies that ({8, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 24}) are also factors of (n). This gives (d_8 = 8) and (d_9 = 10), but then there is a contradiction as (d_{10} = 24) and there are no places for the remaining factors. Case 2: (d_7 = 8)7. If (d_7 = 8), then ((d_{10}, d_{k-21}) = (15, 17)) or ((6, 10)).8. The second pair is ruled out as (d_{10} = 6 < 8 = d_7), a contradiction.9. If we consider the first pair, then note that we are forced to have (d_8 = 10) and (d_9 = 12). Thus we get that (n) has at least three factors of (2), exactly (1) factor of (3), and at least (1) factor of (5) (and no factors of (7) or (11)).10. (i) If (d_{11} = 16), then (d_{k-21} = 17 = d_{12}). This implies (k = 33). Or, (n) is a perfect square, which is a contradiction as (v_3(n) = 1).11. (ii) If (d_{k-21} = 17 = d_{11}), this implies (k = 32). And, (n = 2^3 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot 17) works, so (n = 2040) is a solution. Case 3: (d_7 = 9)12. If (d_7 = 9), then ((d_{10}, d_{k-21}) = (41, 40)) or ((15, 12)).13. The first pair implies that (8 mid n), which is a contradiction as (8) is not a factor of (n).14. The second pair implies (d_8 = 10, d_9 = 11, d_{10} = 12).15. (i) If (d_{11} = 13), then (d_{k-21} = d_{12}) implies (k = 33). Or, (n) is a perfect square. So, (n geq (2^2)(3^2)(5^2)(11^2)(13^2)). Let (d(n)) denote the number of divisors of (n). This implies (d(n) geq 243), which is a contradiction.16. (ii) If (d_{k-21} = d_{11} = 15), this implies (k = 32). This implies (n geq (2^2)(3^2)(5)(11)). This implies (d(n) geq 36), which is a contradiction. Case 4: (d_7 = 10)17. If (d_7 = 10), then ((d_{10}, d_{k-21}) = (24, 26)).

Understanding the Problem:   Let the 2022 real numbers be ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2022} ). The condition given is that the sum of any ( k ) consecutive numbers is 2022. Mathematically, this can be written as:   [   a_i + a_{i+1} + cdots + a_{i+k-1} = 2022 quad text{for all } i.   ]2. Deriving the Condition:   Consider the sums of ( k ) consecutive numbers starting from different positions:   [   a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_k = 2022,   ]   [   a_2 + a_3 + cdots + a_{k+1} = 2022.   ]   Subtracting these two equations, we get:   [   a_1 - a_{k+1} = 0 implies a_1 = a_{k+1}.   ]   Repeating this process, we find:   [   a_2 = a_{k+2}, quad a_3 = a_{k+3}, quad ldots, quad a_{2022} = a_{k+2022}.   ]3. Periodicity and GCD:   For the numbers to be equal, the indices must cycle through all positions. This implies that ( k ) must be such that ( k ) and 2022 are coprime (i.e., (gcd(k, 2022) = 1)). This is because if ( gcd(k, 2022) neq 1 ), then the sequence will not cover all indices, and we will not be able to conclude that all numbers are equal.4.

( c_n = n^s sum_{k=n-n^alpha}^{n-1} frac{1}{k^s (n-k)^s} ) Step 2: Analyze ( a_n )For ( a_n ), we have:[ sum_{k=1}^{n^alpha} frac{1}{k^s} leq a_n leq frac{n^s}{(n-n^alpha)^s} sum_{k=1}^{n^alpha} frac{1}{k^s}. ]As ( n to infty ), ( sum_{k=1}^{n^alpha} frac{1}{k^s} ) converges to the Riemann zeta function ( zeta(s) ) because ( alpha < 1 ). Therefore:[ lim_{n to infty} a_n = zeta(s). ] Step 3: Analyze ( b_n )For ( b_n ), we consider ( n^alpha < k < n - n^alpha ):[ k^s (n-k)^s > (n^alpha)^s (n-n^alpha)^s > (n^alpha)^s left(frac{1}{2} nright)^s = frac{1}{2^s} n^{s(alpha+1)}. ]Thus:[ b_n leq n^s (n - 2n^alpha) cdot frac{2^s}{n^{s(alpha+1)}} < frac{2^s}{n^{salpha - 1}} to 0 text{ as } n to infty. ] Step 4: Analyze ( c_n )By symmetry, ( c_n ) behaves similarly to ( a_n ):[ c_n = n^s sum_{k=n-n^alpha}^{n-1} frac{1}{k^s (n-k)^s}. ]Thus:[ lim_{n to infty} c_n = zeta(s). ] Step 5: Combine ResultsCombining the results from ( a_n ), ( b_n ), and ( c_n ):[ lim_{n to infty} n^s sum_{k=1}^{n-1} frac{1}{k^s (n-k)^s} = 2 lim_{n to infty} a_n + lim_{n to infty} b_n = 2zeta(s). ] ConclusionFor the sequence ( {S_n(a)}_{n geq 2} ) to converge to a positive real number, we need:[ a = 2019. ]The final answer is ( boxed{2019} )."},{"problem":"2.

For different values of a, we can examine the behavior of f'(x):- When a leq 0, f'(x) leq 0 for all x, which implies that f(x) is monotonically decreasing on mathbb{R}.- When a > 0, we can factor the derivative as f'(x) = -3left(x^2 - frac{a}{3}right) = -3left(x + sqrt{frac{a}{3}}right)left(x - sqrt{frac{a}{3}}right). To find where f(x) is increasing, we set f'(x) > 0, yielding x  sqrt{frac{a}{3}}. Thus, the intervals of increase for f(x) are (-infty, -sqrt{frac{a}{3}}) and (sqrt{frac{a}{3}}, infty).Conversely, for the decreasing intervals, we set f'(x)  0, we find that 8sqrt{x} - 1 = 0, so sqrt{x} = frac{1}{8} and thus x = frac{1}{64}.However, h'(x) changes sign around x = frac{1}{4} rather than x = frac{1}{64}, which indicates an error in the prior solution. Let's correct this:Setting h'(x) = 0 leads to the equation (2sqrt{x} - 1)(4x + 2sqrt{x} + 1) = 0. Since (4x + 2sqrt{x} + 1) > 0, we must have 2sqrt{x} - 1 = 0, so sqrt{x} = frac{1}{2} and thus x = frac{1}{4}. Since h'(x)  0 for x in (frac{1}{4}, +infty), h(x) reaches its minimum at x = frac{1}{4}.Now evaluate hleft(frac{1}{4}right) to find that minimum value: hleft(frac{1}{4}right) = left(frac{1}{4}right)^2 - frac{1}{2}left(frac{1}{4}right)^{frac{1}{2}} = frac{1}{16} - frac{1}{4} = -frac{3}{16}.

Event A, which is \\"the first coin is heads up,\\" can have the outcomes of HH (first coin heads, second coin heads) or HT (first coin heads, second coin tails). Thus, we can express A as:[A={HH, HT}]Event B, defined as \\"the second coin is tails up,\\" can result in either HT (first coin heads, second coin tails) or TT (first coin tails, second coin tails). Therefore, event B can be represented as:[B={HT, TT}]To determine if Asubseteq B, we compare the elements of A and B. Since A contains an element (HH) that is not in B, we conclude:[Ansubseteq B]Hence, option A is incorrect.Next, we examine if A=B. By comparing the sets, we see that A and B have different elements (HH is not in B and TT is not in A), which shows:[Aneq B]Thus, option B is incorrect.To determine if A and B are independent, we calculate the probability of A and B occurring together, P(AB), and compare it to the product of the probabilities of A and B occurring independently, P(A)P(B). Event AB (both A and B occur) happens only when the first coin is heads and the second coin is tails, which corresponds to the outcome HT. Therefore, the probability of AB occurring is:[P(AB)=frac{1}{4}]since there is only one favorable outcome (HT) out of four possible outcomes (HH, HT, TH, TT).The probabilities of A and B happening independently are:[P(A)=frac{1}{2}][P(B)=frac{1}{2}]since each event has two favorable outcomes out of four possible outcomes.Checking the independence condition:[P(AB)=P(A)P(B)][frac{1}{4}=frac{1}{2}cdotfrac{1}{2}]This equality holds, confirming that A and B are independent events.

If p>5, the number p is not divisible by 5, so one of the numbers (p-2),(p-1),(p+1),(p+2) is divisible by 5, hence their product (p-2)(p-1)(p+1)(p+2) is divisible by 5. At least one of the numbers p+1 or p+2 is even, so the product is also divisible by 2. Therefore, the number (p-2)(p-1)(p+1)(p+2) for p>5 is divisible by 10.

Additionally, a+b=c+d - the number of blue points.Notice that among the numbers c and d, exactly one is even, since the number 50 is divisible by 2 but not by 4. This means that among the numbers a and b, exactly one is also even. There are exactly two ways to represent 56 as the product of an even number and an odd number: 56=8 cdot 7 and 56=56 cdot 1.In the first case, c=10, d=5 work. As an example, you can place 5 blue points on the line, then a red one, then 3 more blue points, then another red one, and finally 7 more blue points.In the second case, the total number of blue points is 57. Then it only remains to understand that the following system of equations has no integer solutions:left{begin{array}{l}c+d=57 c d=50end{array}right.One can check that the quadratic trinomial t^{2}-57 t+50=0, whose roots by Vieta's theorem should be the numbers c and d, does not have a pair of natural solutions (for example, it is sufficient to verify that its values at t=0 and t=1 have different signs, meaning one of the roots lies in the interval (0 ; 1)).Alternatively, one can simply enumerate the factorizations of the number 50 into c and d."},{"problem":"What is the smallest possible perimeter of a triangle with integer coordinate vertices, area frac12, and no side parallel to an axis?","solution":"To find the smallest possible perimeter of a triangle with integer coordinate vertices, area frac{1}{2}, and no side parallel to an axis, we need to follow these steps:1. Verify the area condition using Pick's Theorem:   Pick's Theorem states that for a lattice polygon (a polygon whose vertices are at lattice points), the area (A) is given by:   [   A = I + frac{B}{2} - 1   ]   where (I) is the number of interior lattice points and (B) is the number of boundary lattice points. For our triangle, we need (A = frac{1}{2}).2. Check the vertices (0,0), (2,1), and (3,2):   Let's calculate the area of the triangle with vertices ((0,0)), ((2,1)), and ((3,2)) using the determinant formula for the area of a triangle:   [   A = frac{1}{2} left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) right|   ]   Substituting the given points:   [   A = frac{1}{2} left| 0(1 - 2) + 2(2 - 0) + 3(0 - 1) right|   ]   [   A = frac{1}{2} left| 0 + 4 - 3 right| = frac{1}{2} left| 1 right| = frac{1}{2}   ]   The area condition is satisfied.3. Calculate the perimeter:   We need to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle:   [   text{Length of side } (0,0) text{ to } (2,1): sqrt{(2-0)^2 + (1-0)^2} = sqrt{4 + 1} = sqrt{5}   ]   [   text{Length of side } (2,1) text{ to } (3,2): sqrt{(3-2)^2 + (2-1)^2} = sqrt{1 + 1} = sqrt{2}   ]   [   text{Length of side } (3,2) text{ to } (0,0): sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (2-0)^2} = sqrt{9 + 4} = sqrt{13}   ]   Therefore, the perimeter is:   [   sqrt{5} + sqrt{2} + sqrt{13}   ]4. Verify if this is the smallest possible perimeter:   To ensure this is the smallest possible perimeter, we need to check if there are any other sets of integer coordinate vertices that satisfy the area condition and have a smaller perimeter. This involves checking other possible triangles and comparing their perimeters.   However, given the constraints and the specific nature of the problem, it is highly likely that the triangle with vertices ((0,0)), ((2,1)), and ((3,2)) provides the smallest perimeter.The final answer is ( boxed{ sqrt{5} + sqrt{2} + sqrt{13} } )"},{"problem":"17 cdot 47 In triangle ABC, angle B is trisected by BD and BE, intersecting AC at D and E, respectively, then(A) frac{AD}{EC}=frac{AE}{DC}.(B) frac{AD}{EC}=frac{AB}{BC}.(C) frac{AD}{EC}=frac{BD}{BE}.(D) frac{AD}{EC}=frac{AB cdot BD}{BE cdot BC}.(E) frac{AD}{EC}=frac{AE cdot BD}{DC cdot BE}.","solution":"[Solution] Given that B D bisects angle A B E, then frac{A D}{D E}=frac{A B}{B E}, i.e., A D=frac{D E cdot A B}{B E}.

Analyze the sum conditions:   - Let C_i be the sum of the i-th column and R_i be the sum of the i-th row.   - We have the conditions:     [     sum_{i=1}^{11} R_i leq 0 quad text{and} quad sum_{i=1}^{11} C_i geq 0     ]   - Since the total sum of all entries in the board is the same whether summed by rows or by columns, we have:     [     sum_{i=1}^{11} R_i = sum_{i=1}^{11} C_i     ]   - Combining these, we get:     [     sum_{i=1}^{11} R_i = sum_{i=1}^{11} C_i = 0     ]3.

Determine the structure of the board:   - For each row and each column to sum to zero, the number of 1s must equal the number of -1s in each row and each column.   - Since the sum of a row or a column is zero, the number of 1s and -1s must be even.5. Minimum number of zeros:   - To satisfy the conditions, each row and each column must contain at least one zero. This is because if a row or column had no zeros, it would be impossible to balance the 1s and -1s to sum to zero.   - Therefore, there must be at least 11 zeros on the board (one in each row and one in each column).6. Construct an example:   - Place a zero on the main diagonal of the 11 times 11 board.   - Color the board like a chessboard, with alternating black and white squares.   - Place 1s on the white squares that do not contain a zero and -1s on the black squares that do not contain a zero.By this construction, each row and each column will have a sum of zero, and there will be exactly 11 zeros on the board.The final answer is boxed{11}."},{"problem":"If sin^2alpha + sinalpha = 1, then cos^4alpha + cos^2alpha = ______.","solution":"Given that sin^2alpha + sinalpha = 1, we can try to express everything in terms of sinalpha or cosalpha.

Let PA = a, PB = b, PC = c, PD = d, and AB = s. We have a^2 + c^2 = AC^2 = 2s^2, because AC is a diameter of the circle. Similarly, b^2 + d^2 = 2s^2. Therefore, (a+c)^2 = a^2 + c^2 + 2ac = 2s^2 + 2(56) = 2s^2 + 112. Similarly, (b+d)^2 = 2s^2 + 180. By Ptolemy's Theorem on PCDA, as + cs = dssqrt{2}, and therefore a + c = dsqrt{2}.

We will describe several solution procedures for both parts a) and b). Without comment, we will use the known equalities |A S|=|B S|=|C S|=|D S|. Let us also emphasize that the condition |A B|>|B C| from the problem statement ensures that point E lies on the extension of the diagonal A C beyond point C.Part a), method 1. Point C lies on the hypotenuse S E of the right triangle S B E. At the same time, it lies on the axis of its leg B E, since |C B|=|C E| according to the problem statement. From Thales' theorem, it follows that the circle circumscribed around this triangle has its center precisely at point C. Therefore, the equalities |C B|=|C E|=|C S|=|B S| hold, from which it follows that triangle B S C is equilateral. The sought measure of angle B S C is therefore 60^{circ}.Part a), method 2. Angles E B S and C B A are right, and thus equal, and angle C B S is their common part, and therefore angles E B C and S B A are also equal. From the isosceles triangles B E C and A B S, it follows that |angle E B C|=|angle C E B| and |angle S B A|=|angle B A S|. Therefore, |angle C E B|=|angle B A S| or |angle A E B|=|angle B A E|, and thus triangle E A B is isosceles and |B E|=|A B|. The isosceles triangles B E C and A B S are therefore congruent by the SAS theorem. Therefore, |B C|=|B S|=|C S|, triangle B S C is thus equilateral, and |angle B S C|=60^{circ}.Part a), method 3. Let varphi be the measure of the angles at the base B E of the isosceles triangle B E C. Considering |angle E B S|=90^{circ}, then 90^{circ}-varphi is the measure of the angles at the base B C of the isosceles triangle B C S, and therefore its third angle B S C has a measure of 2 varphi. Triangle S B E thus has internal angles of 90^{circ}, varphi, and 2 varphi, so varphi+2 varphi=90^{circ}, from which varphi=30^{circ}, and thus |angle B S C|=2 varphi=60^{circ}.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_c056f0bb4193640bf2e7g-3.jpg?height=394&width=686&top_left_y=1845&top_left_x=685)Part b), method 1. Angle F S D is the same as angle E B D and is right, since F S | E B according to the problem statement. From the solution of part a), we know that B S C is an equilateral triangle. The isosceles triangle C D S therefore has internal angles of 30^{circ}, 30^{circ}, and 120^{circ}. Therefore, for the internal angles of triangle C F S we get|angle F C S|=|angle D C S|=30^{circ} text { and } quad|angle C S F|=|angle C S D|-|angle F S D|=120^{circ}-90^{circ}=30^{circ} text {, }so C F S is an isosceles triangle and |S F|=|C F|. Instead of proving the equality |D F|= =2|C F|, it is sufficient to prove the equality |D F|=2|S F|. This, however, as is well known, follows from the right triangle F D S, since |angle F D S|=30^{circ}.Part b), method 2. Let us show that the right triangle F D S can also be used differently. Let d=|C S|=|B S|=|D S|. From the solution of part a), we know that |B C|=d, which together with |D B|=2 d leads by the Pythagorean theorem to the equality |D C|=d sqrt{3}. From the similarity of the right triangles F D S and B D C, we have |D F| /|D S|=|D B| /|D C|, from which the length of segment D F is|D F|=frac{|D B| cdot|D S|}{|D C|}=frac{2 d cdot d}{d sqrt{3}}=frac{2}{3} cdot d sqrt{3}=frac{2}{3}|D C| .This clearly means that |D F|=2|C F|, as we were to prove.Part b), method 3.

Use properties of Fibonacci sequence modulo 100:   The Fibonacci sequence modulo 100 has a periodicity (Pisano period). The period length for modulo 100 is 300. Therefore:   [   F_{2009} mod 100 = F_{2009 mod 300} mod 100 = F_{2009 mod 300} mod 100 = F_{209} mod 100   ]7.

Finding the lengths of the diagonals:   - If (alpha = 90^circ), then:     [     4 = l_1 l_2     ]   - Given (l_1 + l_2 = 4), we solve the system of equations:     [     l_1 + l_2 = 4     ]     [     l_1 l_2 = 4     ]   - Solving these, we find (l_1 = l_2 = 2 , text{m}).6.

We are given that after t minutes, the water level in bucket A follows the exponential decay curve y = ae^{nt}. 2. After 5 minutes, the water levels in bucket A and B are equal, which means half of the water is left in bucket A, so we have a/2 = ae^{5n}. Simplifying this equation gives us:   [   frac{1}{2} = e^{5n}   ]3. We are also given that after m minutes, the water level in bucket A is frac{a}{8} liters.

To find the relationship between n and t, we use the information from step 2. Since frac{1}{2} = e^{5n}, we can express frac{1}{8} as a power of e that relates to 5n.

We are given two pieces of information that can be translated into equations:1. The total number of items purchased is 100, which gives us the equation:[x + y = 100]2. The total cost for purchasing these items is 6200 yuan. Given the cost per item for type A is 50 yuan and for type B is 70 yuan, we can write the equation as:[50x + 70y = 6200]To solve these equations, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use elimination for simplicity:From the first equation, we can express y in terms of x:[y = 100 - x]Substituting y in the second equation:[50x + 70(100 - x) = 6200][50x + 7000 - 70x = 6200][-20x = -800][x = 40]Substituting x = 40 back into y = 100 - x:[y = 100 - 40 = 60]Therefore, the distributor purchased boxed{40} items of type A souvenirs and boxed{60} items of type B souvenirs at once.# Part 2: Calculating the ProfitTo calculate the profit, we need to consider the selling price and cost price of each type of souvenir:- For type A souvenirs, the profit per item is the selling price minus the cost price, which is 100 - 50 = 50 yuan. For 40 items, the total profit is 50 times 40 = 2000 yuan.- For type B souvenirs, the profit per item is 90 - 70 = 20 yuan. For 60 items, the total profit is 20 times 60 = 1200 yuan.Adding these two amounts gives us the total profit:[2000 + 1200 = 3200] yuanTherefore, if all the souvenirs are sold out on the day of the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics, a profit of boxed{3200} yuan will be made."},{"problem":"Leo the fox has a 5 by 5 checkerboard grid with alternating red and black squares.

He then computes the sum of the numbers inthe 13 squares that are the same color as the center square. Compute the maximum possible sum Leocan obtain.","solution":"1. Identify the color of the center square:   - The center square of a (5 times 5) checkerboard grid is the square at position ((3, 3)).   - Since the grid alternates colors, and assuming the top-left corner is red, the center square ((3, 3)) will also be red.2. Determine the color pattern:   - The grid alternates colors, so the red squares are at positions where the sum of the row and column indices is odd (since the top-left corner is red).3. Count the number of red squares:   - In a (5 times 5) grid, there are 13 red squares and 12 black squares.4. Understand the movement constraint:   - Leo places the numbers (1, 2, 3, ldots, 25) such that any two consecutive numbers are in adjacent squares (sharing a side).   - This implies that moving from one square to another changes the color of the square (since adjacent squares have different colors).5. Sum of numbers in red squares:   - Since the numbers are placed consecutively and adjacent squares have different colors, the numbers in the red squares will either all be odd or all be even.   - The sum of the first 25 natural numbers is (frac{25 times 26}{2} = 325).   - The sum of the numbers in the black squares will be the sum of the even numbers or the sum of the odd numbers, depending on the starting number.6.

Find the derivative of the curve: The curve given is y=ln x-n+2. Differentiating both sides with respect to x gives us the slope of the tangent line at any point x on the curve. The derivative of ln x is frac{1}{x}, so we have:   [   y' = frac{d}{dx}(ln x - n + 2) = frac{1}{x}.   ]2. Equating the slope of the tangent line to the curve: The line given is y=frac{1}{e}x+m+1, which has a constant slope of frac{1}{e}. Since the line is tangent to the curve, their slopes at the point of tangency must be equal. Thus, we set:   [   frac{1}{x} = frac{1}{e}.   ]   Solving for x gives us x=e.3. Finding the point of tangency: Substituting x=e into the equation of the line and the curve, we get:   [   frac{1}{e} cdot e + m + 1 = ln e - n + 2.   ]   Simplifying both sides, since ln e = 1, we find:   [   1 + m + 1 = 1 - n + 2.   ]   This simplifies further to:   [   m + n = 1.   ]4.

Let's denote the center of C_1 as O_1 with coordinates (-1,-4) and the center of C_2 as O_2 with coordinates (2,-2). The distance d between O_1 and O_2 is given by the distance formula: d = sqrt{ (2 - (-1))^2 + (-2 - (-4))^2 } = sqrt{ (2 + 1)^2 + (-2 + 4)^2 } = sqrt{ 3^2 + 2^2 } = sqrt{ 9 + 4 } = sqrt{ 13 }.The radius of C_1 is r_1 = sqrt{16} = 4, and the radius of C_2 is r_2 = sqrt{9} = 3. Now, we need to examine the relationship between the radii and the center distance d.For two circles, there are a few possibilities:- If d > r_1 + r_2, the circles do not intersect (they are separate).- If d < |r_1 - r_2|, one circle lies within the other without touching (they are contained without intersection).- If d = r_1 + r_2, the circles are externally tangent.- If d = |r_1 - r_2|, the circles are internally tangent.- If |r_1 - r_2| < d < r_1 + r_2, the circles intersect.Here, since 4 - 3 < d < 4 + 3, it follows that: 1 < sqrt{13} < 7.

Analyze the geometric properties:   - Since (M) is the midpoint of (AB), (M) is at ((50, 0)) in a coordinate system where (A) is at ((0, 0)) and (B) is at ((100, 0)).   - (P) is such that (MP = 50), meaning (P) lies on a circle centered at (M) with radius (50).   - (P) is also such that (PC = 100), meaning (P) lies on a circle centered at (C) with radius (100).3.

The derivative of f(x) is:f'(x)=frac{d}{dx}(xln{x})=ln{x}+1.Because the line y=2x+m is tangent to the graph of y=f(x), the slope of the tangent (derivative of f(x)) must equal the slope of the line, which is 2:ln{x}+1=2.Solving for x yields x=e. At x=e, f(e)=eln{e}=e since ln{e}=1.Thus, the tangent point is (e,e), and to find m, we set the equation of the tangent line at this point equal to the function:e=2e+m.Solving for m, we get m=-e. Therefore, the value of m is:boxed{m=-e}.(2) We have that f(x)=(x-a)ln{x}. Taking the derivative gives us:f'(x)=frac{d}{dx}((x-a)ln{x})=ln{x}+1-frac{a}{x}.Since f(x) needs to be a monotonically decreasing function on the interval [1,2], we require that f'(x)leq 0 throughout this interval.Therefore:ln{x}+1-frac{a}{x}leq 0.Multiplying through by x, which is positive on the interval [1,2]:xln{x}+x-aleq 0 Rightarrow a geq xln{x}+x.Define g(x)=xln{x}+x.

A real challenge was to convince oneself that there exist arbitrarily large integers n for which the statement is true. Here, working through small cases gave a good intuition of the solutions, but many cases had to be considered. Consequently, many students tried to use inequalities to show that, when n was arbitrarily large, the sum would become larger or smaller than n^{2}(n-1) / 4.

Now let f(x) satisfy the equation, which we denote E(a, b, c). Then clearly f(x)+C also does; therefore, we may suppose without loss of generality that f(0)=0. We start with proving Lemma. Either f(x) equiv 0 or f is injective. Proof. Denote by Theta subseteq mathbb{R}^{2} the set of points (a, b) for which f(a)=f(b). Let Theta^{*}={(x, y) in Theta : x neq y}. The idea is that if (a, b) in Theta, then by E(a, b, x) we get  H_{a, b}(x):=left(a b^{2}+b x^{2}+x a^{2}, a^{2} b+b^{2} x+x^{2} aright) in Theta  for all real x. Reproducing this argument starting with (a, b) in Theta^{*}, we get more and more points in Theta. There are many ways to fill in the details, we give below only one of them. Assume that (a, b) in Theta^{*}. Note that  g_{-}(x):=left(a b^{2}+b x^{2}+x a^{2}right)-left(a^{2} b+b^{2} x+x^{2} aright)=(a-b)(b-x)(x-a)  and  g_{+}(x):=left(a b^{2}+b x^{2}+x a^{2}right)+left(a^{2} b+b^{2} x+x^{2} aright)=left(x^{2}+a bright)(a+b)+xleft(a^{2}+b^{2}right).  Hence, there exists x for which both g_{-}(x) neq 0 and g_{+}(x) neq 0. This gives a point (alpha, beta)= H_{a, b}(x) in Theta^{*} for which alpha neq-beta. Now compare E(alpha, 1,0) and E(beta, 1,0). The left-hand side expressions coincide, on the right-hand side we get f(alpha)-fleft(alpha^{2}right)=f(beta)-fleft(beta^{2}right), respectively. Hence, fleft(alpha^{2}right)=fleft(beta^{2}right) and we get a point left(alpha_{1}, beta_{1}right):=left(alpha^{2}, beta^{2}right) in Theta^{*} with both coordinates alpha_{1}, beta_{1} non-negative. Continuing squaring the coordinates, we get a point (gamma, delta) in Theta^{*} for which delta>5 gamma geqslant 0. Our nearest goal is to get a point (0, r) in Theta^{*}. If gamma=0, this is already done. If gamma>0, denote by x a real root of the quadratic equation delta gamma^{2}+gamma x^{2}+x delta^{2}=0, which exists since the discriminant delta^{4}-4 delta gamma^{3} is positive. Also x0 for x>0 by injectivity. Assume that f(x) for x>0 does not have the form f(x)=x^{tau} for a constant tau. The known property of multiplicative functions yields that the graph of f is dense on (0, infty)^{2}. In particular, we may find positive b1. Also, such b can be found if f(x)=x^{tau} for some tau0 and some constant tau>0.

If 3(cos 2A - cos 2C) = 1 - cos 2B, then the minimum value of frac{sin C}{sin A sin B} + frac{cos C}{sin C} is ______.","solution":"To solve for the minimum value of frac{sin C}{sin A sin B} + frac{cos C}{sin C} given that 3(cos 2A - cos 2C) = 1 - cos 2B, we follow these steps:1. Apply Trigonometric Identities:   - Firstly, we use the trigonometric identities for the sum and difference of angles in sine: sin(alpha + beta) = sin alpha cos beta + cos alpha sin beta and sin(alpha - beta) = sin alpha cos β - cos α sin β.   - This allows us to express sin(alpha + beta) sin(alpha - beta) as sin^2 alpha - sin^2 beta through a series of algebraic manipulations:      [     sin(alpha + beta) sin(alpha - beta) = sin^2 alpha cos^2 beta - cos^2 alpha sin^2 beta = sin^2 alpha (1 - sin^2 beta) - (1 - sin^2 alpha) sin^2 beta = sin^2 alpha - sin^2 beta.     ]2. Derive Relation from Given:    - Applying the given condition 3(cos 2A - cos 2C) = 1 - cos 2B, and using trigonometric identities, we obtain 3(2sin^2 C - 2sin^2 A) = 2sin^2 B.   - Simplifying, we get 3sin(A + C) sin(C - A) = sin^2(A + C). Since sin B > 0, we deduce that 3sin(C - A) = sin(A + C).   - This simplifies to sin C cos A = 2cos C sin A, leading to tan C = 2tan A (given that A and C are acute angles).3. Solve for the Expression:    - The expression frac{sin C}{sin A sin B} + frac{cos C}{sin C} becomes frac{sin C}{sin A sin(A + C)} + frac{1}{tan C} after applying the relationship tan C = 2tan A.   - This simplifies to frac{1}{sin^2 A cdot frac{1}{2tan A} + frac{tan A}{1 + tan^2 A}} + frac{1}{2tan A}.   - Further simplification yields frac{1}{frac{tan A}{2(1 + tan^2 A)} + frac{tan A}{1 + tan^2 A}} + frac{1}{2tan A} = frac{7}{6tan A} + frac{2}{3}tan A.4. Find Minimum Value:   - To find the minimum value of the expression, we apply the AM-GM inequality: frac{7}{6tan A} + frac{2}{3}tan A geq 2sqrt{frac{7}{9}} = frac{2sqrt{7}}{3}.   - The equality holds when tan A = frac{sqrt{7}}{2}, which leads to the minimum value of the expression.Therefore, the minimum value of frac{sin C}{sin A sin B} + frac{cos C}{sin C} is boxed{frac{2sqrt{7}}{3}}."},{"problem":"Given x 、 y 、 z in[0,1].

This means that BC is parallel to the tangent to the given circle at D.If we take O to be the center of the given circle, then this means that OD is perpendicular to BC.  Let M be the midpoint of chord BC, and let N be the intersection of OD with the line through A parallel to BC.Since BC = 6, we know that BM = 3; since OB (a radius of the circle) is 5, we can conclude that triangle BMO is a 3-4-5 right triangle.

The [locus](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Locus) of midpoints N of the chord AD is a circle P, with diameter AO. Generally, the circle P can intersect the chord BC at two points, one point, or they may not have a point of intersection. By the problem condition, however, the circle P is tangent to BC at point N. Let M be the midpoint of the chord BC. From right triangle OMB, we have OM = sqrt{OB^2 - BM^2} =4. This gives tan angle BOM = frac{BM}{OM} = frac 3 4.Notice that the distance OM equals PN + PO cos angle AOM = r(1 + cos angle AOM), where r is the radius of circle P. Hence [cos angle AOM = frac{OM}{r} - 1 = frac{2OM}{R} - 1 = frac 8 5 - 1 = frac 3 5] (where R represents the radius, 5, of the large circle given in the question). Therefore, since angle AOM is clearly acute, we see that [tan angle AOM =frac{sqrt{1 - cos^2 angle AOM}}{cos angle AOM} = frac{sqrt{5^2 - 3^2}}{3} = frac 4 3]Next, notice that angle AOB = angle AOM - angle BOM. We can therefore apply the subtraction formula for tan to obtain [tan angle AOB =frac{tan angle AOM - tan angle BOM}{1 + tan angle AOM cdot tan angle BOM} =frac{frac 4 3 - frac 3 4}{1 + frac 4 3 cdot frac 3 4} = frac{7}{24}] It follows that sin angle AOB =frac{7}{sqrt{7^2+24^2}} = frac{7}{25}, such that the answer is 7 cdot 25=boxed{175}.Solution 3This solution, while similar to Solution 2, is arguably more motivated and less contrived.Firstly, we note the statement in the problem that \\"AD is the only chord starting at A and bisected by BC\\" – what is its significance? What is the criterion for this statement to be true?We consider the locus of midpoints of the chords from A. It is well-known that this is the circle with diameter AO, where O is the center of the circle. The proof is simple: every midpoint of a chord is a dilation of the endpoint with scale factor frac{1}{2} and center A. Thus, the locus is the result of the dilation with scale factor frac{1}{2} and centre A of circle O. Let the center of this circle be P.Now, AD is bisected by BC if they cross at some point N on the circle. Moreover, since AD is the only chord, BC must be tangent to the circle P.The rest of this problem is straightforward.Our goal is to find sin angle AOB = sin{left(angle AOM - angle BOMright)}, where M is the midpoint of BC. We have BM=3 and OM=4.Let R be the projection of A onto OM, and similarly let Q be the projection of P onto OM. Then it remains to find AR so that we can use the addition formula for sin.As PN is a radius of circle P, PN=2.5, and similarly, PO=2.5. Since OM=4, we have OQ=OM-QM=OM-PN=4-2.5=1.5. Thus PQ=sqrt{2.5^2-1.5^2}=2.Further, we see that triangle OAR is a dilation of triangle OPQ about center O with scale factor 2, so AR=2PQ=4.Lastly, we apply the formula:[sin{left(angle AOM - angle BOMright)} = sin angle AOM cos angle BOM - sin angle BOM cos angle AOM = left(frac{4}{5}right)left(frac{4}{5}right)-left(frac{3}{5}right)left(frac{3}{5}right)=frac{7}{25}]Thus the answer is 7cdot25=boxed{175}.Solution 4 (coordinate geometry)Aime1983p15s2.pngLet the circle have equation x^2 + y^2 = 25, with centre O(0,0). Since BC=6, we can calculate (by the Pythagorean Theorem) that the distance from O to the line BC is 4. Therefore, we can let B=(3,4) and C=(-3,4). Now, assume that A is any point on the major arc BC, and D any point on the minor arc BC. We can write A=(5 cos alpha, 5 sin alpha), where alpha is the angle measured from the positive x axis to the ray OA. It will also be convenient to define angle XOB = alpha_0. Firstly, since B must lie in the minor arc AD, we see that alpha in left(-frac{pi}{2}-alpha_0,alpha_0right). However, since the midpoint of AD must lie on BC, and the highest possible y-coordinate of D is 5, we see that the y-coordinate cannot be lower than 3, that is, alpha in left[sin^{-1}frac{3}{5},alpha_0right).Secondly, there is a theorem that says that, in a circle, if a chord is bisected by a radius, then they must be perpendicular. Therefore, suppose that P is the intersection point of AD and BC, so that by the theorem, OP is perpendicular to AD. So, if AD is the only chord starting at A which is bisected by BC, this means that P is the only point on the chord BC such that OP is perpendicular to AD. Now suppose that P=(p,4), where p in (-3,3). The fact that OP must be perpendicular to AD is equivalent to the following equation:[-1 = left(text{slope of } OPright)left(text{slope of } APright)]which becomes[-1 = frac{4}{p} cdot frac{5sin alpha - 4}{5cos alpha - p}]This rearranges to[p^2 - (5cos alpha)p + 16 - 20 sin alpha = 0]Given that this equation must have only one real root pin (-3,3), we study the following function:[f(x) =  x^2 - (5cos alpha)x + 16 - 20 sin alpha]First, by the fact that the equation f(x)=0 has real solutions, its discriminant Delta must be non-negative, so we calculate[begin{split}Delta & = (5cos alpha)^2 - 4(16-20sin alpha)  & =  25 (1- sin^2 alpha)  - 64 + 80 sin alpha  & = -25 sin^2 alpha + 80sin alpha - 39  & =  (13 - 5sin alpha)(5sin alpha - 3)end{split}]It is obvious that this is in fact non-negative. If it is actually zero, then sin alpha = frac{3}{5}, and cos alpha = frac{4}{5}. In this case, p = frac{5cos alpha}{2} = 2 in (-3,3), so we have found a possible solution. We thus calculate sin(text{central angle of minor arc } AB) = sin (alpha_0 - alpha) = frac{4}{5}cdot frac{4}{5} - frac{3}{5} cdot frac{3}{5} = frac{7}{25} by the subtraction formula for sin. This means that the answer is 7 cdot 25 = 175.Addendum to Solution 4Since this is an AIME problem, we can assume that we are done since we have found one possible case. However, in a full-solution contest, we could not assume that the answer is unique, but would need to prove that this is the unique solution. This can be proven as follows.Suppose that Delta > 0, which would mean that there could be two real roots of f(x), one lying in the interval (-3,3), and another outside of it. We also see, by [Vieta's Formulas](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Vieta%27s_Formulas), that the average of the two roots is frac{5cos alpha}{2}, which is non-negative, so the root outside of (-3,3) must be no less than 3. By considering the graph of y=f(x), which is a \\"U-shaped\\" parabola, it is now evident that f(-3) > 0 and f(3)leq 0. We can just use the second inequality:[0 geq  f(3) =  25  - 15cos alpha - 20 sin alpha]so[3cos alpha + 4 sin alpha  geq 5]The only way for this inequality to be satisfied is when A=B (by applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, or just plotting the line 3x+4y=5 to see that point A can't be above this line), which does not make sense in the original problem statement. (For it would mean that the point A lies in the half-plane above the line 3x+4y=5, inclusive, and the half-plane below the line -3x+4y=5, exclusive. This can be seen to be impossible by drawing the lines and observing that the intersection of the two half-planes does not share any point with the circle.)Solution 5Let the center of the circle be O. Fix B,C, and A. Then, as D moves around the circle, the locus of the midpoints of AD is clearly a circle. Since the problems gives that AD is the only chord starting at A bisected by BC, it follows that the circle with diameter DO and AO is tangent to BC.Now, let the intersection of BC and AD be E and let the midpoint of AO (the center of the circle tangent to BC that we described beforehand) be F. Drop the altitude from O to BC and call its intersection with BC K. Drop the perpendicular from F to KO and call its intersection with KO L. Clearly, KO = sqrt{OC^2-KC^2} = sqrt{5^2-3^2} = 4 and since EF is radius, it equals frac{5}{2}. The same applies for FO, which also equals frac{5}{2}. By the Pythagorean theorem, we deduce that FL = 2, so EK = 2. This is very important information! Now we know that BE = 1, so by Power of a Point, AE = ED = sqrt{5}.We’re almost there! Since by the Pythagorean theorem, ED^2 + EO^2 = 25, we deduce that EO = 2sqrt{5}. EC=OC=5, so sin (CEO) = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}. Furthermore, since sin (CEO) = cos(DEC), we know that cos (DEC) = frac{2sqrt{5}}{5}. By the law of cosines,[DC^2 = (sqrt{5})^2 + 5^2 -10sqrt{5} cdot frac{2sqrt{5}}{5} = 10]Therefore, DC = sqrt{10} Longleftrightarrow BA = sqrt{2}. Now, drop the altitude from O to BA and call its intersection with BA Z. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, OZ = frac{7sqrt{2}}{2}. Thus, sin (BOZ) = frac{sqrt{2}}{10} and cos (BOZ) = frac{7sqrt{2}}{10}. As a result, sin (BOA) = sin (2 BOZ) = 2sin(BOZ)cos(BOZ) = frac{7}{25}. 7 cdot 25 = boxed{175}.Solution 6[Dgram.png](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/File:Dgram.png) [](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/File:Dgram.png)Let I be the intersection of AD and BC.Lemma: AI = ID if and only if angle AIO = 90.Proof: If AI = ID, we get AO = OD, and thus IO is a perpendicular bisector of AD. If angle AIO = 90, We can get triangle AIO cong triangle OIDLet  be this the circle with diameter AO.Thus, we get angle AIO = 90, implying I must lie on omega. I also must lie on BC. If both of these conditions are satisfied, The extension of AI intersecting with circle O will create a point D such that AI = ID. Thus, since AD is the only chord starting at A, there must be only 1 possible I, implying the circle with diameter AO is tangent to BC.Now, create a coordinate system such that the origin is O and the y-axis is perpendicular to BC. The positive x direction is from B to C.Let Z be (0,5).Let Y be (-5,0).Let X be the center of omega. Since omega's radius is frac{5}{2}, the altitude from X to OY is 1.5, since the altitude from I to OY is 4. XO is 2.5, so sin(XOY) = sin(AOY) = frac{3}{5}. sin(BOZ) =  frac{3}{5}. If we let sin(theta) = frac{3}{5}, we can find that what we are looking for is sin(90 - 2theta), which we can evaluate and get frac{7}{25} implies boxed{175}-AlexlikemathSolution 7 (No Trig)Let O be the center of the circle. The locus of midpoints of chords with A as a endpoint is a circle with diameter overline{AO}. Additionally, this circle must be tangent to overline{BC}. Let the center of this circle be P. Let M be the midpoint of BC, N be the foot of the perpendicular from P to overline{BM}, and K be the foot of the perpendicular from B to overline{AP}. Let x=BK.From right triangle BKO, we get KO = sqrt{25-x^2}. Thus, KP = sqrt{25-x^2}-frac52.Since BO = 5, BM = 3, and angle BMO is right, MO=4. From quadrilateral MNPO, we get MN = sqrt{PO^2 - (MO - NP)^2} = sqrt{(5/2)^2 - (4 - 5/2)^2} = sqrt{(5/2)^2 - (3/2)^2} = 2. Thus, BN = 1.Since angles BNP and BKP are right, we get [BK^2+KP^2 = BN^2 + NP^2 implies x^2 + left(sqrt{25-x^2}-frac52right)^2 = left(frac52right)^2 + 1][25 - 5sqrt{25-x^2} = 1][5sqrt{25-x^2} = 24][25(25-x^2) = 24^2][25x^2 = 25^2 - 24^2 = 49][x = frac75]Thus, sin angle AOB = frac{x}{5} = frac{7}{25}implies boxed{175}.~rayfish"},{"problem":"Calculate: frac{{cos190°(1+sqrt{3}tan10°)}}{{sin290°sqrt{1-cos40°}}}=______.","solution":"To solve the given problem, we'll break down the solution into detailed steps:Given:[frac{{cos190°(1+sqrt{3}tan10°)}}{{sin290°sqrt{1-cos40°}}}]Step 1: Simplify the trigonometric functions based on their angles.- cos190° = -cos10° because cos(180° + theta) = -costheta.- sin290° = -sin70° because sin(270° + theta) = -costheta.- tan10° = frac{sin10°}{cos10°} by definition.Step 2: Substitute the simplified trigonometric functions into the equation.[frac{{-cos10°(1+sqrt{3}cdotfrac{{sin10°}}{{cos10°}})}}{{-sin70°sqrt{1-cos40°}}}]Step 3: Simplify the expression under the square root using the trigonometric identity 1 - cos2theta = 2sin^2theta.- For theta = 20°, we have 1 - cos40° = 2sin^2 20°.Step 4: Substitute the simplified expression into the equation.[frac{{cos10°+sqrt{3}sin10°}}{{sqrt{2}sin20°cos20°}}]Step 5: Use the double angle formula for sine, sin2theta = 2sinthetacostheta.- For theta = 20°, we have sin40° = 2sin20°cos20°.Step 6: Substitute the double angle formula into the equation.[frac{{2sin40°}}{{frac{{sqrt{2}}}{2}sin40°}}]Step 7: Simplify the equation.- The sin40° terms cancel out, and we are left with 2sqrt{2}.Therefore, the final answer is:[boxed{2sqrt{2}}]"},{"problem":"Find the x, y integers such that x^{3}(y+1)+y^{3}(x+1)=19.","solution":"Again, nothing very pretty.

We will assume henceforth that x, y are different from 0 and -1.

For (x, y)=(1,1), we get 4=19, a contradiction. For (x, y)=(2,1), we get 82+13=19. Thus (2,1) and (1,2) are solutions.If x and y are negative, we have x leq-2 and y leq-2. If x leq-3, we have x^{3}(y+1)+y^{3}(x+1) geq 27>19 which is impossible. Therefore, y>-3 and x>-3 by symmetry, so x=-2=y. However, in this case, x and y are not coprime, a contradiction.The remaining case is where x is strictly positive and y is strictly negative (the other case is identical by symmetry). In this case, x^{3}(y+1) leq 0 and y^{3}(x+1) leq 0 so (x, y) is not a solution.Thus, the solutions to the equation are the pairs (2,1),(1,2),(-20,-1),(-1,-20).## 2 Mid-term Training## Statements"},{"problem":"6.5. 101 people bought 212 balloons of four colors, and each of them bought at least one balloon, but no one had two balloons of the same color.

Suppose now that each person who bought 4 balloons gives one balloon to someone who bought 2. Now everyone has either 1 or 3 balloons, and the total number of people and balloons remains the same. Suppose now that everyone releases one balloon into the sky; 72 balloons will remain, with each person having either 2 balloons or none.

The inner parts of the halves completely cover the rectangle, while 22 nodes, located in these halves, coincide. Therefore, the number of nodes in the rectangle is 22 less than in the two halves, that is, T+1156-22. At the same time, this number is obviously equal to 1009 cdot 1156.

First, we show how to construct a good collection of n triangles, each of perimeter greater than 4 . This will show that all t leqslant 4 satisfy the required conditions.Construct inductively an (n+2)-gon B A_{1} A_{2} ldots A_{n} C inscribed in omega such that B C is a diameter, and B A_{1} A_{2}, B A_{2} A_{3}, ldots, B A_{n-1} A_{n}, B A_{n} C is a good collection of n triangles. For n=1, take any triangle B A_{1} C inscribed in omega such that B C is a diameter; its perimeter is greater than 2 B C=4. To perform the inductive step, assume that the (n+2)-gon B A_{1} A_{2} ldots A_{n} C is already constructed. Since A_{n} B+A_{n} C+B C>4, one can choose a point A_{n+1} on the small arc widetilde{C A_{n}}, close enough to C, so that A_{n} B+A_{n} A_{n+1}+B A_{n+1} is still greater than 4 . Thus each of these new triangles B A_{n} A_{n+1} and B A_{n+1} C has perimeter greater than 4 , which completes the induction step.We proceed by showing that no t>4 satisfies the conditions of the problem. To this end, we assume that there exists a good collection T of n triangles, each of perimeter greater than t, and then bound n from above.Take varepsilon>0 such that t=4+2 varepsilon.Claim. There exists a positive constant sigma=sigma(varepsilon) such that any triangle Delta with perimeter 2 s geqslant 4+2 varepsilon, inscribed in omega, has area S(Delta) at least sigma.Proof. Let a, b, c be the side lengths of Delta. Since Delta is inscribed in omega, each side has length at most 2. Therefore, s-a geqslant(2+varepsilon)-2=varepsilon. Similarly, s-b geqslant varepsilon and s-c geqslant varepsilon. By Heron's formula, S(Delta)=sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} geqslant sqrt{(2+varepsilon) varepsilon^{3}}. Thus we can set sigma(varepsilon)=sqrt{(2+varepsilon) varepsilon^{3}}.Now we see that the total area S of all triangles from T is at least n sigma(varepsilon). On the other hand, S does not exceed the area of the disk bounded by omega. Thus n sigma(varepsilon) leqslant pi, which means that n is bounded from above.Comment 1. One may prove the Claim using the formula S=frac{a b c}{4 R} instead of Heron's formula.Comment 2. In the statement of the problem condition (i) could be replaced by a weaker one: each triangle from T lies within omega.

The perimeter of the board is 128 mathrm{~cm}.","solution":"a) By drawing the network and (with a different colored pencil) retracing it. Considering the intersections of the dividing and boundary lines of the board as nodes, 4 paths lead from the internal nodes to the adjacent nodes (even nodes), 2 paths from the corner nodes (even nodes), and 3 paths from the nodes on the boundary and dividing lines (odd nodes).When looking for the minimum number of pencil lifts, we only lift the pencil at a point V where we cannot proceed further, obviously only at a node, if we have drawn the last path belonging to it. The starting point can only be a node as well, because the pencil line can be extended backward. In every K starting point, we use 1 path, which is why the node - in terms of the remaining paths - changes to the opposite parity (from odd to even, from even to odd). If we pass through a node, the number of remaining paths decreases by 2, so its parity does not change. Thus, we complete the drawing of all paths from a corner node in one pass, and from the internal nodes in two passes (unless we started from such a node). For an odd node, however, only 1 path remains free after one pass, and we must lift the pencil when we arrive there again.It is evident from this that it is only useful to use an originally odd node as K, and - adhering to this rule - only an originally odd node can be V. The number of K and V points is equal. There are 7 odd nodes on each side, totaling 28, of which 14 will be K and 14 will be V, so we need to lift the pencil 13 times and 14 times at the end to finish.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_90c9129066af9dc3414fg-1.jpg?height=559&width=507&top_left_y=802&top_left_x=755)Figure 1b) To complete our path without lifting the pencil, we need to retrace every path from each V to the next K, so we must choose a nearby new K for each V. The distance between adjacent odd points on the same side is equal to the side c of the squares, and the nearest odd points on two adjacent sides are 2c apart (on the line). The 7 odd points on each side can be paired into three adjacent V-K pairs, resulting in 4 cdot 3c = 12c extra paths. If we choose the remaining odd point on each side to be the neighbor of two opposite corners of the board (points A, B, C, D in the figure), and the connecting path's K and V are A and D, then an additional 2c extra path is needed between B and C.The perimeter of the board is 32c = 128, so c = 4 text{ cm}. The length of the lines in the network is 2 cdot 9 cdot 8c = 576 text{ cm}, the retraced path is 14c = 56 text{ cm}, so the length of the shortest path is 632 text{ cm}. Figure 1 shows that such a retracing path indeed exists.Kultsár Szabolcs (Hajdúböszörmény, Bocskai I. g. II. o. t.) Padányi Piroska (Budapest, Radnóti M. g. I. o. t.)Note. If the network contains 2n times 2n squares instead of 8 times 8, or 2n+1 segments of length 2nc in each direction, then the number of odd nodes is 4(2n-1), and thus the pencil must be lifted (including the final lift) 2(2n-1) = 4n-2 times. If we want to retrace this network without lifting the pencil, then the path length is[2(2n+1)2n + 4(n-1) + 2]c = (8n^2 - 8n - 2)cIf, however, we are dealing with a (2n+1)^2 chessboard, then the 4 cdot 2n odd nodes require 4n lifts, and the total path length of the pencil is[2(2n+2)(2n+1) + 4n - 1]c = (8n^2 + 16n + 3)cIndeed, here the pairing of the 2n odd nodes on each side into V-K pairs requires nc extra paths, but one such pairing is redundant in the entire network because 2 (adjacent) nodes serve as the K and V of the entire path. The existence of such a path for a 7 times 7 chessboard is shown in Figure 2.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_90c9129066af9dc3414fg-2.jpg?height=409&width=382&top_left_y=159&top_left_x=861)Figure 2(K and V are not marked for symmetry reasons; any two endpoints of a retraced c-segment can be used for this purpose.)

Then, in one minute, the cold water will fill 3 / 20 of the bathtub, the hot water will fill 1 / 8 of the bathtub, and 3 / 40 of the bathtub will drain. Therefore, in one minute, the bathtub will fill 3 / 20+1 / 8-3 / 40, i.e., 1 / 5 of the bathtub. Thus, the entire bathtub will be filled in 5 minutes."},{"problem":"28.1.12 In the plane, given 5 points, where no three points are collinear, and no four points are concyclic. If a circle passes through three of these points, and the other two points are respectively inside and outside the circle, then it is called a good circle. Let the number of good circles be n, try to find the possible values of n.","solution":"Consider any two points A, B among 5 points, and let the remaining three points be C, D, F.If C, D, E are on the same side of line AB, without loss of generality, assume angle ACB < 180^{circ}, in this case, the circle ABD is the unique good circle;(3) angle ACB + angle AEB < 180^{circ} < angle ADB + angle AEB, in this case, the circles ABC, ABD, ABE are all good circles;The above discussion shows that for any two given points, the number of good circles is either 1 or 3.5 points can form 10 pairs, and there is at least one good circle passing through each pair, so there are at least 10 good circles (counted with repetition). Since each good circle passes through exactly 3 pairs, there are at least 4 different good circles, i.e., n geqslant 4.With 5 points, 10 line segments can be formed, each of which is a chord of an odd number (1 or 3) of good circles. The sum of 10 odd numbers is even, and each good circle has exactly 3 chords, so n is even.If n geqslant 6, then at least frac{3 times 6 - 10}{2} = 4 line segments are common chords of 3 good circles. 4 line segments have 8 endpoints, so there must be two line segments with a common endpoint, say AB and AC. Thus, the circles ABD and ACD are both good circles, so there are at least 2 good circles passing through A and D, and of course, there must be 3. Similarly, there are 3 good circles passing through A and E. By symmetry, assume the shortest line segment among AB, AC, AD, AE is AB. Then angle ACB, angle ADB, angle AEB are all acute angles. From the previous discussion, if C, D, E are on the same side of line AB, then there is only one good circle passing through A and B; if C, D, E are on different sides of line AB, then since the sum of any two angles among angle ACB, angle ADB, angle AEB is less than 180^{circ}, there is also only one good circle passing through A and B.

A circle with its center lying on the height B H passes through the vertices of the triangle B, C and intersects the side A B at point E.

Right triangles B H A and B E D are similar ( angle B is common), angle B C E=angle B D E (as inscribed angles subtending the same arc), therefore, angle B A C=angle B D E=angle B C E. Next, triangles C B E and A B C are similar (by two angles: angle B is common, angle B A C=angle B C E).From the equality of the ratios of corresponding sides, we find:frac{B E}{B C}=frac{B C}{A B^{prime}}, B E=frac{B C^{2}}{A B}=frac{36}{8}=4.5Therefore, A E=8-4.5=3.5.Answer: 3.5## №8: Parameter.Find all values of the parameter a for which the equation a^{2}+13|x-1|+3 sqrt{4 x^{2}-8 x+13}=3 a+3|4 x-3 a-4| has at least one root. In the answer, specify the sum of all integer values of the parameter that satisfy the condition of the problem.## Solution:Rewrite the equation as a^{2}-3 a+3 sqrt{(2 x-2)^{2}+9}=3|4 x-3 a-4|-13|x-1| and consider the functions f(x)=a^{2}-3 a+3 sqrt{(2 x-2)^{2}+9} and g(x)=3|4 x-3 a-4|-13|x-1|, defined and continuous on the set of real numbers. The graph of the function y=g(x) represents a piecewise-linear function consisting of segments of lines and rays. For x geq 1 each segment of the graph is part of a line of the form y=k x+b, where k<0 (since for any expansion of the first modulus, the coefficient of x will be negative). Therefore, on the interval [1 ;+infty) the function y=g(x) decreases from g(0) to -infty. Similarly, it can be shown that on the interval (-infty ; 1] the function g(x) increases from -infty to g(0). Therefore, at the point x=1 this function reaches its maximum value. g_{text {max. }}=g(1)=3|3 a|=9|a|.Based on the properties of monotonic functions, the function f(x) takes its minimum value at x=1 . f_{text {min. }}=f(1)=a^{2}-3 a+9. On [1 ;+infty) f(x) increases from f(0) to +infty, and on the interval (-infty ; 0] it decreases from +infty to f(0).Therefore, the equation f(x)=g(x) has at least one root only when f_{text {min. }} leq g_{text {max., }}, that is, when the inequality a^{2}-3 a+9 leq 9|a| is satisfied. For a geq 0 quad we get a^{2}-3 a+9 leq 9 a ; a^{2}-12 a+9 leq 0 ; frac{D}{4}=36-9=27; a_{1,2}=6 pm 3 sqrt{3} ; quad a in[6-3 sqrt{3} ; 6+3 sqrt{3}] . quad For quad a<0 quad we have a^{2}+6 a+9 leq 0 ;(a+3)^{2} leq 0 ; a=-3. Thus, the equation has at least one root for a in{-3} cup[6-3 sqrt{3} ; 6+3 sqrt{3}]. Estimate between which integers the boundaries of the interval lie: 0<6-3 sqrt{3}<1 ; 11<6+3 sqrt{3}<12. Therefore, the integers on the considered interval are from 1 to 11 inclusive.
