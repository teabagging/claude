A massive bruise formed over my greater trochanter and the coloration spread all around my thigh, but there wasn t too much pain. 6 days after the fall, I started getting intermittent sharp stinging pain from my thigh. The pain is so intense that I can t stand on or move that leg much, and this lasts for minutes to a couple hours at a time.

She landed on her bottom on concrete. She got up and was talking, but had no color in her face/lips. She started feeling dizzy and nauseous. We got her to sit and she dry heaved a few times. Said she couldn t see or hear. Leaned her back against her dad who sat on the floor to hold her. She was getting worse, her arm started shaking and them her head (seizing). Her eyes were open, but she wasn t communicating. Then she went limp. I ran upstairs for the phone to call 911 while my husband was holding her, calling for her to come back. By the time I got back to the stairway, she was awake again, so she wasn t even out a minute. The 911 call didn t go through before my husband stopped me. She slowly started coming around. Got some color back, felt less nauseous, could see and hear better. Now (about 20 minutes later), she seems ok. A little weak and low on energy, but talking, laughing, asking questions and asking for food. No bumps, no blood, no pain other than her elbow. Should she still be seen, or can we just watch her here at home? If so, what should we watch for.","Doctor":"Hi,YOU SHOULD SEE A PHYSICIAN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!What actually happened was the blood supply to her brain stopped transiently resulting in the physical manifestation she had. she might have had carotid dissection. immediate attention is required with thourough body check up. there might be some embolus obstructing blood vessels also. proper aetiology can be derived only by proper investigations which is also important to prevent any further such incidence. hope that helps! take care! :)"},{"Patient":"I had a car accident two days ago.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your treating physician, I would prescribe some anti inflammatory drug along with a proton pump inhibitor for a few days. Apart from this, I would refer you to a physiotherapy department where they might give you some heating either with an infra red device, or short-wave diathermy device, which are soothing and help in healing of the wound in muscle and bone. The second part of your history is a little perplexing on the pain in both sides of your lower abdomen and the nauseous feeling. This might call for an ultrasound abdomen to rule out any secondary abdominal pathology. A careful clinical examination of the abdomen is also a vital part of the management  in your case. Therefore, in case of increase in the intensity of pain and discomfort, I would not hesitate to refer you to a general surgeon for an examination and further management.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

If it's small amounts of black /cola coloured blood, then it's almost ok as it is the altered blood formed from small tears which might have formed in your oral tract during the injury. If so, it will heal by itself. If you were wearing a safety helmet during riding, again you are on the safe side. But the most important thing is that we had to rule out fractures of skull and face which can also result in spitting of blood.

If the cat bite produced tear in your skin or blood has come out, then you have to take the anti Rabies vaccination and tetanus vaccination.

MY question is: How long till the purple colour is gone? Will it persist even after getting stitches removed? Should I clean the area around stitches? If yes ,with what I am supposed to clean? How should I brush my teeth? Its really painful if I brush my teeth.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to health care magic forums. Usually the skin around stitches will take 7 to 10 days to heal properly and the healing will be complete by 1 month, depending upon the site of injury, depth of the cut and infections if any. Usually the doctor will give antibiotics for 5 days to accelerate healing and prevent infections. The black colour will gradually fade and will disappear when healing is complete. It's not permanent. But the stitch marks will persist for a long time. You haven't mentioned the exact site of the wound on your lower lips. If it involves the inner side of mouth, it's better to avoid brushing for a week. Instead apply tooth paste in your index finger and brush gently without causing much disturbance to the wound. You can use a good mouth wash twice a day to improve oral hygiene. About dressing of the wound, it's recommended to go back to the hospital where the stitching is done, every alternative day, so that nurses will do the cleaning using Povidone Iodine.

Valerian [Tagar] is most commonly used for sleep disorders [insomnia] and also used to treat anxiety, stress, muscular cramps and spasms Valerian has an action similar to benzodiazepines by increasing the amount of chemical called GABA which helps regulate nerve cells and has a calming effect on anxiety. 2. common side effects include a headache, upset stomach, dry mouth, excitation, strange dreams and daytime drowsiness and since Valerian does have a drug interaction with anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, so one should not take them if taking Valerian as single or in compound form. 3.

The leaves can have either smooth or notched edges and are often clustered in groups of three.Most of the time, poison oak rash can be treated at home. If you think you’ve been exposed, you should remove your clothing. Wash your clothes and anything else that may have come into contact with the poison. The oils from the plant can remain on fabric and other materials and can give you another rash.Also wash your body well with plenty of lukewarm water and soap. Pay special attention to your hands, fingernails, and whatever skin may have touched the plant.The rash can be very itchy and the temptation to scratch is strong, but scratching can cause an infection. Touching the blisters can also result in infection. Take lukewarm baths or cool showers to ease itching.Over-the-counter remedies like calamine lotion or hydrocortisone cream may temporarily take care of the itch. You can also try applying cool compresses to the itchy patches. Antihistamine pills can also help with the itching. But be careful — antihistamine on your skin can make matters worse.See your doctor or dermatologist if symptoms don’t improve within 10 days. A poison oak rash can be diagnosed by its appearance.Hope this info was helpful.stay healthy,stay safe."},{"Patient":"I am a final year medical student suffering from factitious cheilitis (due to lip sucking behavior)I was prescribed triamcinolone and have been using it for the past seven months ( applying once in the morning and night )Are there any other measures which helps me get rid off this condition as i am very much concerned about the long term use of steroids Note: good oral hygiene practice, no mineral and vitamin deficiencies  , lft is normal Chapped lips on washing with water produces whitish coat (predominantly lower lip )","Doctor":"hello,daily application of butter(unsalted) or coconut oil thrice a day is helpful.marigold( Calendula officinalis) oil can also be used for external application."},{"Patient":"I've been having discomfort to the back of both knees (in the bend of the knee) for quite a while.

Great question.  There are quite a few herbs that function as well if not better than prescription medication.  The first is St. Johns Wort that you've probably heard of.  It increases serotonin in the brain as do the SSRI's (prescription medication) with fewer side effects. It is effective for both depression and anxiety but can interact w some prescription medications so I would ask your physician.  Other herbs include passionflower, gingko biloba (also helps w memory but has a positive serotonergic effect), vitamin D, magnesium, and passionflower to name a few.  These are generally safe and effective.  Kava is as effective as xanax or ativan however there have been rare cases of severe liver disease with it, so I would not recommend it."},{"Patient":"Hi can alpha lipoic acid work on diabetic neuropathy and chronic sciatica? Is there any good natural treatment for severe RLS? I currently am prescribed 8mg of Ropinirole per day and some days it does NOTHING to relieve the symptoms.....please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your concern. Yes Alpha lipoic acid works on Diabetic Neuropathy and off course on Chronic Sciatica.ALA (ALpha Lipoic Acid) helps to1. Reduce the sharp, radiating pain from the pressure on the sciatic nerve2. Get rid of the burning, numbness and restlessness sensations3. Reduce stress and anxiety especially at night when trying to sleep4. Improve your strength, balance and coordinationThere are some good natural treatments for severe RLS. Only thing you need to have some patience with Ayurveda line of treatment.First of all you need to inculcate some modifications in your lifestyle. I would like to suggest you some tips. Try to follow them.1.Starting a regular exercise program. Start a regular walk for atleast 15-20 mins. Whenever you feel like walking, just do it. But don't miss it. Make it a schedule for daily. Keep moving to get relieved from RLS. Easy to moderate exercise can help alleviate RLS. Take care of doing over-exercise. Excessive exercise with lots of sweating and hard muscle contractions can aggravate symptoms.2. Eliminating or reducing caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco in your diet.3. Ensuring adequate sleep. You can use Chamomile tea as it induces sleep and wards off sleeplessness, thus relieves RLS4. Getting leg massages with Ayurvedic oils like Mahanaryan oil. This is the most common oil available in market.5. Avoiding standing or sitting for long periods of time. As prolonged standing can sometimes cause you oedema.6. RLS sometimes aggravates due to lack of water. Drink water liberally. 7. Reduce stress by doing breathing techniques, meditation, Yoga, retiring from late night works, keeping home and office affairs distinct from each other etc. Keep yourself happy as much as you can. Do something what you always enjoy to do.8. Eat a balanced healthy diet of fruits, vegetables and lean proteins. Since Ayurveda believes that RLS is a disease caused by vitiated VAt in your body. So I will suggest you to follow undermentioned procedures. Please look for a good and experienced panchkarma specialist in your area and take his help.1. Massage of the afflicted part (butt, lower back and lower limb) using Ayurvedic medicated oils like Tila Taila (Sesame oil)Ksheerabala TailamMahamasha Tailam.2.KAti vasti is very effective in RLS –Local oil pooling around the lumbar and sacroiliac joints is highly beneficial in RLS and nerve disorders afflicting the lower limbs . This treatment soothes the nerves supplying the lower limb at their origin i.e. in the lower back region, just like treating the roots of the plant.3. Hot fomentation or sweat inducing treatment.I hope the above mentioned guidelines helps you. Wish you a speedy recovery.ThanksDr. Tripat Mehta"},{"Patient":"I took an herbal pain relief substance called Kratom. I took it according to the vendors instructions.

In 1996, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration began classifying acupuncture needles as medical instruments, and it now requires that acupuncturists use only sterile, disposable needles. Also, acupuncturists will swab the acupuncture areas first with an antiseptic, so there is very little risk of infection.

Anxiety is one of the most common mental illnesses worldwide. Many people suffer some form of anxiety occasionally but others cannot manage this natural response to a stressful situation. When a person experiences a highly stressful or threatening scenario, the mind can be overloaded and fail to develop ways of coping. Acupuncture is an ancient form of traditional Chinese medicine. It works on the principle of stimulating points in the body to correct imbalances in the flow of energy through channels known as meridians. This belief is based on the interaction of the five elements (wood, fire, earth, metal and water) and having profound effects on internal organs, which are either yin or yang.Traditional Chinese medicine also recognizes the mind and body interacting as one, meaning that emotions have a physiological effect on the body.Western medical practitioners traditionally have questioned the validity of traditional Chinese medicines such as acupuncture. More recently, acupuncture has been recognized as a legitimate treatment for some conditions and is growing in popularity.<>Traditional Chinese medicine relates anxiety to an imbalance of the heart and kidney. Fire represents the heart and joy according to the five elements. The diagnosis is that too much heat in the heart will imbalance the interaction with the kidney (represented as water and fear). This will result in the water organ failing to contain the fire organ rising up to the mind, leading to anxiety. Acupuncture on points around the heart, kidney, spleen and ear are used to treat anxiety. Pro and con of everything are there  t least it has no side effects . So you should not worry about it .

On medical front formulating a drug by mixing different herbs has different para meters depending upon their gun dosh ras virya vipak etc. The main consideration is whether herbs having light or heavy effect are being mixed or mixing of one that increases pit with one that increases kaph will negate the net medical outcome. so mixing of herbs per choice is not recommended but mixing herbs based on ethics is highly recommended.As far consideration is for refreshing tea it depends on flavor and taste. There are companies pumping pit pacifying tea, kaph pacifying tea or vaat pacifying tea. Herbal tea and masal tea are also in routine use.

The bleeding with the stool and without pain is suggestive of the Hemorrhoids or piles. This is due to the fact that due to anal intercourse the tissues supporting the veins get loosened up allowing them to swell. The pain int he right abdomen can be due to colitis or IBS which you must also be suffering already. This does not look to be cancer as there will be mass at teh rectum, or the anal canal. I would advise you the following.::Talk to your PCP, Get a reference to the Surgical Gastroenterologist.Get ano-proctoscopy and colonoscopy and biopsy to see what the exact problem is like . 'Once the diagnosis is made further proper treatment can be very well planned. If there are large piles get operated, if small get the proper medication.Have Sitz bath twice daily.No anal sex at all."},{"Patient":"My Age 41, Height 5ft 4in, weight 59 and currently no any health problem.I facing dental bone loss problem, Dr. suggested to remove teeth and use teeth cap.

I was suffering from fever since the Aug 28 and the temperature was going up and down with my throat burning. I was treated initially with paracetemol and ciprofloxacin for about 3 days first and then when again I was having the temperature and the same symptoms, the medication continued for another 4 days. It subsided but again after two days my throat started burning...cold and cough followed and temperature also rose. When I changed a doc ...he prescribed me to undergo a blood test with all details, which analyzed revealed I was having Typhoid...even this doc gave me tabs only for 3 days and he told me that since I used antibiotics...these would suffice...what he prescribed me were ORFIX- CV, OFLOXIN -100 & LOR -10, which were asked to be taken once in the morning and at night and one more tab for fever which has paracetamol, which was asked to be taken only when there is temperature on the high side. well now that the medication is completed two days ago...I feel that the cough and cold hasn't subsided and I still get flum in white color most of times and in yellow color sometimes after getting up from bed in the mornings.

In regard your question if there is permanent cure to PCOS, is a difficult one to answer, since ayurvedic medicine can get you so far as to be asymptomatic. That is regular periods and absence of PCOS symptoms. If alternate medicine is what you are looking for i would recommend you the following- Kumaryasava (Kottakal or Ayurvaidyashala pharmacy) - 3tsp - thrice a day- after food (without mixing water. however you can consume water after the intake of syrup)M2Tone syrup (Charak Pharmaceuticals) - 3tsp - thrice a day- after food Kanchanara Guggulu  (Kottakal or Ayurvaidyashala) - 2 tab - three times - after food.This above prescription is aimed at two things 1. To regulate your periods2. To get the PCOS to a stage where it ceases to give you any symptoms.Note : - Since you have a history of PCOS for 4 years now you may have to continue the same for about 2 menstrual cycle minimum after the intake of this medicine to draft a report about your progress. Also to device the average time span you may require to take it on the whole. Also your weight seems to be a little on the lower side in comparison to your height. Another couple of kg s should be no harm, though it is important to maintain it so.Some of the yoga poses recommended - Suryanamaskar (For both thyroid and PCOS)prasrita padottasana Nishpanda bhava with shavasana (concentration on the uterus and its appendages)While performing yoga make sure you are concentrating on your breathing. You may enroll into a yoga class or simply follow authentic yoga classes on youtube. Please make sure you are on at least 2 hours empty stomach for an effective yoga session.Pranayama-Ujjai (Both PCOS and Thyroid)KapalbhaatiAnulom vilomI hope this was helpful.

Well, this is possible in few conditions where the body reacts in different way , not in the usual patho-physiological way. We have to have a conclusive diagnosis ; I would advise you the following:Since he is diabetic, you have to get all his parameters of diabetes, lipid profile ,cardiac status and any abnormality as his responses are different in dehydration. To prove the point further you have to get his angiography of the intestines as there may be some vascular problems.CT scan of the abdomen and Enteroclysis during the same time can give the hint as he is vomiting early with lower abdominal pain, which can occur in sub-acute intestinal obstruction.

Ciplatrim [ sibutramine hydrochloride monohydrate] is indicated for the management of obesity, including weight loss as well as maintenance of weight loss, but 'depression' being one of the ADR [adverse drug reaction] of the drug limited it use in associated depression [which you were having].2. ciplatrim is contraindicated in binge disorders [bulimia nervosa], thus was not an ideal prescription for you.3.

If you are at present taking any slimming medication purchased in South Africa that contains sibutramine (Reductil, Ectiva or Ciplatrim), please contact the prescribing doctor or your pharmacist and discuss the risks associated with taking the remaining pills in your possession. 4. A multi-disciplinary approach, including dietary, medical and psychotherapeutic methods, should be undertaken to manage obesity.PS.

The pain to the hand combined with upper back pain indicates that nerves leaving your spine are being compressed; it is likely happening in or around your lowest cervical vertebrae in the neck, C6 or C7. The compression could be caused by a bulging or herniated disc between the vertebrae, so consult an orthopedic surgeon for necessary examination and investigation [X-ray cervical spine]2. also occupation can be one culprit for the same: postural dysfunction can cause neck/ back pain3.

Lie on the side with a pillow between the knees.v. Distract your mind from the pain, watch television, read light humorous stories, listen to soothing music.4. A Chiropractor or Osteopath can perform joint and spinal manipulations to release pressure on nerves which may be causing referred shoulder pain. PS. People who have osteoporosis, spinal cord compression, or inflammatory arthritis, or who take blood-thinning medications should not undergo spinal manipulation.

Age:  Most people diagnosed with anal cancer are between age 50 and 80. [your father too must be in this age group]ii. Smoking: Smokers are about eight times more likely to develop anal cancer than nonsmokers.iii. Lowered immunity. People with diseases or conditions affecting the immune system and people who take immunosuppressive drugs that make the immune system less able to fight disease are more likely to develop anal cancer.iv. since case is examined & diagnosed thus other pathologies of anal canal [anal fistula] which causes anal cancer are excluded2.  people with anal cancer do have a high risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease (STD), such as HPV  [human papilloma virus]and HIV, thus anal cytology/screening is requested.3. Squamous cell carcinomas of the anal margin  are treated similarly to squamous cell carcinomas of the skin elsewhere in the body.4. since  cancer is diagnosed, relieving symptoms [supportive care] remains an important part of cancer care since treatment will depend upon staging of the cancer i.e. size and location of tumor, spread to lymph nodes or metastasis to other parts of body.

She also has an enlarged spleen.  We know the functions of bone marrow (she had a biopsy) and the spleen.  We also know that MDS can morph into AML.

MDS [myelodysplastic syndrome] also known as pre leukemia or oligoblastic lukemia affects the bone marrow and the blood, and since case is diagnosed, this means she is under regular Supervision, but before opting for holistic treatment, keep in mind that since it is disease of bone marrow, thus the body will slow down/ STOP making three type of blood cells:i. Red blood cells: which will cause anemia [for which you have to look out for shortness of breath, unusual paleness, weakness, and since anemia in such condition is refractory to any treatment thus Erythropoietin injection is mainstay of treatmentii. white blood cells: will cause frequent fever and infectionsiii. platelets: easy bleeding/bruising.PS.  infection or uncontrolled bleeding can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention, thus keep a check on her physical appearance and symptoms.2. since she is receiving supportive care for her disease, thus in enlarged spleen [especially when associated with myeloproliferative disorder] make sure to check with her blood tests especially platelet count, blood smear.3. since splenomegaly is a symptom and not a disease, thus management should be directed towards treating the main pathology., since splenectomy [removal of spleen]can be done to alleviate the symptoms of discomfort and pain.for Prophylactic management:. Limit Activity/sports that may result in falling. [Bending, dancing and cleaning are examples of activities that might further irritate thew spleen.].  Avoid chocolates,mints,coffee,meat, alcohol & carbonated drinks, spicy food. Since spleen is a part of our immune system thus try using 'himalayan goji juice' which helps in improving the immune system.. You may ask for prescription medicines like: 'rohitak arishta', capsule capsicum, cinchona Off., . Talk to a yoga instructor about exercises that can help massage and support the spleen, like The Pigeon, Seated Angle and Bound Angle poses can be good for spleen.

Although smaller studies show promising results, more research is needed before we can say for sure that this age-old therapy can help you get pregnant.3. Acupuncture is effective in reducing stress.

JME [juvenile mycoclonic epilepsy] is shock like momentary contraction of muscles of a limb or the whole body, and since cause was 'idiopathic' even then secondary causes like: intracranial tumor, tuberculoma,cysticerosis should be ruled out with relevant investigationsPS. treatment is symptomatic and the same whether epilepsy is primary or secondary.2. since the person is able to think clearly even during the attack, thus no first aid is usually required.3. Because myoclonic seizures are often associated with certain syndromes, thus I won't advise any alternate cure, till he is seen by a doctor to make a diagnosis and then begin the treatment4. Common instructions which should be kept in mind/are:. do not miss the treatment even for one day [when started].. avoid places where convulsions can be dangerous. e.g. swimming,driving, climbing heights,work near moving machinery, standing in train or bus doors, work near fire.. avoid fat rich diet [since fat is known to precipitate attacks of epilepsy]"},{"Patient":"i actually wishes to know that im taking both homeo and allo patic together but i can not digest so is this ok during the pregnancy and secondly is this necessary that i must take the ascard during the pregnancy ...plz tell me what to doo i will be very thankfull to u if u answer my question","Doctor":"1. It could be drug-drug interaction of the drugs from two different -pathies [since unable to digest], and although homeopathic medicines are diluted but because their is no study on their ingredients, thus it will be wise not to use them in pregnancy.

A midwife or herbalist can tell you whether any herb is safe for pregnant women.2. According to Mr. Christopher Hobbs [botanist, herbalist, acupuncturist]: sticking to homeopathic products that are highly diluted and in tablet form is considered safe. Any dilutions that are 6x or higher (up to 30x, usually) are fine.3. Ascard [aspirin] if given for medical reason is SAFE, since prevents miscarriage/pre eclampsia and increases blood circulation, thus take it regularly and have constant follow up with your Obstetrician."},{"Patient":"which medicine should we prefer for increased eosinophills homeopathic or allopathic??is there any side effects from allopathic medicines?? i don't want to take medicines often for this..!my eusinophill has increased to 11 and i have been having dry cough for 3 continuous months every winter since 3 yrs","Doctor":"1. cough for continuous 3 months every winter since 3 years is highly suggestive of 'Bronchitis' and consultation with Chest Specialist is highly recommended for necessary Examination and Investigations.2.

Thanks for your query.Once a black tarry stool means you had bleeding in the intestinal tract including the stomach, esophagus; you had just got the stomach checked. Endoscopy can not check the small intestines which are almost 20 feet and part of the proximal colon which is 2 feet as bleeding from any of the area can cause black tarry stool. Although stool tests were normal later , this does not mean that you have got OK, because now you have pain around the naval. This indicates there is a problem in the small intestines. Unfortunately ultrasonography can not show the diseases of the small intestines. You need a contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen.If required diagnostic laparoscopy, exploration.Angiography of the small intestines.All these investigations will help you to get the proper diagnosis and plan for further treatment."},{"Patient":"throwing upHi, I felt nausea last night around 5 then around 948 I started throwing up , til nothing was left .

According to clinical studies, such drugs have shown very impressive effects on protecting body from the side effects (of chemo and radio therapies) like alopecia, nausea, constipation, anorexia and vomiting. The patients who receive Ayurvedic treatment along with chemotherapy have shown more regularity in maintaining the chemotherapy cycles as the hematological levels can be maintained up to a normal state.

Thanks for your query.Passing of the clots followed by light bleeding can be periods called oligomenorrohea, or you have have missed abortion. But at the same time you have central abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea hot flashes to the point of sweating, light headedness can all suggest the possibility of severe enteritis causing septicemia causing all the symptoms you have.

Microgynon and Rigevidon have the same ingredients in same dosage and because it is cheaper for health suppliers to give out Rigevidon therefore most Doctors prefer giving it, although they contain exactly the same drugs, other constituents may be different. 2. You could experience side effects, since drug made by different manufacturer might have slight difference/change. and because its a hormonal preparation, few hormonal contraceptives are known to aggravate depression, and cause side effects like nausea, headache, bloating, weight gain, vaginal discharge etc. PS. Consider visiting your doctor/gynecologist for further evaluation and assistance to see if switching to ALTERNATE low dosage hormonal contraceptive would help.

I developed diabetics because of several years of steroids for asthma. Doctors did nothing to make certain that the diabetes was controlled. I ended up going from 40 units of insulin BID to 185 units BID. Because of that, I gained ~50#. I ended up with three strokes, a heart attack, quadruple bypass, and loss of ~80% of my kidneys. With the surgery, my legs and feet were bound very tightly to reduce swelling. However, I was told that because of the tightness, I lost some circulation in my feet. Consequently, I have extreme to excruciating pain and great swelling in my lower legs, ankles, and feet. I also have swelling in my hands, wrists and arms. My doctors are ignoring my complaints about the pains and swelling. I take more than a dozen drug pills everyday. I am not willing to take more drugs. Some of my new drugs work well for the first week, then stop working at all. Are there homeopathics I can use for these problems? I must do something to relieve at least some of my pains and edema.

Thanks for your query in HCM. I am Dr.Aliem, and I am pleased to help you.Your symptoms of abdominal pain, coupled with blood in stools indicate that your pain is not functional. You need further evaluation.      I suggest you to  consult your physician/gastroenterologist. Your symptoms can be due to infection- which may be detected by examination of your stool. If confirmed, it is treated by a course of antibiotics.        If infection is ruled out, you may need to undergo a Digital Rectal examination initially (i.e examination of the inner aspect of your anus with gloved finger of your doctor), and colonoscopy if needed. This means, endoscopic examination of your large intestine to rule out diseases like Inflammatory Bowel Disease.  Hope this helps. Feel free to post further queries if any. I will be glad to answer.

Currently, polycythemia vera [PV][ is not curative but it can be controlled, [ since mutation, in the body's JAK2 gene is the main cause], with  PV there is increase in both platelets and red blood cells clumping, resulting in more of clot formation and higher chances of stroke.2. though hydroxyurea [hydrea] is a chemo toxic drug [causing leukemia], you can opt for 'Interferon' which is not a \\"chemo-type drug\\" but a biological response modifier and using interferon soon after diagnosis, is often the best course. 3. since thickened blood in PV causes slowing of circulation you should keep certain things in mind:i. moderate exercise improves your blood flow and reduces chances of blood clots. [walking, leg/ankle stretches]ii. avoid tobacco in any form: since nicotine can cause your blood vessels to constrict and thereby increasing the risk of stroke.iii. avoid hot bath and keep your skin dry [apply moisturizer]iv. Inspect your hands and feet regularly as poor circulation can make prone to injuries. v. since iron load is there thus avoid iron supplements.4. Once your hemoglobin and hematocrit values are reduced to within the reference range, thereafter the choice depends on the risks of secondary leukemias and the rate of thrombosis or bleeding.5. In Ayurveda PV is consider under 'Raktapitta', and when Pitta comes in contact with rakta [blood], both being hot in nature diminishes the clotting process and produces bleeding, thus the choice of alternative treatment depends on the risks of secondary leukemias and the rate of thrombosis or bleeding."},{"Patient":"I am having full body tremors and have been going to a chiropractor and it has been helping a lot but I am currently on vacation out of state and having issues with my tremors again and was wondering if you had any home treatments to help calm them down","Doctor":"1. for treatment purpose one has to look CLINICALLY for the presence of any static tremor [tremors at rest] OR kinetic tremor [action tremors] which will give an insight of the cause of tremor [since no thyroid report, brain disease, or addiction is mentioned in the history]2. commonest cause of tremors in clinical practice are physiological tremors due to anxiety, fear or nervousness and alternative treatment will be directed to calm them down..

In Ayurveda Garcinia Cambogia is  known as 'vrikshmala' used in curries and in stomach problems and since it is a natural fruit thus the extract from this fruit shouldn't be too expensive, so if your bottle [single] costs more than 60, be sure that the manufacturer has added some unnecessary preservatives/ additives.\\" [caffeine and artificial binders contributing to the side effects]]ii. HCA [hydro citric acid] present in garcinia cambogia helps in weight loss, and is a serotonin booster which helps alleviates depression and regulates mood.PS. after repeated studies it was found that 60% of HCA if present in the product is effective thus if your bottle doesn't have any mention of HCA do not buy next time.iii. 400 or 800 mg or more of Garcinia Cambogia extract, taken one hour before meals three times a day is sufficient [i.e. 1200 to 2400 mg]iv. since Garcinia Cambogia side effects have been reported with supplements not made in the USA, be sure to get your supplement from a certified lab in the USA.\\"PS.  \\"60% HCA concentration is recommended.\\" and make sure you take garcinia cambogia with a probiotic like buttermilk.

Herbal medicines  have been used to relieve these symptoms for centuries, and there is no substantial evidence that herbal products are a source of toxic reactions, but because herbal products are not regulated in the United States, contamination or accidental overdose is possible, thus  you should learn as much as possible about herbs and work with a qualified practitioner.4.

I am a Homoeopath and I can confidently say that Homoeopathy can help your friend. Degeneration of bones at this age is a genetic and constitutional problem and the treatment that is needed should help him to rebuild his bones. This can be done only by approaching his constitution genetically. Homoeopathy does that. No amount of pain killer drugs are going to help him in the long run. Not only that, those drugs will have their own bad effects that are going to make still worse problems in other systems.Therefore ask your friend to approach an expert Homoeopath at the earliest. Regarding the latter part of your query, every individual on earth normally works for his livelihood. The same work can be interpreted as a service directly or indirectly to other human beings. Medical men are experts in helping the people to regain their health. This does not mean that they should work without getting any remuneration from their clients. There is nothing unethical or shameful in charging money from their patients. If the patient cannot afford to pay for the treatment, every practitioner does it on a charity basis.

The role of virechana karma in these conditions are of prime importance. It eliminates existing 'AMA' in gastrointestinal tract and prevents the absorption of such 'AMA' in systemic circulation. Hence in Allergic conditions virechana is the best treatment which will prevent the associated symptoms of allergy [itchy nose/nostrils]3. Avoid:Heavy, slimy and acidic food, curd, mustard oil, excess physical exertion, sunlight-dust areas, exposure to strong winds, day sleeping, smoking, Potato, green leafy vegetables. Cold water/food.Take:  Old brown rice, soup of moong dal, black grapes, cow’s or goat milk, garlic, lukewarm water to drink, black pepper, dried ginger, honey, mulethi, launga.Take Raw ginger+ raw turmeric: [2 gm each] and fry in cow’s ghee [6 gm] and thereafter add 6 gm jaggery and take at bed time [during night].Successful prescription drugs will bei.Mahalakshmi vilas ras+ shringa bhasma+ Shuddha man shila+ madhuyashti/sitopladi churan: with cow’s gheeii.Chitrak haritki: at bed timeiii.Vyoshadi churan: after meals, two times  You can contact an Ayurveda Physician there for the Dosage recommendations .As attacks are occassional take high protein diet ( egg (white), soyamilk, pumpkin, squash, watermelon, peanuts, almonds, if non-vegetarian (meat) are choices , legumes, sprouted pulses/cereals, milk with protein powder [since blockage of nose is an issue thus yogurt and beans are not recommended] and deep breathing Exercises [anulom vilom]  i. Vitamin A: helps to maintain Thymus gland which is a powerful antiviral gland: thus mango, carrots, cantaloupe (विलायती खरबूजा), egg yolk, apricots, pumpkin, papaya, are ideal.ii.

I am just 25 years old with no ill habits. There all nearly 5-6 or may be more. First time it was only one on my right hand………and it was increasing big. Only two month age I noticed two lipoma in my left hand & one in my back chest. I discussed with doctors (Surgery and Medicine) about lipomas. They told me that it was multi Lipomas tumor. They also told me that these lipomas are not dangerous and they are removed by surgery. I also went a homeopathic doctor. He gave me some medicine. I took all medicine continuously about 3 month … but I don’t get any improvement yet. He (homeopathic doctor) told me it will take long time to remove lipomas. I’m almost sure that lipomas have occurred because of allergy. Now my question is: Is there a treatment in homeopathy to completely prevent the lipoma from reoccurring and of course permanently? Is there any treatment to decrease the size of existing lipomas or completely eradicate the all lipomas. How long will it take to see any improvement? I used to eat a lot of Hilsha ilisha fish.

Less oil must be used in cooking and boiled vegetables are preferable. This is because the intestines need time to recover from infection.

I've been the homeopathic route for 3 months this past spring with no relief.  Right now I don't even know what kind of doctor to go see.","Doctor":"Hello friend,Thank you for posting your query through Healthcare magic. Homoeopathy is not practised in majority of places and by majority of practitioners as it should be practised. In Homoeopathy YOU are to be treated and cured. There is no treatment in Homoeopathy for Valley Fever or fibromyalgia or auto immune diseases. In all these and other diseases the patient is treated and not the disease. World has already seen thousands of fever types, getting thousands of names according to the fancies of the vested people. In the case of fever, even in epidemic types, the fever is not treated but the individual patient with fever is treated. Any routine treatment of conventional medicine with suppressive and chemical drugs make the disease to get suppressed and make unnatural drug diseases. The disease will then affect more deeper and important organs and systems finally to get diagnosis like fibromyalgia, auto immune diseases etc. These are unnatural or artificial drug diseases and in these cases, Homoeopathy is ineffective. Homoeopathy is for natural diseases. The symptoms a patient produces in disease condition has to be spontaneously or naturally produced by his body and mind. Then only those symptoms are to be considered as genetically or constitutionally produced. Homoeopathic curative remedies are selected by an expert Homoeopath based on these genetic and constitutional symptoms. If all the symptoms of nature are suppressed and if all the new symptoms that appear in the patient are artificial drug diseases, a right Homoeopathic prescription cannot be made in Homoeopathy. This may be the reason for the failure of Homoeopathic treatment in your case. If possible, get back to me with a very detailed information about you. I think I will be able to help you through Homoeopathy itself. You can get back to me directly through the premium follow up question facility of Healthcare magic.

A couple of years ago I went to a doctor and  the doctor prescribed therapy for me.  I wear compression stockings now and use the Flexitouch machine every night.  That doctor just said I don't need to come back but I want to find a new doctor that specializes in lymphedema.  I live in Round Rock, Texas.","Doctor":"Hello friend, Thank you for posting your query through Healthcare magic.I feel sympathy for you not because of your disease but because of your poor understanding about your disease. Lymphedema is not your disease. Lymphedema simply means the accumulation of lymph at a particular area because of poor lymphatic circulation and defective removal of lymph from the area affected. Just imagine what happens when you pluck out a bud from a plant when you really want to remove the plant as a whole. Instead of destroying the plant with its 'roots', you are trying to remove the buds. You will only experience further growth of more buds from more areas in the plant. Just like that you are not doing anything to remove your disease in its totality. There will be surely an underlying disease that makes you suffer from lymphedema. Approach a physician who will help you to diagnose your disease after all necessary investigations. Still a conventional medical specialist cannot offer a satisfactory answer for your  queries and that is why your doctor said you need not any more go to him. Very often the removal of the plant with its roots is not possible for him. He can maximum suggest another therapy, another machine or another stockings for you. Because the 'root' of your problem lies in your genetics and for time being conventional medicine cannot offer any genetic or constitutional treatment for you. Therefore I can suggest confidently that you may approach an expert Homoeopathic physician known to you or you can very well get back to me with all your details. I think I can offer cure for your lymphedema. Homoeopathy cure YOU and YOU only. With Best Wishes,Dr C. J.

Im trying not to have to afford the name brand if I can help it......but I will..... 0000 zip code   Louisiana","Doctor":"Hello friend,Thank you for posting your query through Healthcare magic. Since you have posted this query in the alternative medicine category I am   answering . I am a Homoeopath and so the drug which you have asked for do not come under my speciality. Protonix soium 40 mg or Pantoprazole (not pantaprozole) 40 mg. as I have understood, is a slow releasing antacid, of the conventional medicine used for relieving heart burn, by inhibiting the release of Hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice. Hope you will not get offended if I share some different thoughts with you. You are under the strong conviction that your husband has to take a chemical drug like protonix for the rest of his life. You are not even prepared to change the brand name of it. I feel empathy for you because you and your husband are made to believe that there is only one method in this world to relieve the acidity of your husband . That is to take antacid for the rest of his life. The word itself tells you that it is anti acid. You have not asked to yourselves why your husband is having more acid in his stomach. First of all understand that your husband has got a genetic tendency to produce excess of acid in his stomach. Or to be short he has a constitutional problem of hyper acidity. You have not mentioned a word about HIM, his MIND, his LIFE SITUATIONS, his mental and physical reactions to them because no body has given the idea that these are the reasons for his hyper acidity and he can be cured by an alternative genetic constitutional treatment which is curative and holistic. Let me say that he can be cured without any more taking any antacid, with the rightly chosen homoeopathic constitutional remedy. Once HE is cured, you need not search  26 pharmacies in Louisiana to get a suppressive chemical drug which is harmful to the vital organs of his body. It is having very harmful bad effects and that is why its production is discontinued as in the case of any other chemical drug of conventional medicine.  First it gets approval somehow and once a large number of people die under its side effects its production gets discontinued to make it in another combination by the pharmaceuticals again to continue the same process. You may sit relaxed and think over what I have written and if you think that your husband can have Homoeopathic treatment, get back to me through the premium follow up question facility of Healthcare magic.With Best Wishes,Dr C.

My Dr's appt is only 10 days from now and I am a little concerned about waiting so long. Is there anything else over the counter that I can use to treat it while I wait for my appt.?Thanks in advance for your help.Dina","Doctor":"Hello Dina, Thank you for posting your query through Healthcare magic.I am a Homoeopath and my answer may appear strange for you.Is it the first instance you are getting it or you had several episodes of bartholin cysts in the past ? If you had them earlier, I hope they got resolved by themselves. In that case why don't you wait for the cyst to get resolved by itself? If they got resolved by themselves, it means, your body is healthy enough and knows how to resolve it even at this instance. If this is the first instance you got one and no past history, then also it is now in a compromised state. Because there is no much hurting and no fever at all.  But if it is because of the Polysporin, then it is a suppression of the natural inflammatory process and that may be why it does not hurt. In that case, there is more chance of recurrences in future.  Body needs a constitutional support to improve the immunity and control the inflammation. This constitutional support is best done by Homoeopathic treatment. But if you are taking Homoeopathic method, you should stop applying Polysporin externally. Then by the right constitutional method of Homoeopathic treatment, not only the present cyst will be cured with disappearance of the swelling but also you will develop immunity so that no occurrences of bartholin cysts will take place in future.

Also because you have taken the pill, it is not possibly going to happen. Only because your period has not come regularly this time, you need not get worried. The main reason is that you have taken the pill.  It contains hormones. This will disturb your orchestration harmony of hormones and will get re established only after one or two periods. You did not say much about your sex. Was it with your regular partner? You had any mental disturbance during or following? Because such psychological reasons also can make problems in the regularity or rhythm of your periods by intervening the hormonal activity. Pregnancy can be confirmed or ruled out by blood or urine test 7-10 days after the possible day of conception. That means now you can very well do the test and take next steps accordingly.

Can I get some advice from you?Thankyou,Rezi","Doctor":"Hello friend,Thank you for posting your query through Healthcare magic.Sudden hearing loss (SHL) is a name given by conventional medicine to those patients whose nervous system involved in hearing is damaged by past suppressive treatments given for complaints of cold. Getting frequent cold is a genetic and constitutional disease, which should have been treated with Homoeopathy. There are very good remedies like Tuberculinum, Baryta carb, Silicea, Calcarea carb etc for preventing frequent cold and other connected diseases. With these sort of remedies, the constitutional tendency to get cold is rapidly and permanently treated successfully in Homoeopathy. Such children are given pain killers, anti inflammatory and antibiotic drugs by the conventional medicine. They give external applications in nose and ears and cough syrup for cough and antifebrile like paracetamol for fever etc. All these drugs arrest the natural tendency of the body to cure the disease by brining about discharges, fever, inflammation etc. When the body is not allowed to express disease in the most harmless areas and tissues deeper tissues like Nervous system are affected. Body has a natural tendency to keep the inner and more important tissues healthy by manifesting diseases in the relatively less important tissues. When it is suppressed by very strong suppressive chemical drugs such damages to the Nervous system occurs. Anosmia following nasal drops, SHL following ear drops, meningitis and a large variety of mental retardation and cerebral palsy by anti febrile drugs are common after effects of such treatments of conventional medicine.Why I am writing this much is to make you understand that it is not the SHL that you should aim at now. Let her tendency to get cold, which is a genetic and constitutional problem of your daughter has to be corrected. For that you have to come back from the path of conventional medicine in which you were for the last 5 years treating your daughter and you have to start in a new path that is of HOMOEOPATHY. This is an entirely different road to health. It is not late you start taking her along this humanitarian path. I do not know how much damage her nerves carrying hearing impulses from ears to the brain have met with by this time. Homoeopathy can offer her health in the best possible manner. Homoeopathy has got several instances where such damages to the nervous system has got repaired. Neurons in the nerves have got tremendous capacity to develop collateral branches and develop fresh nerve connections so that she can improve her hearing. You can get back to me by asking a premium question or directly contact me with more details about our daughter. Remember that Homoeopathy never treats SHL but your daughter.With Best Wishes,Dr C. J.

Would like to know whether surgery is the only cure to gallstones as my homeopathic doctor says that it is curable and no surgery is required.","Doctor":"Hello, srividyadey, Apparently you have not had any severe acute attack or inflammation of your gallbladder which would have sent you to the hospital. Your sonogram shows 2-4 mm. size stones. These can be dissolved by medications such as chenodeoxy cholic acid. If the stones are mainly made out of cholesterol crystals , this drug is very effective. If there is significant calcium in the composition of the stones this won't work. The drug has some side effects such as diarrhea, nausea and indigestion. This will improve with time. You need to be on the medication 6-12 months with follow up sonograms to see the size of the stones. In most cases it is possible that the stones would come back after the drug is stopped. In other words , your gallbladder still is abnormal with abnormal bile formation that causes stones. The definitive way of cure is by removing the gallbladder by surgery. This can be done through laparoscopic method and can be done as same day surgery. Recovery is faster. You can discuss these with your doctor and take proper action.

He consulted many doctors, one of the doctors told him to take viminta injections (500mcg) and many other tablets, still there's no improvement. Infact one of his leg is swollen a bit now.. m really very tensed can u plz give me some home remedies or yoga techniques to improve his condition..!!  :(","Doctor":"Hello Faiza509,To say that Diabetes is under control is an unfortunate situation. In fact his sickness has never come under control. To see that blood sugar level has come to normal range is no cure.Disease has to be understood in a dynamic form which is gradually worsening for the last 18 years or more. Since your fathers disease is becoming worse, he is now developing the complication called Diabetic Neuropathy. The burning sensation is a symptom of that. It will spread from below upwards and then will affect more important nerves like retinal nerves. None of your medicines taken so far has done him any good. So there is no meaning in continuing the drugs.Homoeopathy considers the patient as a person and treat him. To say that he is sick because he has got Diabetes is wrong. It is only right to say that he is sick and that is why his blood sugar goes high (Diabetes). He can be helped through Homoeopathic treatment after withdrawing all his chemical drugs.His case has to be taken in detail to suggest the remedy.Best wishes for an earliest recovery through HomoeopathyDr. C.

You must always keep your face clean by washing it with water several times a day. Do not use soap every time you wash your face, unless it is a very mild one, or rich in moisturizing oils.

Even if he has taken chemotherapy the first time, and had responded to it then, we could safely consider chemotherapeutic re-challenge in his present clinical context. Unlike chemotherapy for many diseases, only a single drug is employed as chemotherapy in prostate cancer. there are two drugs, both being relatively safe and with minimal side effect profile. a newer hormonal agent called Abiraterone is now available in India and could be considered as an alternative if your father cannot tolerate chemotherapy or fails to respond to the given therapy. i am sure your doctors have considered your father's overall condition before recommending you this treatment option. go ahead and get it done. your father should do well with that.

But the pain is persistent and the character is like a gasoline flame racing in lower abdomen. Since you have a burning pain for almost 19 years, I would recommend you to undergo the tests of MRI of the whole spine and find the cause and get further treated for ablasion or removal of the discs if protruding and get well."},{"Patient":"Hi, are there any anti- depressant medicines in homeopathy and ayurveda?

I get anxious that I am going to fall and I am constantly up-tight when walking.  I used to love country-walking and found it very relaxing, but not anymore.  This has been gradually coming on for past 7-to-8 years and an osteopath whom I attended told me that the stress muscle in my neck was not relaxing and asked how was my walking in the house. It is ok in the house, but not on the public paths or even on the beach, although it is better on the beach because of the sand. I feel I should be able to relax more, but seem unable to do so, and every magazine I read advises one to walk.  Is there anything at all you could suggest?  Perhaps Yoga or Pilates, but I would have to travel by car for something like that as there are no classes in my locality.

You have to go further for tests related to the liver and see if there are other causes of Hepatitis, which I am sure you may have. Anyways stopping the medicines was a good choice as it may cause such problems. I would advise you to undergo the further tests, ultraonography and MRCP if required. About recovery:The first thing of the treatment is to get a full bed-rest. Take Hepato-protective medicines . If the liver counts and enzymes are growing fast, get admitted to get an appropriate treatment. IT may take 3 weeks to 3 months for a complete recovery.

If I turn the body to another side, i get to another place. That symptom happens while awake and i just need to close my eyes to travel. When solar chakra is seen, a golden disk with black number 6 appears, the numbers are multiple, it looks like a psychedelic arrangement.

If there are no symptoms like tingling or numbness or weakness in your legs then you can go for conservative treatment. Conservative treatment requires strict bed rest on hard surface +/- traction for minimum 3 weeks. For having your meals you can sit upto 30 degree for say 10 mins. All toilet habits should be carried out in bed. Care of back with prevention of bed sore takes priority. If you want to turn to your side, you are not supposed to do it by yourself. Rather you should be log rolled with help of 2 persons. Once the pain decreased by 3 weeks you can start standing with limited sitting activities and then gradually getting into your day-to-day activities. 3. Surgery is indicated if there is any associated neurological complications or when early mobilisation of the patients takes priorty. Soon after surgery, patient will be able to sit, walk and do his routine activities. 4. Applying ointments, massage, hot fomentation might compromise the health of your skin over the spine.

The feeling of caught in the stream of vicious cycle of daily chores with not much excitement felt. The thought of not being able to do justice to my abundant talent and inability to break off from the routine haunts me. HEALTH PROBLEM HISTORY Some 12 years back I did feel numbness on the right side of the head and face. Severe pain in the heart and headache followed. Further medical check ups and MRI scan revealed no health problems. Heart surgeons,Psycologists & Neuroligists were consulted. Relief was felt upon psychologists treatment. Anxiety was diagnoised as the culprit. I was diagnosed to suffer from Cervical spondilyisis say some 5 years back by the Orthopaedic surgeons,Bangalore. PRESENT HEALTH STATUS Presently suffering from rightside neck pain . Stiffness of hands & fingers. Sometimes tingling sensation in hands and legs. It was severe during this winter. My head aches normally on the right side of my head. A feeling of muscle catch on the right side of the cheek. Unable to lift heavy objects for quite some time. If I lift I end of with shoulder pain or chest pain sometimes. Whenever I watch TV and sit with the Laptop for some time my neck starts paining and thereafter involuntorily I make an effort to blink the right eye profusely. Some days these symptoms disappear totally extending sometimes to a month. For the past 15 days i.e before the onset of the menstrual periods I have been experiencing burning sensation in the palms and feet and continues till this date and my periods are still on. It also has been pricking which is so irritating. Even 15 days before the last menstrual period I experienced these symptoms and this time it has once again repeated. HEALTH CHECK UPS 12 years back did have a thorough check up and MRI scan as well- Tests Normal pattern . In April 2011 & -May 2012-Except for heart beat in the region of 80 -90 every thing else normal. TREATMENTS TAKEN 12 years back with the Psychologist treatment, relief felt. It has once again surfaced 2 years back. One and a half years back at Batras, homeopathic treatment was taken for a year. The Doctors there revealed that it is nerve related and is in fact nerve twitching. Severe headache vanished. Muscle catch on the right side of the face has surfaced. However the medicines from them have been stopped 6 months back. Presently I am of the opinion that if I leave this medical problem untreated it may lead to serious illness. Your take on this? Is it a neurological related problem?

The vitated doshas affect the skin and blood tissues. They also influence water element of the affected region on skin. Thus the skin which is influenced by affected doshes becomes discolored [ white or copper] scaly and thin. AYURVEDA suggests PANCHAKARMA for the treatment of parapsoriasis.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is charecterized by diffuse inflammation of lung paranchyma and airways in previously sentisitized patients. Based on the length and intensity of exposure and subsequent duration of illness. Clinical presentations of hypersensitivity pneumonitis are categorized as acute , subacute and chronic progressive. The best way to treat HP is to avoid the antigen that caused it  Your petbird, moldy carpet, or hot tub is the source of the antigen you can remove it from your home. Properly dry and store farm products to decrease the risk of developing hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Indivituals who may be exposed to allergens should work in ventilated areas and use respiratory protection [ masks ] YOGA, Limited human study exists for yoga in the treatment for lung diseases , such as bronchitis or airway obstruction.

But I cannot find any side-effects.","Doctor":"Hello! Thanks for  posting query on HCM. Cupping therapy is an ancient Chinese form of alternative medicine in which a local suction is created on the skin.Doctors or cupping practitioners believe that this mobilizes blood flow in order to promote healing.Suction is created using heat  or mechanical devices. There are various types of cupping therapy, including: -Dry cupping -Wet cupping A partial vacuum is created in cups placed on the skin either by means of heat or suction. This draws up the underlying tissues. When the cup is left in place on the skin for a few minutes, blood stasis is formed and localized healing takes place. Cupping has been found to affect the body up to four inches into the tissues, causing tissues to release toxins, activate the lymphatic system, clear colon blockages, help activate and clear the veins, arteries and capillaries, activate the skin, clear stretch marks and improve varicose veins. After the procedure, the site may be covered with an antibiotic ointment and bandage to prevent infection. The skin's appearance generally returns to normal within 10 days. Cupping is considered to be useful and relatively safe, especially when performed by trained health professionals. Potential side effects include: -Mild discomfort - Burns - Bruises - Skin infection Cupping therapy should be avoided by the following groups: -Pregnant or menstruating women. -People with metastatic cancer -People with bone fractures or muscle spasms.

Endometriosis is presence of endometrial tissue in other than uterus. It may present in ovaries, tubes, peritoneum or cervix. Endometrial tissue is the cause for menstruation in the uterus. It is the periodical shedding of endometrium which results in monthly menstruation. Hence whereever the tissue is, because of hormonal effect it sheds off. If it is in ovary the endometrial tissue along with blood collects and forms a chocolate colour fluid filled cyst. The definitive treatment is excision of the tissue. It depends on the site and extent of the tissue. If it is not operable the treatment consists of hormones. Shatavari is an ayurveda medicine. Its a time honoured medicine. It gives wonderful results. For endometrial bleeding it works. Because you have a scattered endometrium it effects all the tissue. same like danogen. Hence both the mode of therapies are the same. But I suggest you to follow either one treatment. Because both the therapies effect by the influence of hormones.

This choline is again taken up by the pre-synaptic nerve and acetylcholine is again synthesized. 3. Now if for any reason this acetylcholinesterase is inhibited or not produced in sufficient amount this will result in accumulation of acetylcholine and acetylcholine is an EXCITATORY neurotransmitter thus resulting in muscular paralysis, convulsions, bronchial constriction and death due to asphyxia. 4. best known example is organophosphorus poisoning. 5.

E-COLI bacteria cause the majority of UTIs , but many  other bacteria , fungi,and parasites may also cause of UTI. Females have a higher risk for UTIs than most males. probably because of their anatomy, other risk factors for UTIs, include any condition that may impede urine flow, [ e.g.enlarged prostate , congenital urinary tract abnormalitiies, and inflammation ] Symptoms and signs of UTI vary somewhat depending on sex, age, and the area of the urinary tract that is infected. My advice is , Both during or after a UTI , you need plenty of fluids to flush out  the infection and to keep you hydrated and can help to prevent cystitis. Avoid caffeine and sugary drinks. Urinate after sexual intercourse will flush out germs that may have found their way into the urinary tract during sex. A UTI is sometimes jokingly referred to as the \\" honey mooner's disease, because it can be associated with intercourse. Wear clean underwear everyday and skip tight clothing. In AYURVEDA, Shilajit bhasmam and Punarnava are the ideal supplements if taken can cause healing of the UTI. Juice of the banana stem is also very good remedy for UTI."},{"Patient":"Hi.

For the last 4 months i have a burning pain in the lower abdomen. The pain is from one side to the other but mostly located on the right side. Sometimes putting my leg up hurts more. Or if i am sitting down and leaning forward like for instance when driving i feel the pain more. Sometime i feel it radiates to the right leg and even to my backside. Lately i feel pain in my ovaries as well. I have seen a doctor who found 2 fibroids on ultrasound however the pain i keep having is not really consistent with fibroid pain. I feel like i am burning inside. At the same time i was diagnosed with high fsh. My periods became a bit irregular and i have ember flashes. I am only 39. No kids as i was late to meet my partner but do want to have a child with all my heart. As you understand i feel devastated. Amh is not bad. It is around 0.9 ng/ml. The weird thing is that i never had a problem with fsh before and my periods were very regular. The hormones went crazy at the same time when this weird pain started. Are the two related? What is going on in my belly? What is causing this burning pain? Could something be making trouble for the ovaries making fsh increase? Or is it just me getting older and having less eggs?

Avoid straining your throat by talking too much, especially talking lowdly. Avoid fried or cold foods , which can aggravate a sore throat. Sufficiant intake of water helps in washing away infections quickly from your system. My advice is; Gargle with infusion made from HENNA LEAVES heals sore throat as it has anti bacterial Gargle with 2 tablespoons of SESAME OIL  three times a day. Apply paint in the throat with GARLIC JUICE + HONEY mix Chew THALISHADI VATAKAM as lozenges.

It does not have any bad effects on health and does not lead to any medical problems. So, the shivering is not due to your masturbation. I would advise you to cut down your drinking and see a doctor for a detailed evaluation of your problem. Further treatment will depend on the cause identified. Wish you all the best.

Thanks for being with us. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder that may affect many tissues and organs, but principally attacks joints. It can be a disabling and painful condition, which can lead to substantial loss of functioning and mobility if not adequately treated. Various treatments are available: Non-pharmacological treatment includes physical therapy, occupational therapy and nutritional therapy but these do not stop the progression of joint destruction. Analgesia (NSAIDs) and anti-inflammatory drugs, including steroids, are used to suppress the symptoms, while disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are required to inhibit or halt the underlying immune process and prevent long-term damage. In recent times the newer group of biologicals has increased treatment options. Biologicals like infliximab,rituximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab,golimumab,interleukin 1 blockers such as anakinra can tried if 3 DMARDs in combination fail to respond. I would like suggest to start her on low dose steroids e.g. prednisolone 5mg OD and 1 or 2 DMARDs like methotrexate,hydroxychloroquine ,leflunimide,sulfasalazine or azathioprine. Low dose steroids does not harm much.Its benefit will be more than its harmful effects. Aceclofenac or indomethacin can be given for pain relief. Consult with a Rheumatologist  for better management.

Following test reports, consult with your doctor for next line of management.

A chronic sinusitis too needs to be excluded for other systemic drugs or local acting long effect drugs like local steroids to be prescribed. These drugs when taking appropriately reduce symptoms and actually increase and improve quality of life in patients with allergic rhinitis. I suggest you take an appointment with an ENT surgeon.

Symptoms of dizziness, nausea, cold sweats on experiencing severe pain can be due to Vaso-Vagal attack. In this, the blood flow to the brain decreases, resulting in decreased supply of Oxygen to the brain and the above symptoms appear in the beginning, which later result in unconscioussness. Symptoms increase in sitting or standing position while the symptoms disappear on lying down. This is because on lying down, the blood flow increases towards brain leading to relief from symptoms. Lying with head end low will be more beneficial. Orthostatic training exercises can be helpful in preventing the recurrance of the attacks. You can consult your doctor for examination and recording of your blood pressure and other vitals along with investigations for finding the cause of rectal pain. I hope this is helpful to you.

At times we are not aware of our body posture and a muscular spasm happens which presents in the form of pain and discomfort with varying intensity.

She underwent a surgery but the pain is severe and she can still feel the lumps . The recent ultra sound scanning report(post operation) says Schwannomas shows multiple inter muscular solid hypo echoic lesions noted at medial aspect of lower leg and thigh. And the Largest lesion is about 17x10mm size. Nature of Specimen: Excised? Neurofibroma Gross: Received a 2x1.5x0.5 cms soft tissue mass. Cut section capsulated, pearly white. Micro: Sections studied show the features of a Schwannoma. Her doctor says there is no use to do the surgery again as the lumps are so many and are tiny in size. He is suggesting to suffer with the pain and these lesions are not harmful. My mother started to use the Homeopathy medicine since 2 months from now. Initially there was bit relief with the pain and she can t feel the lumps also. But the pain doesn t go away completely. I am worried if these are really not tumors and should we continue using the Homeopathy patiently. Pls throw some light on this. Thank you so much","Doctor":"Hello Satya, Thank you for your query. Schwannomas are the benign tumors arising from the nerve sheath.  These are common among people with history of neurofibromatosis.  These Schwannomas very very rarely become malignant, there is only 1% probability of it.  The pain caused in the leg is due the pressure these tumors cause on the nerves.  As the other surgeon suggested, surgery is not the cure for this condition as schwannomas recur again even after surgery.  The best method is to relieve pain and the pressure symptoms rather than excising them. Homeopathy is one of the best alternative medicine for the neurofibromatosis.  The medicine helps in stopping the recurrence, and reducing pain. There are some cases which i treated had tumors reduce in size and then disappear.  It might take little time but definitely will help in treating this condition.  I suggest you continue using it as your mother found some improvement. You can feel free to contact me anytime..I would be happy to help you Thank you Dr.Shalu"},{"Patient":"I have suffered with swollen knees for many years and I have also recovered from a ruptured patella tendon which changed my dancing career.

The knee swelling of the right knee might be due to the acute injury caused due to the workout, may be a meniscus tear or ligament sprain. If the pain is too severe and swelling not subsiding it is advisable to take an x-ray of knee. Physical therapy helps in return of the natural strength and stability of the knee after the surgery.

When I had my first attunement my teacher let us know our bodies would be going through changes. Some of us had emotional changes, some changed their diets to suite their bodies changing needs, I however have become very sensitive to many things. I have terrible skin reactions to most chemicals , exposures to metals, a label of a snapple bottle touching the skin of the arm, and even things that are hypo allergenic or designed for sensitive skin . (Triple antibiotic ointments and other commonly used products) I cannot eat red meat anymore, something I enjoyed as I now have severe migraines even with the smallest of portions. The smell of cooked meat is unbearable whereas before I had no problem with it. I can still eat fish and fowl, but have noticed my sense of taste is not as strong as it used to be, and have had strong chocolates without being able to taste them. I have been on so many antibiotics in the first year since the changes they are no longer effective. My doctor asked to have blood work to find the cause of the severe rashes (they covered from my abdomen to my neck, my ears, and my arms. The whole left side of my back, and from my hip to my knee on one side of my body at different times, always in large areas.) I tested negative for diabetes, and negative for HIV. I was told the only thing notable was that a small part of my thyroid left in me after surgery had formed nine cold masses around it, and that my liver levels were slightly elevated. (Was on seizure medicine for many years which stimulated the liver, no longer taking medication). My thyroid levels were normal. I am at a loss of the cause of the rashes, and intolerance to foods I used to be able to eat. Each doctor I have seen just tells me, dont eat that anymore, dont use neosporin, and dont touch the labels of bottles, or dont wear jewelry. I feel disheartened knowing I will get the same shrug and very specific restriction from the latest thing I came into contact with instead of someone telling me where the common thread is and how further reactions can be prevented.","Doctor":"hi dear tranceaiglatson thanks for the query after going through your query as per my knowledge  your body is showing reaction my be known as idiosyncrasy (this is individual hypersensitiveness as to drug or food) some times some traits of our body remain silent in our body till it gets some triggering factors and in your case reiki became the triggering factor as it effects whole body please do not worry it can be cured by right homeopathic remedy ...homeopathic remedy will take you to your original constitution. the homeopathic physician will have to give you right constitutional similimum which can be given to you by only a homeopath who is expert classical homeopath practicing as per laws of homeopathy remember homeopathy will consider all your physical , mental symptoms and all your past medical history your likes and dislikes ,and your sensitivities homeopathy will act on immune system and will cure this hypersensitive response hope for best"},{"Patient":"my wife is now 6 week pregnant woman now she has taken naturogest 100mg daily one tablet but doctor suggested twice upto one month i cant afford the cost of the medicine due to my financial condition shell she use naturogest 100mg continue upto 2 month? how many month she has to taken this medicine? other wise tell me affordable price medicine","Doctor":"As a homeopath i don't think that hormone replacement therapy is good for health , as per your question i give you advice to visit a good classical homoeopath for your problem who take detail history of your disease as well as about you , so that you got right and permanent treatment for  problem,wish you a good health.."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, I have been diagnosed with Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME), since almost 20 years now. As with this form of disease, the seizure or jerk last for few min. esp after sleep or when I am not fully awake. Over the years, I have been given Sodium Valporate based medicines like Valparin, Valence and Encorate Chrono. I have shown to some of the best doctors in this field like Dr. R.S.Wadia (Ruby Hall, Pune); Dr. Ichaporia (Jehangir Hospital, Pune); Dr. Bhat (Manipal Hospital, Bangalore) and Dr. Ashok Singhal (Apollo Hospital, Bangalore). Some 5 years back, after continous medication, I stopped the medicine and I have to face more serious consequence including falling unconscious, biting tongue and muscle contraction . That s when I realized that English medication can only control the disease and NOT cure it. Considering that taking these medications over a long time will have some side effects, I am now tempted to try alternate medication - Ayurveda - which states that it can eventually cure the disease (with ofcourse no side effects). I am told that it would be a slow process - taking many years - but eventually it would be CURED .

I have gone through your query. All the problems you have been facing are definitely not due to masturbation. Masturbation is a common thing and 90% people do masturbate. 2-3 times a day is also not over masturbation. Masturbation does not cause fizzy vision, hair loss, low back pain and dark complexion or growth retardation. The memory loss you have been experiencing is due to lack of concentration and exhaustion. If you have too much erotic thoughts try to control yourself by keeping yourself busy in other activities like laying or interacting with your family memebrs. Try to meditate atleast 15-20 mins a day. Feeling tired  and fizzy vision and loss of glow in face could be due to improper diet. Firstly be comfortable with yourself. Do not think something is abnormal with you. All the changes you are feeling are due to hormone changes that usually occur at your age. Take lots of fresh fruits especially citrus fruits and bananas. Take fresh leafy vegetables and carrots. Use almond oil for your hair ( it is rich in Vitamin E) If you are a non vegetarian take chicken or mutton liver( atleast once a week, egg ( Daily) to imrove your memory power. You do not require any medicines a good diet and some quality time either with your family members  or friends would be enough. Hope you got my point. Wish you  healthy life ahead. Take care"},{"Patient":"hi doctor, i am 28 years old i faced two times from malaria last two years after 6 month I felt fever in my right side hydrocele and little swelling ,dumb also when i consulted to doctor they said this is filaria so I consulted to homeopathy doctor P.K.

Hope your spirits are a little better today.First, you should know that if you are defeated psychologically by your health situation, then you probably would not get any better. If you have been tested in the hospital and most tests came out clean then it probably is a good sign but I do doubt if all the tests available for abdominal pain have been done. If you are having abdominal pain, then it is an indication that you are actually having a problem but it does not necessarily mean that you are dying. It would have been good to know which part of the abdomen is paining so I can suggest some tests you may require. You may just be experiencing a diet problem and may just need to adjust your diet and probably not eat late after 7 pm or at least an hour before you go to bed.

They protect the body against the foreign materials and infections.  reduction in white blood cell count leads to weakened immune system, as these cells are an integral part of the immune system.

The infections of gastrointestinal system, lungs, throat and bladder are are some typical examples of low white blood cell count infections. When you notice the symptoms of infection due to leukopenia, you should immediately consult the doctor. Complete blood count and absolute neutrophil count are the commonly recommended tests for the diagnosis of leukopenia. Sometimes, a bone marrow examination is suggested by the doctor for an accurate diagnosis. Besides that have a balanced and nutritious diet. Add more fresh fruits and vegetables to your diet.

The etiopathology of the disease is considered due to vitiated Blood (Rakta Dushti) along with vitiated Kapha and Vata. Vitiated Kapha blocks the normal excretory function of skin and get the waste material stagnated inside, producing symptoms like itching, pustules and nodules formation. Vitiated Rakta that also get stagnated and produces multiple irruptions, redness, raised local temperature, thick bloody discharge from the boils and abscess formation. Then irritation, blackish discoloration and ugly scar formation is worked out by Vitiated Vata. Raktamokshan (Blood letting) is a well-accepted treatment for Vitiated Rakta Dosha. Much better results can be obtained with supplementation of internal medicine and local application of Lepa (Face pack). Face pack made up of Lodhra(Symlocos racemosus), Vacha(Acorus Calamus), Dhanyak(Coriandrum Sativum), Chandan(Santalum album) and Ushir(Vettiveria Zizanioides) is very beneficial.

Acne could manifest in different forms like comedones, papules, pustules(pus filled) and cystic nodular. The pustular and cystic nodular ones are known to leave behind scars. Hormonal changes, puberty, excessive use of cosmetics, stress (The National Institutes of Health (USA) list stress as a factor that \\"can cause an acne flare.\\") can cause or aggravate acne. A few things that needs to be followed- 1) Avoid rubbing your face too hard while washing and wiping (pat dry) as friction leads to the breaking of comedones, which can aggravate. 2) Avoid make up, if you need to use make up go for water based products. 3) Avoid pricking or breaking the acne as it increases the spread.(keep your nails short to avoid accidental pricking) 4) Use a face wash rather than a soap as it prevents drying of skin. 5)Wash your face 2 times/day, or after coming home from outside.  Too frequent washing can dry the skin. 6) Drink plenty of water--8-10 glasses 7) Have a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and avoid junk food, chocolates etc., as these are not healthy. 8) In case of females---rule out underlying diseases like PCOD and Thyroid. Homeopathy has excellent results in cases of acne by reducing the intensity and frequency of the breakouts and treating the underlying cause. The products that you use act only on the skin level, thereby not tackling the main underlying cause, which leads to recurrent breakouts.

By your history and description, possibility of stress and anxiety related worsening of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and asthma is more likely. Stress and anxiety cause hyperacidity. This worsen GERD. And this in turn causes worsening of asthma. So in my opinion, we should definitely treat your stress and anxiety first. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs (propranolol and flunarizine combination) too. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm.

I was reading about rosacea recently and observed that i had the symptoms of ocular rosacea. I went to my Gp and she prescibed erythromycin eye cream.

The previous renters had been evicted for drugs and the place was wrecked. That summer, four fillings fell out. In October, I became sick with breathing problems that I first thought to be bronchitis, but it got worse and worse. After two ER visits and severe hoarseness and breathing issues, I called my natural gas company that came and found a gas leak at the line to the furnace and a carbon monoxide leak at the water heater. I have been following up with my primary doctor, saw an allergy asthma doctor (who first said I had asthma though I had never been diagnosed), but my primary agrees that I do not have asthma. I have been to a pulmonary specialist and they found nothing. I have been to a sinus specialist who did surgery about 10-15 years ago and he said nothing though I ve had facial pain and what seemed sinus infection symptoms. Now, my front teeth are greatly deterioriated. I chipped at front tooth and more and more goes away each day. I went to the dentist and he scheduled a great deal of work. The next day the tooth next to my front teeth fell out. I went in and he drilled and put in a temporary but said it needs bridge at minimum. However, the pain is the same as I have been experiencing - not at my tooth but up beside my nose in my nasal cavity and even when I sleep on that side I wake up feeling like that side is stuffy . There has been nothing productive from blowing or nasal rinse. I ve also had a sensation to grind ever since this occurred - a new sensation that I asked poison control about. Who can help me?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Well, your problem of hoarseness and breathing issues seems to be most probably due to the gas leakage , you were continuously breathing poisonous gases although the amount must be less but continuous intake can lead to toxicity and breathing and other lung related problem.As the x ray is fine with no signs of asthma then you need not to worry.Pain on face or facial pain seems to be due to radiating pain from wrecked teeth and also there can be sinus inflammation.So yes the teeth should be treated at first to prevent further damage and loss of teeth..Grinding of teeth can also cause damage to the teeth and when the body is under stress it can happen.You should also get a complete blood count done.It will be better if you vacate the place and get into some clean residence.Hope I have answered your query.

I have been suffering with ezcema on my neck for the last few months and a few weeks ago it spread to be forehead and became infected. I was put on antibioitics and steroid creams. My neck is no longer in a rash formation nor is it itchy but it is still visably red. My question is firstly does the use of steriod creams lead to your skin needing time to recover from them? Also, today when I looked in the mirror I noticed not only an increased number of whitehead spots on my forehead but also orange crusts around them. Is this a sign that I have infected skin again and will therefore need to use antibiotics once more? I very much hope this is not the case due to the sensitivity of my skin as it is with all of the creams I have been told to use. I have read online that ezcema takes time to heal and needs helping - not having hot showers, avoiding touching the area, eating more fruit and venegetables for the added vitamins, staying hydrated etc. Is it enough for me to take a natural approach to healing or will the skin not naturally heal itself from the ezcema?

My ent specialist recommended Nasacort and Affrin (only my need immediate relief and I use it only 3 days and take a break).  My concern is that when not taking affrin my nose is clogged which prevents me from concentrating at work. Is there any other medication I can try other than Nasacor and not rely on Affrin. I do irrigation using nasal saline and have also used vicks spray but none of them work like Affrin. Please advice if there is any alternative to affrin.Thank you,Zain","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Nasacort is having mometasone. It is inhaled corticosteroid. Afrin is having oxymetazoline. Afrin is habit forming drug so better not to take it. You should take 1. Combination of fluticasone and azelastin nasal spray twice daily in each nostril. 2. Oral combination of antihistamine (levocetrizine or fexofenadine) and anti allergic (montelukast) once a day at night. These will improve your symptoms without much habit formation.

PFT will tell you about severity of asthma and treatment is based on severity only.

No surgery of a simple cyst.If complex cyst, you have to undergo laparoscopic diagnosis and removal. Your doctors are trying to avoid any intervention as you are just 19 years old and in the reproductive age group. Also, go for blood tests particularly AFP for cancer.

These are the very common symptoms everybody suffers sometime or the other in life. The result of a post nasal drip irritating the throat, an infection by the whooping cough bacterium.Pollution is another major cause, when small particles set in our airways when we breathe in due to smoke and dust. Either cough can be triggered by cold air, movement, talking, change of temperature, or laughing.Expectorant may be clear, coloured, stringy, frothy or tacky. A nervous habit during times of anxiety, removing the cause will lead to recovery.In fact unpleasant though they are, coughs have a purpose, it is nature’s boon in way of recovery. They protect our lungs from unwanted particles, infection, and the build-up of secretions that would otherwise lead to pneumonia.They also act as a warning signal for several serious diseases. Antibiotics can be used to treat bacterial infection with your physician’s advice. Decongestants relieve nasal congestion by drying up the mucous.Care must be taken as decongestants can excessively dry the nasal mucous membranes, which leads to further swelling and congestion.Kunjal therapy with Salty Luke warm water, drink 4 to 5 glasses of this water and vomit it out helps cleansing all airways, lungs, chest congestion, paving the way to health.A pinch of Black pepper turmeric powder in spoon of honey thrice a day is soothing to throat and relieves from anxiety. Warm water with salt and few drops of lemon juice, will enhance fast recovery. Hope this helps solve your query.
