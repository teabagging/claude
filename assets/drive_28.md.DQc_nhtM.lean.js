Thus, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (-frac{1}{e}, 0).- For f'(x)  0 because both e^{x} and ln(-x) are positive.  - For -1  0 and h'(-frac{1}{e}) = e^{-frac{1}{e}} - 1 < 0, there exists x_0 in (-1, -frac{1}{e}) such that h'(x_0) = 0. This implies h(x) has a maximum at x_0, and since h'(x_0) = 0, we find e^{x_0} = -ln(-x_0), leading to x_0 = -e^{x_0} and ln(-x_0) = x_0. Thus, h(x_0) = x_0^2 - 2x_0.Since x_0 in (-1, -frac{1}{e}), it follows that h(x_0) < h(-1) = 3, and h(x) leq h(x_0). Therefore, we conclude:[boxed{g(x)-f(x) < 3}]"},{"problem":"Given a square with an area of 1, if the square revolves around one of its sides for one full turn, the lateral surface area of the resulting geometric body is ______.","solution":"To solve this problem, we should visualize the motion of the square as it rotates around one of its sides. Since the side around which the square is rotating functions as the axis of rotation, the resulting geometric body will be a cylinder.Given that a square with an area of 1 implies that each side of the square has a length of 1, we can then deduce the dimensions of the cylinder. The side of the square becomes the height of the cylinder (h = 1), and the rotation of one side around the axis will trace a circle with a circumference equal to the square's perimeter, which in this case is 4 times the length of the side. But since the square rotates about one side, the circle's circumference will be equal to the length of one side itself (C=1).Therefore, the radius of the circle (base of the cylinder) can be found knowing the circumference of the circle relates to its radius by the formula C = 2pi r. Solving for r, we get r = frac{C}{2pi} = frac{1}{2pi}.However, we notice here that the result for the radius stated above is not necessary, as we are directly given the perimeter (circumference for the cylinder's base) by the length of the rotating square's side. Hence, the lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula A_{text{lateral}} = h cdot C = h cdot 2pi r. In our case, h = 1 and C = 1 (since it's the length of the square's side and so the circumference of cylinder's base), making the calculation straightforward:A_{text{lateral}} = 1 cdot 1 = 2pi cdot frac{1}{2pi}Simplifying the above equation, we find:A_{text{lateral}} = boxed{2pi}"},{"problem":"Square ABCD has a side length of 4.

Given that overrightarrow{BM} cdot overrightarrow{BN} = 20, find |overrightarrow{BN}|.A: sqrt{5}B: 2sqrt{5}C: 5D: 10","solution":"To solve for |overrightarrow{BN}|, we start by expressing vectors overrightarrow{BM} and overrightarrow{BN} in terms of the given information:1. Let overrightarrow{AN} = lambda overrightarrow{AD}. This means we are expressing the vector overrightarrow{AN} as a scalar multiple of overrightarrow{AD}, where lambda is the scalar.2. We know that overrightarrow{BM} = overrightarrow{BC} + overrightarrow{CM} and since M is the midpoint of CD, overrightarrow{CM} = frac{1}{2}overrightarrow{CD}. However, since overrightarrow{CD} and overrightarrow{BA} are parallel and of the same length, we can write overrightarrow{CM} = frac{1}{2}overrightarrow{BA}. Therefore, overrightarrow{BM} = overrightarrow{BC} + frac{1}{2}overrightarrow{BA}.3. Similarly, overrightarrow{BN} = overrightarrow{BA} + overrightarrow{AN} = overrightarrow{BA} + lambda overrightarrow{AD}. Since overrightarrow{AD} and overrightarrow{BC} are also parallel and of the same length, we can replace overrightarrow{AD} with overrightarrow{BC}. Thus, overrightarrow{BN} = overrightarrow{BA} + lambda overrightarrow{BC}.4. Given that the side length of square ABCD is 4, we know that overrightarrow{BA} cdot overrightarrow{BC} = 0 because they are perpendicular.5. The dot product overrightarrow{BM} cdot overrightarrow{BN} = (overrightarrow{BC} + frac{1}{2}overrightarrow{BA}) cdot (overrightarrow{BA} + lambda overrightarrow{BC}) simplifies to 16lambda + 8 because overrightarrow{BA} cdot overrightarrow{BC} = 0 and the lengths of overrightarrow{BA} and overrightarrow{BC} are both 4. Therefore, we have 16lambda + 8 = 20.6. Solving for lambda, we get 16lambda = 12, which means lambda = frac{3}{4}.7. To find |overrightarrow{BN}|, we use the Pythagorean theorem in the context of the vector's components. Since overrightarrow{BN} = overrightarrow{BA} + lambda overrightarrow{BC} and both overrightarrow{BA} and overrightarrow{BC} have a length of 4, the length of overrightarrow{BN} is sqrt{16 + (3/4)^2 cdot 16} = sqrt{16 + 9} = 5.Therefore, the magnitude of vector overrightarrow{BN} is boxed{5}, which corresponds to choice boxed{C}."},{"problem":"In acute triangle triangle ABC, the sides opposite angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively.

Find the difference between largest and smallest values Donald can achieve.","solution":"To solve this problem, we need to understand the properties of logarithms and how the product of logarithms can be manipulated. The key insight is that the product of logarithms can be expressed as a ratio of products of logarithms.1. Understanding the Product of Logarithms:   The product of logarithms can be written as:   [   prod_{i=1}^{50} log_{(a_i)}[b_i]   ]   where (a_i) and (b_i) are chosen from the sets ((52), (53), ldots, (101)) and ([2], [3], ldots, [51]) respectively.2. Using the Change of Base Formula:   Recall the change of base formula for logarithms:   [   log_{a}(b) = frac{log(b)}{log(a)}   ]   Applying this to our product, we get:   [   prod_{i=1}^{50} log_{(a_i)}[b_i] = prod_{i=1}^{50} frac{log(b_i)}{log(a_i)}   ]3. Simplifying the Product:   The product of fractions can be written as a single fraction:   [   prod_{i=1}^{50} frac{log(b_i)}{log(a_i)} = frac{prod_{i=1}^{50} log(b_i)}{prod_{i=1}^{50} log(a_i)}   ]4. Choosing the Cards:   Since Donald has to use each card exactly once, the numerator will be the product of the logarithms of the numbers from 2 to 51, and the denominator will be the product of the logarithms of the numbers from 52 to 101. Thus, we have:   [   frac{prod_{i=2}^{51} log(i)}{prod_{j=52}^{101} log(j)}   ]5. Calculating the Difference:   The largest value of the product occurs when the ratio is maximized, and the smallest value occurs when the ratio is minimized.

Identify the sum of interior angles of a heptagon:   The sum of the interior angles of a heptagon (7-sided polygon) is given by:   [   (7-2) times 180^circ = 5 times 180^circ = 900^circ   ]2. Set up the equation for the sum of the given angles:   We are given the angles (168^circ), (108^circ), (108^circ), (168^circ), (x^circ), (y^circ), and (z^circ). Therefore, we can write:   [   168^circ + 108^circ + 108^circ + 168^circ + x^circ + y^circ + z^circ = 900^circ   ]3. Simplify the equation:   Combine the known angles:   [   168^circ + 108^circ + 108^circ + 168^circ = 552^circ   ]   Thus, the equation becomes:   [   552^circ + x^circ + y^circ + z^circ = 900^circ   ]4. Solve for the sum of the unknown angles:   [   x^circ + y^circ + z^circ = 900^circ - 552^circ = 348^circ   ]5. Use the properties of a convex, equilateral heptagon:   Since the heptagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal. For a convex heptagon, the interior angles must be less than (180^circ). Given the specific angles, we can infer that the remaining angles must be such that they sum to (348^circ) and fit the pattern of the given angles.6. Determine the specific values of (x), (y), and (z):   Given the symmetry and the specific angles provided, we can deduce that the remaining angles must be such that they balance the given angles. By trial and error or logical deduction, we find that:   [   x = 132^circ, quad y = 132^circ, quad z = 84^circ   ]   This satisfies the equation:   [   132^circ + 132^circ + 84^circ = 348^circ   ]7. Verify the solution:   Check that the angles sum to (900^circ):   [   168^circ + 108^circ + 108^circ + 168^circ + 132^circ + 132^circ + 84^circ = 900^circ   ]   This confirms that the solution is correct.The final answer is ( boxed{ y = 132^circ } )"},{"problem":"2. Given a parallelogram A B C D and points X and Y on its boundary, different from point A, such that lines A X and A Y divide this parallelogram into three parts of equal area. Determine the ratio of the area of triangle A X Y to the area of parallelogram A B C D.(David Hruška)","solution":"SOLUTION. For the lines A X and A Y to divide the parallelogram A B C D into three parts, the points X and Y must be distinct and neither can lie on side A B or side A D. Each of them must therefore lie on side B C or side C D. In the following paragraph, we will explain that one of the points X, Y must lie inside side B C and the other inside side C D, given that all three parts of the divided parallelogram have one-third of its area.Since the diagonal A C bisects the area of the parallelogram A B C D, none of the three parts with one-third area can contain the entire triangle A B C or the entire triangle A C D. However, if both points lie on side B C as shown in the figure, one of the three parts would contain the entire triangle A C D. Similarly, the case where both points X, Y lie on side C D is also ruled out.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_f65fa79cddf5b6ea0ee5g-3.jpg?height=322&width=642&top_left_y=1064&top_left_x=707)Since the labels X and Y can be interchanged, we will assume further that point X lies inside side B C and point Y inside side C D.

According to the problem, the areas of triangles A B X and A Y D are S_{A B X}=S_{A Y D}=S / 3. Since triangles A B X and A B C share the same height from vertex A, the lengths of the opposite sides are in the ratio|B X|:|B C|=S_{A B X}: S_{A B C}=(S / 3):(S / 2)=2: 3,from which |B X|=frac{2}{3}|B C|, so |C X|=frac{1}{3}|B C|. Similarly, by comparing triangles A Y D and A C D, we get |C Y|=frac{1}{3}|C D|. Together, we find that by the SAS similarity criterion, triangles C X Y and C B D are similar in the ratio 1: 3. Therefore, the area of the first isS_{C X Y}=left(frac{1}{3}right)^{2} cdot S_{C B D}=left(frac{1}{3}right)^{2} cdot frac{S}{2}=frac{S}{18}The quadrilateral A X C Y also has an area of S / 3 and is composed of triangles A X Y and C X Y. We already know the area of the latter, so the area of the former isS_{A X Y}=frac{S}{3}-S_{C X Y}=frac{S}{3}-frac{S}{18}=frac{5 S}{18} .Conclusion. The desired ratio of areas is 5 : 18.For a complete solution, award 6 points.

Solving for (a) and (b), we find:   [   a = b   ]7. Since (a = b), the right triangle is an isosceles right triangle, where the two legs are equal. In an isosceles right triangle, the angles opposite the equal legs are equal, and the sum of the angles in a triangle is (180^circ). Therefore, each of the acute angles is:   [   frac{90^circ}{2} = 45^circ   ]8. Thus, one of the acute angles of the triangle is:   [   boxed{45^circ}   ]"},{"problem":"Alice sends a secret message to Bob using her RSA public key n=400000001.

The company's drone accessories sales department currently has two types of accessories, A and B, with their purchase prices and selling prices as shown in the table.

Thus, the number of units of product B is 300 - x. The condition that product B's units must be at least twice that of A's can be expressed as:[300 - x geq 2x]Solving for x gives:[300 geq 3x][x leq 100]To find the total profit w, we calculate the profit per unit for each product and multiply by the number of units sold. The profit for product A is the selling price minus the purchase price, which is 300 - 260 = 40 yuan per unit. For product B, it is 100 - 80 = 20 yuan per unit. The total profit equation is:[w = 40x + 20(300 - x)]Simplifying the equation gives:[w = 40x + 6000 - 20x][w = 20x + 6000]Since the profit increases with the number of units of product A sold, and x is limited to 100 units to satisfy the condition, the maximum profit occurs when x = 100. Substituting x = 100 into the profit equation:[w = 20 times 100 + 6000][w = 2000 + 6000][w = 8000]Therefore, to maximize the profit, 100 units of product A and 300 - 100 = 200 units of product B should be purchased, resulting in a maximum profit of boxed{8000} yuan."},{"problem":"Given the one-variable quadratic equation x^{2}-(2m+3)x+m^{2}=0 has two distinct real roots.(1) Find the range of values for m;(2) If x_{1} and x_{2} are the two roots of the one-variable quadratic equation x^{2}-(2m+3)x+m^{2}=0, and frac{1}{{x}_{1}}+frac{1}{{x}_{2}}=1, find the value of m.","solution":" Step-by-Step Solution# Part 1: Finding the Range of Values for mGiven the quadratic equation x^{2}-(2m+3)x+m^{2}=0, for it to have two distinct real roots, the discriminant Delta must be greater than 0.

From the fact that in the examined triangles C lies on the circle centered at C_1 with radius 3c / 2 = 3 cdot AC_1 = 3 cdot BC_1, it follows that the other two sides are in magnitude between c and 2c: c < a, b < 2c, because for the points B' and A' on the line AB closest to A and farthest from A respectively, we have B'A = AB = BA' = c, AA' = 2c, and if C coincided with B' or A', a proper triangle would not be formed.However, we must also specify that c is the shortest side of the triangle.

To prove that this is the case, we first prove that the boundary of every half-disk intersects the quarter-circle with radius 2 , and then that the half-disk is internally tangent to the quarter-circle at that point.

Since overline{O C} is a radius of the quarter-circle, it is perpendicular to the tangent of the quarter-circle at C. Since overline{M C} is a radius of the half-disk, it is perpendicular to the tangent of the half-disk at C.

Associativity: The operation ( * ) is associative, i.e., for all ( a, b, c in A ),   [   a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c.   ]2. Cancellation Law: If ( a * c = b * c ), then ( a = b ) for all ( a, b, c in A ).3. Existence of Identity Element: There exists an element ( e in A ) such that ( a * e = a ) for all ( a in A ).4. Special Condition: If ( a ) and ( b ) are distinct elements of ( A - {e} ), then   [   a^3 * b = b^3 * a^2,   ]   where ( x^k = x * x^{k-1} ) for all integers ( k ge 2 ) and all ( x in A ).Let's analyze these conditions step by step. Case 1: ( a^2 = e )If ( a^2 = e ), then ( a ) has a cycle of 2. This means ( a * a = e ). - Using the special condition (4), let ( b = a ):  [  a^3 * a = a^3 * a^2.  ]  Since ( a^3 = a * a^2 = a * e = a ), we have:  [  a * a = a^2 = e.  ]  This implies that ( a ) is its own inverse. Case 2: ( a^2 neq e )If ( a^2 neq e ), we need to consider the implications of the special condition (4). Let ( b = a^2 ):  [  a^3 * a^2 = (a^2)^3 * a^2.  ]  Simplifying, we get:  [  a^5 = a^8.  ]  Since ( a^5 = a^8 ), we can multiply both sides by ( a^{-5} ) (assuming ( a ) has an inverse):  [  e = a^3.  ]  This implies that ( a^3 = e ), meaning ( a ) has a cycle of 3. ConclusionFrom the above cases, we see that every non-identity element ( a ) in ( A ) must either have a cycle of 2 or 3. - If ( a ) has a cycle of 2, then ( a^2 = e ).- If ( a ) has a cycle of 3, then ( a^3 = e ).We need to check if we can have elements with different cycles in the same set ( A ). Mixed CyclesSuppose ( a ) has a cycle of 2 and ( b ) has a cycle of 3. Then:  [  a^3 * b = b^3 * a^2.  ]  Since ( a^3 = e ) and ( b^3 = e ), we get:  [  e * b = e * a^2.  ]  This simplifies to:  [  b = a^2.  ]  But ( a^2 = e ) for ( a ) with a cycle of 2, so ( b = e ), which contradicts the assumption that ( b ) is a non-identity element.Thus, all non-identity elements must have the same cycle.

To each of its sides, we append the product of the numbers at its vertices and sum all the numbers next to the individual sides. Find the smallest possible non-negative value of such a sum.","solution":"SOLUTION. Let S be the value we are examining, i.e., the sum of the numbers on the sides of the 63-gon. If we assign the number 1 to each vertex of the 63-gon, we get S=63, because each of its sides will be assigned the number 1. It is clear that for any chosen numbering of the vertices, it can be reached by gradually changing 1 to -1.Now let's examine how the value of S will change when we change the value at some vertex of the 63-gon from 1 to -1. Let's denote the values at the neighboring vertices as a and b (their order does not matter). By performing this change, we will obviously change the numbers on the two sides that emanate from this vertex (and on no others). In the calculation of the value of S, the values of exactly two addends will change.If a=b=1, the sum S will decrease by 4 (before the change, the numbers a, b contributed a+b=1 cdot 1+1 cdot 1=2, and after the change, their contribution will be 1 cdot(-1)+(-1) cdot 1=-2). Similarly, we can analyze the other possibilities:| a | b | change in a+b | difference in the value of S || ---: | ---: | :---: | :---: || 1 | 1 | 2 rightarrow-2 | -4 || 1 | -1 | 0 rightarrow 0 | 0 || -1 | 1 | 0 rightarrow 0 | 0 || -1 | -1 | -2 rightarrow 2 | 4 |We see, therefore, that changing one number at a vertex does not change the remainder of the number S when divided by four. At the beginning, we found that one of the achievable values is S=63, which gives a remainder of 3 when divided by four, so the smallest non-negative value must also give the same remainder of 3, hence we will look for the smallest possible value of the sum S among the numbers {3,7,11, ldots}.As we can easily verify, the value S=3 can be achieved: it is enough to place the following 63 numbers in the vertices of the 63-gon in the given orderunderbrace{1,1,-1,-1,1,1,-1,-1, ldots, 1,1,-1,-1}_{60 text { numbers }}, 1,1,1and we get S=3.

Applying this to our equation, we get:[sin(α-β)cosα-cos(α-β)sinα = sin((α-β)-α) = sin(-β) = frac{1}{4}]This simplifies to:[sin(-β) = frac{1}{4}]Since sin(-β) = -sin(β), we have:[-sin(β) = frac{1}{4}]Therefore, [sin(β) = -frac{1}{4}]Next, we need to find sin(frac{3π}{2}+2β).

Determine the maximum number of elements of a subset Bsubset A such that for all elements x,y from B, x+y cannot be divisible by x-y. \\r\\r[i]Mircea Lascu, Dorel Mihet[/i]","solution":"1. Partitioning the Set ( A ):   We start by partitioning the set ( A = {1, 2, ldots, n} ) into subsets of three consecutive integers. Specifically, we form the subsets:   [   {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}, ldots   ]   This partitioning continues until we cover all elements of ( A ). The number of such subsets is given by:   [   m = leftlceil frac{n}{3} rightrceil   ]   where ( leftlceil x rightrceil ) denotes the ceiling function, which rounds ( x ) up to the nearest integer.2. Condition Analysis:   We need to ensure that for any two elements ( x ) and ( y ) in subset ( B ), the condition ( x + y ) is not divisible by ( x - y ). 3. Maximum Number of Elements in ( B ):   If ( B ) contains more than ( m ) elements, then by the pigeonhole principle, at least two elements of ( B ) must lie in the same subset of the partition ( mathcal{P} ). We need to show that this would violate the given condition.4. Violation of Condition:   Consider any subset ( {a, a+1, a+2} ) from the partition ( mathcal{P} ). If we pick any two elements from this subset, say ( x ) and ( y ), we have:   [   x, y in {a, a+1, a+2}   ]   Without loss of generality, assume ( x < y ). Then ( x - y ) can be ( -1 ) or ( -2 ). For ( x + y ) to be divisible by ( x - y ), we need:   [   x + y equiv 0 pmod{x - y}   ]   This is impossible for any pair ( (x, y) ) within the same subset ( {a, a+1, a+2} ) because the differences ( x - y ) are too small to divide ( x + y ).5. Constructing ( B ):   To construct a subset ( B ) with exactly ( m ) elements, we can choose one element from each subset of the partition ( mathcal{P} ). For example:   [   B = {1, 4, 7, ldots} cap A   ]   This ensures that ( B ) has exactly ( m ) elements and satisfies the condition that ( x + y ) is not divisible by ( x - y ) for any ( x, y in B ).6. Conclusion:   Therefore, the maximum number of elements in subset ( B ) such that ( x + y ) is not divisible by ( x - y ) for any ( x, y in B ) is:   [   boxed{leftlceil frac{n}{3} rightrceil}   ]"},{"problem":"A deck of forty cards consists of four 1's, four 2's,..., and four 10's.

From there, every third ring in the row was gold, every fourth ring was antique, and every tenth ring had a diamond. A ring that did not have any of these three properties was a counterfeit.How many gold rings were on display that were also antique and had a diamond? How many counterfeits did Mr. Silver display?(L. Hozová)Hint. According to what rules were the rings with different combinations of the three mentioned properties placed?","solution":"Every 3rd ring was golden, every 4th was antique, and every 10th had a diamond. Thus,- the number of golden rings was 120: 3=40,- the number of antique rings was 120: 4=30,- the number of rings with a diamond was 120: 10=12.When counting rings with multiple properties, we first determine the regularity with which they appeared at the exhibition: every 12th ring was both golden and antique, every 30th ring was golden with a diamond, and every 20th ring was antique with a diamond (here, 20 is the least common multiple of the numbers 4 and 10). Thus,- the number of golden antique rings was 120: 12=10,- the number of golden rings with a diamond was 120: 30=4,- the number of antique rings with a diamond was 120: 20=6.Furthermore, every 60th ring had all three properties (60 is the least common multiple of the numbers 3, 4, and 10), thus- the number of golden antique rings with a diamond was 120: 60=2.When counting rings with any of the mentioned properties, we must be cautious: 10 rings were both golden and antique, 2 of which also had a diamond, so the number of golden antique rings without a diamond was 10-2=8. Similarly, the number of golden non-antique rings with a diamond was 4-2=2 and the number of non-golden antique rings with a diamond was 6-2=4.The number of golden rings with some additional property was 2+8+2=12, while the total number of golden rings was 40, so the number of golden non-antique rings without a diamond was 40-12=28. Similarly, the number of non-golden antique rings without a diamond was 30-(2+8+4)=16 and the number of non-golden non-antique rings with a diamond was 12-(2+2+4)=4.The previous counts and relationships can be illustrated using a Venn diagram as follows:![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_fc767241fb97c8703187g-4.jpg?height=448&width=780&top_left_y=2112&top_left_x=638)The number of rings with any of the three properties (i.e., rings that were not fakes) was 2+8+4+2+28+16+4=64. Therefore, the number of fakes was 120-64=56.Note. If we denote the three basic sets of rings as Z, S, and D, the initial part of the solution can be summarized as follows:begin{gathered}|Z|=40, quad|S|=30, quad|D|=12 |Z cap S|=10, quad|Z cap D|=4, quad|S cap D|=6, |Z cap S cap D|=2 .end{gathered}In the next part, we determined the number of elements in the union Z cup S cup D by gradually expressing the number of elements in mutually disjoint* subsets (Z cap S) backslash(Z cap S cap D), (Z cap D) backslash(Z cap S cap D), etc., which we then summed. More concisely, the same result can be obtained by the following calculation:begin{aligned}|Z cup S cup D| & =|Z|+|S|+|D|-|Z cap S|-|Z cap D|-|S cap D|+|Z cap S cap D|= & =40+30+12-10-4-6+2=64 .end{aligned}This relationship is known as the principle of inclusion and exclusion.

We will assume that the length of a chocolate bar is n. Each student should receive a portion of length m. If n leq m, then the length of the portion will be no less than n. Therefore, no more than one cut will pass through each chocolate bar.Let n=m+d, where d is a divisor of m. In this case, the length of the portion is n-d. With the described method of division, each chocolate bar is divided into parts whose lengths are multiples of d, meaning the distance from the cut line to the edge of the chocolate bar is no less than d. Two cuts passing through the same chocolate bar would cut out a piece no larger than n - 2d, which is less than the portion. Therefore, each chocolate bar will be cut no more than once.We will prove that there are no other pairs (n, m).First method. Let n=m+d and it was possible to divide the chocolate bars while meeting the conditions. We will prove that the lengths of all pieces, and therefore m, are multiples of d. Suppose this is not the case. Consider the piece of the smallest length r that is not a multiple of d. Then there is a piece of length n-r. The student who received it also received a piece of length no greater than m - (n-r) < r, which is not a multiple of d. Contradiction.Second method. Consider a graph where the vertices correspond to students, and the edges connect two students who received pieces from the same chocolate bar. Let a connected component of this graph have n' vertices and m' edges. This means that m' chocolate bars are distributed among n' students, i.e., m' / n' = m / n, or m = d m', n = d n', where d is a rational number. On the other hand, due to connectivity, m' geq n' - 1. Since m' < n', then n' = m' + 1, i.e., n = m + d. From this, it is clear that d is an integer and m is a multiple of d.## Answera) For n=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,18; b) when n leq m or when m < n and m is divisible by n-m.Submit a comment"},{"problem":"(5 points) The formula for the surface area of a cone is ()A:               S=pi r^2+pi rlB:               S=2pi r^2+2pi rlC:               S=pi rlD:               S=pi r^2+pi R^2+pi rl+pi Rl","solution":"A  Key point:              Solids of revolution (cylinder, cone, frustum).

Let the two-digit number be expressed in the form (10a + b), where (a) and (b) are the digits of the number, and (a) is the tens digit while (b) is the units digit.2. We need to find all numbers such that when you subtract seven times the sum of its digits from the number, you get a prime number. Mathematically, this can be written as:   [   10a + b - 7(a + b)   ]3. Simplify the expression:   [   10a + b - 7a - 7b = 3a - 6b   ]4. For (3a - 6b) to be a prime number, it must be of the form (3k) where (k) is an integer. The only way for (3k) to be prime is if (k = 1) or (k = -1) (since the only prime multiples of 3 are 3 and -3).5. Therefore, we set:   [   3a - 6b = 3 implies a - 2b = 1   ]6. Now, we solve for (a) and (b) such that (a - 2b = 1) and both (a) and (b) are digits (i.e., (0 leq b leq 9) and (1 leq a leq 9)).7. Check each value of (b) from 0 to 9:   - For (b = 0):     [     a - 2(0) = 1 implies a = 1     ]     The number is (10 cdot 1 + 0 = 10).   - For (b = 1):     [     a - 2(1) = 1 implies a = 3     ]     The number is (10 cdot 3 + 1 = 31).   - For (b = 2):     [     a - 2(2) = 1 implies a = 5     ]     The number is (10 cdot 5 + 2 = 52).   - For (b = 3):     [     a - 2(3) = 1 implies a = 7     ]     The number is (10 cdot 7 + 3 = 73).   - For (b = 4):     [     a - 2(4) = 1 implies a = 9     ]     The number is (10 cdot 9 + 4 = 94).   - For (b = 5) to (b = 9), (a) would be greater than 9, which is not possible since (a) is a single digit.8.

Given the ellipse (C) with the equation frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 (a > b > 0), an eccentricity of frac{sqrt{6}}{3}, and passing through the point (3,-1), we can set up the following system of equations:begin{cases}frac{9}{a^2} + frac{1}{b^2} = 1frac{c^2}{a^2} = frac{a^2 - b^2}{a^2} = left(frac{sqrt{6}}{3}right)^2end{cases}Solving this system, we find a^2 = 12 and b^2 = 4.

It is a basic-level question.Step-by-step enhanced solution:1. Let M(x,y) be the coordinates of the midpoint M. Since N is the foot of the perpendicular, it lies on the x-axis, so its y-coordinate is 0. Thus, we have N(x,0).2. Now, let's find the coordinates of P.

Placement of the even digit: The even digit can be placed in any of the four positions. However, if the even digit is placed in the thousands place, it cannot be 0 (to ensure it's a four-digit number). Therefore, there are 4 times 4 = 16 possibilities for placing an even digit (4 choices for the position and 4 choices for the even digit, considering 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8, but excluding 0 for the thousands place).2. Placement of the odd digits: After placing the even digit, we have 5 odd digits left (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) and 3 positions to fill without repetition. This can be done in P(5, 3) = 5 times 4 times 3 = 60 ways.3. Combining the choices: To find the total number of such four-digit numbers, we multiply the number of ways to place the even digit by the number of ways to place the odd digits, which gives 16 times 60 = 960.However, the solution above has a mistake in the calculation of the possibilities for placing an even digit. The correct approach should consider the even digit and odd digits placement separately and accurately:- Correct Placement of the Even Digit: The even digit can indeed be placed in any of the four positions. For the thousands place, there are 4 choices (2, 4, 6, 8), and for the other three positions, there are 5 choices (0, 2, 4, 6, 8), making the calculation for the even digit placement incorrect in the initial explanation.- Correct Calculation: The correct calculation should account for the different scenarios of placing the even digit in the thousands place versus the other positions. The total number of combinations should accurately reflect the constraints of the problem, including the prohibition against repeating digits and the requirement for one even and three odd digits.Given the mistake in the initial explanation, the correct total number of such four-digit numbers needs to be recalculated properly, considering the correct approach to placing even and odd digits without repetition and adhering to the given constraints.Final Answer: The correct total number of four-digit numbers containing one even digit and three odd digits, with no repeated digits, is boxed{1140}."},{"problem":"Given A=-4x^{2}-4xy+1, B=x^{2}+xy-5, when x=1, y=-1, find the value of 2B-A.","solution":"To solve for 2B-A given A=-4x^{2}-4xy+1 and B=x^{2}+xy-5, we substitute A and B into the expression 2B-A:begin{align*}2B-A &= 2(x^{2}+xy-5)-(-4x^{2}-4xy+1) &= 2x^{2} + 2xy - 10 + 4x^{2} + 4xy - 1 &= 6x^{2} + 6xy - 11.end{align*}Now, substituting x=1 and y=-1 into the expression 6x^{2} + 6xy - 11:begin{align*}6(1)^{2} + 6(1)(-1) - 11 &= 6 - 6 - 11 &= -11.end{align*}Therefore, when x=1 and y=-1, the value of 2B-A is boxed{-11}."},{"problem":"(1) Find the intervals where the function f(x)=2 cos x(cos x+sqrt{3} sin x)-1, x in mathbf{R} is monotonically increasing;(2) Let points P_{1}left(x_{1}, y_{1}right), P_{2}left(x_{2}, y_{2}right), cdots, P_{n}left(x_{n}, y_{n}right), cdots all lie on the graph of the function y=f(x), and satisfyx_{1}=frac{pi}{6}, x_{n+1}-x_{n}=frac{pi}{2}left(n in mathbf{N}^{*}right)Find the value of y_{1}+y_{2}+cdots+y_{2018}.","solution":"(1) f(x)=cos 2 x+sqrt{3} sin 2 x=2 sin left(2 x+frac{pi}{6}right), f(x) is monotonically increasing in the interval left[-frac{pi}{3}+k pi, frac{pi}{6}+k piright], k in mathbf{Z};(2) Let t_{n}=2 x_{n}+frac{pi}{6}, t_{1}=2 x_{1}+frac{pi}{6}=frac{pi}{2}, t_{n+1}-t_{n}=pi Rightarrow t_{n}=left(n-frac{1}{2}right) pi, soy_{n}=2 sin left(frac{2 n-1}{2} piright)=left{begin{array}{ll}2 & n=2 k-1 -2 & n=2 kend{array} quad(k in mathbf{Z})right.Therefore, y_{1}+y_{2}+cdots+y_{2018}=0."},{"problem":"19.

Starting with the given condition, acos B + bcos A = 2ccos C, we apply the Law of Sines: frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C}. This lets us express cos B and cos A in terms of sin A and sin B respectively, leading to the equation sin Acos B + sin Bcos A = 2sin Ccos C.2. Utilizing the sum-to-product trigonometric identities, the left-hand side of the equation can be transformed into sin(A+B). Since A+B+C=pi, we have A+B=pi-C. Therefore, sin(A+B) = sin(pi - C) = sin C.3. The given equation then simplifies to sin C = 2sin Ccos C, implying sin C(1 - 2cos C) = 0. Since sin C ≠ 0 for C in (0,pi), we must have 1 - 2cos C = 0 leading to cos C = frac{1}{2}.4. The equation cos C = frac{1}{2} gives us the value of C directly, as cos C = cos frac{pi}{3}. Therefore, C = frac{pi}{3}.# Part (2): Perimeter of triangle ABC1. Given that the area of triangle ABC is 2sqrt{3} and using the formula for the area of a triangle (S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2}absin C), we can substitute C = frac{pi}{3}, which has sin C = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. This gives us the equation frac{1}{2}abfrac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 2sqrt{3}.2. Simplifying the area equation, we find that frac{sqrt{3}}{4}ab = 2sqrt{3}. Solving for ab gives us ab = 8.3. Next, applying the Law of Cosines with c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2abcos C and substituting C = frac{pi}{3} (where cos C = frac{1}{2}), we get c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - abcdot3. Given that c = 2sqrt{3}, we have c^2 = 12.4. From c^2 = (a+b)^2 - 3ab, substituting ab = 8 and c^2 = 12, we find (a+b)^2 = 12 + 3cdot8 = 36. Therefore, a+b = 6.5. Finally, the perimeter L of triangle ABC is the sum of its sides: L = a+b+c = 6 + 2sqrt{3}.Hence, the measure of angle C is boxed{frac{pi}{3}}, and the perimeter of triangle ABC is boxed{6 + 2sqrt{3}}."},{"problem":"The Garfield Super Winners play 100 games of foosball, in which teams score a non-negative integer number of points and the team with more points after ten minutes wins (if both teams have the same number of points, it is a draw).

Let S be a subset of the set of numbers {1,2,3, cdots, 1989}, and the difference between any two numbers in S is not equal to 4 or 7. How many numbers can S contain at most?","solution":"Analysis Notice that the sum of 4 and 7 is 11. We first observe the first 11 natural numbers 1,2, cdots, 11, and find that 1,4,6,7,9 satisfy the conditions of the problem. Then we observe the 11 numbers 12,13, cdots, 22, and find that 1+11,4+11,6+11,7+11,9+11 also satisfy the conditions of the problem. And 1,4,6,7,9,12,15,17,18,20 still satisfy the conditions of the problem. Thus, we have found a periodic number group with a period of 11. This makes the solution approach very clear.Solution The difference between any two numbers in the array (1,4,6,7,9) is not equal to 4 or 7, and the arrays (11+1,11+4,11+6,11+7, 11+9), cdots,(11 k+1,11 k+4,11 k+6,11 k+7,11 k+9), k in N, and 11 k+9 leqslant 1989, also have this property. On the other hand, the difference between any two numbers in the union of all these arrays is also not equal to 4 or 7. We form the set S by combining all the numbers in these arrays. Noting that 1989=11 times 180+9, the number of numbers in S is 5 times 180+5=905.We then prove that S cannot contain more numbers. If not, then among the arrays (1,2, cdots, 11),(12,13, cdots, 22), cdots,(1970,1971, cdots, 1980),(1981,1982, cdots, 1989), at least one array can be selected to contain six numbers such that the difference between any two numbers is not 4 or 7. Without loss of generality, consider the array 1,2, cdots, 11, and divide them into five groups (4,7,11),(3,10),(2,6),(5,9),(1,8). At least one group must have two numbers selected. Clearly, none of the last four pairs can be selected simultaneously, so only the first group can select 4,7. Thus, in (3,10), only 10 can be selected; in (2,6), only 2 can be selected; in (5,9), only 5 can be selected; and in (1,8), neither number can be selected. In other words, it is impossible to select a sixth number, so S can contain at most 905 numbers."},{"problem":"Xiao Ming bought a book, and his classmates wanted to know the price of the book.

The area of triangle ABC is given by S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2}acsin B = frac{a^2}{3sin A}.      Therefore, we can write the equation as:   frac{1}{2}acsin B = frac{a^2}{3sin A}2. Simplifying the equation, we get:   3csin B sin A = 2a3. By applying the Law of Sines (frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C}), we can rewrite the equation as:   3sin C sin B sin A = 2sin A4. Since sin A neq 0, we can divide both sides by sin A to find:   sin B sin C = frac{2}{3}Therefore, the solution for part (1) is boxed{sin B sin C = frac{2}{3}}.# Part (2): Finding the Perimeter of triangle ABC with a = 31.

Using the identity cos(B+C) = cos B cos C - sin B sin C, we substitute the given values:   cos(B+C) = frac{1}{6} - frac{2}{3} = -frac{1}{2}3. Since cos(B+C) = cos A, we have:   cos A = -frac{1}{2}4.

Therefore, the sum of squares (b+c)^{2} is:   (b+c)^{2} = 9 + 3bc = 9 + 24 = 339. Solving for b+c, we get:   b+c = sqrt{33}10.

We are given that the sum of the digits is 6, i.e.,    [   a + b + c = 6   ]   Additionally, for the number to be divisible by 11, the alternating sum of its digits must be a multiple of 11. This gives us the equation:   [   a - b + c = m   ]   where m is some multiple of 11.2. Adding the two equations together, we get:   [   (a + b + c) + (a - b + c) = 6 + m   ]   Simplifying, we obtain:   [   2a + 2c = 6 + m   ]   Dividing by 2, we get:   [   a + c = frac{6 + m}{2}   ]   For a + c to be an integer, 6 + m must be even, implying that m must be even. Since m is a multiple of 11, the only even multiple of 11 is 0 (as 22 and -22 would make a + c exceed the digit range).3. Setting m = 0, we get:   [   a + c = frac{6 + 0}{2} = 3   ]   Substituting back into the original sum equation, we get:   [   b = 6 - (a + c) = 6 - 3 = 3   ]   So, b = 3.

Thus, the probability that at least one boy will hit a given target is 1-(1-1 / n)^{n}.Therefore, the expected number of hit targets is nleft(1-(1-1 / n)^{n}right).b) We will show that the expected number of hit targets is greater than frac{n}{2}.

Clearly, the number of such strings is 2^{9}=512 (for each of the 9 symbols in the string, there are two possibilities - to be a plus or a minus). It remains to show that this correspondence is one-to-one, i.e., the permutation is uniquely restored from the string of pluses and minuses. Indeed, let at the beginning of the string there are mathrm{n}_{1} minuses (possibly, mathrm{n}_{1}=0), and then a plus, then mathrm{n}_{2} minuses, then a plus, and so on. Then the permutation must start with a group of mathrm{n}_{1}+1 numbers in a row in descending order, followed by a new group of mathrm{n}_{2}+1 numbers in a row in descending order, and so on. At the same time, the first number of the second group must be greater than the last number of the first group. Since the first and second groups contain different numbers, this means that each number of the second group is greater than each number of the first group. Similarly, each number of the third group is greater than each number of the second group, and so on. The above reasoning allows us to uniquely restore the permutation (while using the fact that each of the numbers 1,2, ldots, 10 must appear in the permutation); the permutation has the form: mathrm{n}_{1}+1, mathrm{n}_{1}, ldots, 1, mathrm{n}_{1}+mathrm{n}_{2}+2, mathrm{n}_{1}+mathrm{n}_{2}+1, ldots, mathrm{n}_{1}+2, ldots (The numbers in the permutation are arranged in \\"steps\\" of lengths mathrm{n}_{1}+1, mathrm{n}_{2}+1, ldots of consecutive numbers in descending order.)## Answer2^{9}=512."},{"problem":"Example 4 Let a, b, c be 3 distinct real numbers, and the real-coefficient polynomial p(x), when divided by x-a, x-b, and x-c, yields remainders a, b, and c respectively.

Find the smallest positive integer n such that less than 1% of the pairs (a, b) with 0 le a, b le n are primitive.[i]Proposed by Mehtaab Sawhney[/i]","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the smallest positive integer ( n ) such that less than ( 1% ) of the pairs ((a, b)) with ( 0 le a, b le n ) are primitive. A pair ((a, b)) is called primitive if there exists a positive integer (ell) such that ((a + bi)^ell) is real.2. Characterizing Primitive Pairs:   To determine when ((a + bi)^ell) is real, we need to consider the argument of the complex number (a + bi). The argument (theta) of (a + bi) is given by (theta = tan^{-1}left(frac{b}{a}right)). For ((a + bi)^ell) to be real, (ell theta) must be an integer multiple of (pi). This implies that (theta) must be a rational multiple of (pi).3. Primitive Pair Conditions:   The argument (theta) is a rational multiple of (pi) if and only if (frac{b}{a}) is rational. This means that (a) and (b) must be such that (frac{b}{a}) is rational, or equivalently, (a) and (b) must be proportional to each other. Therefore, the primitive pairs ((a, b)) are those where (a = 0), (b = 0), or (a = b).4. Counting Primitive Pairs:   - Pairs of the form ((0, k)) where (0 le k le n): There are (n + 1) such pairs.   - Pairs of the form ((k, 0)) where (0 le k le n): There are (n + 1) such pairs.   - Pairs of the form ((k, k)) where (0 le k le n): There are (n + 1) such pairs.   - Note that the pair ((0, 0)) is counted three times, so we need to subtract 2 from the total count.   Therefore, the total number of primitive pairs is:   [   (n + 1) + (n + 1) + (n + 1) - 2 = 3n + 1   ]5.

The cost per kilogram for type A in May is 8 yuan, and for type B, it's 18 yuan. The total cost for these purchases in May is 1700 yuan. In June, the prices increased to 10 yuan per kilogram for type A and 20 yuan per kilogram for type B, leading to an additional 300 yuan for the same quantities. Therefore, we have the following system of equations:1. For May: 8x + 18y = 17002. For June: 10x + 20y = 2000 (since 1700 + 300 = 2000)To solve for x and y, we can subtract the first equation from the second, which gives us:- 2x + 2y = 300- Simplifying, we get x + y = 150Now, we need to solve this system of equations. We can use substitution or elimination. Here, let's use the elimination method:- Multiply the first equation by 5 to get 40x + 90y = 8500- Multiply the second equation by 4 to get 40x + 80y = 8000- Subtracting these two equations, we get 10y = 500, which simplifies to y = 50Substituting y = 50 into the first equation:- 8x + 18(50) = 1700- 8x + 900 = 1700- 8x = 800- x = 100Therefore, the shop purchased boxed{100 text{ kilograms of type A fruits and } 50 text{ kilograms of type B fruits in May.}}# Part 2: Minimum Amount to Pay in JuneLet a represent the quantity of type A fruits purchased in June, and let w be the total amount paid.

The total cost, w, can be expressed as:- w = 10a + 20(120 - a)- Simplifying, we get w = -10a + 2400Given that the quantity of type A fruits does not exceed three times the quantity of type B fruits, we have:- a leqslant 3(120 - a)- Simplifying, a leqslant 360 - 3a- Adding 3a to both sides, 4a leqslant 360- Dividing by 4, we get a leqslant 90Since the coefficient of a in the cost equation is negative, the total cost w decreases as a increases. Therefore, to minimize w, we set a to its maximum value, which is 90:- Substituting a = 90 into the cost equation: w = -10(90) + 2400 = 1500Hence, the minimum amount the shop should pay for these two types of fruits in June is boxed{1500 text{ yuan.}}"},{"problem":"Every year, Atlantic salmon swim upstream to return to their birthplace to lay eggs.

Let O_1 be the oxygen consumption unit when the salmon swims at speed v m/s, and let O_2 be the oxygen consumption unit when the salmon increases its speed by 2 m/s, thus swimming at (v+2) m/s. The relationship between the swimming speed v and the oxygen consumption unit O is given by the equation:[v = frac{1}{2}log_3frac{O}{100}]For the initial speed v, we have:[v = frac{1}{2}log_3frac{O_1}{100}]For the increased speed v+2, we have:[v + 2 = frac{1}{2}log_3frac{O_2}{100}]Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us the increase in speed in terms of the change in oxygen consumption:[2 = frac{1}{2}log_3frac{O_2}{100} - frac{1}{2}log_3frac{O_1}{100}]Using the properties of logarithms, we can combine the right side into a single logarithm:[2 = frac{1}{2}log_3left(frac{O_2}{100} div frac{O_1}{100}right)][2 = frac{1}{2}log_3frac{O_2}{O_1}]Multiplying both sides by 2 to isolate the logarithm:[4 = log_3frac{O_2}{O_1}]This equation tells us that the ratio frac{O_2}{O_1} is equal to 3^4, since the base of the logarithm is 3:[frac{O_2}{O_1} = 3^4]Therefore, the ratio of the oxygen consumption unit of the salmon when it increases its speed by 2 m/s to the original oxygen consumption unit is 3^4, which equals 81.

Consider a prime (p) dividing (m):   Let (p) be a prime that divides (m). Since (a^n - 1) must be divisible by (m) for each (a in {1, 2, 3, ldots, n}), it must also be divisible by (p).3.

Form of (m):   Since (m) must be divisible by (p) and (a^n - 1) must be divisible by (m) for all (a in {1, 2, 3, ldots, n}), we conclude that (m) must be a power of (p), i.e., (m = p^k).6.

If (F(x) notequiv x^n - 1) in (mathbb{F}_p[x]), then subtracting them gives a polynomial of degree (n-1) having (n) zeroes modulo (p), which contradicts Lagrange's Theorem.

Find the maximum or minimum value.(4) If 7x-x^{2}+y-11=0, find the minimum value of x+y.","solution":" Step-by-Step Solutions# (1) Minimum value of left(x-1right)^{2}+3- The expression is already in the form left(x-aright)^{2}+k where a=1 and k=3.- Since left(x-1right)^{2} geqslant 0 for all x, the minimum value of left(x-1right)^{2}+3 is when left(x-1right)^{2} = 0.- Therefore, the minimum value is 3 + 0 = 3.boxed{3}# (2) Minimum value of x^{2}+10x+32- Start by completing the square: x^{2}+10x+32 = x^{2}+10x+25-25+32 = left(x+5right)^{2}+7.- Since left(x+5right)^{2} geqslant 0, the minimum value of left(x+5right)^{2}+7 is when left(x+5right)^{2} = 0.- Therefore, the minimum value is 7 + 0 = 7.boxed{7}# (3) Maximum or minimum value of -frac{1}{3}{x^2}+2x+5- Rewrite the expression: -frac{1}{3}{x^2}+2x+5 = -frac{1}{3}(x^{2}-6x+9)+8 = -frac{1}{3}(x-3)^{2}+8.- Since -frac{1}{3}(x-3)^{2} leqslant 0, the expression reaches its maximum value when -frac{1}{3}(x-3)^{2} = 0.- Therefore, the maximum value is 8 + 0 = 8.boxed{8}# (4) Minimum value of x+y given 7x-x^{2}+y-11=0- From 7x-x^{2}+y-11=0, we get y=x^{2}-7x+11.- Thus, x+y = x^{2}-7x+11+x = x^{2}-6x+11 = x^{2}-6x+9-9+11 = left(x-3right)^{2}+2.- Since left(x-3right)^{2} geqslant 0, the minimum value of left(x-3right)^{2}+2 is when left(x-3right)^{2} = 0.- Therefore, the minimum value is 2 + 0 = 2.boxed{2}"},{"problem":"Among four numbers, the first three form an arithmetic sequence, the second three form a geometric sequence.

We need to show that ( f_n ) is well-defined. This means that if ( widehat{x} = widehat{y} ) in ( mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} ), then ( f_n(widehat{x}) = f_n(widehat{y}) ).2. By definition, ( widehat{x} = widehat{y} ) implies ( x equiv y pmod{n} ), which means ( n mid (x - y) ).3. We need to show that ( widehat{f(x)} = widehat{f(y)} ). This is equivalent to showing that ( f(x) equiv f(y) pmod{n} ).4. Since ( f in mathbb{Z}[X] ), ( f(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients. Therefore, ( f(x) - f(y) ) can be written as:   [   f(x) - f(y) = a_k(x^k - y^k) + a_{k-1}(x^{k-1} - y^{k-1}) + cdots + a_1(x - y)   ]5. Each term ( x^i - y^i ) for ( i geq 1 ) is divisible by ( x - y ). Since ( n mid (x - y) ), it follows that ( n mid (x^i - y^i) ) for all ( i geq 1 ).6. Therefore, ( n mid (f(x) - f(y)) ), which implies ( f(x) equiv f(y) pmod{n} ).7. Hence, ( widehat{f(x)} = widehat{f(y)} ), and ( f_n(widehat{x}) = f_n(widehat{y}) ). This shows that ( f_n ) is well-defined. Part (b)1. We need to find all polynomials ( f in mathbb{Z}[X] ) such that for all ( n in mathbb{N} ), ( n geq 2 ), the function ( f_n ) is surjective.2. Suppose ( deg(f) geq 2 ). We will show that ( f_n ) cannot be surjective for some ( n ).3. Choose an integer ( x_0 ) such that ( M = |f(x_0) - f(0)| > |x_0| ).4. Consider ( n = M ).

Since ( M = |f(x_0) - f(0)| ), we have ( widehat{f(x_0)} = widehat{f(0)} ) in ( mathbb{Z}/Mmathbb{Z} ).6. This implies ( f_M(widehat{0}) = f_M(widehat{x_0}) ), but ( widehat{x_0} neq widehat{0} ) in ( mathbb{Z}/Mmathbb{Z} ).7. Since ( mathbb{Z}/Mmathbb{Z} ) is finite, for ( f_M ) to be surjective, it must be injective. However, we have found ( widehat{0} neq widehat{x_0} ) such that ( f_M(widehat{0}) = f_M(widehat{x_0}) ), which is a contradiction.8. Therefore, ( deg(f) leq 1 ).9. Let ( f(X) = aX + b ). We need to check the conditions for ( f_n ) to be surjective.10. If ( a = 0 ), then ( f(X) = b ), and ( f_n(widehat{x}) = widehat{b} ) for all ( widehat{x} in mathbb{Z}/nmathbb{Z} ). This is not surjective for ( n geq 2 ).11. If ( |a| > 1 ), consider ( n = |a| ). In ( mathbb{Z}/|a|mathbb{Z} ), we have ( f_n(widehat{x}) = widehat{ax + b} = widehat{b} ) for all ( widehat{x} in mathbb{Z}/|a|mathbb{Z} ). This is not surjective.12. Therefore, ( |a| = 1 ). Hence, ( f(X) = pm X + b ) with ( b in mathbb{Z} ).13. It is easy to check that these polynomials satisfy the hypothesis, as ( f_n(widehat{x}) = widehat{pm x + b} ) is surjective for all ( n geq 2 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ f(X) = pm X + b } ) with ( b in mathbb{Z} )."},{"problem":"Given the partial corresponding values of the function y=ax^{2}+bx+cleft(aneq 0right) in the quadratic function y=ax^{2}+bx+c are as shown in the table below:[begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}hlinex & ldots & -2 & -1 & 0 & 2 & ldots hliney & ldots & -3 & -4 & -3 & 5 & ldots hlineend{array}]Find the expression of this quadratic function.","solution":"To find the expression of the quadratic function y=ax^{2}+bx+c, we start by substituting the given points into the equation and solving for a, b, and c.1.

Use the properties of similar triangles:   - Since (r) is parallel to (AB), triangles (ADE) and (ABO) are similar by AA similarity criterion (Angle-Angle).   - The ratio of the areas of similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.4. Calculate the area ratios:   - Let (M) be the midpoint of (DE). Since (r) is the midline, (M) divides (DE) into two equal segments.   - The area of triangle (ADE) is half the area of triangle (ABC) because (DE) is parallel to (AB) and (M) is the midpoint.5. Relate the areas of (ABO) and (ODCE):   - The area of triangle (ABO) is a fraction of the area of triangle (ABC). Since (O) is the intersection of medians, it divides the triangle into smaller triangles of equal area.   - The area of quadrilateral (ODCE) is the remaining part of the area of triangle (ADE) after subtracting the area of triangle (ADO).6. Prove the areas are equal:   - Since (O) is the centroid of triangle (ADE), it divides (ADE) into three smaller triangles of equal area.   - The area of triangle (ABO) is equal to the area of triangle (ADO) plus the area of triangle (BEO).   - The area of quadrilateral (ODCE) is the area of triangle (ADE) minus the area of triangle (ADO).7. Conclude the proof:   - By the properties of the centroid and the midline, the area of triangle (ABO) is equal to the area of quadrilateral (ODCE).[boxed{text{The areas of triangle } ABO text{ and quadrilateral } ODCE text{ are equal.}}]"},{"problem":"## Problem StatementCalculate the limit of the function:lim _{x rightarrow frac{pi}{2}} frac{1-sin ^{3} x}{cos ^{2} x}","solution":"## SolutionSubstitution:x=y+frac{pi}{2} Rightarrow y=x-frac{pi}{2}x rightarrow frac{pi}{2} Rightarrow y rightarrow 0We get:begin{aligned}& lim _{x rightarrow frac{pi}{2}} frac{1-sin ^{3} x}{cos ^{2} x}=lim _{y rightarrow 0} frac{1-sin ^{3}left(y+frac{pi}{2}right)}{cos ^{2}left(y+frac{pi}{2}right)}= & =lim _{y rightarrow 0} frac{1-cos ^{3} y}{(-sin y)^{2}}=lim _{y rightarrow 0} frac{(1-cos y)left(1+cos y+cos ^{2} yright)}{sin ^{2} y}=end{aligned}Using the substitution of equivalent infinitesimals:1-cos y sim{frac{y^{2}}{2}}, as y rightarrow 0sin y sim y, as y rightarrow 0We get:begin{aligned}& =lim _{y rightarrow 0} frac{frac{y^{2}}{2}left(1+cos y+cos ^{2} yright)}{y^{2}}=lim _{y rightarrow 0} frac{1+cos y+cos ^{2} y}{2}= & =frac{1+cos 0+cos ^{2} 0}{2}=frac{1+1+1^{2}}{2}=frac{3}{2}end{aligned}## Problem Kuznetsov Limits 16-29"},{"problem":"Given the complex number z=dfrac{1+2i}{{{(1-i)}^{2}}}, the imaginary part of z is (    )A: dfrac{1}{2}B: dfrac{1}{2}iC: -dfrac{1}{2}D: -dfrac{1}{2}i","solution":"AnalysisThis question tests the operation of multiplication and division in the algebraic form of complex numbers, examining the basic concept of complex numbers.

Let's call a pair of these integers [i]elegant[/i] if their sum is an integer power of 2.

Define the Problem in Graph Theory Terms:   We are given ( n ge 2 ) distinct positive integers. We need to find the largest possible number of pairs whose sum is a power of 2. We can represent this problem using a graph ( G ) with ( n ) vertices, where each vertex represents one of the integers. An edge is drawn between two vertices if and only if their sum is a power of 2.2. Claim 1: The Graph ( G ) has no cycles.   - Proof:     Suppose, for contradiction, that ( G ) contains a cycle. Let the cycle be ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k, a_1 ) with ( k geq 3 ). Assume ( a_1 + a_2 ) is the largest sum among all ( a_i + a_{i+1} ). Since ( a_1 + a_2 ) is a power of 2, let it be ( 2^x ). Similarly, let ( a_2 + a_3 = 2^y ) and ( a_k + a_1 = 2^z ) with ( x > y ) and ( x > z ).     - If ( y > z ), then ( 2^x geq 2^{y+1} > 2^y + 2^z ), which is a contradiction.     - If ( y < z ), then ( 2^x geq 2^{z+1} > 2^y + 2^z ), which is also a contradiction.     Therefore, ( G ) cannot contain any cycles. (blacksquare)3. Claim 2: Any acyclic simple undirected graph ( G ) on ( n ) vertices has at most ( n-1 ) edges.   - Proof:     We proceed by induction on ( n ).     - Base Case: For ( n = 2 ), the graph can have at most 1 edge, which is ( n-1 ). The base case holds.     - Inductive Step: Assume the statement is true for graphs with ( n ) vertices. Consider a graph with ( n+1 ) vertices. We need to show that this graph has at most ( n ) edges.       - Take a maximal path ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_t ) in the graph. Vertex ( v_1 ) has no neighbors among ( v_i ) (for ( i > 2 )) since otherwise, it would form a cycle, contradicting the acyclic property. Therefore, ( v_1 ) can only have ( v_2 ) as a neighbor, implying ( deg(v_1) leq 1 ).       - Remove ( v_1 ) and its edge (if it exists). The remaining subgraph on ( n ) vertices has at most ( n-1 ) edges by the inductive hypothesis. Adding back ( v_1 ) and its edge gives at most ( n ) edges in total.     Thus, any acyclic graph on ( n+1 ) vertices has at most ( n ) edges. (blacksquare)4. Conclusion:   From Claims 1 and 2, the graph ( G ) has at most ( n-1 ) edges. This means the maximum number of elegant pairs is ( n-1 ).5. Constructing a Graph with ( n-1 ) Elegant Pairs:   To show that ( n-1 ) elegant pairs are attainable, consider the following construction:   - Let ( a_1 = 1 ) and ( a_i = 2^n - i ) for ( i = 2, 3, ldots, n ).   - For each ( i neq 1 ), ( a_1 + a_i = 1 + (2^n - i) = 2^n - (i - 1) ), which is a power of 2.   - This construction ensures that there are ( n-1 ) elegant pairs.The final answer is ( boxed{ n-1 } )."},{"problem":"In an increasing arithmetic sequence {a_{n}}, where a_{1}=1, a_{2}, a_{4}+2, a_{14} form a geometric sequence.(1) Find the general formula for {a_{n}};(2) If b_{n}=2^{a_{n}}, find the sum of the first n terms of {b_{n}} denoted as S_{n}.","solution":" Solution:# Part (1): Finding the General Formula for {a_{n}}Given that {a_{n}} is an increasing arithmetic sequence with a_{1}=1 and that a_{2}, a_{4}+2, a_{14} form a geometric sequence, we can start by defining the common difference of the arithmetic sequence as d (where d > 0).Since a_{2}, a_{4}+2, a_{14} form a geometric sequence, we can write the property of a geometric sequence as:[(a_{4}+2)^{2}=a_{2}a_{14}]Substituting the general formula for an arithmetic sequence a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1)d into the equation, we get:[(1+3d+2)^{2}=(1+d)(1+13d)]Simplifying the equation, we find the possible values for d.

Sinceleft|frac{a sqrt{3}}{2}-frac{2}{3} aright|>left|frac{a}{2}-frac{2}{3} aright|this point is r=a sqrt{3} / 2.Therefore, the area of the covered part is minimal when r=2 a / 3, that is, when the radius of the circle drawn around the center is two-thirds of the side of the hexagon, and it is maximal when k is the inscribed circle of the hexagon.Remark. Several of our solvers noticed that the problem in a more general form had already appeared in our journal (1976, Volume 52, Issue 2, Page 63, F. 2004). There, the problem was to construct the circle for a regular n-gon under similar conditions, for which the covered part of the area is minimal or maximal. The solution given there, in certain aspects, is more than what we intended for the case n=6, and the solution to our problem can be read from there. However, we did not accept those solutions that only stated that the solution to the problem can be found here and there, but did not answer the question of the problem (i.e., what is the radius of k when the covered area is minimal or maximal). This is because it is not mentioned in the cited solution."},{"problem":"Find all functions f ,g,h : Rto R such that f(x+y^3)+g(x^3+y) = h(xy) for all x,y in R ","solution":"To find all functions ( f, g, h : mathbb{R} to mathbb{R} ) such that ( f(x+y^3) + g(x^3+y) = h(xy) ) for all ( x, y in mathbb{R} ), we can proceed as follows:1. Substitute specific values for ( x ) and ( y ):   - Let ( x = 0 ):     [     f(y^3) + g(y) = h(0)     ]   - Let ( y = 0 ):     [     f(x) + g(x^3) = h(0)     ]2. Analyze the equations obtained:   - From ( f(y^3) + g(y) = h(0) ), we can express ( g(y) ) in terms of ( f ):     [     g(y) = h(0) - f(y^3)     ]   - From ( f(x) + g(x^3) = h(0) ), we can express ( g(x^3) ) in terms of ( f ):     [     g(x^3) = h(0) - f(x)     ]3. Equate the two expressions for ( g ):   - Since ( g(y) = h(0) - f(y^3) ) and ( g(x^3) = h(0) - f(x) ), we have:     [     h(0) - f(y^3) = h(0) - f(x)     ]   - This implies:     [     f(y^3) = f(x)     ]4. Consider the implications of ( f(y^3) = f(x) ):   - For ( f(y^3) = f(x) ) to hold for all ( x, y in mathbb{R} ), ( f ) must be a constant function. Let ( f(x) = c ) for some constant ( c ).5. Substitute ( f(x) = c ) back into the original equations:   - If ( f(x) = c ), then:     [     c + g(y) = h(0)     ]     [     c + g(x^3) = h(0)     ]   - This implies ( g(y) = h(0) - c ) and ( g(x^3) = h(0) - c ), so ( g ) must also be a constant function. Let ( g(x) = d ) for some constant ( d ).6. Determine the relationship between the constants:   - From ( c + d = h(0) ), we have:     [     d = h(0) - c     ]7. Substitute ( f(x) = c ) and ( g(x) = d ) into the original functional equation:   - The original equation becomes:     [     c + d = h(xy)     ]   - Since ( c + d = h(0) ), we have:     [     h(xy) = h(0)     ]   - This implies ( h ) must also be a constant function. Let ( h(x) = e ) for some constant ( e ).8. Verify the consistency of the constants:   - From ( c + d = e ) and ( d = h(0) - c ), we have:     [     c + (h(0) - c) = h(0)     ]     [     e = h(0)     ]Thus, the only solutions are constant functions ( f(x) = c ), ( g(x) = h(0) - c ), and ( h(x) = h(0) ).The final answer is ( boxed{ f(x) = c } ), ( g(x) = h(0) - c ), and ( h(x) = h(0) )."},{"problem":"## Task 3 - 040823Given are the two adjacent angles alpha and beta with the vertex A and point D on the common side (see figure below).a) Construct from this figure the triangle A B C such that overline{A D} is a median!b) Under what condition will the triangle A B C be equilateral?![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_06_b85a894aa8dbf722a7b3g-0596.jpg?height=220&width=371&top_left_y=1112&top_left_x=1365)","solution":"a) One extends overline{A D} beyond D by its own length and thus obtains point E.

It can be observed that the pattern of remainders follows a cycle of 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, with a cycle length of 8. Within this cycle, the fourth and the eighth numbers are multiples of 3.

Understanding the problem: We need to find all positive integers ( n ) such that ( n^{d(n)+1}(n+21)^{d(n)} ) is a perfect square, where ( d(n) ) is the number of positive divisors of ( n ).2. Case 1: ( n ) is not a perfect square:   - If ( n ) is not a perfect square, then ( d(n) ) is even. This is because the number of divisors of a non-square number is always even.   - Therefore, ( n^{d(n)+1} ) is not necessarily a perfect square because ( d(n)+1 ) is odd.   - However, ( (n+21)^{d(n)} ) is a perfect square because ( d(n) ) is even.   - This implies that ( n^{d(n)+1}(n+21)^{d(n)} ) cannot be a perfect square unless ( n ) itself is a perfect square, leading to a contradiction.3. Case 2: ( n ) is a perfect square:   - Let ( n = k^2 ) for some positive integer ( k ).   - Since ( n ) is a perfect square, ( d(n) ) is odd. This is because the number of divisors of a perfect square is always odd.   - We need ( n^{d(n)+1}(n+21)^{d(n)} ) to be a perfect square.   - Substituting ( n = k^2 ), we get ( (k^2)^{d(k^2)+1}(k^2+21)^{d(k^2)} ).   - Since ( d(k^2) ) is odd, let ( d(k^2) = 2m+1 ) for some integer ( m ).   - Therefore, ( (k^2)^{2m+2}(k^2+21)^{2m+1} ) must be a perfect square.   - Simplifying, we get ( k^{4m+4}(k^2+21)^{2m+1} ).4. Condition for ( k^2 + 21 ) to be a perfect square:   - For ( k^{4m+4}(k^2+21)^{2m+1} ) to be a perfect square, ( k^2 + 21 ) must be a perfect square.   - Let ( k^2 + 21 = u^2 ) for some integer ( u ).   - This implies ( u^2 - k^2 = 21 ), which can be factored as ( (u-k)(u+k) = 21 ).5. Solving the equation ( (u-k)(u+k) = 21 ):   - The factor pairs of 21 are (1, 21), (3, 7), (7, 3), and (21, 1).   - Solving for each pair:     - ( u - k = 1 ) and ( u + k = 21 ):       - Adding these equations, ( 2u = 22 Rightarrow u = 11 ).       - Subtracting these equations, ( 2k = 20 Rightarrow k = 10 ).       - Thus, ( n = k^2 = 10^2 = 100 ).     - ( u - k = 3 ) and ( u + k = 7 ):       - Adding these equations, ( 2u = 10 Rightarrow u = 5 ).       - Subtracting these equations, ( 2k = 4 Rightarrow k = 2 ).       - Thus, ( n = k^2 = 2^2 = 4 ).6.

Determine the largest integer d for which the following statement holds: From any n-element set of integers, one can select three different non-empty subsets such that the sum of the elements in each of them is an integer multiple of d. (The selected subsets may have common elements.)(Jaromír Šimša)","solution":"Solution. The given statement does not hold for any d geqq n: it suffices to consider an n-element set composed of integers that give a remainder of 1 when divided by d. In the case of d=n, the only \\"suitable\\" subset is the entire n-element set; in the case of d>n, no such subset exists.In the second part of the solution, we will show that the statement holds for d=n-1. In the following exposition, all considered sets will be non-empty, their elements will be integers, and s(mathbf{X}) will denote the sum of all elements of the set X.First, we prove (a known) statement that if mathrm{X} has at least d elements, then there exists mathrm{Y} subset mathrm{X} with the property d mid s(mathrm{Y}). Indeed, if we select d different elements x_{1}, ldots, x_{d} in mathbf{X}, then in the case where none of the d sumsx_{1}, x_{1}+x_{2}, ldots, x_{1}+x_{2}+ldots+x_{d}is a multiple of d, two of them give the same remainder when divided by d; their difference is then a multiple of the number d, which is the sum s(Y) for a suitable subset Y.Let's return to the proof of the statement from the problem for d=n-1. Let mathrm{X} be any set with n elements. According to the proven fact, we can find a set X_{1} subset X such that n-1 mid sleft(mathbf{X}_{1}right). Choose some x_{1} in mathbf{X}_{1} and for the (n-1)-element set mathbf{X}^{prime}=mathbf{X} backslashleft{x_{1}right}, we use the fact again: there exists a set mathbf{X}_{2} subset mathbf{X}^{prime} such that n-1 mid sleft(mathbf{X}_{2}right). Since x_{1} in mathrm{X}_{1} and x_{1} notin mathrm{X}_{2}, we have already selected two different subsets of the set mathrm{X} with the required property. The third subset mathrm{X}_{3} subset mathrm{X} satisfying n-1 mid sleft(mathrm{X}_{3}right) we now find as follows: in the case X_{1} cap X_{2}=emptyset, we choose X_{3}=X_{1} cup X_{2}; in the opposite case, where X_{1} cap X_{2} neq emptyset, we choose x_{2} in mathrm{X}_{1} cap mathrm{X}_{2} and apply the same fact again - this time to the (n-1)-element set mathbf{X}^{prime prime}=mathbf{X} backslashleft{x_{2}right} - and find the desired mathbf{X}_{3} subset mathbf{X}^{prime prime}.Answer. The largest d is equal to n-1.Note. For the value d=n-1, it can happen that the required property will be satisfied by exactly three (different) subsets of the n-element set X. This occurs when the numbers in the n-element set mathrm{X} give remainders of 1,1,1, ldots, 1,0 when divided by n-1.

Which palindromes among the numbers from 10000 to 999999 are more numerous - those with an odd sum of digits or those with an even sum, and by what factor?","solution":"Answer. There are three times more palindromes with an even sum of digits.Solution. Note that a 5-digit palindrome looks like overline{a b c b a}, and a 6-digit palindrome looks like overline{a b c c b a}. Each of these palindromes is uniquely determined by the first three digits overline{a b c}. This means that there are as many 5-digit palindromes as there are 6-digit palindromes, which is the same as the number of numbers overline{a b c} from 100 to 999 (i.e., 900).Note that any 6-digit palindrome has an even sum of digits 2(a+b+c). The sum of the digits of a 5-digit palindrome is 2(a+b)+c, which depends only on the parity of the digit c. Therefore, for any fixed a and b, there are five (even) digits c for which 2(a+b)+c is even, and five (odd) digits c for which 2(a+b)+c is odd. This means that there are as many 5-digit palindromes with an odd sum of digits as there are 5-digit palindromes with an even sum of digits (450 each). Therefore, there are twice as many 6-digit palindromes as there are 5-digit palindromes with an odd sum of digits. Thus, there are more palindromes from 10000 to 999999 with an even sum of digits than with an odd sum, and exactly three times more.Remark. To prove that there are more palindromes with an even sum of digits, one can establish a one-to-one correspondence between 5-digit and 6-digit palindromes. For example, this can be done by associating each 5-digit palindrome overline{a b c b a} with a 6-digit palindrome overline{a b c c b a}. In this case, the sum of the digits of all 6-digit palindromes is even, while among 5-digit palindromes, there are those with an odd sum of digits.Comment. It is proven that there are as many 5-digit palindromes as there are 6-digit palindromes - 2 points.It is proven that the sum of the digits of 6-digit palindromes is even - 1 point.It is proven that the number of 5-digit palindromes with an odd sum of digits is equal to the number of 5-digit palindromes with an even sum of digits - 2 points.It is proven that there are more palindromes with an even sum of digits, but not how many times more - 1 point.In the case of a solution using a one-to-one correspondence, it is shown that there are more palindromes with an even sum of digits - 4 points."},{"problem":"3.

Thus, a = d m and b = d n, where m and n are coprime natural numbers. Since a b = d^2 m n is a perfect square and m and n are coprime, m and n must also be perfect squares. Write m = x^2 and n = y^2, where x and y are natural numbers. It follows that 101 = a - b = d(x + y)(x - y). Since 101 is a prime number and x + y geq 2, it must be that d = x - y = 1 and x + y = 101. From these, we calculate x = 51 and y = 50, so a = 51^2 = 2601 and b = 50^2 = 2500.2. way. Let d be the greatest common divisor of the numbers a and b. Since d divides 101 and 101 is a prime number, d can only be 1 or 101.If d = 1, then a and b are coprime numbers. Since a b is a perfect square, it follows that a and b are also perfect squares. Write a = x^2 and b = y^2, where x and y are natural numbers. Then 101 = a - b = x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y), from which it follows that x - y = 1 and x + y = 101, since 101 is a prime number and x + y geq 2. From these two equations, we easily calculate x = 51 and y = 50, so a = 51^2 = 2601 and b = 50^2 = 2500.If d = 101, we can write a = 101 m and b = 101 n, where m and n are coprime natural numbers. Since a b = 101^2 m n is a perfect square and m and n are coprime, it follows that m and n are also perfect squares. Write m = u^2 and n = v^2, where u and v are natural numbers. Then 101 = a - b = 101(m - n) = 101(u^2 - v^2) = 101(u + v)(u - v), which is a contradiction, since u + v geq 2.The only solution to the problem is thus the pair a = 2601 and b = 2500.3. way. Write a = b + 101 and calculate a b = b(b + 101) = n^2 for some natural number n. From this, we express n^2 - b^2 = (n - b)(n + b) = 101 b. Since 101 is a prime number, 101 mid (n - b) or 101 mid (n + b). We consider both possibilities.If 101 mid (n - b), we can write n - b = 101 k for some natural number k. From the equation (n - b)(n + b) = 101 b, it follows that k n = b(1 - k), which is a contradiction, since the left side of the equation is strictly positive, while the right side is less than or equal to zero.If 101 mid (n + b), we can write n + b = 101 l for some natural number l. From the equation (n - b)(n + b) = 101 b, it follows that l(101 l - 2 b) = b, or 101 l^2 = b(2 l + 1), from which we express b = frac{101 l^2}{2 l + 1}, which must be a natural number. Therefore, 2 l + 1 divides 101 l^2. Since 101 is a prime number, it must be that (2 l + 1) mid 101, so we can write 101 = (2 l + 1) c, where c in mathbb{N}. Since 2 l + 1 > 1, it must be that c = 1 and 2 l + 1 = 101. From this, we calculate l = 50 and b = 50^2 = 2500.

Determining the given line's slope:The slope of the line 2x+3y=0 can be found by rearranging it into slope-intercept form (y = mx + c), where m is the slope.  y = -frac{2}{3}x So the slope is m = -frac{2}{3}.3. Finding the perpendicular line's slope:The slope of a line perpendicular to another line with slope m is the negative reciprocal of m. Therefore, the slope of the line perpendicular to 2x+3y=0 is: m_{perp} = -frac{1}{m} = -frac{1}{-frac{2}{3}} = frac{3}{2} 4. Writing the equation using point-slope form:We use the center of the circle (-1, 2) as the point and frac{3}{2} as the slope to write the point-slope form of the line's equation: y - 2 = frac{3}{2}(x + 1) Expanding and rearranging to standard form, we get: y - 2 = frac{3}{2}x + frac{3}{2}  2y - 4 = 3x + 3  3x - 2y + 7 = 0 Thus, the equation of the line is boxed{3x - 2y + 7 = 0}."},{"problem":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} satisfy overrightarrow{a} perp (overrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{b}), and |overrightarrow{a}| = 3, |overrightarrow{b}| = 2sqrt{3}, find the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}.","solution":"Since overrightarrow{a} is perpendicular to (overrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{b}), their dot product equals to zero: overrightarrow{a} cdot (overrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{b}) = overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 0 Let theta be the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b}.

The time taken to travel upstream is given as 7 days. Therefore, we have:   [   D = (v_s - v_r) times 7   ]5. Since both expressions equal ( D ), we can set them equal to each other:   [   (v_s + v_r) times 5 = (v_s - v_r) times 7   ]6. Expanding and simplifying the equation:   [   5v_s + 5v_r = 7v_s - 7v_r   ]   [   5v_s + 5v_r - 7v_s + 7v_r = 0   ]   [   -2v_s + 12v_r = 0   ]   [   12v_r = 2v_s   ]   [   v_s = 6v_r   ]7. Now, we need to find the time it takes for a raft to float downstream from Gorky to Astrakhan. A raft floats with the speed of the river current, ( v_r ).8. The time ( t ) taken for the raft to float downstream is given by:   [   t = frac{D}{v_r}   ]9. From the downstream equation ( D = (v_s + v_r) times 5 ), we substitute ( v_s = 6v_r ):   [   D = (6v_r + v_r) times 5   ]   [   D = 7v_r times 5   ]   [   D = 35v_r   ]10. Substituting ( D = 35v_r ) into the time equation:    [    t = frac{35v_r}{v_r} = 35    ]    [    t = 35 text{ days}    ]The final answer is (boxed{35}) days."},{"problem":"There are five students taking a graduation photo in a row, among them, student A cannot stand next to student B, and students B and C must stand together.

Let the center of the circle be denoted as O, the foot of the altitude from vertex C of the triangle as H, and the angle B A C as alpha.The center of the circle inscribed in an angle lies on the bisector of that angle, so angle O C L = frac{1}{2} angle A C B = 60^{circ}. Since the radius drawn to the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent, C L = O L operatorname{ctg} angle O C L = sqrt{3} cdot frac{1}{sqrt{3}} = 1. By the sum of the angles in quadrilateral O L C K, we find that angle L O K = 60^{circ}.Since O L perp A C and M K | A C, then O L perp M K. Triangle M O K is isosceles, and the height in it is also the bisector, so angle M O K = 2 angle L O K = 120^{circ}. Hence, M K = 2 cdot M O cdot sin 60^{circ} = 3. angle M O L = frac{1}{2} angle M O K = 60^{circ}, M O = L O, therefore, triangle M O L is equilateral, angle M L O = 60^{circ}, M L = sqrt{3}. Then angle A L M = angle A L O - angle M L O = 30^{circ}.Consider triangle A L M. By the cosine theorem, we get A M^{2} = A L^{2} + L M^{2} - 2 cdot A L cdot L M cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 13.By the tangent-secant theorem, A L^{2} = A M cdot A N, from which A N = frac{25}{sqrt{13}}. The triangles A L M and A L N share a common height from vertex L, so their areas are in the ratio of their bases, i.e., as A M : A N. Therefore, S_{triangle A L N} = S_{triangle A L M} cdot frac{A M}{A N} = frac{1}{2} cdot A L cdot L M cdot sin 30^{circ} cdot frac{25}{13} = frac{125 sqrt{3}}{52}.Since K M | A C, triangles B K M and B C A are similar, with the similarity ratio being K M : C A = 3 : 6.

For the tangents at these points to form a rectangle, the slopes of the tangents at these points must satisfy the condition of perpendicularity. This means that the product of the slopes of the tangents at any two adjacent points must be (-1).

We know that x+y+1 is also a divisor of 2 x y. But the greatest common divisor (gcd) of x+y-1 and x+y+1 is 1 or 2, since the difference between the two numbers is 2. Therefore, 2 x y is divisible by (x+y-1)(x+y+1) (if the gcd is 1) or by frac{(x+y-1)(x+y+1)}{2} (if the gcd is 2).

Using the given face areas, we'll find the lengths of these edges. Then, we'll determine the length of the diagonal of the rectangular solid, which will give us the diameter of the sphere. Finally, we'll calculate the sphere's volume.Step-by-step Solution:Let the lengths of the three edges that meet at one vertex of the rectangular solid be a, b, and c, respectively.From the problem, we know that:ab = 1,bc = 2,ac = 2.Solving these equations, we find:a = 1,b = 1,c = 2.Now, we can find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular solid using the formula:d = sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} = sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2} = sqrt{6}.Since all vertices of the rectangular solid are located on the same sphere, the diagonal of the solid is equal to the diameter of the sphere.

Identify the given points and their properties:   - ( H ) is the orthocenter of (triangle ABC).   - ( I ) is the incenter of (triangle ABC).   - ( O ) is the circumcenter of (triangle ABC).   - Points ( B, H, I, C ) lie on a circle.2. Determine the angle (angle BHC):   - The orthocenter ( H ) is where the altitudes of the triangle intersect.   - The foot of the altitude from ( A ) is ( X ), from ( B ) is ( Y ), and from ( C ) is ( Z ).   - By angle chasing, (angle BHX = angle C) and (angle CHX = angle B).   - Therefore, (angle BHC = angle B + angle C).3. Use the cyclic quadrilateral property:   - Since ( B, H, I, C ) lie on a circle, (angle BHC = angle BIC).   - The incenter ( I ) is the intersection of the angle bisectors of (triangle ABC).   - Therefore, (angle BIC = 180^circ - frac{1}{2}(angle A)).4. Equate the angles:   - From the cyclic quadrilateral property, (angle BHC = angle BIC).   - Thus, (angle B + angle C = 180^circ - frac{1}{2}(angle A)).5. Solve for (angle A):   - We know that (angle A + angle B + angle C = 180^circ).   - Substitute (angle B + angle C) from the previous step:     [     angle B + angle C = 180^circ - frac{1}{2}(angle A)     ]     [     180^circ - angle A = 180^circ - frac{1}{2}(angle A)     ]     [     angle A = 60^circ     ]6. Determine (angle BOC):   - Since (angle A = 60^circ), and (angle A) is an inscribed angle of (angle BOC), the central angle (angle BOC) is twice the inscribed angle.   - Therefore, (angle BOC = 2 times 60^circ = 120^circ).The final answer is (boxed{120^circ})."},{"problem":"Let S(m) be the sum of the digits of the positive integer m.

It is obvious that the only solutions in nonnegative integers to this inequality are x=0 and x=1. Indeed, for x geq 2, the left hand side grows faster. Therefore, either k=1 or k=2 and b=1.Now we have only two cases left.Case 1: b=1 and k=2. We are left with the equation Sleft(a^{2}right)=a, for 10 leq a<100. Then a^{2}<10^{4}, so a=Sleft(a^{2}right) leq 9 cdot 4=36.Moreover, taking into account the fact that the sum of digits does not change the number modulo 9, a^{2} equiv a(bmod 9), i.e., a(a-1) equiv 0(bmod 9), therefore a equiv 0(bmod 9) or a equiv 1(bmod 9). So now we are left only with numbers a in {10,18,19,27,28,36}, which we can easily check by substitution and see that there are no solutions.Case 2: k=1. In the same way, looking modulo 9, we get that a^{b+1} equiv a^{b}(bmod 9) implies a^{b}(a-1) equiv 0(bmod 9). Therefore either a=1 or a is divisible by 3. a=1 is an obvious solution with all b in mathbb{Z}^{+}.Otherwise, a in{3,6,9}. But then a^{b+1}<10^{b+1} and Sleft(a^{b+1}right) leq 9(b+1). Therefore, 3^{b} leq a^{b}=Sleft(a^{b+1}right) leq 9(b+1). But from 3^{b} leq 9(b+1), we can conclude b leq 3. Indeed, for b geq 4, the left hand side increases faster. So we are left with a in{3,6,9} and b leq 3. We check all these cases to determine that only (a, b)=(3,2) or (a, b)=(9,1) are solutions."},{"problem":"4.2.

Then B^{prime} A is perpendicular to A B, and thus parallel to C M, similarly B^{prime} C | A M, so A, C, B^{prime}, and M are the vertices of a parallelogram, and A M=B^{prime} C. This is also valid if B^{prime} coincides with A or C, because in this case there is a right angle at C or A in the triangle, so M falls into the vertex of the right angle.

Translate and scale the assignments:   We can assume that the largest number assigned to an edge is 1 and the smallest is 0. This is possible by translating and scaling the assignments.3. Case 1: Non-incident edges:   Suppose the edges with numbers 0 and 1 are not incident. Consider a tetrahedron (complete graph on 4 vertices). We need to check if the edges can form arithmetic progressions.       - Assign numbers to the edges such that they form arithmetic progressions.    - If the edges are (0, 1, frac{1}{3}, frac{2}{3}), some of the numbers must be equal, which contradicts the requirement for distinct numbers.4. Case 2: Incident edges:   Suppose the edges with numbers 0 and 1 are incident, say (0 to AB) and (1 to AC). Then, the edge (BC) must be assigned (frac{1}{2}) to form an arithmetic progression with (AB) and (AC).5.

What is smallest possible value of n","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the smallest possible value of ( n ) for a regular ( n )-sided polygon such that the angle formed by the extension of two adjacent sides is ( 28^circ ).2. Angle Properties of Regular Polygon:   For a regular ( n )-sided polygon, the internal angle between two adjacent sides is given by:   [   theta = frac{(n-2) cdot 180^circ}{n}   ]   When these sides are extended, they form an external angle which is supplementary to the internal angle:   [   text{External angle} = 180^circ - theta = 180^circ - frac{(n-2) cdot 180^circ}{n} = frac{360^circ}{n}   ]3. Secant Angle Theorem:   The problem states that the angle formed by the extension of two sides is ( 28^circ ). This angle is half the measure of the arc intercepted by the two sides of the polygon. Therefore, we have:   [   frac{360^circ}{n} = 2 cdot 28^circ = 56^circ   ]4. Solving for ( n ):   [   frac{360^circ}{n} = 56^circ   ]   [   n = frac{360^circ}{56^circ} = frac{360}{56} = frac{90}{14} = frac{45}{7}   ]   Since ( n ) must be an integer, we need to find the smallest integer ( n ) such that:   [   n = 7k quad text{for some integer } k   ]5.

Verification:   For ( n = 7 ):   [   frac{360^circ}{7} approx 51.43^circ   ]   This does not match ( 56^circ ). Therefore, we need to find the correct ( n ).   Re-evaluating the problem, we realize that the angle formed by the extension of two sides is not directly the external angle but rather the angle between the extended lines. This angle is given by:   [   frac{180^circ}{n} = 28^circ   ]   [   n = frac{180^circ}{28^circ} = frac{180}{28} = frac{45}{7}   ]   This confirms that ( n = 45 ).The final answer is ( boxed{45} )."},{"problem":"7.195. log _{x}(125 x) cdot log _{25}^{2} x=1.","solution":"## Solution.Domain of definition: 0<x neq 1.Switch to base 5.

Hence, it follows that S: S_{ADP} = S_{BCP}: S_{CDP}, which, given the derived relationships, meansfrac{S}{10} = frac{8-S}{1+S}After rearranging, we get a quadratic equation for S:S^2 + 11S - 80 = (S + 16)(S - 5) = 0,which has two roots, -16 and 5. Since the area S of triangle ABP is a non-negative number, only S=5 is valid. From the above relationships, we can easily calculate S_{BCP}=3 and S_{CDP}=6. The area of the quadrilateral ABCD in mathrm{cm}^{2} is thereforeS + S_{BCP} + S_{CDP} + S_{ADP} = 5 + 3 + 6 + 10 = 24.Conclusion. The area of quadrilateral ABCD is 24 mathrm{~cm}^{2}.Alternative Solution. Let the lengths of segments PA, PB, PC, PD (in mathrm{cm}) be denoted by a, b, c, d respectively. According to the known formula S = frac{1}{2}uv sin omega for the area of a triangle with sides of lengths u and v forming an angle of size omega, we express the conditions of the problem with the equations8 = frac{1}{2}ab sin varphi + frac{1}{2}bc sin (pi - varphi), quad 9 = frac{1}{2}bc sin (pi - varphi) + frac{1}{2}cd sin varphi, quad 10 = frac{1}{2}da sin (pi - varphi),where varphi = |angle APB|. For simplicity, let k = frac{1}{2} sin varphi = frac{1}{2} sin (pi - varphi). We then get the system of equations8 = kab + kbc, quad 9 = kbc + kcd, quad 10 = kda,from which we will find the area S of quadrilateral ABCD, which in mathrm{cm}^{2} is given by the formulaS = kab + kbc + kcd + kda.First, we eliminate d by a suitable combination of the second and third equations (1):9a - 10c = kab c.By combining this equation with the first equation (1), whose right-hand side we rewrite as the product k b(a + c), we eliminate b:(9a - 10c)(a + c) - 8ac = 0.Using the identity(9a - 10c)(a + c) - 8ac = 9a^2 - 9ac - 10c^2 = (3a - 5c)(3a + 2c),we see that for (positive) numbers a, c, we have 3a = 5c or 9a = 15c, and thus equation (3) can be rewritten as 5c = kab c, from which kab = 5. From equations (1), it follows that kbc = 3 and kcd = 6, which, when substituted into (2) along with the value kda = 10, leads to the result S = 24.For a complete solution, award 6 points, of which 1 point for expressing the area using one of the three triangles ABP, BCP, or CDP, 2 points for justifying the proportionality between the areas of the four triangles, 1 point for setting up the corresponding equation, and 1 point for solving it.

In the plane, 2013 red points and 2014 blue points are marked so that no three of the marked points are collinear. One needs to draw k lines not passing through the marked points and dividing the plane into several regions. The goal is to do it in such a way that no region contains points of both colors.Find the minimal value of k such that the goal is attainable for every possible configuration of 4027 points.","solution":"Answer. k=2013.Solution 1. Firstly, let us present an example showing that k geqslant 2013. Mark 2013 red and 2013 blue points on some circle alternately, and mark one more blue point somewhere in the plane. The circle is thus split into 4026 arcs, each arc having endpoints of different colors. Thus, if the goal is reached, then each arc should intersect some of the drawn lines. Since any line contains at most two points of the circle, one needs at least 4026 / 2=2013 lines.It remains to prove that one can reach the goal using 2013 lines. First of all, let us mention that for every two points A and B having the same color, one can draw two lines separating these points from all other ones. Namely, it suffices to take two lines parallel to A B and lying on different sides of A B sufficiently close to it: the only two points between these lines will be A and B.Now, let P be the convex hull of all marked points. Two cases are possible.Case 1. Assume that P has a red vertex A. Then one may draw a line separating A from all the other points, pair up the other 2012 red points into 1006 pairs, and separate each pair from the other points by two lines. Thus, 2013 lines will be used.Case 2. Assume now that all the vertices of P are blue. Consider any two consecutive vertices of P, say A and B. One may separate these two points from the others by a line parallel to A B. Then, as in the previous case, one pairs up all the other 2012 blue points into 1006 pairs, and separates each pair from the other points by two lines. Again, 2013 lines will be used.Comment 1. Instead of considering the convex hull, one may simply take a line containing two marked points A and B such that all the other marked points are on one side of this line. If one of A and B is red, then one may act as in Case 1; otherwise both are blue, and one may act as in Case 2.Solution 2. Let us present a different proof of the fact that k=2013 suffices. In fact, we will prove a more general statement:If n points in the plane, no three of which are collinear, are colored in red and blue arbitrarily, then it suffices to draw lfloor n / 2rfloor lines to reach the goal.We proceed by induction on n. If n leqslant 2 then the statement is obvious. Now assume that n geqslant 3, and consider a line ell containing two marked points A and B such that all the other marked points are on one side of ell; for instance, any line containing a side of the convex hull works.Remove for a moment the points A and B. By the induction hypothesis, for the remaining configuration it suffices to draw lfloor n / 2rfloor-1 lines to reach the goal. Now return the points A and B back. Three cases are possible.Case 1. If A and B have the same color, then one may draw a line parallel to ell and separating A and B from the other points. Obviously, the obtained configuration of lfloor n / 2rfloor lines works.Case 2. If A and B have different colors, but they are separated by some drawn line, then again the same line parallel to ell works.Case 3. Finally, assume that A and B have different colors and lie in one of the regions defined by the drawn lines. By the induction assumption, this region contains no other points of one of the colors - without loss of generality, the only blue point it contains is A. Then it suffices to draw a line separating A from all other points.Thus the step of the induction is proved.Comment 2. One may ask a more general question, replacing the numbers 2013 and 2014 by any positive integers m and n, say with m leqslant n. Denote the answer for this problem by f(m, n).One may show along the lines of Solution 1 that m leqslant f(m, n) leqslant m+1; moreover, if m is even then f(m, n)=m. On the other hand, for every odd m there exists an N such that f(m, n)=m for all m leqslant n leqslant N, and f(m, n)=m+1 for all n>N."},{"problem":"Fill in the blanks with the corresponding rational numbers: -2, 0, -0.1314, 11, frac{22}{7}, -4frac{1}{3}, 0.03, 2%.Positive numbers: ______;  Integers: ______;  Negative numbers: ______;  Non-negative integers: ______.","solution":"To categorize each number into the correct group, we follow the definitions of each category:1.

We will consider the games that have not been played. The condition means that the unplayed games do not form triangles. We will prove by induction on k that for 2k teams, the maximum number of unplayed games is no more than k^2.Base case: k=1 (the estimate is obvious).Inductive step: Suppose it is proven for k, we will prove for k+1. If there are no unplayed games, then everything is proven. Otherwise, select any teams A and B that have not played against each other. Note that the number of unplayed games involving teams A or B is no more than 2k (not counting the game between A and B), since for any team C, at least one of the games AC and BC has been played. Now consider all teams except A and B and apply the inductive hypothesis - among them, no more than k^2 games have not been played. Therefore, the total number of unplayed games is no more than k^2 + (2k + 1) = (k+1)^2, which is what we needed to prove.Substituting k=10 gives that the number of unplayed games is no more than 100, and the total number of possible games is frac{20 cdot 19}{2} = 190, from which the number of played games is no less than 190 - 100 = 90.The estimate is achieved if the teams are divided into two equal groups, all matches are played within each group, and no matches are played between the groups."},{"problem":"A b^{2} x^{2}+a^{2} y^{2}=a^{2} b^{2} ellipse, draw a rectangle whose area t is given.

This tells us that angle F D E=angle F N M. Thus, N M is parallel to D E.Also, D E=2 N M.Consider next triangle G N M and triangle G E D.Since N M is parallel to D E, then angle G N M=angle G E D and angle G M N=angle G D E.This means that triangle G N M is similar to triangle G E D. Since N M=frac{1}{2} D E, then the similarity ratio is 1: 2.Therefore, G E=2 G N and G D=2 G M.Since D M=E N, then G D+G M=G E+G N or 2 G M+G M=2 G N+G N. This gives 3 G M=3 G N or G M=G N.Therefore, triangle G N M is isosceles with angle G N M=angle G M N.Finally, consider triangle M N E and triangle N M D.Since angle M N E=angle N M D, N M is a common side, and E N=D M, then the triangles are congruent (SAS).Thus, M E=N D.Since M E=frac{1}{2} F E and N D=frac{1}{2} F D, then F E=F D, and so triangle D E F is isosceles, as required.(c) Suppose that triangle A B C has equal medians A M=C N, with M the midpoint of B C and N the midpoint of A B.

If there were at least 3 knights among them, the leftmost knight would definitely lie, which is impossible. If there were at least 3 liars, the leftmost liar would definitely tell the truth, which is also impossible. Therefore, in every group of four consecutive people, there are exactly 2 knights and 2 liars. By dividing all the people into 15 such groups, we get that there are 15 cdot 2 = 30 knights.Another solution. Notice that there cannot be only knights or only liars sitting at the table.

Let angle C B D=alpha, angle C D B=beta, alpha+beta=90^{circ} (see Fig. 11.6a). Right triangles D B C and A B C share the side B C. If angle A B C=alpha, then triangles A B C and D B C are congruent, which implies C D=A C, which is impossible because A C is the hypotenuse of the right triangle A C D.Therefore, angle A B C=beta, angle B A C=alpha. Since B A C is the angle between the line A B and the plane A C D, then alphaC D, hence C DA D.Therefore, angle B A D=beta, quad angle A B D=alpha, quad then A D=cos beta; C D=B D cos beta=A B cos alpha cos beta=cos alpha cos beta. Thus, C D<A D.From triangle A C D: C D<A D and alpha<beta. Therefore, angle C A D=alpha. From triangle A B C and triangle A B D: A D=A C cos alpha=A B cos ^{2} alpha. From triangle A B D quad A D=A B cos beta. We obtain the equation: cos beta=cos ^{2} alpha.Since alpha+beta=90^{circ}, then cos beta=sin alpha. The obtained equation becomes: sin alpha=1-sin ^{2} alpha. Introducing the notation sin alpha=t, where 0<t<1, we get the quadratic equation t^{2}+t-1=0, whose roots are t_{1}=frac{-1-sqrt{5}}{2}<0 and t_{2}=frac{-1+sqrt{5}}{2}, 0<t_{2}<1. Therefore, sin alpha=frac{sqrt{5}-1}{2}.Since cos beta=sin alpha, then C D=cos alpha cos beta=cos alpha sin alpha. Moreover, sin alpha=cos ^{2} alpha, and the angle alpha is acute, so sqrt{sin alpha}=cos alpha. Thus, C D=left(frac{sqrt{5}-1}{2}right)^{frac{3}{2}}.For a series of calculations (for example, to determine the arrangement of planar angles at vertex A), the formula of three cosines can be used. Let the line B C be perpendicular to the plane A C D, angle B A C=alpha, angle C A D=beta, quad angle B A D=varphi quad (see Fig. 11.6b). Then cos varphi=cos alpha cos beta.The tetrahedron described in the problem exists.

What is the smallest value of n so that if the outer layer of unit cubes are removed from the block, more than half the original unit cubes will still remain?","solution":"1. Calculate the total number of unit cubes in the cubic block:   The total number of unit cubes in an ( n times n times n ) cubic block is given by:   [   n^3   ]2. Determine the number of unit cubes in the outer layer:   The outer layer consists of all the unit cubes that are on the surface of the cube. To find the number of these cubes, we need to consider the six faces of the cube, each of which is an ( n times n ) square. However, we must subtract the cubes that are counted multiple times at the edges and corners.   - Each face has ( n^2 ) unit cubes.   - There are 6 faces, so initially, we count ( 6n^2 ) unit cubes.   - Each edge of the cube (12 edges in total) has ( n ) unit cubes, but each edge is shared by 2 faces, so we subtract ( 12n ) unit cubes.   - Each corner of the cube (8 corners in total) is shared by 3 faces, so we add back 8 unit cubes.   Therefore, the number of unit cubes in the outer layer is:   [   6n^2 - 12n + 8   ]3. Calculate the number of unit cubes remaining after removing the outer layer:   The number of unit cubes remaining after removing the outer layer is:   [   n^3 - (6n^2 - 12n + 8)   ]4. Set up the inequality to find the smallest ( n ) such that more than half of the original unit cubes remain:   We need the remaining cubes to be more than half of the original cubes:   [   n^3 - (6n^2 - 12n + 8) > frac{n^3}{2}   ]5. Simplify the inequality:   [   n^3 - 6n^2 + 12n - 8 > frac{n^3}{2}   ]   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:   [   2n^3 - 12n^2 + 24n - 16 > n^3   ]   Subtract ( n^3 ) from both sides:   [   n^3 - 12n^2 + 24n - 16 > 0   ]6.

What are the lengths of the sides if the area of the trapezoid is maximized?","solution":"A cyclic trapezoid is a trapezoid whose sides are chords of a circle. Since the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180^{circ}, it follows that the trapezoid is isosceles.Let the larger base of the trapezoid be AB = a, the smaller base DC = c, and the legs AD = BC = b (Figure 1).According to the condition:d = 2b + cThe area of the trapezoid is: T = frac{a + c}{2} cdot m. By the Pythagorean theorem:m = sqrt{b^2 - left(frac{a - c}{2}right)^2}From (1), b = frac{d - c}{2}; substituting these values, we get:T = frac{a + c}{2} sqrt{left(frac{d - c}{2}right)^2 - left(frac{a - c}{2}right)^2}Transform the expression, using the known identity x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y):T = frac{a + c}{4} sqrt{(d + a - 2c)(d - a)}The value of (d - a) is constant and does not affect the maximum value; d + a = k is the perimeter of the trapezoid. Further transforming the expression, we get:T = frac{1}{4} sqrt{d - a} sqrt{(a + c)(a + c)(k - 2c)}Each factor under the second square root is positive, and we can apply the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality to the product of three factors:begin{gathered}sqrt[3]{(a + c)(a + c)(k - 2c)} leq leq frac{(a + c) + (a + c) + (k - 2c)}{3} = frac{k + 2a}{3}end{gathered}The product is maximized when the factors are equal, i.e., a + c = k - 2c = d + a - 2c, from which 3c = d, and thus c = frac{d}{3} and b = frac{d - c}{2} = frac{d}{3}, meaning the legs and the shorter base have the same length.Such a trapezoid exists if d > a (Figure 2).The opposite angles are equal because they correspond to equal-length chords, so AB parallel CD, meaning the quadrilateral is indeed a trapezoid.Katalin Ásványi (Ajka, Bródy I. Gymnasium, 11th grade)Remarks. 1. The problem can also be solved as an extremum problem using derivatives (see the online solution outline).2. The unusually high number of zero-point solutions is due to the following incorrect conclusions:a) \\"Since the perimeter of the quadrilateral is given, and among quadrilaterals with a given perimeter, the square has the largest area, the quadrilateral must be a square.\\" This reasoning is flawed because not only the perimeter but also one side is given, so (except for the case d = 3a) the trapezoid cannot be a square.b) \\"Reflecting the cyclic trapezoid over its longer parallel side, we get a hexagon. For a given perimeter, the regular hexagon has the largest area, so the trapezoid has three equal sides, each of length frac{d}{3}.\\" This error is similar to the previous one: the resulting trapezoid has not only a given perimeter but also a predetermined diagonal, so we cannot refer to the general extremum problem.c) Some students decomposed the area into two independent terms and tried to find the maximum of each term separately, and from this, they attempted to determine the common maximum.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_fead467f9254c86dacf1g-1.jpg?height=436&width=480&top_left_y=2254&top_left_x=817)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_fead467f9254c86dacf1g-2.jpg?height=480&width=488&top_left_y=123&top_left_x=816)"},{"problem":"11.

For (n = 49):   [   phi(49) = 49 left(1 - frac{1}{7}right) = 49 cdot frac{6}{7} = 42   ]   Since (9) and (49) are coprime, we have:   [   9^{42} equiv 1 pmod{49}   ]4. Reducing the exponent: We need to reduce the exponent (2018) modulo (42):   [   2018 div 42 = 48 quad text{remainder} quad 2 implies 2018 equiv 2 pmod{42}   ]   Therefore:   [   9^{2018} equiv 9^2 pmod{49}   ]5.

We perform the division:   [   32 div 7 = 4 quad text{remainder} quad 4 implies 32 = 4 cdot 7 + 4   ]   Therefore, (32) in base 7 is (44).Conclusion:The last two digits of (2018^{2018}) in base 7 are (boxed{44})."},{"problem":"Find the value of m + a if the tangent line l: x - y + m = 0 to the curve y = ln x also tangents to the curve y = x^2 + a.","solution":"Step 1: Find the derivative of y = ln x to obtain the slope of the tangent line.The derivative is y' = frac{1}{x}.Step 2: Let the tangent line l intersect the curve y = ln x at point (x_0, ln x_0).

Let C_{perp} be the projection of C on the internal angle bisector of angle B. Let C' be the projection of C on MN. Since CC_{perp}BC' forms a rectangle (because the internal bisector is perpendicular to the external bisector), we have:   [   CC' = BC_{perp} = BC cos(23^circ)   ]4.

Problem 1: Simplify frac{1}{{sqrt{3}+1}}+frac{1}{{sqrt{5}+sqrt{3}}}+frac{1}{{sqrt{7}+sqrt{5}}}+cdots+frac{1}{{sqrt{121}+sqrt{119}}}.Step 1: Rationalize each term in the series.Each term of the form frac{1}{{sqrt{n+2}+sqrt{n}}} can be rationalized to frac{{sqrt{n+2}-sqrt{n}}}{2} by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator.Step 2: Apply the rationalization to the entire series.The series becomes:[frac{{sqrt{3}-1}}{2}+frac{{sqrt{5}-sqrt{3}}}{2}+frac{{sqrt{7}-sqrt{5}}}{2}+cdots+frac{{sqrt{121}-sqrt{119}}}{2}]Step 3: Combine like terms.Notice that all terms except for the first and last cancel out, leaving us with:[frac{1}{2}(-1+11)]Step 4: Simplify the expression.Simplifying the expression gives us:[frac{1}{2} times 10 = 5]Therefore, the simplified form of the given series is boxed{5}.

A trapezoid ABCD (AD | BC) and a rectangle A_{1}B_{1}C_{1}D_{1} are inscribed in a circle Omega with radius 13, such that AC | B_{1}D_{1}, BD | A_{1}C_{1}. Find the ratio of the areas of ABCD and A_{1}B_{1}C_{1}D_{1}, given that AD=24, BC=10.","solution":"Answer: frac{289}{338} or frac{1}{2}.Solution. Draw a line through the center of the circle O perpendicular to the bases of the trapezoid. Let it intersect A D and B C at points N and M respectively. Since a diameter perpendicular to a chord bisects the chord, B M=M C=5, A N=N D=12. By the Pythagorean theorem from triangles O N D and O M C, we find that O N=sqrt{O D^{2}-D N^{2}}=5, O M=sqrt{O C^{2}-M C^{2}}=12. There are two cases.1) Point O does not lie on the segment M N. Then the height of the trapezoid is M N=O M-O N=7. Let H be the foot of the perpendicular dropped from vertex B to the base A D. Since the trapezoid inscribed in a circle is isosceles, D H=frac{A D+B C}{2}=17. Then B D=sqrt{D H^{2}+B H^{2}}=sqrt{338}=13 sqrt{2}. The area of any quadrilateral is half the product of the diagonals multiplied by the sine of the angle between them. Since the diagonals of the rectangle A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} D_{1} are parallel to the diagonals of the trapezoid A B C D, the angle between them is equal to the angle between the diagonals of the trapezoid. Let this angle be psi. Moreover, the diagonals of the rectangle inscribed in a circle are its diameters, so A_{1} C_{1}=B_{1} D_{1}=26. Then S_{A B C D}=frac{1}{2} A C cdot B D sin psi=169 sin psi ; S_{A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} D_{1}}=frac{1}{2} A_{1} C_{1} cdot B_{1} D_{1} sin psi= frac{1}{2} cdot 26 cdot 26 sin psi=338 sin psi. Therefore, the ratio of the areas is frac{169 sin psi}{338 sin psi}=frac{1}{2}.2) Point O lies on the segment M N. Then M N=O N+O M=17. Similarly to the first case, we find that D H=17, B D=sqrt{D H^{2}+B H^{2}}=17 sqrt{2}, S_{A B C D}=frac{1}{2} A C cdot B D sin varphi=289 sin varphi ; S_{A_{1} B_{1} C_{1} D_{1}}=frac{1}{2} A_{1} C_{1}. B_{1} D_{1} sin varphi=frac{1}{2} cdot 26 cdot 26 sin varphi=338 sin varphi, where varphi is the angle between the diagonals of the trapezoid.

The original solution states a=4, which should be accepted without the incorrect derivation I provided.2. For b, the correct calculation was shown, leading to b=5.3. For the cube root of a+b-1, with a=4 and b=5, the calculation correctly leads to 4+5-1=8, and the cube root of 8 is indeed 2.Therefore, the corrected final answers are:- For a and b: a=4, b=5.- The cube root of a+b-1 is boxed{2}."},{"problem":"The coefficient of x^{3} in the expansion of the binomial (2- sqrt {x})^{8} is ______.","solution":"The general term formula for the expansion of a binomial is given by T_{r+1} = binom{8}{r} 2^{8-r}(- sqrt {x})^{r} = (-1)^{r} binom{8}{r} 2^{8-r}x^{frac{r}{2}}.To find the coefficient of x^3, we need to have frac{r}{2} = 3.

Using these facts, we can solve the system of equations (star) to find that:begin{cases}sin θ = frac{3}{5}, cos θ = frac{4}{5}.end{cases}Now, we can find the value of sin (θ + frac{π}{4}) by using the trigonometric identity sin(α + β) = sin α cos β + cos α sin β:sin left(θ + frac{π}{4}right) = sin θ cos frac{π}{4} + cos θ sin frac{π}{4} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}left(frac{3}{5} + frac{4}{5}right) = boxed{frac{7sqrt{2}}{10}}."},{"problem":"Given that the sequence {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence with positive terms, and the sum of the first 100 terms is 500, find the maximum value of a_{50} cdot a_{51}.","solution":"[Analysis]This problem examines the properties of an arithmetic sequence and the use of basic inequalities to find the maximum value.

Since the sum of all numbers is 1+2+ldots+9=45, we have 4 S=45+3 e+(b+d+f+h).

Let x, y, u, v be non-zero integers. Then 3 divides x^{2}+y^{2}, so x and y are divisible by 3 by the previous result.

Add three unit vectors forming angles alpha, 2 alpha, 3 alpha with the O x axis, respectively. By the condition, the coordinates of the resulting vector along x and y are equal, since they are the sums of the same three numbers. Therefore, this vector, if it is not zero, is directed along the line forming an angle pi / 4 with the O x axis. But the direction of the sum of three vectors coincides with the direction of the vector forming an angle 2 alpha, since the other two are symmetric relative to it.Thus, 2 alpha=frac{pi}{4}+pi k, from which alpha=frac{pi}{8}+frac{pi k}{2}. Direct verification shows that all angles of the specified form fit.It remains to consider the case when the sum of three unit vectors is zero. It is easy to see that this is possible only if the angles between them are frac{2 pi}{3}, from which alpha=frac{2 pi}{3}+pi k or alpha=frac{4 pi}{3}+pi k.
