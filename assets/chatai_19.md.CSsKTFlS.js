I had a shot of rocephin and oral bactrim . Everything seemed to clear up. Then 2 weeks ago I came down with a cold/virus. I had some stomach upset and associated it with drainage until 5 days ago when I started chilling and having back pain . I went to an urgent care facility where they did a dipstick urinalysis . It came back normal. However, every day since, I have progressively felt worse. I have no appetite , intermittent severe back pain (like someone punched me), nausea, chills/sweats but no fever. I used an OTC UTI test strip that came back negative on nitrites and positive (trace) on leukocytes the first time and both negative the second. I still feel absolutely miserable. I did notice tonight 2 times tiny black specks in my urine. I ve not noticed this ever before. I know I need to see a dr and have an appointment set up already, but I have no insurance and am afraid that they will order multiple tests and it turn up I m just paranoid.

I must assure you that your concerns are well justified and you ought to keep your appointment with the doctor. Your symptoms could well be due to pyelonephritis (infection of the kidney). Unfortunately you will need to undergo urine culture, ultrasound of kidneys and some blood tests at the very least. I can understand your predicament since you donot have insurance cover, but if you donot get it sorted now the medical expenses of complications will only be higher! Good luck.

Ischaemic changes in the brain is quite common after a certain age in most hypertensives (people with high blood pressure). Without a detailed history of your dad's medical problems its not possible to attach significance or dismiss this MRI finding. The fact that he now has kidney faille puts him at high risk of cardiovascular problems like stroke, heart attach etc and he should be on an antiplatelet agent (e.g: Aspirin or clopidogrel) unless there is any contraindication.

Thanks for asking the question. As a young person with hypertension, you must be investigated for secondary causes of hypertension thoroughly. I hope your doctor(s) are doing it/ done it. You seem to have a lot of protein leak which needs to be quantified by a 24hour urine collection. Most common secondary cause of high blood pressure is due to kidney issues and I suspect you will need a kidney biopsy unless it has been already done. You donot have kidney failure yet since creatinine is still 1.09 (?mg/dl), so please donot panic. I am glad that you are rightly concerned about your health. The oxalate crystals are probably nothing to worry about and renal denervation is reserved for people with resistant essential hypertension (i.e all secondary causes ruled out and BP not controlled on at least 3 anti-hypertensives). Although you have not given me much information of the tests carried out till date, I suspect you have not been investigated completely. You can get back to me with the results of all tests done till date either here or on my website (docrambhat.com) and I will be able to advice you further. Best wishes.

Most people who reach Stage 5 CKD (kidney function less than 15%) face the dilema of choosing between the limited options confronting them. These are - Renal transplant, Haemodialysis, Peritoneal dialysis and Conservative treatment (letting nature take its course). The last option is opted by some elderly who are already frail from other medical problems. Transplant is by far the best option but availability of organ is the problem. Daily haemodialysis is the next best option but many find it quite tedious in the beginning to dialyse daily. 3 times a week haemodialysis and Peritoneal dialysis both stand jointly at third position. For those who chose Haemodialysis, FISTULA is by far the best option for many reasons (less infection, lasts longer, good flow and hence we can achieve better dialysis, etc). If forming a fistula is not possible due to various reasons, A-V GRAFT is next best and last come the CATHETER. I would definitely recommend a fistula as the first option. Best wishes.

From what you have mentioned in the question, you have longstanding low potassium, protenuria and have recently been diagnosed as CKD. There are various stages in CKD and it would be nice to know which stage you are in and what the latest actual eGFR reading is? Low potassium in blood could be due to various reasons and will need investigation especially if you are having symptoms.

Hop we get to propose solutions that would make your life somewhat better.Yes, exercise would greatly help with your cholesterol problems. If it should fail, then adding some drugs would be the next best option. In a good number of my patients, exercise and reduced fats intake greatly helps them and rarely do they need medications to stay controlled unless otherwise.From the urination stand point, I suspect you have urinary incontinence. The best thing to do at this time would be to empty your bladder as often as possible. I will suggest that you establish a urination schedule like every 2hours so as to always allow the bladder almost empty. This would ensure that nothing flows out when you laugh, sneeze, cough, etc. Also, your doctors should teach you how to practice kegel exercises to better control these symptoms.The kidney doctor would try to look for the cause of your problem and address them. He may also want to see what the impact on the kidneys has been. This would required a detail interview,, physical examination and some tests. Take some time and think of your symptoms, what provokes and aggravates them, any questions you may want to ask the doctor, etc so that you would not forget anything worth mentioning that would aid in your treatment.Please, also consider dropping a few pounds.

On the other hand, one of the easy tests to identify features of early kidney damage would be to get an estimation of urine microalbumin, preferably early in the morning. If this is normal, you are unlikely to have a major kidney problem. The mild increase in cortical echogenicity that was noted on scan earlier would then be an artifact, which can be followed up on ultrasounds periodically. irrespective of whether there is kidney problem or not, you can certainly restrict salt in your diet - usually the most helpful suggestion that we offer!Hope I have been able to help you."},{"Patient":"My 27 year old daughter is an Rn and has suffered with nausea, vomiting that just will not stop and severe pain.

If oral iron is not sufficing for what ever reason, you need i.v infusion, so dont delay, especially if your haemoglobin level is low. B complex suppliments can cause change in urine colour.

My question is, had a rt kidney biopsy a week ago today, she said the preliminary path came back with a lot of scarring of the tissues. Just to continue on wait and watch. I also have a complex cyst on that same kidney, that warranted an MRI but, cancelled due to lab work. What does the scarring suggest? Does that mean stage 5 or renal failure is rt. around the corner? What suggested sites should I be searching? Ty","Doctor":"Welcome to HCM dear. Thanks for the question. I would like to answer your question in two parts 1. Explanation of physical findings on biopsy -You may already know that each kidney contains about a million tiny filters (called nephrons). We all have damage to these filters after the age of 40years due to normal aging process. Some of us have excess damage due to various different conditions (diabetes, high blood pressure, genetic kidney disease, etc) The scarring (this is the term we use to explain to common man) that was seen on your kidney (I suspect it most likely means filters) is the end result of longstanding damage due to any cause. So, the scarring tells us that there is no active disease to treat now. The complex cyst in the kidney may/ maynot be related to the general ongoing slow damage to your kidney and MRI is the right way to assess any complex cyst.2. Functional status of your kidney -The staging (Chronic Kidney Disease stage 1 to 5) is based on blood test (creatinine and eGFR) and might not tally well with the physical findings of kidneys on scan or biopsy. Your nephrologist will monitor this regularly. Once eGFR goes below 15 we class patients as CKD stage 5. Dialysis or transplant usually become necessary when eGFR goes below 10.Hope the above clarifies your doubts."},{"Patient":"Dear  sir/madmeI am Mr Tong, my father has just passed away three wks ago,after the hernia surgery.The doctor said my father system got infected.Let me tell you something about my father 's health. He had got a renal failure, he was on the peritoneal dialysis for about 2 yrs or so. My father did very well with the dialysis procedures.he was very careful and hygenic. On 17 of August 2013 he 's got a tummy pain he took Paracetamol to relieve the pain, the pain had gone on and offand on Sunday 18 he still got pain and got a couple of vomit, so my mum recommend him to go to the hospital to check.The surgeon doctor found that he had got a hernia pain aroun his groin. He had to have surgery. I was told that the the surgery will take about 45 minuttes , but it ended up  6 hrs, because the surgeon had open another cut around his tummy, he suspected that the hernia pain may not be only one problem that causse the tummy pain.Before the surgery my father was due to do the peritoneal dialysis,but it delayed 2 hrs and he ended up doing the surgery without diong the dialysis.After the surgery my father was fine he even told me that all the pain disappeared. The doctor came to check and said everything was good and told my father tha t he can drink clear soup or drink if. He felt like to.On  Tuesday 20 August my father needs to do Hemo -dialysis , in the dialysis room he felt very cold and i was told by one of the nurses that it was quite normal.The Doctor had organised a CT scan to check if something was not right from the surgery. The result was fine.so the doctor called for a family meeting we was told that there was a bowel obstruction , the bowel was not working and there was bugs in my father's system and even told that the surivival reate was as low as 10%.and duto to my father was very old (73) and he was on the PD and also had two surgery it was very hard for to cope . He is very weak to fight the infection.The doctor suspected that the infection may come from the tube( for the hemo - dialysis), but the tube was not removed , until wednesday it was tested it was positive. So my father suffered the pain the whole Tuesday night and did not wake up on wednesday  , the doctor just gave him antibiotic and painkiller. He was in coma for a couple of day s and passed away on Saturday. During that period he still can breathed , he cant talk he can move his fingers when we asked him. But the doctor said he was already die they can do anything even he stiill breathed.My questions to you is that is there any handling error during the treatment or before the surgery?Was my father given the enough antibiotic(high dose)?If the tube was remove early and tested would it possible to save his life?If the surgeon did not open another cut around his tummy, will it reduce the pain?Thank you so much for ypur answers. I am looking forward to hearing from you.Best Regards,","Doctor":"Dear sir, my sincere condolences to you and your family. It is always hard to lose a near and dear. You have managed to give quite a bit of information about the circumstances around your dad's terminal illness and treatment, however in order to give a professional advice it is not sufficient.1. Firstly, when my peritoneal dialysis patients have pain in their abdomen, they see me (nephrologist) first rather than a surgeon. I usually thoroughly examine the patient and do multiple tests before I can identify the problem. Only when I identify a surgical problem do I call the surgeon. I hope all this happened in your dad's case.2. Subsequent to the initial operation, whatever complications ensued, it will be wrong on anyones part to comment on them without thoroughly studying your dad's case notes.Apologies for not answering your questions, but doing so will be inappropriate in my view.

From your history, it seems that you have a urinary infection which may originate anywhere from the kidney to the bladder. Urinary infection as you know will give rise to all the urinary symptoms what you have mentioned. In case of me being your doctor, I will advise you for a urine routine and culture/sensitivity test, and depending on the sensitivity I will also prescribe you some antibiotic apart from an alkaliser to relieve your stinging sensation.I am not aware of the situation for which your doctor has labelled you as being in high risk for renal failure.

The CT scan will give us some information about how your kidneys and gallbladder look. Are you having any white discharge per vagina which is contaminating the urine? Infection of the urinary tract is the most common cause of pus cells in the urine. Repeat the culture. If repeated cultures are negative and there is no kidney stone on CT scan, you will need tests to look for causes of 'Sterile pyuria'. Blood in stools is not due to gallstones nor urine infection - it needs further assessment.

Cortical cysts - cortical cyst or simple cyst are not clinically significant. it does not cause pain nor does it become cancer.  No need to be worried about this finding.3.

KIDNEYS: The left kidney is normal in it anatomical positions .There is moderate pelvicealyceal  system dilation .A 10 x 4mm echogenic  mass (stone) is also noted. CONCLUSION/IMPRESSION : Left Nephrolithiasis  with obstructive nephropathy .","Doctor":"Hi Mr IK ! Left nephrolithiasis with obstructive nephropathy means a stone in the urinary system may be in the pelvicalyceal system obstructing the flow of urine resulting in swelling of the drainage system of the urine. This might have caused pain in your left side kidney area for which you might have gone for an ultrasound. This is not a major problem as it is curable with some intervention by a qualified urologist. However, it should not be left untreated, as back pressure due to the obstruction of the urine outflow may cause damage to the kidney, and might land up in destruction of the kidney tissue. If it occurs in both kidneys, then renal failure may occur. I would advise you to consult a Urologist in your area at the earliest possible, and go as per his advice. Thanks and good luck."},{"Patient":"Hello Dr. Grief.

I have Bipolar 1 - diagnosed in 1974 and took Lithium until 2004 at which time my kidneys failed to excrete it and I had a build up. At that time started taking Seroquel XR (600 mg) and Zoloft . In 2008 my Internist found that I had goiters on my thyroid and enlarged hyperthyroid glands and had to have all that removed. Question: Would Lithium be safe for me now in light of the thyroid removal. I have gained 35 pounds on Seroquel and just cannot seem to be able to lose it. I did not have a weight problem on Lithium. I sleep (too much) on Seroquel, but I tried a lower dose and that did not work. I just seemed to be a happier, more outgoing, person on the Lithium. I did not sleep as well on the Lithium but a small doseage of Xanax, etc. could help that. My Question is really - could I tolerate Lithium now. I take Synthroid, potassium chloride , prilosec, Atenolol and Hydrothyazide in addition to Seroquel and Zoloft.","Doctor":"Long term lithium treatment leads to a slowly progressive loss of kidneys function which may be permanent.What do your tests show about level of kidney functions.

The 5 mm stone in left ureter has to be removed at the earliest and the hydronephrosis reduced. If the doctor decides, he may remove the 8 mm stone from left kidney at the same sitting.

This is the most fertile time in the menstrual cycle for a woman to conceive. The date of ovulation is usually constant at 14 days before the onset of periods. It is said that a couple should have sex regularly from one day before ovulation and until 4 days after it happens. This will increase the chances of getting pregnant.You must try again during your next cycle, the most fertile days would be staring 14 days from the expected onset of your next periods.There might also be other causes for you not getting pregnant like anti sperm antibodies in your cervix, non deposition of adequate amount of semen in your vagina, abnormal sperm production in your partner and any pelvic infection in you.Please discuss with your gynecologistHope this helps"},{"Patient":"both kidney are normal in size and parenchymal echogenicity . there is pelvocalyceal fullness,both kidneys . no lithiasis . no focal solid or cystic mass ... ureters-not visualized urinary bladder floating fine internal echoes.. pre void urine - 173 cc . post void urine 11 cc ... wanna know whats the really meaning of this im confused","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.I will explain your ultrasound findings in simple terms:1.

If most of your kidney is healthy (I do not know what do you mean by tiny cyst and how many of them is there), cysts are completely harmless and should not give any symptoms at all. You should have them under observation.Your WBC level can indicate an inflammation process or blood issue (like leukemia).

Stomach infection rather does not give symptoms for so long time.I suggest you to consult hematologist with your results.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"Saw a dr.

Palpitations may be due to AV block/Atrial fibrillation/VPC's /SVT's / Atrial Flutter. Its recommended to get an ECG, Electrocardiography and HOLTER monitoring for 48 hours done . If it comes Normal then you should look for systemic cause . Get Thyroid profile, serum electrolytes, CBC and renal Function test.

This can at times cause severe pain and colic, and therefore i suggest you get at least an X-ray taken and an ultrasound of your kidneys to find out if the stone has indeed disappeared from the kidney and ureter. If the stones are in the ureter and are stuck causing you severe pain, a stent might be required to be placed to relieve you of the discomfort. Sometimes some drugs also might help you have what we call 'medical expulsion of stones'."},{"Patient":"3 weeks ago had kidney stone bad kind bleeding burning drops of pee while erge to push i also got hives all over my body at this time then the pain stopped im not sure if i passed it or not . but 1 week ago i got some pressure below the rib cage an a cramp on left side with also a severe stomache ache er said i had acid reflux take some pepcid but didnt comment on the hives and i still have the stomache ach that is angered by some food water heat and very angered with alcohol oops but i still have the hives i dont have heart burn or burning in my throat just a stomache ach that controlls my life now an oh the hves that r reder when im hot .","Doctor":"Hi, it looks like you almost certainly had a kidney issue when you had your symptoms of bleeding with burning urination. This picture is usually due to a stone or infection, but the only way to know if you have indeed passed a stone or not is to get some minimum tests done like an ultrasound of your kidneys and bladder area along with an X-ray of the same area with a urine examination for any evidence of infection. On the other hand your hives are not likely to be due to the kidney problem, and if you have upper abdominal discomfort that gets worse with alcohol, you might have sever gastritis and try avoiding anything that exacerbates it like alcohol, coffee, spicy food. you can try using antacids and medications like Ranitidine but if things get worse, you might need an endoscopy."},{"Patient":"OK I have a 1cm hemangiolipoma in my right kidney (USN due in a month) I have what appears to be a small (2 cm?) blister like lipoma on my back.

These are usually seen as crops on face and the angiomyolipomas also are seen in both the kidneys in such patients. Without actually having had a look at the lesion on your back it will be difficult to predict what it could be, but it does not sound like a tuberous sclerosis lesion at present. Your being an RN  makes it easy for you to understand medical literature, and thus if at next USG, your doctor picks up an enlargement of the angiolipoma or if there are fresh ones, you should be concerned and discus with your urologist as to the next step.

There are classifications to say if a lump or cyst is worrisome. As you are passing blood in urine, a CT scan with contrast becomes a necessary investigation to know what exactly is present in the lump.In CT scan, we can say if a lump is having fat, fluid or muscle. Even the blood supply of the lump is best known though CT scan.Your doctor will discuss the CT scan report with you and tell if its something to really worry about.

A week after the surgery I had the stent removed. Later that night I passed a 3mm stone. A recent x-ray showed a stone in my right kidney and minute stone in my left kidney.

My BP is shooting up (160/105 - 170/110) after having stopped Arakamin (reducing over 48 hrs). I have already taken my full dose = Minipress XL 10 mg, Metolar XR 100 mg and Lotensyl 20 mg but the BP is not coming down. Have then taken 3 capsules Depin 10 mg (under the tongue ) one after the other (20 mins gap). BP came down to 145/100 but is again goin up. What should I do ?","Doctor":"Dear madam/ sir, welcome to HCM. At the outset I would like to warn you against using Depin under the tongue. It can unpredictably drop the BP drastically in some patients and lead to strokes and heart attacks. I rarely use clonidine (arkamine) now a days since we have much better agents. When I need to stop ark amine, I do it very slowly over weeks rather than days. It is notorious to cause rebound hypertension. Changing Metoprolol (Metolar) to Labetolol (100mg TDS) might help in your case to counter act the rebound hypertension. If you have fluid retention (swelling of feet), a small dose of loop diuretic (Lasix 20mg) might help controlling BP and the fluid retention as well. Moxonidine (0.2mg BD) would be my next choice if you are not having fluid retention. I would strongly recommend you to consult a friendly physician/ Nephrologist to guide your management rather than self medicate (even if you are a doctor yourself). I hardly know your entire case details and hence would not encourage you to blindly follow my advice. The gist of what I want to tell you are 1) Stay clear of sublingual Depin. 2) Do not self medicate. 3) There are lot many other options to control BP, so dont panic and lose heart. If you BP is not getting controlled after appropriate advice from a nephrologist, you will need further investigations."},{"Patient":"I AM END STAGE RENAL.

Your stone is quite big and the blasting procedure would require multiple sittings to completely get rid of the stone.

The blasting technique is associated with a small risk of pain during and after each procedure and a risk of infection but you do not require prolonged admission.On the other hand the surgical part will take care stone in one sitting but would require a lengthy admission.Hoping for the best.

Urinary bladder holds the urine that flows down from your kidneys (you may be knowing that). Hence, unless you have emptied your bladder by passing urine just prior to the scan, it is normal for it to be containing some urine and hence 'distended'. One or two odd 'simple' cysts in the kidneys are a normal feature and nothing to worry about. These two have noting to do with 'Fibromyalgia'. With regards to your other health issues (fibromyalgia in particular), it would help to know more about you and details of your symptoms and tests before giving any opinion. Best wishes.

Can you give me your feed back with what you think might be causing the Beta hemolytic Streptococcus.?? Thank you, Michele","Doctor":"Hi Michele, welcome to HCM. Thanks for giving lots of information in your question(s). Beta haemolytic streptococcus is a common bug causing upper respiratory infection. If you have urinary infection with it , its a bit rare. It spreads by areosols and quite a common bacteria. You do not have to worry about it as it is treatable. You can still have some blood in urine even after you have passed the stone some weeks ago. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids to prevent further stones. Your urine routine tests shows blood and protein which needs further investigation under a nephrologist locally (Kidney Biopsy). With regards to your thyroid, many people have multi nodular disease of the thyroid, however your tests don't suggest any sinister pathology which should worry you. You need follow up under a local endocrinologist to check you thyroid function. Best wishes. RB"},{"Patient":"my girlfriend has been in acute kidney failure since about March.

An exophytic cyst is a cyst that grows form the inside out.The prostate is also enlarged,this would be expected at age 82.Fatty liver and also deposits of fat in other parts of the body is treated by increasing physical activity and changing the diet.The  dietary changes actually involve reducing the use of carbohydrates which are eventually stored as fat.Your doctor may consider monitoring the cysts for any changes that may occur by repeated ultrasounds.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Sir I have been removed two stones of the size 12 mmm and 13 mm through open surgery from my right sided lower ureter in 2006. But again on 7th sep,2012 severe pain occured due to 11 mm stone In my right sided proximal ureter as revealed by ultrasound performed on 8th Sep,2012. So I consult the Hpmeo doctor who precribed Barbares volgerus Q and renal cure for 10 days. After 10 days on 18th Sep,2012 I also performed the altrasound again showing minimal right sided caliectasia and minimal fulness of calyces in right kidney . I have also used 2 oz of lemin juice with 3 spoons of tea olive oil during these days for two times. . Now I have minimal pain and burning in right side before and during urine excretion .Now please give me suggestions and tell me precautions.","Doctor":"Hello and thanks for your question. At the outset I must tell you that any stone over 5 mm is unlikely to come out spontaneously with medical management. I havenot read homeopathy or Ayurveda, however if I were you, I would not take chances. You are a stone former and since the stones keep recurring, you need to try your best to protect them. Any damage to your kidney during each of these episodes will remain and accumulate over time. So consult a good urologist first. You need a Plain CT KUB. We need to rule out infection as well (Urine culture). The above will guide management."},{"Patient":"My husband was a dialysis patient. He complained of back pain and laid down with a heat pad on his back. A couple hours later, He died in his sleep and there was vomit. Could that have been a heat attack. He had a history.

After 3 days of dialysis when blood tested found urea high in blood around 43. So once again got dialysis done. She is still in ICU. Dont know what to do. Doctors said she needs to come twice a week for dialysis. But before and after dialysis she gets so weak that she cant even open her eyes.Please Help Doctor","Doctor":"She is feeling weak after dialysis because they are removing too much fluid from her body during dialysis. Discuss with your doctor to see if removing less fluid or not removing fluid from her body will prevent her from feeling weak. In disease of kidney caused by pain killers used in rheumatoid arthritis, patient tend to pass a lot of urine compared to other patients and hence many a time only dialysis is required and little or no extra fluid needs to be removed during dialysis.If your mom has pain still discuss with your doctor if she will benefit from steroid and leflunomide. The chance of your mom recovering is high if the creatinine increase is recent. However for predicting chances of improvement more information is required. Discuss with your doctor if she will need a renal biopsy in the near future. It can predict recovery better than other tests. However if the kidneys are severely damaged and small biopsy is dangerous and treatment has to done without kidney biopsy.Wishing fast recovery for your mom.

You dont have to worry about the kidney especially if the kidney function tests are fine. Horse shoe kidney is a congenital anomaly and nothing to worry about atall.

What is the exact size of the kidneys on the USG scan? What does the urine tests show? What is important to establish is whether the kidney impairment has happened over past few days or months to years. I suspect your nephrologist has made that assessment and labelled her CKD (means kidney problem slowly DETERIORATING over may months or years). If her kidney problem is recent and there are active urinary sediments and urine protein, I would do a kidney biopsy (as long as kidneys are more than 8 cmd) to clarify the diagnosis and guide treatment. I have not studied other forms of medicine, so can't comment about them or the benefits of them.

At the very least it should not cause any harm. However if the Creatinine has jumped up so quickly, something is wrong here, and it might/ might not be the new medicines that you started.

You will need to consult your GP/ Family physician and get a few tests arranged first - Urine routine and culture (mid stream urine please) and Ultrasound of Kidneys and bladder (pre and post emptying the bladder) at the very least. Some people tend to develop bladder diverticulae or tend to retain some urine in bladder even after they think they have emptyed it. Any stagnant urine is a good culture medium for bugs! I am not sure what these lumps you mention are - best to check out with a gynaecologist. I dont want to just make some assumptions without examining some one and cause you to worry. It could be infection, warts, or something called endometriosis, or some thing else. Only after examination (and tests like a smear or biopsy) can we identify the problem. You have been with only one partner for past 10years but you are never sure of the other person are you!

I am afraid you need to be a bit more clear about the name of the blood test result and the value. If it is creatinine and the value is millimols, it seems normal.

There are instances where one sitting treatment might have been difficult and a stent is put in to decompress the kidney and the stone is treated after 2 weeks (not 2 months).

I started having heart palpitations about 8 years ago. I found I was unable to use anti-histamines because they would make them worse. Over the last year, they got much worse. I took caffiene, alcohol, and chocolate out of my diet. This summer I had some caffiene and it caused a rxn. of tachycardia , tremors, flushing, abdminal pain, headache, weakness in legs, and increased bowel movements, axiety. I had a full cardiac work-up done and was found to have PAC and tachycardia but was told it was benign. In october I started having spells of tacycardia when getting up to urinate at night (4x/night). when I would lie back down my heart rate would race. It would happen at random times during the day as well. I developed weak heavy legs, cramping in muscles. I had a massage which caused tremors in my arms and legs and a tachycardia (150BPM) that lasted 3 hours at the ER until I was given a Beta blocker . I had nausea, dizziness, visual trouble, tremors, weakness, anxiety, three bowel movements, increased urination, headache, Rushes of pain and pressure to my face, chest pain, abdominal pain. I was sent home with a prescription for Metroprolol. I continued to have symptoms and removed all chocolate, aged cheese, MSG and have continued to stay away from alcohol and caffiene. My initial 5-H1aa was slightly elevated but came down to normal next time and blood dopamine was slightly elevated. I had a full endocrine workup. Metanephrines slightly elevated initally but came down. All others still in normal range. Negative Thyroid, HIV neg., neg. mast cell disease, normal brain MRI. ruled out MS. I went to ER again in December with symptoms and he put me on lorazepam and told me I had hyperventilation syndrome. It helps my leg weakness and keeps me from having to urinate several times at night but now I am addicted to it. I have had R. flank pain for years and upper abdominal pain. Ultrasound showed polyps on gallbladder (at least one measuring 5 mm) and a cluster of milk of calcium cysts on my R. kidney. I find that I can not lie on my R. side without pain and increasing symptoms. I had accupuncture today and was placed on my stomach. by the end of treatment my bladder was full and when I went to get up, I was very dizzy and blurred vision in my L. eye. I had tremors. After 20 minutes I felt better. My primary care thinks it is anxiety, the neurologist says it is migraines which I have had for years but usually around my menstrual cycle, and the endocrinologist does not think it is a pheo or carcinoma because my urine and blood tests were not too high. I take 50 MG of Metroprolol and .5 mg of lorazepam in the morning and at night. I tried to switch to lexapro but one dose made me feel like I drank a bottle of wine and then had six espresso. I did not try it again. The meds are keeping my heart rate down and the lorazepam seems to help as well from keeping the episodes from getting too bad but I feel they are just treating the symptoms and not the cause. My doctor said she will check the polyp and cyst again in two years. My mentrual cycles have become much lighter for the last few months. All hormone tests were normal. I never suffered from anxiety in the past but whatever this is, it has caused me to develop it. I am not sure where to go from here. My blood pressure has always been low but when I have an episode it increases (160/98 being highest) while on beta blocker. Thanks for your help.

Later on, it was observed taht my BP is in teh range of 140/100, so the dosage was inreased as folows: Amolrad 10mg, Lorem 5 mg in morning and Amlogard 5mg, Lorem 5mg at night. I had been taking this dosage and my BP was normally 130/85-90 or at times it would be 140/90.

After few days of taking teh increased dose, I started observing swelling in my feet and increase in the girth of my legs. I was concerned and so again visited the doctor.

I ve been experiencing left side pelvic radiatng to the back, feeling it sets into my hip. Sharp pain lasting hours and always diahrea with bad pain for days and dull pain almost always. After an E.R. visit they found a cyst on my left ovary and a kidney stone from a CT scan . I passed the stone a few weeks later, but still experiencing pain. i had an ultrasound done, and they found the complex cyst 4.5 cm still there 2 months later. Pain continued, now in the 4 month.

They asked if I could feel it, and I can, larger than a quater. They asked if I have pain sitting, walking. Well, I have a bubble butt with lots of cushion, so I don t feel discomfort sitting. But, after thinking about it I have experienced what I thought was a bruised tailbone NUMEROUS times.

Also, this stent may harbour bacteria, so you have to take antibiotics, if fever is there, then higher antibiotics are needed.Yes, you should drink that amount of water so that at least 2-3 liters of urine is voided in 24 hrs & not more than that.Take antispasmodics, analgesics, antibiotics with your Urologist's opinion.Follow up with him for stent removal & further management.Wish you a good health.Take care.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi.

FIRST- Its highly unlikely that you might have got pregnant if you had sexual contact/ contact with sperms 3 days prior to your regular period date. So the big question to answer is 'did this odd period much earlier than anticipated'?

Based on  these we can arrive at a diagnosis. Certain conditions can be treated with medication alone. Some othera may need surgery like cutting an extra nerve bundle, if present (that causes the high heart rate) or Inserting a pace maker if the heart block is severe enough to cause significant hemodynamic changes. The treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and disorder and other medical conditions you may have.Coronary artery disease may also lead to these problems and needs to be ruled out. An angiogram may be necessary. You will probably need blood thinners to prevents clots traveling to vital organs (due to the arrhythmia) to prevent strokes.

It has been about the right time in my head to start getting into the lighter less frequent periods. At the end of February 2013 I started to get pregnancy like symptoms. I went to the doctor had a test, came back negative, but I did have a UTI . I have finished my antibiotics, but in the last few day I have been feeling even more nauseous, in fact I have been vomiting everything I had to eat or drink within 20 minutes of consumption. Today I had gone into the doctor for sever back pain and vomiting. The only 2 times I have ever gotten so sick in my life was when I was pregnant with my daughter (2yrs old now). And last year when I was found with gallbladder issues that resulted in the removal of it. Today they rules out kidney stones with a CT and took a urine sample, stating that it looked clean they sent me on my way with pills to help me with my nausea. Now I have the frequent urge to urinate still, I still feel sick to my stomach even with the pills they gave me but not as badly so I was finally able to keep my food down (so far). The pain in my back is centered in my mid-upper left side and slightly radiates down my back to my upper hip area. I have less fear of being pregnant now since I have gone to the doctor and they ruled that out for a UTI. But I am still concerned since I read someplace that the implant should not cause frequent trips to the bathroom. And since they took my urine today and said it looked clean and that they couldn t find anything wrong with the symptoms described to them, I am slightly fearful that there is an underlying infection that was missed or that the test could have been wrong. My mother went 3 blood tests before they said she was pregnant with me and just recently my sister did a similar thing and did not find out she was pregnant until she was 25 weeks along. Even after countless tests. I have been on antibiotics twice since having been intimate with my boyfriend, at the beginning of the year for a viral infection and then just recently for the UTI. I know some antibiotics makes some birth controls less effective but I have read that they shouldn t not interfere so much with the implant. With my family history of false negatives and the rule out of another UTI or kidney infections , with the feelings that I have been having could they just be side effects of the implant? Or is there possibly something that was over looked? And if it is the cause from the implant, would removal of it be in my best interest? Because the back pain and nausea are getting in the way of me spending time with my little one as much as I would like to.","Doctor":"Hi, implants will have side effects, like you have stated, but what ever the alternative you opt may have the same problems. The other possibilities are peptic ulcer, or hepatitis. So i advise you to consult a gastro enterologist for diagnosis and treatment.

In general all analgesics have adverse effects on kidney function and are not indicated in kidney disease. Toradol also belongs to the family of analgesics that inhibit vasodilatory substance called as prostaglandins to elicit its action. Inhibiting such vasodilatory agent will further reduce your kidney function. Although such medications are contra-indicated, under unavoidable conditions such as yours (fore-mentioned inflammatory conditions) sporadic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDS) may be used but only under medical supervision. I will advice you to consult your primary physician for any use of analgesics. Regardless of any choice of pain killers please increase the amount of fluid intake and avoid any consumption of alcohol. Lastly, please make sure that your physician knows about all medicines you are taking, even over-the-counter medications.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I am 70 years old, just told that I have a 2cm spot on right kidney. basically good health weigh 220 and active around my property.

Does the pain come on taking a deep breath at all? If so this is a 'Pleuritic lower chest pain' and you may be having a chest infection. If not, it might well be coming from the kidneys.

You are one of the rare few who has provided all the important details! I suspect you are a healthcare worker yourself. You are right in that your sister needs to see a nephrologist (not urologist) ASAP. She needs to have a 24hour urine protein estimation and possibly a renal biopsy for diagnosis. The two differential diagnosis here are IgA Nephropathy and Post Infectious Glomerulonephritis. Only a biopsy can differentiate the two or clarify if the problem is something totally different. I am very wary of doctors treating emperically with steroids without proper diagnosis. We can prognostigate only if we have a biopsy confirmed result. However if the protenuria has settled already, we are in a dilema whether to biopsy or not?? Dont waste time and see a nephrologist pronto. I dont know who is near you at Varanasi, you will have to find out. Feel free to come back with any more quiries.

I had cystoscopy and laser removal with placement of a stent on Nov. 15th. My initial six-week ultrasound after surgery showed some hydronephrosis . Because I was still experiencing pain, I had a CT scan with dye done. The swelling has gone down, but I am still experiencing pain. THe urologist said I need to see my general practitioner.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.You have got your kidney stone treated by laser and subsequent stent placement.It is natural for the 6 week ultrasound to show some residual hydronephrosis if your stone was big and present for some time. You did the right thing in getting CT scan abdomen with contrast done. I suppose the hydronephrosis as seen on CT scan has improved from before.Since nothing is mentioned about removal of stent, I consider it is still in place. Your persisting pain might be due the upper portion of the stent touching the renal pelvis and upper part of ureter. It can also be due to some small infection.Routine urine examination for red blood cells and urine culture and sensitivity may be done for further treatment by your doctor.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I am 24 years old, I went into hospital 2 weeks ago and was diagnosed with PID and severe kidney Infection . I was on morphine and tramadol because the pain was so bad and anti biotics. They have sent me home but the pain is still bAd. My GP has prescribed me oramorph to take with tramadol 4x a day but it makes me feel sicker and more tired than I already do and the tramadol isnt touching it. Could I ask for a similar alternative that I don t have to take as often?","Doctor":"Hi young one. My sympathies with you. Pain from kidneys can be quite bad and difficult to control. If the pain is not settling, I would be keen to rule out persisting infection in the kidneys first. I usually give a longer course (atleast 2 weeks) of antibiotic if the kidneys are involved with infection (we call it pyelonephritis). If the infection is limited to the urinary bladder you may nott need such a long course. So, most importantly contact your nephrologist/ urologist and ensure they have ruled out persisting infection. With regards to pain medication, I strongly recommend you take 1 (one) gram Paracetamol every 6 hours along with either tramadol or morphine (not both together). Take regular anti-emetics (eg: perinorm 10mg TDS) as well. Both kidney infection and the pain killers can cause nausea and vomiting separately. Hope this helps.

The wet read yesterday is not a full diagnosis yet, but the nurse stated that fatty deposits were seen in my kidneys. What does this mean?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.When CT scan of abdomen (kidneys included) is done, the scan also is taken for the lower areas of chest and the lung bases. I think pneumonia was diagnosed in this manner.Coming to the kidney growth, fat deposition can occur in some tumors of kidneys like lipoma or angiomyolipoma. The nature of such growth needs to be accurately evaluated and your doctor will write this in your report.In most patients, fat deposition in kidneys is a benign condition, however the confirmation depends on correct description and may also require a kidney biopsy.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I had lithotripsy a month ago and had a ureter stent placed on the left side.

I am scheduled for another lithotripsy on my right kidney, but will have the stent removed and will not have another one for that side for which I am grateful. Can the stent cause all of these problems?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing.In most patients with kidney stones, a metallic stent is placed to give passage to the multiple small stone fragments to pass into the urinary bladder and then out of the urinary tract. Stents used generally are double J stent with hook like curves at both the ends.Sometimes, these ends of the stents slip downwards into the upper ureter to cause slight injury or the end in the bladder can cause bladder wall injury. Most injuries are slight but can cause severe pain to the patients.Also the smaller stone fragments can cause pain as they pass through the ureter.So what you think is right, stents and smaller stone fragments, both can cause pain.Hoppe this helps."},{"Patient":"I am a 17 year old girl who is having some unusual problems.

We are here to help you, so dont worry about not being able to pay! What you describe suggests some kind of block at the level of mid/ lower ureter. The urine produced in the kidney comes down via the ureter (tubes connecting kidneys to bladder) to the bladder. If there is some kind of partial block in the ureter there will be back pressure on the kidney and the kidney pelvis and proximal part of ureter appear full/ dilated. The heterogenous opacification in the renal pelvis (part of kidney where the urine collects before draining into ureter) could be due to infection/ blood clot/ growth etc. This needs to be looked into by a urologist. Good luck."},{"Patient":"My foster mother passed on two days ago. She has been suffering lung problem for a while now and the legs were really swollen. Is the swelling a result of lung or kidney problem? Before she passed on she was fine and healthy. A day before she died she was strong and energetic and even ran her errands but she started experiencing blood coming from the nose and when she was coughing blood came from the mouth. The morning following, there was still bleeding but this time it was more. She got tired and could not walk, she was laid in bed to rest and suddenly she stopped breathing and she was gone.

Swelling of the legs can result from medical conditions related to any of the four organ systems - Lungs, heart, kidneys or liver. Its only after careful assessment including examination and tests that we can tease them out.

Since then till October 2012 I was on the same medicine untill I started having a symtom of shortlessness of breath. I complained this to another doctor and he asked me to taper the dosage to 12.5 mg. Since then I am on Prolomet 12.5 mg. I tried to quit it somedays back but it resulted in increased BP (140/95).

People with Mitral Valve prolapse are known to have heart rhythm disturbance (leading to palpitations) and heightened anxiety (related or unrelated to palpitations). Beta blockers are the treatment of choice for this and has beneficial effects (and not deleterious) on the heart. It does not affect the kidneys. I hope you have also had 24hour or 7 day continuous monitorinsince you are ong of your heart tracing to look for heart rhythm disturbance in the past. If you dont have any symptoms now (since you are on prolomet) you dont have to have heart trace monitoring now if not already done).You are young with high BP and hence would require a through investigation for secondary hypertension.

This can be decreased by ureteric catheter placement that gives the surgeon the advantage of facilitating intraoperative ureter identification and assisting in immediate injury recognition and repair.Also this decision is controversial because of fear of ureteric damage during catheter insertion and postoperative urinary complications such as obstructive oliguria and urinary tract infection.I suppose there has been little injury to the urinary tract due to the stent placement in your father during surgery.

I have been having a lot of skipped beats and extra beats and feels like pauses to me. I recently wore a holter monitor and it showed up 306 skipped beats and extra beats in groups of three at 231bmp and one pause for 2.1 seconds. I wrote in my diary exactly at the time it showed this, so it was what I was feeling. But when I visited the cardiologist he tried to tell me that it probably was an electrode that came loose or just a reading that wasnt correct due to the heart monitor. I take tenormin and have been on it for about 28 years. I have had the svt for a long time and have know about the mvp for several years, and was told at the emergency room one time that I had the atrial septal aneurysm and that it needed to be evaluated with a tee scope. The heart dr didn t even tell me about it whenever he did the echo test, and I found out like I said, whenever I visited er.","Doctor":"Hi, Look atrial aneurysms can be picked by echocardiography. If you are so stressed then undergo TEE. Secondly, 360 missed beats are too much and it may be due to artefact or electrode misplacement. Secondly, you are taking atenolol so lesser chances of extra beats. Just keep a check on your blood pressure, sugar level. Avoid tea, coffee, alcohol or any stimulant drug. Avoid undue physical or mental exertion. Try relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises whenever you feel extra beats. Hope I have answered your query.

Is this something I should consider and speak to my urologist about considering my situation?","Doctor":"Hi, Many thanks for the query!You need to do certain basic investigations first, which include-USG (KUB), Urine routine & microscopy, Sr. creatinine, Sr. uric acid.Blood in urine is usually due to Ca-oxalate stones having spikes on their surface causing mechanical trauma to mucosa of urinary tract & bleeding.Pain is due to spasms of the ureter to get rid of the stone by more frequent & powerful contractions to propel it out.Also as you have recurrent stones, do- Metabolic workup of 24 hrsurine sample, Sr. PTH, Sr. Calcium.As per the reports, appropriate diet instructions can be given & if Sr. uric acid is raised, Uric acid synthesis inhibitors like allopurinol can be started.Along with thiazide diuretics, you need to take Potassium Magnesium citrate, also take urine alkanizing agents with your Urologist's opinion.Take symptomatic treatment as per Urologist's opinion till you get your investigations done, viz. Plenty of oral fluids, anti-spasmodics, urinary alkalinizing agents, pain killers.5 mm & 2 mm stones need not be removed surgically, they will come out with above medicines.Wish you a good health.Take care.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi. doctor , I have a stone in my kidney about 12 mm size and i showed to one urologist he said he will check through laser and destroy it. I AM afraid i told him to give medications instead of surgery . He gave me medicines like MagAsorb(2 tablets twice daily) with No-URIC(1 tablets 2 times daily). My advice is that do it really help with this medications. I have heard of systone(himalaya) do this will help easily with enough water to pass by. Pleasem, advice.... THANKYOU very Much","Doctor":"Hi, many thanks for the query!In our body, each kidney is connected to urinary bladder bya separate narrow tube called \\"ureter\\". A stone in kidney has to passthrough this narrow ureter to reach bladder & from there throughanother narrow tube called \\"urethra\\", it comes out.Your stone size is 12 mm but diameter of ureter is smaller enough not to allow this stone pass out.So, some day it will be stuck in the ureter, this will block the urine outflow & urine will start accumulating in ureter just behind the stone (obstruction) & further will accumulate in kidney causing back pressure changes in the form of hydronephrosis/hydroureter, compromising kidney function gradually.We want to prevent all these complications.So, it is advisable to get that stone removed surgically.You can get it removed either by PCNL or ESWL or RIRS.If the stone is of hard variety (Ca-oxalate) then ESWL should not be done.Inspite of all this, if you want to give a try at medicines, take anti-spasmodics, diuretics, K-Mg citrate with your Urologist's opinion.Drink plenty of water so that at least 2 litres of urine is voided in 24 hrs.If your luck is at its peak, it may come out.Do- follow-up USG KUB, RFT, Urine (R/M).Wish you a good health.Take care.Regards."},{"Patient":"my mother is a CKD patient and has undergone the transplant surgery on 20th march ,i.e almost 10 days back . she was having seviour back pain and a hip joint was also hurting alot . for that dr sugested a durajesic patch 50mg . and her electrolytes are also imbalances . now she is dignosed with paralytic ileus . yeaterday dr put a rice tube thre her nose n still there is no improvent . please sujjest rreatement for releafe asap .","Doctor":"Hello,Your doctor is giving the right treatment for your mother.Electrolyte imbalance results in paralytic ileus resulting in intestinal obstruction.Standart treatment requires a ryle's tube in stomach and electrolyte restoration.Once the electrolyte imbalance is restored your mother shall be relieved of her paralytic ileus.Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am an 83 year old woman, who has been bothered by kidney problems.

This really depends on how his kidneys are functioning. This can be determined by finding out his urine output in a day and also specialised tests like 44 hour creatinine clearance test.

It will identify the type of stone in the urinary tract and presence/ absence of urinary tract infection.If there is any evidence of infection, an urine culture needs to be done.Appropriate antibiotics need to be given after getting the culture report.A pevic ultrasound will help to identify any structural abnormality of the urinary tract.Some structural abnormalities cause recurrent stone formation.A cystogram/ dynamic bladder study is next investigation. This investigation will pick up the cause of urinary retention (if present) and hence recurrent stone formation.After diagnosing the cause of recurrent stone formation, treatment has to be done.Treatment depends on the size and site of the stone.It may be through lithotripsy, nephrostomy or open surgery.If the kidney is damaged to a large extent (hydronephrosis- dilated and damaged kidney) it may have to be removed.Consult an urosurgeon for further management.Thanks and take careDr Shailja Puri Wahal"},{"Patient":"I have constant pain sometimes a stabbing pain down my right side and round the front under my rib cage.

The history given by you regarding itching seems to be more of an allergic reaction only, as you yourselves said.Itching is a late symptom in kidney disease and rarely a presenting symptom, as is your fear.In allergic reactions swelling does reduce early  and itching persists for a longer time.           As I see,there is no reason for you to be anxious as of now.You can relax.Further investigations including renal function tests and Ultrasound scan of abdomen may give confirmation.

That time she was not experiencing any problem. Doctor told to let it there and suggested some do s & don ts. Yesterday, she had severe pain in her lower right abdomen.

Thanks in advance!","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for using HCM.Q. what are the options for her kidney removal with minimal surgery?Shock wave lithotripsy. It uses sound waves to create strong vibrations (shock waves) that break the stones into tiny pieces that can be passed in your urine. This can cause moderate pain, blood in the urine and discomfort as the stone fragments pass through the urinary tract. If not successful then surgically can remove stone using small instruments inserted through a small incision in your back. Discuss with your doctor for the same. Hope I answered your question.

I didnt get my period in. March..am about 14days late... i feel like i will get on my period w/cramps and back pain but it dsnt come?..Is it normal for ur body to skip cycles when gettingof loestrin fe","Doctor":"Hi and thank you so much for this query.I am sorry to hear you have not been able to have your menses regularly. I feel happy that you are taking control of your reproductive life by practicing contraception. Congrats and keep up.Hormonal contraceptives impose an external control mechanism of the menstrual cycle. This is why it is very important for it to be used correctly and consistently. When you stop, then predicting the eventual sequences of events becomes very difficult. I do understand why you stopped and that is totally acceptable.  It is normal to expect alterations during breaks in pills consumption.Bleeding on  loestrin fe occurs when you stop taking the hormonal pills and start with the ferrous tablets. This is called withdrawal bleed and represents your menses. What i will suggest now is that you patiently wait for the next cycle so as to restart the pills as prescribed to get the cycle well controlled again.In the mean time, please take good care of your sexual habits to avoid any pregnancy as you are not covered by your contraception. Also, contraception prevents against pregnancy and not infections, so always consider using a protection during intercourse.I hope this answers your query and provides useful information for you to act on. I wish you good health.Dr. Ditah, MD"},{"Patient":"I'm having lots of pressure in my cervix area while im just about done peeing. and my bladder is always feeling completely full to the point it hurts.. i went to the ER thinking that maybe i have a UTI or Kidney Infection and they told me lab results came fine NO UTI NO KIDNEY INFECTION.

You haven't mentioned the size of this lower ureteric stone but it must be larger as it is stuck there causing back pressure changes, so less likely to pass out with medicines.You need to do- Sr. creatinine to know the current kidney function, Sr. Uric acid so that treatment for that can be started, Urine (R & M), USG (KUB).Take anti-spasmodics, pain killers, diuretics, urine alkalinizing agents, potassium-magnesium citrate, allopurinol (if sr. uric acid is raised) with your doctor's opinion.Drink plenty of water so that 3 litres of urine is voided in 24 hrs.Wish you a good health.Take care.Regards."},{"Patient":"In September I had total pelvic reconstructive surgery with a complete hysterectomy .

X ray Lumbar spine shows instability: Means there is some little problem in your in maintaining the back posture.2. KUB 3 cysts in the left kidney: The cysts size is not mentioned.

This may require treatment with anti fungals in tablet or cream (cream is difficult to apply in your condition).Your doctor will give you anti fungals to take for a while.Your husband may not be infected if he has a good immunity.

What could be the remedy?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM.Thank you for your query.Let me first shed light on the rules of treating an infection, more specifically a urinary tract infection.As you experienced a return or relapse of symptoms as soon as you got off your antibiotics the reasons for the same could be the following:-Inadequate dosage used to treat the infection (a stronger dosage should have been advised)-Inadequate duration of use (should have been continued for a longer duration as infection was clearly still prevalent)-Inappropriate antibiotic used (the antibiotic used was not good enough to treat the infection)In such cases, a urine culture should be conducted (which was done) and one of the most effective antibiotics should be selected to treat the condition, for an adequate amount of time with an appropriate dosage.Now coming to the presence of a colony of 50,000. If you are not on the antibiotic, this colony count is only going to multiply and increase which would most certainly result in an infection again. If the antibiotic used was effective, the urine culture should have not reported any colonies or infection-causing organisms at all.I hope all this is clear. It is quite evident what has to be done. Please re-visit your doctor or another one, and select an antibiotic which is susceptible to your infection, and re-initiate a course of at least 7-10 days, and discontinue only once a repeat urine test has reported the absence of an infection.I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for.

I am contact our senior vice president of benefits to find out why I can't get this drug. My calcium is at 11.4% and I am really afraid.  Thanks.","Doctor":"Dear user, obviously you were suffering from chronic kidney disease. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is one of the common manifestation of CKD. In this condition your parathyroid gland becomes overactive and level of PTH hormone increases which ultimately raises your Serum calcium level (normal level 8.5-10.2 mg/dl). usually patient does not have any symptoms but sometimes he may feel itching, fatigue and bone pain due to bone loss (as seen in your case). Sensipar is given to suppress the parathyroid gland and lower the calcium level when patient is on dialysis. This drug is not approved for use when patient is not on dialysis.Secondary hyperthyroidism gets corrected after kidney transplant and serum calcium come back to normal level. But sometime it may not happen and and hyperparathyroidism persists, a condition called tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Remember, Excessive use of Sensipar may lower serum calcium too much causing life threatening side effects such as  heart arrhythmias and seizure (convulsions), far more seroius than itching and bone loss.So it needs close monitoring of serum calcium, phosporus and PTH levelIn your case I would suggest complete work up of serum calcium, phosporus and PTH level and consultation with Nephrologist for further course of actionI hope I have simplified the information enough for you to understand."},{"Patient":"Hello, I have been diagnosed with \\"ankylosing spondylitis\\".

On the left side there is a 14mm long axis exophytic cortical cyst. The left kidney is slightly smaller in overall size when compared to the right with a long axis measurement of 8.4 cm compared to 11.2 on the right. This suggest atrophy.","Doctor":"hi,thank you for your query.The renal cortex is the outer portion of the kidney between the renal capsule and the renal medulla. It forms a continuous smooth outer zone in the adult which extends down between the pyramids. It contains the renal corpuscles and the renal tubules except for parts of the loop of Henle which descend into the renal medulla. It also contains blood vessels and cortical collecting ducts.The renal cortex is the part of the kidney where ultrafiltration occurs.now the thinning of renal cortex as in your case in the left kidney is due to a cyst(fluid filled swelling) which is exophytic (from outside).measuring 14mm it is a big cyst which is causing compression of the cortex (outer zone) this leads to to atrophy (loss of tissue). hence the size of the left kidney is smaller than the right one.hope the explanation answered all of your questions,thank you,wishing you good health"},{"Patient":"After a stint was inserted into my left tube from kidney to bladder to allow fluids to bypass a stuck kidney stone, I was discharges with a visual small amount of blood in urine.

Thanks for  being with us. There are two main types of kidney insult 1.acute 2.chronic. This can be easily distinguished if you have previous serum creatinine levels.If previous creatinine levels were normal and you have been started  with new onset symptoms like fever,abdominal pain,oliguria,burning or pus in urine or any new drugs has been started for other reason then it could be an acute kidney injury. Acute kidney injury can be successfully treated but this problem may be the start of chronic renal failure. If you are suffering from any chronic illness like hypertension,diabetes,poly cystic kidney disease,renal artery stenosis and your serum creatinine levels were high last time also then its likely to be a chronic renal failure. There are lots of causes of acute and chronic kidney failure hence its better to have an urgent nephrologist opinion as creatinine of 10.4 can be life threatening,may lead to complications like hyperkalemia,azotemia,uremia and you may need dialysis too. If you could have provided other lab findings like hemoglobin level,calcium,phosphorous,usg of kidney bladder ureter,blood pressure and sugar levels then i could have answered in more detail. Anyways your further queries are most welcome and wish you better health ."},{"Patient":"My wife is 19 years out from kidney trnaplant and taking Neoral.

I've been on adderall for at least 10 years, and only just started getting the stones about 2 years ago. But since then they're very frequent.  However, when I went off adderall I noticed they lessened significantly, and have already increased tenfold in the week since I started taking it again. When I was off adderall,  I was off for about 6 months. One stone was analyzed and the results were indeterminate origin, or something similar to that, I can't remember the exact way it was phrased. The first stone I had was excruciating, however,  after that, the others don't seem to be as painful, even though sometimes they do look bigger. I don't know if this is a sign of something bad either, but I hope not.A year ago, my kidneys were tested and were functioning fine, despite the stones.I hope you can put all this info together and maybe help me out a bit.I will talk to my doc in June,  but right now I'm out of the country and would just like some quick advice! Thanks!Katie","Doctor":"Greetings !Welcome to the site.Well it is unlikely for Adderall to be the reason behind your kidney stones since it is not associated with this as a side effect. The fact that after discontinuing Adderall you noticed a decrease in the frequency of stone formation could be best described as a chance finding as kidney stone formation in the body is very random and not dictated by any regular timing / interval and so this very nature of kidney stone formation justifiably explains the frequency decline which coincided with Adderall withdrawal.So to summarize---- Adderall is unlikely to be the cause for your kidney stone formation.-- You shall continue taking Adderall as per the guidance of your doctor.-- As for kidney stones you should keep yourself well hydrated by drinking lots of fluids including water, lemonade, cranberry juice, coconut water.I hope this allays your dilemma regarding Adderall's effect on your condition.Wish you all the best.Regards.."},{"Patient":"I'm a 47 year old male, and had CABG surgery last May.

I think he is still weak because he's body is still recovering from the trauma of the surgery and being 80 years of age would surely affect the recovery period. You may want to look into physical therapy to strenghten muscles and hasten recovery. Vitamin c once daily would also be helpful in recovery.

Also around the mesh barrier I have severe flank pain where my left kidney is, my white cell count was silted elevated and they said my liver wasn't doing great. If my kidney backing up doesn't show on test what else can they do to see what is wrong with my kidney. I'm very in tune with my body. I knew I had pneumonia I told the doctors, I was right!

It is obvious that you have uterus problem which referred the symptoms to other sites in spite of my expectation to hear from you about gynecological problems but you didn't. We can say your problem of previous pain was due to the uterus tumour which was relieved by hysterectomy. But now, you may have another problem despite the similarity in complain. So, now you have to rescan the kidney and do urinalysis to rule out the stone or gravels ..etc. If these problem is not renal, it may be neurological in the form of herpes zoster or it may be myositis or panniculitis which are simply treated.

Currently your mother's blood pressure and heart rate are still withing the normal range but on the lower end of it. Typically pacemakers are implanted because of either low or irregular heart rate, and they frequently require adjustment of their rate after the initial implantation.

The best thing to do right now if your mother is presenting symptoms of tiredness and lightheartedness is to interrogate the pacemaker and see whether increasing the pacing rate has any beneficial influence of her.

It is painless procedure which requires multiple sittings on a urology clinic, in which very small shock waves (ultrasonic) are given externally using a lithotripsy machine.The machine will break the stones into multiple pieces which will coming out with the urine, and doctor will advice you some pain killers and plenty of fluids to drink.take careregardsDr Hari Om ChandrakarMBBS"},{"Patient":"hi  doctormy ct scan are( both kidneys are normal in size, shape and position. normal excretion of contrast medium is noted from both kidneys . no obstructive lesion identified. normal urinary bladder wall thickness , no ston/ mass is seen.rest of abdomen is unremarkable.  mild dilatation of the calyceal system with delayed pyelogram is appreciable)- i go to the bathroom many time in the day- i dont have any bain in kidney- my blood test is normal- bun 5.5        2.5-6.4  mmo1/l- crea 95       53-115  umo1/l-k     4.2         3.5-5.1 mmo1/l-c1  101        98-107 mmo1/l-na   153    132-145   mmo1/lphos 1.62    0.81-1.58  mmo1/l-urca   42    34-50     umo1/lwhat is wrong with me doctor ?why is mild dilatation of calyceal in both kidnys?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM.

Donors can be living individuals or cadavers (people who voluntarily donate organs after death).The detailed information about donor status, the waiting period and cost can be obtained directly from the centres performing kidney transplant.To name a few centres performing kidney transplant in India are- Appolo group of hospitals, KMC Manipal, AIIMS New Delhi, PGIMER Chandigarh, SGPGIMS Lucknow, Tata Memorial Hospital Mumbai,Chennai transplant centre and CMC Vellore.It is not possible to quote the exact cost of the procedure but it will cost few lakhs in Indian currency.The graft is not sold but the cost includes the expertise required for the procedure and the drugs used in the post operative period.Post operatively, the patient has to be kept on strict follow up to look for any feature of graft rejection.Repeat renal biopsies may be required for the procedure.So, it is advisable to get operated at a center where you can easily fly from Dubai frequently.Thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"Writing for a family member- kidney transplant recipient needs root canal-was told insurance would cover it-sent forms back & forth between dentist & transplant coordinator two or three times now-each time told a different form needs filled out or more complete info. is needed as to why root canal is necessary for transplant sustainability & retention .

A 5mm stone would have around 70-80% chance of spontaneous passage and it will increase slightly with the medicines that you are taking. Waiting time for spontaneous passage would be 2 weeks. The pain in the lower part of your abdomen means that your stone is on it's way down to the bladder. The pain is caused by the contraction of the muscles in the ureter (tube that connects the kidneys to the bladder) pushing down the stone.If you feel that the medicines are not working or you still have severe pain you might need an emergency endoscopic removal of the stone.

One of the causes of plueritic chest pain is Pneumothorax, in which air escapes from the lung into the chest cavity. The simultaneous occurrence of pneumothorax and Kidney cyst may point towards Birt-Hogg-Dubbe syndrome. The kidney involvement in this syndrome is development of cysts and tumours, Lung involvement causes Lung cyst which cause air leak into the chest ( Spontaneous Pneumothorax) and Skin involvement causing various benign (non-cancerous) tumors. Its advisable to do Chest X-ray to confirm Pneumothorax and consult your doctor for genetic test of this syndrome.

I have had a swollen prostate but it wasn't bad the last time I had it checked 3 months ago could it be connected thank you.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM.Thank you for your query.I can understand your concern. The kidney area you are referring to could in fact point towards a kidney, condition, but could also be due to other structures lying in the same region. Your bowels could be inflamed or irritated, which could have resulted in the blood in your stools. Fresh blood in the stools indicates a lower gastrointestinal (GIT) bleed, and will have to be looked into. Causes could be hemorrhoids, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcers, polyps, diverticulitis, etc.I would also request you to undergo another pelvic ultrasound to visualize and grade your prostate, and if required even a digital rectal examination. If your prostate is indeed enlarged, it could be compressing the urethra that could cause retention/stagnation of urine, that could result in the kidney pain and even infections. Although this cannot explain the blood in your stools.To find out what the chunks you observed in your stool are, you will have to give your stool for analysis to the laboratory. This could be undigested food, parasites, etc.It is difficult to tell without viewing them or analyzing them in the laboratory. I thus request you to visit your doctor and go about all the above mentioned investigations.I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for. Please feel free to write back to me for any further clarifications. I would gladly help you.Best wishes"},{"Patient":"27 yr old girl. Urine protein 4+, serum albumin 2.3 .

The most common causes for pitting edema are : heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease and low protein levels.Klebsiella can cause different type of infections including urinary tract infections. There may be resistance to some of the antibiotics choosen.The initial antibiotics should be choosen out of those that are less likely to have an issue with resistance. This would include medication such as ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, gentamycin, quinlones ( ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin). In this circumstance where the disease process is complicated these would be best and should be used for 14 to 21 days.If there was no history of loss of protein and edema then a simpler antibiotic regimen would have been suggested.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hii, Hope everybody is fine..I get liquid in my penis when its erected, also I get pain in kidney when i get erected.Liquid comes when the penis is hard.

My heart rate is about normal(52-55 per minute), but it skips and then races. I have been incredibly tired, and when this happens, I get a slight rush when the heart beat resumes. I also just realized that I have a slight fever(about .8 degrees). Is this anxiety or caffeine caused? Should I just take a clonazepam or something like that?","Doctor":"HIWell come to HCMI really appreciate your concern, skipping heart beat can not be detected without EKG test, if this is the case of arrhythmia so it has to be sent for cardiac evaluation for confirmation, let me inform you that doctor can only judge this, of course you must be having some symptoms but it may not be due to rhythm. Anxiety can change the cardiac rhythm but it is not the harmful no need to take any medicine for this but try to come out of the stress, if you are going to read the heart beat on your own then it may vary to the great extent, it is all depends upon your mental status or consciousness. hope this information helps."},{"Patient":"Hi Samuel,The renal transplant has been done in Aug, 2011.

The fact that you have been on anti biotherapy shall require that the presence of infection be evaluated, and that clinical signs of endometritis (uterine), which are actually absent in your case, be considered. This are actually indirect clinical measures of threats to infecting the fetus and possibility of causing of premature labour. If the results of the obstetric ultrasound are normal and there are absence of the signs of urinary tract infection, there would actually be no need to induce. If you still continue being seriously in pain, or there is a risk on the baby depending on given clinical and paraclinical criteria, the physician might decide to induce. However, induction in this case under appropriate medical supervision is very safe since the fetus is already greater than 34 weeks.

You should know that stroke imposes a high stress to the organism, leading to increased high blood pressure values. Other possible causes to consider would be : physical or emotional stress, thyroid dysfunction, adrenal gland dysfunction, electrolyte imbalance, kidney or liver dysfunction, etc..For this reason, I would recommend performing further tests to investigate for the possible causes underlying his blood pressure spikes: - a chest X ray study- complete blood count for anemia- kidney and liver function tests- blood electrolytes- thyroid hormone levels - fasting glucose- cortisol and aldosterone plasma levels- PCR and ESR for inflammation. Adding new drugs to his actual therapy may be needed in order to have a better control of high blood pressure. You should discuss with his doctor on these issues.

I also have had history of RBC's in urine ranging in result of few to TNTC.He then did a cystoscopy. He found inflammation and polyps. He prescribed cipro. I asked what he thought was causing the blood in urine. He said probably the polyps. I asked what caused the polyps and he said he thought long term inflammation. He did not remove or biopsy the polyps. If it was a long term inflammation and he prescribed cipro, well, I was on cipro for almost a month during the time of abnormal ct. I had been in hospital with pancreatits, then had colitis. I was on IV cipro in the hospital and the pill form after I had gone home. Wouldn't all that cipro taken care of the inflammation last year?

Yours is whether cyst with secondary infection leading to granuloma (small suspicious area) or cyst with polyps with secodary infections. Blood in urine can be due infections, cyst or polyps. As you have been taking ciprofloxacin nearly one month,  yes infections ( Inflammation/Granuloma) should have been subsided, but might be that infecting agent (bacterias) are resistant to Cipro.

According to the Cleveland Clinic, kidney donors are at no greater risk for future health problems than those with two kidneys. Kidney donation also does not change life expectancy for the donors. After kidney donation remaining kidney gets enlarged and and is sufficient to compensate for the work of two kidneys and the donor can live productive life there after. There is no direct incidence of complications after kidney donation hence i would like to give one standard reference  that could help you more. Long-Term Consequences of Kidney Donation: Hassan N. et al. N Engl J Med 2009; 360:459-469January 29, 2009DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa0804883. Results of the study are as follows: The survival of kidney donors was similar to that of controls who were matched for age, sex, and race or ethnic group. ESRD (End stage renal disease) developed in 11 donors, a rate of 180 cases per million persons per year, as compared with a rate of 268 per million per year in the general population. At a mean (±SD) of 12.2±9.2 years after donation, 85.5% of the subgroup of 255 donors had a GFR of 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area or higher, 32.1% had hypertension, and 12.7% had albuminuria. Older age and higher body-mass index, but not a longer time since donation, were associated with both a GFR that was lower than 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 and hypertension. A longer time since donation, however, was independently associated with albuminuria. Most donors had quality-of-life scores that were better than population norms, and the prevalence of coexisting conditions was similar to that among controls from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) who were matched for age, sex, race or ethnic group, and body-mass index. CONCLUSIONS Survival and the risk of ESRD in carefully screened kidney donors appear to be similar to those in the general population. Most donors who were studied had a preserved GFR, normal albumin excretion, and an excellent quality of life. For detail information you can to the above mentioned reference.

Uni-lateral small kidney is usually acquired after a disease affecting it. In your case, you may correlate with your past medical history. In such a case the other kidney enlarges to compensate for the function. Thus the person has no problems from it. Sometimes it is present since birth. Then it is called as congenital hypoplasia. The pelvocalyceal system is small and usually opacified in intravenous urography. Again compensatory hypertrophy of the contralateral kidney happens. Associated anomalies of kidney are present.

A thyroid dysfunction or an electrolyte imbalance could cause this clinical scenario too. Coming to this point, I would recommend you to closely monitor his blood pressure, frequently during the day in the next week (in sitting position after 10 minutes of total relax) and note them down. If his blood pressure values are above the normal ranges (140/90 mm Hg) most of the time, you should consult with his doctor and perform additional tests to investigate for the possible underlying causes (renal and liver function, blood electrolytes, thyroid hormone levels, etc.).Anti-hypertensive therapy may  be needed.

He says that the donor has asked for 5 crore rupees. He has managed to get 4.99 crores and is in shortage of 1 lakh. I dont know whether its true or he is bluffing.

There are some organs like cornea, heart, brain, liver, kidneys which are donated after the death of the person. Consent is very important in organ donation. The consent is given by the donor during his/ her life or by the nearest kin after death. And there are some organs which can be donated during life of person like bone marrow, one side kidney and part of liver during life of the person. The high cost involved in transplants is associated with expertise of the procedure and the cost of the organ. However, it is not as high as mentioned by your friend. The cost is in few lakhs, more in private centers as compared to that in government ones. Thanks and take care. Dr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"I am 52 yr. old female.

See once you have started to pass Reddish vey dark urine or passed stone which ever is ealier, a complete urine analysis along with USG of abdomen concentrating on KUB area and X-Ray KUB area should have been done. These investigations will reveal all the possible causes of your problem. Only if USG abdomen is not conclusive CT is advised.If the reddish, very dark color urine contains RBC, an assessment should have been done whether reddishness starts in the initial, middle, end of urine or through out.As you have passed a stone (should have been a small one to pass on its own) we have to look for any other stone is there anywhere from kidney to bladder.As per the investigations results treatment should have been advised along with certain dietary restriction as per the type of stone (stone analysis) I also wonder why the investigations and treatment was delyed this much.Do the investigations as I mentioned and take treatment accordingly.

Chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes are devastating because of the damage that they can do to kidneys and other organs. Lifelong diligence is important in keeping blood sugar and blood pressure within normal limits. Specific treatments are dependent upon the underlying diseases. Once kidney failure is present, the goal is to prevent further deterioration of renal function. If ignored, the kidneys will progress to complete failure, but if underlying illnesses are addressed and treated aggressively, kidney function can be preserved, though not always improved.

Thanks for posting your query here. The reason for hydronephrosis of kidney is obstruction to the urine outflow in the urinary tract- from renal pelvis to ureter to urinary bladder to urethra and to out. Any obstruction in the pathway will result in accumulation of urine in the back flow and results in swelling of the kidney. The acute pain on the left side 2-3 weeks could be of renal stone which would have passed out in the urine. For this reason I think your doctor has advised you for an X-ray KUB. Please check the renal parameters which will give you a clue. The swelling of the kidney will get reduces slowly if there is no other pathology. For the gas or acidic problem you can use omeprazole or pantoprazole one tablet daily untill the symptoms resolve. Hope this is helpful to you.

Unawareness of lower extremity trauma due to sensory  neuropathy may result in inadequate attention to minor wounds and subsequent increased infection risk.

Could she have something serious in her kidney?","Doctor":"Hello Tracy, Usually when there is recurrent kidney infection/pyelonephritis/UTI then other underlying diseases conditions should be investigated notably kidney stones or urinary system abnormally or malformations especially in children. If an adolescent or adult, then underlying conditions like diabetes, vaginal infections etc should be checked further. Antibiotics might not get rid of the pain if there are kidney stones. It might get rid of the bacteria infection but not the pain as it will be caused by the stones. At this point it will be advisable to run an image scan (ultrasound or CT scan) to find out if there are stones. In addition to your antibiotics you should encourage your daughter to drink more fluids and also take OTC antispasmodics such as spasfon or buscopan or analgesic pain killers. You may consult a nephrologist for further assistance. Hope this helps and wish you the best"},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with a kidney infection today while at the doctors.

Urinary tract infection mostly presents as fever, chills, flank pain, burning urination, nausea, vomiting, urgency, and foul smelling urine. Not all patients develop all the symptoms. To diagnose the urinary tract infection, ‘urine DR’ (detailed report) is advised; which shows pus cells and red cells, in case of urinary tract infection. Along with urine DR, the ‘complete blood count (CBC)’ can help to rule out other body infections. Urinary tract infections can be treated with suitable antibiotics. I recommend you to go for ‘urine DR’ and just take plenty of clean water. Take care."},{"Patient":"In the past month, my father's kidneys failed and he is getting dialysis through a chest catheter.  He has a foley catheter in place because he cannot relieve himself on his own (seeing a urologist about that). My question is how is it that his urine output is about the same as the fluids he is drinking?  I don't understand how his kidneys can't be working if he has so much urine output.  Is there an explanation?","Doctor":"Hello. There is a simple explanation for good urine output even though body requires dialysis support. Kidneys have two major functions: 1st is purification of blood with maintenance of acid base electrolyte balance and 2nd is removal of excess water from body. In lots of advanced kidney diseases (more than 90% function of kidney - lost), purification of blood is affected badly but water excretion is preserved due to residual functioning of kidneys. Dialysis is needed when either of them hampered.

More details on your mother's medical history (what kind of major surgery, why was a kidney removed, has she ever had cancer before) would be necessary to truly answer your question.  In general, heavy vaginal bleeding in a woman your mother's age is concerning for a few problems.  With the uterus appearing \\"thick\\" on imaging, endometrial cancer and fibroids are certainly possibilities.  Both of these problems can cause heavy bleeding.  She should be evaluated as soon as possible by her doctor, who may decide to do further imaging or blood tests.

Her creatine .06 and her BUN is fine.  also, I started to notice that her short term memory is going and I took her to 3 different nurologist and they all say that from the test there is no dementia or alzhalmer.  So, why would the fidney be leaking protein?  Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hi Protein loss from the kidneys is called albumin-urea, basically it indicates that the kidneys are not functioning properly and are not able to retain the proteins inside and are excreting the substances (proteins) which it should retain. There are many reasons of this condition , stating from entirely a normal phenomenon for some one with very small amount to a fairly advanced kidney disease in cases of huge protein loss. In case of post transplant patient, rejection ( although it has been 6 years) to different kinds of glomerulonephritis can be the causative agents. I think biopsy is the the way to go to see what exactly is the problem so that it can be fixed accordingly.

Should we be concerned - maybe get a 2nd opinion??","Doctor":"hi Treatment options for the control of hypertension in patients of RENAL ARTERY STENOSIS(RAS) with atherosclerotic bilateral renal artery includes both medical and interventional therapy. Interventions aimed at preserving renal function in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis Antihypertensive drugs — For hypertension control, we recommend an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker , often in combination with diuretic . Chlorthalidone is the preferred thiazide diuretic, but a loop diuretic (eg, furosemide or torsemide), may be required in patients who have chronic kidney disease with a significantly reduced glomerular filtration rate. Long-acting calcium channel blockers and beta blockers are also effective . Interventional therapy — Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting is the preferred nonsurgical intervention. Three randomized trials, all with serious flaws, found no improvement in blood pressure, renal, or cardiovascular outcomes in patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis who were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent placement. We agree with the 2005 ACC/AHA guidelines on the management of peripheral artery disease, which recommended percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting for ostial atherosclerotic lesions in patients who have clinical clues suggesting that the renovascular disease is likely to be responsible for hypertension that is not well controlled with optimal medical therapy Based upon the available data, we recommend not performing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in patients who do not meet these criteria because the likelihood of benefit is small and the risk of procedural complications is relatively high. We agree with the 2005 ACC/AHA guidelines, which recommended surgery in patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis who have clinical indications for revascularization, particularly if they have multiple small renal arteries, early primary branching of the main renal artery, or require aortic reconstruction near the renal arteries for other indications (eg, aneurysm repair or severe aortoiliac occlusive disease) take care"},{"Patient":"i am experiencing sharp pains in my baby toe. i have been searching the internet and found that cherries will help eliminate the pain and balance my uric acid. i am taking a blood pressure med that is a durietic. what can i use to help flush out my kidneys. i also drink plenty of water and is an active vegetarian. no beef or pork.","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare  magic It is possible as you assumed, that your symptoms are related to an increase in uric acid. Increased uric acid levels can result in gout which is an inflammatory arthritis. Because there are other potential causes for joint pain you may want to consider visiting your doctor for a blood uric acid level to confirm that this is the cause of your problems. It is also possible , if the level is increased, that your diuretic medication is playing a part. One of the potential side effects of diuretics is an increase in uric acid levels.Your doctor may want to consider switching to another antihypertensive. Other aspects of treatment involve: using enough vitamin c, decreasing any alcohol use, weight loss if there is any excess weight and the use of pain medications.

Thank's in advance for your swift reply.--Have a nice DayThanks & RgdsAAAAAA.SAAAAAAA","Doctor":"Hello Padmanaban, Welcome to HCM and thanks for posting your query here. Kidney stones or renal calculus is an aggregation of minerals which will pass through the urine in common. The symptoms of renal colic are nausea, vomiting, fever, excruciating pain in the flank radiating to the groin, and sometimes with vague abdominal pain. If stones grow to a maximum size more than 3-4mm they will obstruct the urinary passage and may cause hydronephrosis. This in turn affects the urinary outflow and its filtration. Renal stones may be of calcium, oxalate or uric acid, struvite stone composition. The treatment depends on the size, number and site of the stones. Stones below 4-5mm size usually pass through the urine. But larger stones may get obstructed in the renal pelvis, or ureter. Common modes of medical treatment is using diuretics with a drip depending on the location of the stone. Analgesics can be given for pain control. Surgical methods include Extra Corporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy. In this method high ultrasonic waves are used to break the larger stones. The shattered stones are passed through the urine. In multiple and larger stones laser lithotripsy, percutaneous nephrolithotomy  or a ureteral stent is advised. Dietary factors like intake of more fluids, low sodium and calcium(in case of calcium stones), taking less animal protein will reduce the recurrence of renal caliculi. Hope this is helpful to you.

In 2010 his renal scan said functioning of right kidney to be 92%.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for posting your query.Hydronephrosis means swelling/distension of kidney, due to retention of urine or inflammation. It can be due to lower urinary tract infection which may ascend to kidneys causing frequency of urine and distension of kidney/ureter. stone in ureter can also cause distension of ureter and kidney  but would have been detected on sonography. As your child has had surgery for congenital abnormality, he is at higher risk of UTI and obstruction by post-surgical strictures. Give him cranberry juice which may cure and prevent UTIs.

Your doctor must have checked up your creatine levels in blood and albumin levels in your urine.They must be some borderline high and that is the reason,your doctor is wanting to repeat the test in another few months so that kidney functions can be monitored and seen whether they have detiorated any further or not. Any deterioration in kidney function would have to be taken seriously as CKD is a progressive disease which means that it can get worse over time. People with family history of kidney diseases and having high blood pressure and diabetes are called as high risk people. A prompt and early detection can help prevent the progression of kidney disease to kidney failure. Since your triglycerides are high,your doctor has rightly advised you to take aspirin. You must also start doing exercises and avoid consuming beer. Reduce your weight also. As far as food for kidney is concerned,nothing specific is to be done at the moment.

It was at my ureteropelvic junction, a 4-5mm piece of agony. The urologist immediately wanted to operate, I asked him to discharge me and give me a chance to pass it normally without surgical intervention. That night the agony set in again, but this time when I stood up and went to the toilet, the pain subsided enough for me to go back to bed. I have not had pain since then, no problem urinating, no blood in my urine, no fever , basically asymptomatic . Now however I have a constant urge to urinate, with an uncomfortable pressure right by my pelvic bone. I do not struggle to urinate, but it does feel like my bladder is not empty when I get up from the toilet, so I need to go immediately again. This is obviously incredibly irritating.

The symptoms are actually related to the size of the kidney stone, the location of the stone, type of stone and the duration of the stone. many people in the general population have small stones and present with no symptoms.

His latest creatinine serum is 4.16 which increased in last 3 months from 1.98. Medicine he is taking are Lipiget, Loprin, Stress tab, Ammryl,Lophos,Hydrolyzine.

Now the doctor is advising to go for testing tissues in the kidney , we have stopped using Lasix and Minipress for the time being could you please advise any option.","Doctor":"Hello! Thanks for being with us. Diabetes and hypertension if not adequately controlled leads to gradual decrease in  kidney functioning over a period of time. Here in father's case also same factors could be responsible for kidney injury and increase in creatinine level.Drugs like ACE inhibitors and ARBs also decrease kidney function further,hence these should be avoided. There is no harm in using lasix and minipress in this case.Lasix increases urine output,avoids fluid overload and help in decreasing blood pressure.Minipress is also safe to use in this case to decrease blood pressure. Following parameters should be monitored while being on these drugs: 1.serum k+,na, 2.serum calcium,po4, 3.serum uric acid. My suggestion is have strict blood sugar control and blood pressure control to avoid further kidney damage. Target blood pressure should be 110/70 mm of hg in this patient. Hence for better monitoring get a nephrologist opinion. Hope this will help you better. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"My girl friend is experiencing lower adominal area and pain in the back.

Grade I –Grade V. Medical treatment is low dose antibiotic prophylaxis until resolution of VUR occurs. The goal of treatment is to minimize infections, as it is the infection that cause renal scarring and not the vesicoureteral reflux. Medical management is recommended in children with Grade I-III VUR as most cases will resolve spontaneously. A trial of medical treatment is indicated in patients with Grade IV VUR especially in younger patients or those with unilateral disease. For Grade V VUR  surgery is the only option. When medical management fails to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections, or if the kidneys show progressive renal scaring then surgery may be necessary. Surgery is necessary in cases where infection recurs despite prophylaxis with antibiotics, if the VUR is severe (Grade IV & V)and if there is failure of renal growth, formation of new scars and renal deterioration. Since your child had only 1 episode of UTI and he is on regular prophylaxis we can continue with medical management .Urine cultures should be performed every 3 monthly to exclude any new infection. Get a repeat radiological examination to see if the working of kidney function is deteriorating. Good perineal hygiene, and timed and double voiding should be done to decrease the reflux. But still i will suggest you to consult a good urologist to help take a wise and timely decision for surgery.

THANK YOU........AAAA","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM You seem to have suffered from acute diverticulitis with infection that had gone to liver and formed and abscess. Recurrence of diverticular disease is common and can be best avoided by diet alterations. Patients should eat a fiber-enriched diet that includes 30 g of fiber each day. Fiber softens the stool and helps prevent constipation. It also can help decrease pressure in the colon and help prevent flare-ups of diverticulitis. High-fiber foods include: Beans and legumes,Bran, whole wheat bread and whole grain cereals such as oatmeal Brown and wild rice,Fruits such as apples, bananas and pears Vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, corn and squash. Drink at least 8-10 cups of fluid daily. Fluid will help soften your stool. Exercise also promotes bowel movement and helps prevent constipation. The incidence of complicated diverticular disease appears to be increased in people who smoke. Therefore avoid smoking. For long-term medical management of uncomplicated diverticular disease, rifaximin (a poorly absorbed broad-spectrum antibiotic), is associated with 30% less frequent recurrent symptoms from uncomplicated diverticular disease. Furthermore, the use of probiotics has been shown to decrease the incidence of recurrent attacks. Hope i have answered your queries.

Category II:Benign cyst with few thin septa and contain fine clacifications Category IIF: Well marginated with a number of thin septa with thick nodular calcification and >3cms in size. Category III: Indeterminate cystic masses with thick septa with enhancement. Category IV: Malignant cystic masses with thick septa with enhancement and irregular margins. As per your ultrasound report it looks benign Get Your Kidney function tests (Blood urea and serum creatinine)done. If that is normal you need not worry . You can get 6 monthly kidney function test and repeat ultrasonagraphy after 6 months to see if there is enlargement of the cyst or any change in its characteristics or increase in number of cysyts. Large cysts compress the parenchyma and surrounding structures and cause pain . pain can also be due to Haemorrhage and infection. Laproscopic deroofing is the treatment if the cyst is causing symptoms and affecting the renal function."},{"Patient":"Dear Sir, Madam, I stopped eating peanut butter last week on Sunday. Two days later I have no more pvc s! I have suffered from pvc s for years, but have always had peanut butter every day.

I just can t beleive it. Can that be the problem and should I eat some peanuts now and see what happens?? Thanks, Norb","Doctor":"HIWell come to HCMYour query being appreciated, peanut butter could cause the allergic disorder but PVC is not due to that, allergic condition need to be confirmed, I would advise to stop eating peanut butter once again for few days or weeks then start eating  it again, if you noticed the symptoms again then it is the peat nut butter responsible for the condition, in the same way if not eating the peanut butter and still have the same condition as described here then it may not be the pea nut butter but could be something else,  hope this information helps."},{"Patient":"Hello sir my aunt is 67yr old... she had diabetes which she did not care to treat and now both her kidneys have failed...her hemoglobin count is 5..and there is a rapid increase in the urea in her blood.. she was recommended dialysis ..but she is refusing as she thinks that she cannot? bear the pain during dialysis... can u please give a solution to this problem","Doctor":"Hello, Healthy kidneys clean the blood by filtering out extra water and wastes. They also make hormones that keep your bones strong and blood healthy. When both of your kidneys fail, your body holds fluid. Your blood pressure rises. This condition is called uremia Your body doesn't make enough red blood cells. You develop fatigue, nausea, and loss of appetite. Untreated uremia may lead to seizures or coma and will ultimately result in death. If your kidneys stop working completely, you will need to undergo dialysis or kidney transplantation. Your aunt has to go for dialysis at the moment and ultimately she has to opt for kidney transplantation,as dialysis can't go permanently.

The incision to remove a kidney is a large one made on the back, radiating to the side. The incision pain will be similar to the one with your cholecystectomy . To remove the sutures should not be painful. Obviously for the first couple of days post operatively , pain medication will be administered . Although your kidneys do regulate your blood pressure having one kidney does not meen you will develop hypertension,also having one kidney has no effect on your weight. Running is possible with one kidney but caution will have to be taken, as ultra long distance running may cause mechanical trauma to the kidney.

The stone in your case can be because of 1) drinking less water, or 2) water in your locality has lot of minerals in it (hard water), 3) systemic calcium disorder or 4) taking minerals rich food in excess. The stone formation occurs in kidney usually and that where ur stone currently is located according to ur doctor. Their are different recommendation  depending upon the state u live as will as the doctor u see, but normally most of doctors agree that that stone smaller then 4mm/.4cm can be passed in urine, with some pain while urinating, 1) FOR STONE TO PASS VIA urine u have to drink a lot of water, and if u are in the zone on hard water , please drink the mineral water available in market, and it will help you to pass the stone. 2) shock wave lithotrypsy is a method where a wave is send to ur kidney so that the stone shatters in will be easy for kidney to pass in urine, (its like glass shattering with vocal frequency/music) But for this it depends upon the urologists recommendation.

I can understand your worry ! At the age of 55 and diabetes, infections can worsen the kidney function and hence need dialysis. Urinary infections can occur due to obtstruction of the urinary tract by prostate or stones. Prostate enlargement is usually non- cancerous (called BEP), though cancer can occur. PR exam and USG, PSA levels can detect that. Prostate surgery for what? depends on causes. Risks also depend on causes, co- existing diseases like kidney failure, diabetes, heart problems.common complications are bleeding, infection, damage to surrounding structures etc. endoscopic surgery is without external stitches. Open surgery is needed in select cases and needs anaesthesia and gets stitches. I hope you are fully satisfied with the guidance I gave. Hope I have answered all your questions.

Sounds like  you may need to adjust your BP medications.  First thing I would do is check your BP at home with a machine.  If you don't have one I suggest getting one.  Omron is a good brand. Best to check first thing in the AM when you are relaxed or when you feel dizzy or fatigued. Several options.  One is diet.  Less salt and processed foods.  Try organic foods if possible.  Moderate exercise may also be beneficial.If this doesn't help, then the options are to increase HCT to 25 mg daily or a combination pill such as HCT/ACE INHIBITOR. There are quite a few of these meds and they are usually the first choice for high BP as per JNC (Joint National Commission) 8 guidelines.

Fasting blood tests could be done when testing for sugar, cholesterol, uric acid and other diet dependent tests. It is mostly done for glycemia (to determine if diabetic or not). If you had groin pain radiating to the kidneys, I personally would have requested for a urine analysis, abdominal scan (especially looking at the kidneys + bladders + ureters etc). Usually when results are asked to be done after it is for a confirmation of a test conducted earlier. Usually after a while if a test value was high or positive, after a while it could normalize or become negative. Surely that is why they ask to do it again after a month.

First is medical management, although this is usually reserved for people with mild disease or elderly people with multiple medical problems for which intervention is too risky.  Angioplasty with stents are a possibility.  This usually works for single vessel disease.  Typically for people in your dad's age range w multiple blockages, blockage of the L main artery, or diabetic patients open heart surgery (CABG) coronary artery bypass grafting is usually the preferred option, especially if there is decreased heart function (systolic dysfunction or low ejection fraction).I am an internist but do a lot of work on the cardiac floors w experienced cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons.  Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"For the last month I ve had a throbbing lower back pain . Seems like it could ve been kidney-related, but I recently had a general checkup in January and blood work done and my kidneys are fine. I also haven t had my period for about 4 months now. I m normally irregular, but have never had this long a time in between periods. I took two pregnancy tests and I m not pregnant. My OBGYN had told me last year that I had a terratoma (large cyst) and that it may just be nerve pain from that, but never pursued it and the pain went away and returned about a month ago. Since then, it s been far more severe and painful than ever before. Other than this, I don t suffer from anything else except hypothyroidism caused by Hashimotos Disease that I take levothyroxide for. Any thoughts?","Doctor":"teratoma is a tumour, but where it is situated. kidney related pain can not be ruled out with blood tests. only if you do ultrasound scan we can find out any renal stone or other kidney related problems. another thing, your low back pain may be due to  musculoskeletal problems. i want to know your weight. you may need back muscle strenghthening excercises."},{"Patient":"Hello, My father, age 66 yrs, is having high Creatinine level - 5.42.

Do you think it is possible to do treatment with medicines and diet, before going into Dialysis? Looking forward to your help. Thanks a lot.","Doctor":"Hello, Your report suggests that your father is suffering from diabetic nephropathy which has resulted in chronic kidney disease(CKD).This CKD then progresses towards kidney failure called as ESRD ( end stage renal disease ). The fact is there is no treatment of CKD. There are treatments employed like slowing the progression of disease and treating the cause,contributing factors and complications of CKD. Treatment involves restriction on your protein,potassium,fluid ,analgesics,anti biotics like gentamicin etc. Treatment involves controlling  high blood pressure,diabetes,loosing weight,taking care of anemia and low VIT D,etc. The treatment involves stopping all oral anti diabetics and using only injectable insulin. The fact remains that you may prolong the progression of your CKD status to end stage kidney disease but you can't prevent it happening. Your father may pull along for some more time but eventually he has to go for dialysis and then it would be a regular feature with him till you get his kidney transplant done. You must discuss with your doctor and start planning for the kidney transplant ,so that your father may be able to enjoy his life normally.

The ultrasonogram has shown that the right kidney is grossly enlarged (normal 9-11cm, but 16cm in her case). The DTPA renogram shows an obstructed drainage. In a symptomatic patient it is always better to go for surgical treatment. Unfortumately there is no medical treatment for this condition. It can be explained in a simple mechanical example where in the out flow pipeline is blocked and there is enlarged kidney as a result of the pressure built up. If you can remove the blocade then it will help at this stage especially because the relative function of the kidney despite being hydronephrotic is still at 34% which is good. You can preserve the kidney function if the surgery is done at this stage. You can consider a laparoscopic surgery if you are not interested in an open procedure. This will have good results and less scarring. Hope it was helpful. Regards."},{"Patient":"hi dr. sree bhushan please explain this to me MY DAUGHTER IS 1 YEAR OLD.

As your pelvicalycial system is dilated along with right ureter fullness it indicates obstruction at the level of ureter most probably due to stone or stricture.Some amount of urinary retention is acceptable in the 2nd trimester as the uterus is pressing on the bladder and hinders in complete evacuation. The dilatation of the ureter and the pelvicalyx should be taken care of . As you are 27 weeks pregnant, you may take the advise of a urologist whether it can be taken care of now or you need to wait.

A urine culture and sensitivity tests shall then be important in deciding on the appropriate anti biotic to be used and the duration of use. Doing an abdominal ultrasound could be important in eliminating other causes of abdominal pain that could present themselves in the same way. How ever, this shall depend on a critical physical examination by a physician, and based on his clinical judgement, he shall then decide to ask the tests or not.

The infection only affected my right kidney, not my left. When I was in hospital they gave me an ultrasound . The lady who did the ultrasound said that there was a mild dilation of the tube coming down from my right kidney and if my doctors want to then they can send me for further testing to see if it was a stone. When I saw two other doctors they referred to my scan as being fine. I asked them about the dilation and they just said Oh its nothing, its fine. For the next week I was put on antibiotics , I felt like the infection had gone as I no longer had fever or pain in my kidneys, or buring when I urinated etc but I still had a lot of blood in my urine. The doctors kept saying to finish the antibiotics and wait to see if the blood stops. The blood did stop eventually. I then had another urine test to check the infection had definietly gone and it had. My uncle not being satisifed with the results of my scan told me to go for another one. I went yesterday and they said my kidney is functioning fine from all the blood tests and they also said in my notes No renal stones. There is a mild prominence of the right pelvic Caliceal system, the right renal pelvis measuring 6mm even after micturition. Both kidneys are normal in echo pattern, contour and size. The right kidney measures 10.9cm and left kidney measures 10.3cm in bipolar length. There is no loss of corticomedullary differentiation. No calculi seen. The urinary blader is well distended with no wall thickening. No intraluminal mass or calculi. Bilateral ureteric jets seen. It empties adequately . What does all this mean? They suggested its either an infection still there or the recent passage of a stone or a partially obstructing calculus in right ureter.

Serum creatinine levels, a complete serum electrolyte panel (Potassium and Calcium especially) and kidney ultrasounds are of great importance, Considering that the stone is clinically symptomatic with pain, is greater than 6mm in size and with an associated hydrnephrosis, considering removal of this stone is almost imperative and life saving. Left undone could be a serious threat to the affected kidney with a high risk of kidney failure.

The kidney is a noble organ of the body. A specific diagnosis and appropriate treatment of kidney diseases is compelling. In proper contexts, a presumed kidney infection should ideally be accompanied by a urine culture and sensitivity tests to decide on the appropriate anti biotic. Persistence of symptoms as you describe might deserve a more invasive watch and maybe an abdominal ultrasound. Kidney function tests could also be worth performing to ascertain actual level and function of the kidneys. Persistence of symptoms might warrant  booking a visit with the nephrologist for a proper evaluation. While waiting, complying with the antibiotic plan and drinking a lot of water could be helpful.

A cardiac stress test would be needed in order to investigate for coronary artery disease. I would also recommend trying an antiacid or omeprazole.

So I would like to know are there any side effects of this surgery ??","Doctor":"Hello, Uteroscopic laser lithotripsy is a surgical procedure to remove kidney stones. The Holmium laser offers a flexible ureteroscopy or endoscopic approach that is considered one of the most advanced in the treatment for kidney stones and uses a laser beam that produces thermal energy that dissolves obstructive tissue. Surgical procedures utilizing laser technology are minimally invasive but may still produce post-surgical symptoms for patients like slight pain or nausea. Nausea is due to the general anaesthesia given. Most Laser Lithotripsy procedures are safe. Common complications include more than one round of treatments to remove the small stone pieces that were left in the kidneys. It may also cause bleeding around the kidneys that may require blood transfusion. The remaining stone pieces can also block the flow of urine and cause severe pain or blockage. A thin stent may be placed in the body after laser lithotripsy to prevent the blockage of the urine flow. Just go ahead with the surgery as this is one of the most advanced mode of treatment for kidney stones.

The good news though is that this doesn’t happen very often and it often takes a long time to occur. Thankfully, because most stones are associated with significant amounts of pain, most patients will seek treatment long before permanent damage can occur. However, in cases where patients have “silent” stones ,like you,that cause little or no pain, long term obstruction can occasionally lead to kidney damage.

Since his grades have gone down you should not worry. We would like to know whether his kidney is scarring or not. He will need a DMSA scan and then follow up scans. We are more interested on the level at which his creatinine settles down. He also needs a few more tests like renal dynamic scan to comment on individual function of the kidneys and unobstructed passage of urine from them.

There are a few things which can be done prior to the procedure to augment some of the potential kidney toxicity however once this has occurred, there is not much that can be done other than the following: -Avoid potentially kidney toxic medications including over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen or naproxen -Avoid changes in volume status such as with diuretics -Avoid overaggressive drop in blood pressure such as with antihypertensives If the contrast exposure was without vascular manipulation such as a catheter/guidewire as would be used in a cardiac procedure, majority of the time renal function will recover to pre-existing baseline. If this is your situation then at this point he would have to wait and see where things stand about a month from now. If contrast exposure included a catheter or guidewire, there is the added risk of atheroembolic renal insult (small debris from the wall of the blood vessel dislodged by the wire injuring the kidney).

Do take antispasmodic medications , if the pain do not subside even after the medication, it would then be essential for you to get examined and rule out conditions like kidney stones which rarely do present with such pain.

There is a family history of it, my late father and one brother. My doctor has just given me a req for blood work to determine if my Uric acid level is now low enough to start me on Allopurinol .......This whole painful episode lasted approximately 2+ months, with numerous trips to the doctors........Does it get better from here. I have said to my husband several times that the pain was so intense that I wished I was dead.....I am a 58 year old female with a fairly high threshold for pain, but not with the gout....the threshold went right out the window!!!!! Would appreciate your comments/advice/help....Patricia Ward","Doctor":"Thank you for using heathcare magic. One detail which was not mentioned in your question was whether or not during an episode if a physician removed fluid from the joint and had the fluid examined to determine if your symptoms were gout vs some other form of inflammatory arthritis. Assuming then that this is gout, long term management would be medications and lifestyle modification.  For long term management you would benefit from being on a medicatioon such as allopurinol however this should be initiated once the acute attack has resolved.  Other medications such as probenecid and colchicine can also be used as a preventative however allopurinol or the newer medication Uloric would be first line agents. The goal of preventative treatment would be to acheive a uric acid level  Take Care and Be well Lifestyle modification will include reduction in purine intake such as reduction in red meat, cheese, wine etc.  I would suggest that you search online for \\"diet in persons with gout\\" and you should find adequate information regarding dietary restrictions that would help prevent recurrence. I would also suggest that you speak with your primary care doctor regarding a prescription for medication to have on hand in the event of a recurrent attack.  Early initiation of treatment may reduce the severity of the attack.  Medications such as NSAIDS (indomethacin), colchicine and steroids are used in acute attacks.  The appropriate agent for you will be determined by your doctor based on your other medical history."},{"Patient":"i have a lump above my belly button and it hurts to touch or when i lean against something.

The pain which is modulated by touching is not related to the heart, as you can not touch your heart. It seems to be just a musculo-skeletal pain. Anxiety can not be excluded either. Coming to this point, I would recommend trying ibuprofen for the pain. If the pain persists, I would recommend consulting with her doctor for a physical exam and some tests: -a chest X ray study-complete blood count, PCR, ESR for inflammation- a resting ECG and cardiac ultrasound. You should discuss with her doctor on the above issues. Kind regards, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"Hi. Life insurance tests found blood in my urine: WBC 12 RBC 28 and high Creatinine 96 (UK system) Phosphate in urine was 1.48 They estimate my GFR as 58 I am 41, non smoker, otherwise healthy. Does this mean I have kidney disease or could it just be an infection? Could the test be wrong if I ate a beef with coca cola dinner 9 hours before? Also they used first morning urine and my period came 5 days later. I don t know if these things are irrelevant. :o/","Doctor":"Thank you for using healthcare magic The presence of microscopic hematuria which is what you are describing may or may not indicate kidney disease. A kidney stone or any mechanical blockage within the urinary tract can cause microscopic hematuria. Since you are menstruating, this may be confounded vaginal blood admixing with the urine specimen.  To exclude kidney disease you would need:  Blood chemistries to assess creatinine and BUN, kidney ultrasound, clean-catch urinalysis and quantification of urinary protein excretion. Once your physician has the above data, they should be able to answer definitively if you have kidney disease or not. What you had done is take an insurance physical which basically cast a large net \\"fishing for abnormalities\\" such that if there are any, they can deny you insurance or raise your premium.  It is not a diagnostic test rather a screening tool. Consumption of animal protein prior to the studies may have increased the urinary creatinine excretion but should not affect hematuria Take care and be well"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have been suffering from kidney stones for a while. my uric acid is always high even though I am vegetarian. Currently I have 4 uric acid stones in my right kidney (2mm, 4mm, 6mm, 1 cm). Would medication be enough to dissolve the stones. For example taking Urolyt and zyloric. I do not want to do laser or shockwave as I heard it could have really painful consequences. Best regards,","Doctor":"Thank you for using health care Magic nonsurgical methods for treatment of uric acid stones should be supplemented with adequate fluid intake. If you are able to increase your urine out put to the range of 2-4 L of urine per day, you should be able to avoid further stones. The medications may help in dissolving some of your existing stones and coupled with adequate urine flow and oral fluid intake, you may be able to address your kidney stones. Please bear in mind that a stone which is symptomatic or obstructing will require treatment by a urologist. If the stones were just identified without causing symptoms or obstruction, then no acute intervention is required."},{"Patient":"I ve had a kidney stone back in Dec 2012, and I already passed the stone. When I was passing the stone I kepted feeling like I had to pee. Now at times I still have that feeling and I don t know why. I work in a hospital and talked to some of the nurses and they said maybe UTI but its not because I drink plenty of water and juice. Why do I feel that way? I don t have any pain.","Doctor":"Thank you for using health care Magic The first step in evaluating your problem would be a urinalysis. If the urinalysis is indicative of infection, then the urinary tract infection is likely causing your symptoms.  If a UTI is identified, reevaluate after treatment. If no UTI is identified and the urine is positive for microscopic hematuria [positive for small amounts of RBCs/blood), you may need to be evaluated for recurrent kidney stone. People who have had a kidney stone have a 50% or greater chance of recurrence. If your original imaging studies showed multiple stones and you passed only one, it is possible that you may be passing another.  If the urinalysis is entirely clear then consider other causes such as overactive bladder Take care and be well"},{"Patient":"My husband has had upper abdominal pain for almost 2 years. It is constant sharp pains which makes him curled up in a ball for a good part of the day. They have done alot of tests and is now being sent to a UCSF GI dr. thinking it may be his pancreas or bile ducts. I received his records to take to this dr. and noticed that he had a 2 x 2 0.1 cm cyst with intrinsic debris. This report was taken 5/11 and their recommendations were to do a renal ultrasound which was never done as we didn t know he even had a cyst until we received these records the other day. Spoke to a dr a Kaiser and they say it is nothing because its small and hasn t grown and many people have them. If he didn t have this sharp constant pain since then I wouldn t worry but I think further testing on this cyst is required. He has no other symptoms besides the sever abdominal pain. What do you think","Doctor":"Hi and thank you for using health care Magic. Cysts in the kidneys are commonly found in people as we age.  The finding of a few simple cysts on a  ultrasound in and of itself would not warrant further evaluation. The findings of a cyst that would warrant further evaluation would be large size (right around where his are or greater), complexity of the cyst by imaging which would indicate that it is not just fluid-filled or any masslike characteristics. If the original imaging was done in May 2011 and there has been no change in the size, it would seem unlikely to be of any significance. To reassure yourself, I would suggest that you request an MRI to further characterize the cyst as well as urine cytology. Benign findings on an MRI and negative urine cytology would be highly reassuring without the need for further extensive workup."},{"Patient":"I thought I d always had normal GFR results on my yearly physical blood work, but it turns out it dropped to 57 two years ago and 51 last year.

I m worried because my Mom had kidney failure in her 70 s after having kidney issues all her life. He s redoing the blood test for the GFR level next week.","Doctor":"Thank you for using health care Magic. Glomerular filtration rate as calculated on a standard laboratory panel now utilizes a formula known as MDRD. Since the advent of this formula and its use as the primary method of calculation of GFR on standard laboratory panels, there has been a more precise determination of GFR without a 24-hour urine collection.  Despite its increased accuracy, there are a few caveats in its interpretation. For example extremes of body weight and age do not yield accurate results. Furthermore there is a 10% decline in GFR per decade after the age of 30-40.  In order to determine if there is a clinically relevant reduction in renal function or kidney disease for that matter, a urinalysis, evaluation of urine protein, renal ultrasound and serial creatinine assessments would be required at minimum. Should you want to simply answer your question of whether or not your GFR has declined from normal, all that is required is a 24-hour urine collection for creatinine clearance.

He has history of kidney stones . at present, he is diagnosed with multiple calculi in right kidney, with largest 5mm in midpole. multiple calculi in left kidney, with largest 7 mm in lower pole. 8 mm sized left proximal ureteric calculus with ipsilateral hydroureteronephrosis. Is it advisable to go for DJ stent + ESWL procedure, OR are there any other methods by which these stones can be removed more easily? Also what would be the cost of DJ stent + ESWL procedure approximately?","Doctor":"Thank you for using health care Magic the presence of an 8 mm stone on the left with hydroureteronephrosis would be an indication for intervention. The longer the obstruction remains present, the higher the likelihood of damage to the left kidney. 8 mm is at the upper limit in size with regards to the ability of the stone to pass itself. If adequate time and nonsurgical methods (pain medication, increased fluid intake and use of selective alpha antagonist such as tamsulosin) has not resulted in the stone passing then the next step would be proceeding with cystoscopy and stent placement.

To evaluate for and exclude kidney causes of his pain, I would suggest a CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis as well as a urinalysis. If these are reviewed by a physician and are deemed to be normal, it is unlikely that his pain is due to kidney related issues.  If there are no other internal organ abnormalities noted on CAT scan, I would suggest speaking with your primary care Dr. regarding evaluation of musculoskeletal back pain"},{"Patient":"i m a 28 years old man having gastric problem. i get stomach pain on entering and after having meal, which last for sometime. i am not getting any vomiting sensation and my daily routine is also fine. but i feel uncomfortable in my stomach mainly on left side. its a kind of burning pain, which usually increases on empty stomach and in morning time. i m not getting this pain, is this a symptom of kidney stone?. what is problem with me? please advise.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM, From your history it seems you might have gastritis or acid peptic disease.

Since you recently had Cdiff and now have recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms after short course antibiotics for urinary infection, the primary concern would be for recurrent cdiff.  Untreated cdiff can result in complications more serious  than diarrhea and cramps such as megacolon.  I would suggest that you see your primary care doctor as soon as possible, repeat stool studies and consider another course of treatment for cdiff.  Certain labs also offer cdiff strain analysis therefore being able to determine if you have a resistant strain that may benefit from treatment with other agents such as oral vancomycin."},{"Patient":"I am regualary feeling pains in the chest and and the left arm joins and stomach pain.

Have you performed a cardiac stress test? It would help investigate for coronary artery disease and reassure you that you are not going to get any heart attack. If you already have performed this tests and it is normal, I would recommend considering other possible causes that may mimic this clinical scenario: gastritis or gastro-esophageal reflux, a cervical column radicular nerve pain or anxiety. For this reason, I would advice performing a cervical spine X ray study and making some trials: a- try taking an antiacid or omeprazole. If it helps improve your situation it would indicate possible gastro-esophageal reflux or gastritis. In such case a fibrogastroscopy would be needed. b- try taking alprazolam 0.25 or 0.5 during those episodes. If this helps improve your situation, it would indicate anxiety as the main cause of your complaints. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues.

The simplest approach would be systematically eliminate items one by one.  If you had an ultrasound and are going to get a CAT Scan, GI and GU symptoms should be fairly easy to exclude for the most part (barring some limitations if the study is not done with contrast).  A urinalysis would be the quickest and simplest way to see if there are any urologic issues.  If you have blood in your urine then the focus of evaluation would be urologic.  A completely normal urinalysis, although reassuring would not entirely exclude urologic issues.  As far as kidney stones, unless a large stone with shadowing is noted, an ultrasound is not the best test.  A CT will delineate stones.  The prescence of stones by CT does not mean your pain is caused by.  In general a stone that is in the \\"heart\\" of the kidney ie not within the pelvis, ureter or \\"passing\\" would be unlikely to cause you pain.  If the stone is in any of the locations noted previously, then yes it could be the cause of your pain.  Because you mention lower abdominal pain, other items to consider would be divertiular disease, appendix and visceral organ related issues.  Once you have a CT done and a urinalysis, you should be able to exclude or diagnose most common causes of your presenting symptoms.  If these are negative, then I would proceed with musckuloskletal pain work up.  Please note that the \\"classic\\" presentation of kidney stone pain (renal colic) would be back/flank pain that radiates to the groin or lower abdominal quadrants."},{"Patient":"HELLO My 16 year old son has problems with his kidneys etc and has a mitrofanoff etc and has a number of other medical problems. I have just received a review letter after seeing his consultant which states his right kidney measures 10.6cm with focal cortical thinning and mild calyceal prominence with the AP diameter measuring 7mm (previously 18mm). The left kidney measured 9.7cm with focal areas of cortical thinning, mild calyceal prominence and AP diameter of 7mm (previously 13mm). Could you please tell me exactly what this means, and why the diameters would be so different and if I should be concerned at this stage. I thank you for your help.","Doctor":"Based on information you provided, I would presume he has had issues related to obstruction for some time hence the Mitrofanoff.  The radiologic reports are suggesting the following: 1.  The kidney sizes mentioned are within normal range, perhaps the Left a bit smaller.  In general I would conside between 9 and 12 cm normal sized.  The discrepency in the size of his kidneys is within physiologic normal range and that in and of itself would not be concerning 2.  The cortex of the kidney is where majority the \\"functional units\\" of the kidney are located ie the microscopic parts that are responsible for filtration and urine formation.  Cortical thinning would indicate some loss of these functional units perhaps from prior injury or scarring.  I would be considered a marked of what is termed Chronic Kidney disease.  The ultrasound itself would not be the determinant of his kidney function.  This would be assesed based on blood tests and certain urine assessments 3.  The calyx is a portion within the collecting system.  In your sons condition, I would presume there was/or is some degree of reflux (urine refluxing back into the ureter).  This is likely the cause of the calyceal dilation.  Stone, stricture, scarring, mass are other causes but based on your recent Ultrasound not commenting on such a finding and his history, this seems less likely"},{"Patient":"I started by having a symptom of kidney stones but none found.Then I got a burning sensation when I sat on the toilet or on a chair.

The medical benefits from peritoneal dialysis related to long term outcomes is more or less the same.  There is some evidence of benefit by preservation of residual renal function, more so if the patient is not a diabetic.  If a diabetic, peritoneal dialysis may pose a problem for glycemic control and weight gain.  Long term survival is more or less the same. Regarding kidney transplantation, the first step would be to determine is she would be a suitable transplant candidate.  If her nephrologist has already indicated so, then I would search within your state for a local transplant center.  Contact the transplant center directly and ask for information on transplant.  She will be screened via a questionarre, insurance verification and review of her records as well as possibly a consultation with a physician.  Regarding potential doners, the transplant program will guide you and assist in testing those that are interested in donating. Regarding how to \\"convince\\" someone - it is purely a personal decision and the doner should be willing to proceed without hesistation otherwise if there is a bump along the way, they may regret their decision.

The nurse might be right when she told you it was as a result of too much fluid removed. This is a common side effect that occurs as a result of dialysis treatment. You need to know that even though dialysis is a good way of filtrating waste products from your body, it can not 100% replace the natural functions performed by the kidney (and since it has failed...) and so comes with many side effects that you can take your time and research on or ask your mother's treating physician for more info regarding side effects of dialysis. Your mother's age might be another predisposing factor to dialysis side effects.

Mononucleosis spreads through saliva and mucus, and may cause a high fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and a severe sore throat. Other causes of hepatosplenomegaly may include tuberculosis, malaria, and some forms of cancer. Some auto-immune disorders can also lead to this condition, including Systemic Lupus Erythematosis (SLE) and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Parasitic infections, chronic alcoholism, and cat scratch fever are also associated with liver and spleen swelling. The treatment for hepatosplenomegaly largely depends on the underlying cause. Most of the time, when that is treated, the swelling goes down naturally. In those with conditions that can't be cured, treatment focuses on managing the symptoms and improving the liver and spleen's function. This includes things like enzyme replacement therapy, which can help keep the size of the liver and spleen down, and avoiding things that stress the liver, like drinking alcohol or taking aspirin,brufen,diclofenac. hope have answered your query get well soon and takecare."},{"Patient":"I have a pain in my right kidney that feels similar to a kidney infection however I have had blood and urine tests done which are all clear.

I have gone through your post in which you have mentioned that your son is suffering from Nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is a condition in which there is kidney damage causing Proteinuria (loss of proteins through urine) This results in Hypoalbuminemia (decreased protein levels in blood) Hypoalbuminemia reduces the serum oncotic pressure leading to fluid accumulation in the interstitial tissues, which manifests as puffiness around eyes, swelling (edema) over legs, etc. The mainstay of treatment is by administration of glucocorticoid, which acts as an anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agent for treating the condition. So...it will be better to consult a Pediatrician & start treatment. Long term use may have side effects like increased susceptibility to infection, easy bruising, abnormal fat distribution in body, etc. Symptoms aggravate if medication is stopped abruptly. Make sure while discontinuing the medication, its dose should be tapered gradually instead of stopping it abruptly. There is nothing to worry...after completion of treatment, your son will be alright. Wishing him a good health.

Tho' it is not absolute but you do need to get a renal profile done and visit your general physician who should be able to guide you to the next course of action. Do take care."},{"Patient":"Dr. My father is having stone in the left kidney of size 11mm.He was advised to take Potrate MB6 for 3 months along with Urimax .4 mg and Febuget40. He also has prostatomegaly.He has been taking these medicines for 2 month now. Recently he is having gas trouble after taking this medicine.He also take medicines CardaceH5, Ecosprin75,Aztor10 and Metalor25.Recently we again took UT scan ,the stone size remains the same. Is this adequate? Why is having Gas trouble? Does it because of Potrate MB6? Kindly Reply? Thanku","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to HCM. Potrate can cause gas trouble. It can be reduced by taking it mixed  in water after food. The stone can be fragmented with lithotripsy without any surgical procedure. Please talk to your doctor on the same. best regards DR GS"},{"Patient":"i have pain near my right side kidney area which i thought was a kidney stone . i went to the urologist and they xrayed and said they saw nothing. they are bringing me back for a ct scan . another interesting fact is that when the pain sets in drinking water relieves it. but if i drink a lot of soda it brings the pain on, your thoughts......","Doctor":"Hi there ~  It is interesting that drinking water but not soda relieves your pain near the right side kidney area.  X-ray may not reveal a kidney stone but a CT scan may be in order to detect stones or slush that is not detectable by X-ray.  I highly recommend that you consult a urologist to have any doubts regarding pain near the kidney area resolved.  Take care and drink plenty of water, if you have no other kidney problems.  I hope this helped."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr. How r u? Im 58Y male, my livier fuction test such as ALT AST is always showing High values. so Dr. request for me ultrsound. U S shows Mild fatty infiltrations of liver with areas of focal fatty sparing and Tiny echogenic area at the left kidney may be a small calculus of theh cortical calcification . Can i konw what is this????","Doctor":"hi there, SGOT and SGPT are liver enzymes and show derangement when the liver function is compromised. If you have a history of moderate alcohol intake for a prolonged period of time that would explain the enzymes derangement and fatty changes in the liver. The small calculus in the kidney can be ignored if it is asymptomatic. You could start by cutting down on the alcohol intake and taking regular exercise and balanced diet with a plan for decreased carbohydrate and fat intake. Please visit your physician who will be able to prescribe some liver enzyme suppliments. At present the fatty liver is in reversible state of dispair but if left unattended it may not be able to salvage later. Take care and live healthy."},{"Patient":"My father, 72 yr old, having little blood in the first morning urine, but no pain or burning sensation. He is also having nephrotic syndrome , more than 10 gm protein leakage per day. Glomerullies were not found during kidney biopsy . So no proper identification of the category of Nephrotic syndrome was made. Only interstitial inflamation in kidney were found. Immunofluroscence report shows IgA. What can be the cause?","Doctor":"Hi welcome to HCM. Once you rule out stones; infection or tumour by doing urine analysis and ultrasound scan, we need to think of the glomerulo- nephritis as the cause. Kindly do the above tests and we can take it form there. best regards DR GS"}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.Patient.toLowerCase().includes(e)||a.Doctor.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},R={class:"search-container"},M={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],U={key:0},Y={key:1};function B(a,e,h,c,n,s){const y=g("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",R,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),f(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[p,n.searchQuery]])]),t("div",M,[(o(!0),i(w,null,b(s.filteredPoems,(r,m)=>(o(),k(y,{key:m,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:n.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...r)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...r))},[n.isLoading?(o(),i("span",Y,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",U,"See more"))],8,N)):v("",!0)])}const O=u(x,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-8ec9b728"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"chatai/19.md","filePath":"chatai/19.md"}'),q={name:"chatai/19.md"},W=Object.assign(q,{setup(a){return(e,h)=>(o(),i("div",null,[I(O)]))}});export{G as __pageData,W as default};
