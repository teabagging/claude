Since points A(x_{1},y_{1}) and B(x_{2},y_{2}) lie on the parabola C, we have y= frac {1}{4}x_{1}^{2} and y= frac {1}{4}x_{2}^{2}.

Binary Representation and Initial Setup:   Given ( 2^k leq n < 2^{k+1} ), we can express ( n ) in binary as ( n = overline{a_k a_{k-1} cdots a_1 a_0} ).

After the second operation, we need to take the product of the new numbers, each increased by 1, and subtract 1 from the product, i.e.,(((a+1)(b+1)-1)+1)(c+1)-1=(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)-1.Similarly, for any number of numbers.## Answer21!-1."},{"problem":"Given sin(pi + theta) = -sqrt{3} cos(2pi - theta), where |theta| < frac{pi}{2}, find the value of theta.","solution":"Since sin(pi + theta) = -sqrt{3} cos(2pi - theta),We can simplify it to -sin(theta) = -sqrt{3} cos(theta), which implies tan(theta) = sqrt{3}.Given that |theta| < frac{pi}{2}, the only possible value for theta is boxed{theta = frac{pi}{3}}."},{"problem":"What is the maximum possible value of P A+P B+P C+P D if P is a point on the unit square A B C D?","solution":"First, we prove a lemma.Lemma. Let 0 leq a leq 1 and b be real numbers, and letf(x, y)=sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}+sqrt{(1-x)^{2}+y^{2}}Then f(a, b) leq f(0, b), and equality holds if and only if a=0 or a=1 or b=0.On our website, we provided a geometric statement equivalent to the lemma and its geometric proof. Now, we will show how to achieve the goal through calculations. The statement can be rearranged as follows:sqrt{1+b^{2}}-sqrt{(1-a)^{2}+b^{2}} geq sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}-|b|According to our assumption about a, both sides are non-negative, so squaring is an equivalent transformation. After performing the operations, we get:begin{gathered}1+b^{2}+1-2 a+a^{2}+b^{2}-2 sqrt{1+b^{2}} sqrt{(1-a)^{2}+b^{2}} geq geq a^{2}+b^{2}+b^{2}-2|b| sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}end{gathered}After simplifications and introducing the notation c=1-a (clearly 0 leq c leq 1), rearranging (1) gives:c+|b| sqrt{(1-c)^{2}+b^{2}} geq sqrt{1+b^{2}} sqrt{c^{2}+b^{2}}Again, both sides are non-negative, so we can square again:c^{2}+b^{2}(1-c)^{2}+b^{4}+2|b| c sqrt{(1-c)^{2}+b^{2}} geq c^{2}+b^{2}+b^{2} c^{2}+b^{4}After simplifications and rearranging, we get 2|b| c sqrt{(1-c)^{2}+b^{2}} geq 2 b^{2} c. Since 2|b| c geq 0, there are two cases: if 2|b| c=0, then b=0 or a=1 and equality holds. Otherwise, 2|b| c>0 and we can divide by it:sqrt{(1-c)^{2}+b^{2}} geq|b|Again, both sides are non-negative, and after another squaring, we get the obvious inequality (1-c)^{2} geq 0. Equality holds when a=0. Since we performed only equivalent transformations, we have proved the original statement, and thus the lemma.Let us choose the coordinate system such that the vertices of the unit square are A(0,0), B(1,0), C(1,1), and D(0,1); and let P(x, y), where 0 leq x, y leq 1. Thenbegin{gathered}P A+P B+P C+P D= =sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}+sqrt{(1-x)^{2}+y^{2}}+sqrt{(1-x)^{2}+(1-y)^{2}}+sqrt{x^{2}+(1-y)^{2}}= =f(x, y)+f(x, 1-y)end{gathered}Applying the lemma and using that 0 leq y leq 1, we getbegin{gathered}f(x, y)+f(x, 1-y) leq f(0, y)+f(0,1-y)= =sqrt{y^{2}}+sqrt{1+y^{2}}+sqrt{(1-y)^{2}}+sqrt{1+(1-y)^{2}}= =y+1-y+f(y, 1)=1+f(y, 1)end{gathered}Again, by the lemma, f(y, 1) leq f(0,1)=1+sqrt{2}, from which it follows that P A+P B+P C+P D leq 2+sqrt{2}. Equality holds if and only if equality holds in all our estimates, which is easy to see that this happens if and only if P is one of the vertices of the unit square.Márton Borbényi (Kaposvár, Táncsics Mihály Gymnasium, 12th grade)Remark. We sketch a second possible solution, which uses some basic knowledge about functions of two variables. Let us introduce the function g(P)=P A+P B+P C+P D. It is known that in a triangle, the median is at most as long as the arithmetic mean of the sides enclosing the median. From this elementary geometric fact, it immediately follows that if F is the midpoint of the segment P Q, then g(F) leq(g(P)+g(Q)) / 2, and equality holds only if P=Q. Since the function g is continuous, we have shown that g is strictly convex. Using the convexity, it is not too difficult to show that the maximum is at the vertices, it is enough to think that every other point of A B C D is an interior point of a segment whose endpoints are also points of A B C D.[^0][^0]:    { }^{1} https://www.komal.hu/feladat?a=feladat&f=B4878&l=hu."},{"problem":"Given a random variable xi sim N(0, sigma^2), if P(xi < 2) = 0.8, then P(xi < -2) = boxed{0.2}.","solution":"Since the random variable xi sim N(0, sigma^2), the normal distribution is symmetric about x=0.Given that P(xi  2) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2.Therefore, P(xi  2) = 0.2.Hence, the answer is boxed{0.2}.The random variable xi sim N(0, sigma^2) implies that the normal distribution is symmetric about x=0, which leads to the conclusion.This question tests the understanding of the symmetry of the normal distribution and computational skills, and it is considered a basic question."},{"problem":"11.175.

Let's analyze the statements one by one:1. Monotonicity on Different Intervals:   Since f(x) is even, it mirrors its behavior on the negative side to the positive side. Therefore, if it is increasing on [-1,0], it must be decreasing on [0,1] due to the symmetry of even functions. This is because, for an even function, f(-x) = f(x), and an increase in the negative direction implies a decrease in the positive direction over the same magnitude of intervals centered around zero.   - f(x) is monotonically increasing on [-1,0].   - Therefore, f(x) is monotonically decreasing on [0,1].2. Symmetry About the Point (1,0):   The given equation f(1-x) + f(1+x) = 0 implies that for any x, the sum of the function values at points equidistant from x=1 is zero. This means that the function exhibits point symmetry about (1,0). Specifically, f(1-x) = -f(1+x) shows that for any two points 1-x and 1+x, their function values are negatives of each other, indicating symmetry about the vertical line x=1 and hence about the point (1,0).   - f(1-x) = -f(1+x) implies point symmetry about (1,0).3. Behavior on the Interval [1,2]:   Given the symmetry about (1,0) and the monotonic behavior on [0,1], we can infer the behavior on [1,2]. Since f(x) is decreasing on [0,1], and the function is symmetric about (1,0), it will continue to decrease on [1,2].   - f(x) is monotonically decreasing on [1,2].4. Periodicity and Extrema:   From f(1-x) + f(1+x) = 0, we also derive that f(x) = -f(2+x). This relationship suggests a periodic behavior with a period of 4, as f(x+4) = -f(x+2) = f(x). This periodicity implies that the function repeats its values every 4 units along the x-axis.   - The period of f(x) is 4.   Given this periodicity and the monotonic behavior on [0,2], f(x) attains a minimum value at x=2 within one period and will attain maximum values at x=0, 4, 8, ldots, 4k for k in mathbb{Z}.   - f(x) attains a minimum value at x=2 and maximum values at x=0, 4, 8, ldots, 4k for k in mathbb{Z}.Therefore, based on the analysis:- Statement A is incorrect because f(x) is decreasing on [1,2].- Statement B is correct because the function exhibits symmetry about the point (1,0).- Statement C is correct because f(x) attains a minimum value at x=2.- Statement D is incorrect because f(x) does have maximum values at specific points.Hence, the correct choices are boxed{BC}."},{"problem":"1.

Applying the Law of Sines to find the radius R of the circumcircle:    frac{a}{sin A} = 2R implies R = frac{a}{2sin A} = frac{3}{sqrt{3}} = 2sqrt{3}    Further, expressing sin B sin C using b and c yields:    sin B sin C = frac{b}{2R} cdot frac{c}{2R} = frac{bc}{4R^2} = frac{bc}{48} = frac{2}{3}    Solving for bc gives bc = 8.

It should be fairly obvious that n geq 3; so we may break up the initial condition into two sub-conditions.(1) 5^n equiv n pmod{8}. Notice that the square of any odd integer is 1 modulo 8 (proof by plugging in 1^2,3^2,5^2,7^2 into modulo 8), so the LHS of this expression goes 5,1,5,1,ldots, while the RHS goes 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,1,ldots. The cycle length of the LHS is 2, RHS is 8, so the cycle length of the solution is operatorname{lcm}(2,8)=8. Indeed, the n that solve this congruence are exactly those such that n equiv 5 pmod{8}.(2) 2^n equiv n pmod{125}. This is extremely computationally intensive if we try to calculate all 2^1,2^2,ldots,2^{100} pmod{125}, so we take a divide-and-conquer approach instead. In order for this expression to be true, 2^n equiv n pmod{5} is necessary; it shouldn't take too long for us to go through the 20 possible LHS-RHS combinations, considering that n must be odd. We only need to test 10 values of n and obtain n equiv 3 pmod{20} or n equiv 17 pmod{20}.With this in mind we consider 2^n equiv n pmod{25}. By the Generalized Fermat's Little Theorem, 2^{20} equiv 1 pmod{25}, but we already have n modulo 20. Our calculation is greatly simplified. The LHS's cycle length is 20 and the RHS's cycle length is 25, from which their least common multiple is 100. In this step we need to test all the numbers between 1 to 100 that n equiv 3 pmod{20} or n equiv 17 pmod{20}. In the case that n equiv 3 pmod{20}, the RHS goes 3,23,43,63,83, and we need 2^n equiv n equiv 2^3 pmod{25}; clearly n equiv 83 pmod{100}. In the case that n equiv 17 pmod{20}, by a similar argument, n equiv 97 pmod{100}. In the final step, we need to calculate 2^{97} and 2^{83} modulo 125:Note that 2^{97}equiv2^{-3}; because 8cdot47=376equiv1pmod{125}, we get 2^{97} equiv 47pmod{125}. Note that 2^{83} is 2^{-17}=2^{-16}cdot2^{-1}. We havebegin{align*} 2^{-1}&equiv63,  2^{-2}&equiv63^2=3969equiv-31,  2^{-4}&equiv(-31)^2=961equiv-39,  2^{-8}&equiv1521equiv21,  2^{-16}&equiv441,  2^{-17}&equiv63cdot441equiv7cdot(-31)=-217equiv33. end{align*} This time, LHS cycle is 100, RHS cycle is 125, so we need to figure out n modulo 500. It should be n equiv 283,297 pmod{500}.Put everything together. By the second subcondition, the only candidates less than 1000 are 283,297,783,797.

The share of balloons taken by the first child is1+(N-1) / 10=xThe share of the last child is x. The share of the second-to-last child can be written as:(n-1)+x / 9=N / x-1+x / 9=xsince 9 / 10 of the number of balloons remaining after the second-to-last child took (n-1) balloons is x, meaning the additional 1 / 10 part of the remainder he took, in addition to (n-1) balloons, is (1/9)x. From the relation indicating the share of the first child, it follows thatN=10 x-9then the expression defining the share of the second-to-last child gives(10 x-9) / x-1+x / 9=xThe last equation can be rewritten as:8 x^{2}-81 x+81=0or(x-9)(8 x-9)=0Since the number of balloons each child received is an integer, the only possible solution is: x=9.

This means that the sum of the digits of B is not more than 6 cdot 9 = 54.

In this sentence, the nouns \\"sky\\" and \\"world,\\" similar to \\"earth\\" and \\"sun,\\" would typically require the definite article \\"the\\" for specificity. However, if these nouns are preceded by adjectives, an indefinite article can be added before the adjective to indicate a general reference; for example, \\"a red sun\\" means a red sun in general. In this sentence, \\"a bluer sky\\" refers to a generally bluer sky, and \\"a less polluted world\\" means a generally cleaner world. The meaning of the sentence is: If we do not create a cleaner world, we cannot expect to see a bluer sky.

This is because for any two points to be aligned vertically (parallel to the y-axis), their horizontal positions (x-coordinates) must not change.The coordinates of point A are given as (-4,3).

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find all prime numbers ( p ) such that ( p + 1 ) is equal to the product of all prime numbers smaller than ( p ).2. Using Bonse's Inequality:   Bonse's inequality states that for ( n geq 5 ), the product of the first ( n-1 ) primes is greater than the square of the ( n )-th prime:   [   p_1 p_2 cdots p_{n-1} > p_n^2   ]   Here, ( p_n ) denotes the ( n )-th prime number.3. Applying Bonse's Inequality:   Suppose ( p ) is the ( n )-th prime number. Then, we have:   [   p + 1 = p_1 p_2 cdots p_{n-1}   ]   According to Bonse's inequality, for ( n geq 5 ):   [   p_1 p_2 cdots p_{n-1} > p_n^2   ]   This implies:   [   p + 1 > p^2   ]   which is impossible because ( p + 1 leq p^2 ) for ( p geq 5 ).4. Checking Smaller Primes:   Since ( n geq 5 ) leads to a contradiction, we need to check the cases for ( n leq 4 ):   - For ( n = 1 ): ( p = 2 )     [     p + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 quad text{and} quad text{product of primes less than } 2 = 1 quad (text{no primes less than } 2)     ]     This does not satisfy the condition.   - For ( n = 2 ): ( p = 3 )     [     p + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 quad text{and} quad text{product of primes less than } 3 = 2     ]     This does not satisfy the condition.   - For ( n = 3 ): ( p = 5 )     [     p + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6 quad text{and} quad text{product of primes less than } 5 = 2 times 3 = 6     ]     This satisfies the condition.   - For ( n = 4 ): ( p = 7 )     [     p + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8 quad text{and} quad text{product of primes less than } 7 = 2 times 3 times 5 = 30     ]     This does not satisfy the condition.5.

First, calculate the number of regions formed by s lines that are not parallel to each other and no three of which are concurrent.Let a_{n} represent the number of regions formed by n lines that are not parallel to each other and no three of which are concurrent.When we add one more line, it intersects the previous n lines at n points, meaning this new line is divided into n+1 segments (line segments and rays), and each segment divides the original region into two.Thus, adding one more line increases the number of regions by n+1, so a_{n+1}=a_{n}+(n+1).It is easy to see that a_{1}=2, so a_{n}=a_{n-1}+n=a_{n-2}+(n-1)+n=cdots=n+(n-1)+cdots+3+2+2=1+frac{n(n+1)}{2} .Therefore, s lines divide the plane into 1+frac{s(s+1)}{2} regions.Since each horizontal line intersects these s lines at s points, this horizontal line is divided into s+1 segments, and each segment divides the original region into two.That is, adding one horizontal line increases the number of regions by s+1.Thus, after adding h horizontal lines, the number of regions in the plane is h(s+1)+1+frac{s(s+1)}{2}=1992,which simplifies to (s+1)(2 h+s)=2 times 11 times 181, so we haveTherefore, the desired pairs of positive integers (h, s) are (995,1),(176,10),(80,21)."},{"problem":"8.

Optimality Proof:   Let ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n ) be the students, with scores ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_n ) arranged in descending order. We need to show that:   [   p_1 + p_n le m(n-1).   ]   To do this, we will prove a stronger statement:   [   p_1 + frac{p_2 + p_3 + cdots + p_n}{n-1} le m(n-1).   ]   This implies that ( p_1 + p_n le m(n-1) ) because ( p_n le frac{p_2 + p_3 + cdots + p_n}{n-1} ).3.

We can reduce the q odd by -2 and thus obtain p^{a} equiv 1-(-1)^{n}(q).1st case: n even Then p^{a} equiv 0(q) and therefore p=q. Assuming n geq 3, then -1 equiv(p-2) p^{a}(8) follows.

Combine the terms over a common denominator:   [   1 + frac{1}{k^{2}} + frac{1}{(k+1)^2} = 1 + frac{(k+1)^2 + k^2}{k^2(k+1)^2}   ]4. Expand and simplify the numerator:   [   (k+1)^2 + k^2 = k^2 + 2k + 1 + k^2 = 2k^2 + 2k + 1   ]5.

Taking the square root:   [   sqrt{1 + frac{1}{k^{2}} + frac{1}{(k+1)^2}} = frac{k^2 + k + 1}{k(k+1)}   ]10. Therefore, the sum becomes:    [    sum_{k=1}^{40} frac{k^2 + k + 1}{k(k+1)}    ]11. Simplify the fraction:    [    frac{k^2 + k + 1}{k(k+1)} = frac{k^2}{k(k+1)} + frac{k}{k(k+1)} + frac{1}{k(k+1)} = frac{k}{k+1} + frac{1}{k} - frac{1}{k+1}    ]12.

Understanding the problem: We need to find the number of binary strings of length 10 that have an even number of ones and no two consecutive zeros.2. Counting the number of ones: Since the number of ones must be even, the possible counts of ones are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.3. No two consecutive zeros: This condition implies that every zero must be followed by a one. Therefore, the string can be broken down into segments of alternating ones and zeros, starting and ending with a one.4. Formulating the problem: Let's denote the number of ones by ( k ). The number of zeros will then be ( 10 - k ). Since no two zeros can be consecutive, the zeros must be placed in the gaps between ones.5. Placing the zeros: If we have ( k ) ones, there are ( k + 1 ) possible positions to place the zeros (before the first one, between ones, and after the last one). We need to place ( 10 - k ) zeros in these ( k + 1 ) positions.6. Counting valid strings:   - For ( k = 0 ): There is only 1 string, which is \\"0000000000\\", but it does not satisfy the condition of no two consecutive zeros.   - For ( k = 2 ): We need to place 8 zeros in 3 positions, which is not possible.   - For ( k = 4 ): We need to place 6 zeros in 5 positions. The number of ways to do this is (binom{5}{6} = 0).   - For ( k = 6 ): We need to place 4 zeros in 7 positions. The number of ways to do this is (binom{7}{4} = 35).   - For ( k = 8 ): We need to place 2 zeros in 9 positions. The number of ways to do this is (binom{9}{2} = 36).   - For ( k = 10 ): We need to place 0 zeros in 11 positions. The number of ways to do this is (binom{11}{0} = 1).7. Summing up the valid strings:    [   binom{7}{4} + binom{9}{2} + binom{11}{0} = 35 + 36 + 1 = 72   ]The final answer is (boxed{72})"},{"problem":"If the equation x^{2}+y^{2}+2kx+4y+3k+8=0 represents a circle whose center is in the third quadrant, then the range of values for k is ______.","solution":"AnalysisFirst, we convert the general equation of the circle into its standard form.

Given that triangle ( ABC ) is isosceles with ( AC = BC ) and ( angle C = 120^circ ). Points ( D ) and ( E ) are chosen on segment ( AB ) such that ( AD = DE = EB ).2. Since ( AD = DE = EB ), point ( D ) divides ( AB ) into three equal segments. Let ( M ) be the midpoint of ( AB ). Then ( D ) and ( E ) are symmetric with respect to ( M ).3. Consider the projections of ( D ) and ( E ) onto ( AC ) and ( BC ) respectively. Let ( K ) be the projection of ( D ) onto ( AC ) and ( L ) be the projection of ( E ) onto ( BC ).4. Since ( D ) and ( E ) are equidistant from ( A ) and ( B ), and ( M ) is the midpoint of ( AB ), we have ( DK = frac{1}{2}AD = DM ). Thus, ( DK = DM ), implying that ( CD ) is the bisector of ( angle ACM ).5. Since ( angle ACB = 120^circ ) and ( M ) is the midpoint of ( AB ), ( angle ACM = 60^circ ). Therefore, ( angle DCM = 30^circ ).6. Similarly, ( angle ECL = 30^circ ) because ( E ) is symmetric to ( D ) with respect to ( M ).7. Now, consider triangle ( CDE ).

Suppose there exists a positive integer n with f(n) leq n.We show inductively that for each integers r geq 0 there exists an integer s geq 1 with f^{s}(n)= f(n)+r. For r=0 take s=1. Induction step: Suppose that f^{s}(n)=f(n)+r for some integer s geq 1. Denote t=f^{s-1}(n) and note that f(n)+r+1=f^{s}(n)+1=f(t)+1=f^{g(t)}(t)= f^{g(t)+s-1}(n), hence s^{prime}=g(t)+s-1 geq 1 works for r+1.In particular, setting r=n-f(n) geq 0 we see that f^{s}(n)=n for some s geq 1. This contradicts the previous claim.Now, for all positive integers m and n we obtainf^{m}(n) geq f^{m-1}(n)+1 geq ldots geq f(n)+m-1Set m=g(n).

Let's call these 6 teams successful, and the remaining 9 teams unsuccessful. We will call a game between two successful teams an internal game, and a game between a successful and an unsuccessful team an external game.First, note that for each game, the participating teams collectively earn no more than 3 points. Clearly, there were exactly frac{6 cdot 5}{2}=15 internal games, and only from these games did all successful teams collectively earn no more than 15 cdot 3=45 points. There were exactly 6 cdot 9=54 external games, and in each such game, a successful team earned no more than 3 points. Therefore, collectively, all successful teams earned no more than 54 cdot 3=162 points from external games. According to the problem, the successful teams collectively earned at least 6 mathrm{~N} points, so we get the inequality 6 N leqslant 45+162. From this, it follows that N leqslant frac{207}{6}<35 and N leqslant 34. Now let's provide an example for N=34. Number the teams from 1 to 15. We will show how teams from 1 to 6 can earn at least 34 points.- Suppose each team from 1 to 6 won against each team from 7 to 15, then each team from 1 to 6 earned 9 cdot 3=27 points just from these games.- Suppose teams from 1 to 6 played among themselves as indicated in the following table (in each cell, the number of points is shown that the team from the corresponding row received in the game with the team from the corresponding column):|  | mathbf{1} | mathbf{2} | mathbf{3} | mathbf{4} | mathbf{5} | mathbf{6} || :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- || mathbf{1} |  | 3 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 || mathbf{2} | 0 |  | 3 | 3 | 1 | 0 || mathbf{3} | 0 | 0 |  | 3 | 3 | 1 || mathbf{4} | 1 | 0 | 0 |  | 3 | 3 || mathbf{5} | 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 |  | 3 || mathbf{6} | 3 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 0 |  |- Suppose in each game between teams from 7 to 15, the team with the higher number won (the outcome of these games does not matter).In total, teams from 1 to 6 earned at least 27+7=34 points."},{"problem":"37.

We have 8 lights, so there are 7 gaps between these lights. However, since we cannot turn off adjacent lights, we cannot consider the first and last positions as valid gaps for inserting an off light. This effectively reduces our usable gaps to those between the 5 remaining on lights after choosing 3 to be off, which gives us 6 gaps (one less than the number of on lights).Now, we need to place 3 off lights into these 6 gaps.

Derivative of f(x):   To understand the behavior of f(x), we find its derivative:   [   f'(x) = e^x(x+1) + 1   ]   Let g(x) = e^x(x+1) + 1. Then, the derivative of g(x) is:   [   g'(x) = e^x(x+2)   ]4. Monotonicity of g(x):   - For x > -2, g'(x) > 0, indicating g(x) is monotonically increasing on (-2, +infty).   - For x  0.5. Monotonicity of f(x):   Since f'(x) = g(x) geqslant g(-2) > 0, f(x) is monotonically increasing on mathbb{R}.6. Simplification to x > lnfrac{x}{lambda}:   The original inequality simplifies to x > lnfrac{x}{lambda}, which implies ln lambda > ln x - x.7. Finding the Maximum of ln x - x:   Let h(x) = ln x - x for x > 0. The derivative h'(x) = frac{1-x}{x}. Setting h'(x) = 0 gives x = 1.   - For 0  0, indicating h(x) is monotonically increasing.   - For x > 1, h'(x)  -1, the range of lambda is:   [   boxed{(frac{1}{e}, +infty)}   ]Therefore, the range of lambda that satisfies the given inequality is boxed{(frac{1}{e}, +infty)}."},{"problem":"Given a triangle ABC, the lengths of the sides opposite to angles A, B, C are a, b, c respectively, and acosB= frac{1}{2}b+c.(I) Find the measure of angle A;(II) Let R be the radius of the circumcircle of triangle ABC, find the value of frac{b^{2}+c^{2}+bc}{4R^{2}}.","solution":"(I) By the sine law, we have sinAcosB= frac{1}{2}sinA+sinC.Since sinC=sin(A+B), this implies sinAcosB= frac{1}{2}sinA+sinAcosB+cosAsinB.Rearranging the terms, we get cosAsinB+ frac{1}{2}sinB=0.Thus, cosA=- frac{1}{2}.Since 0<A<π, we have A= frac{2π}{3}.(II) By the cosine law, we have b^{2}+c^{2}-a^{2}=2bccosA=-bc.Thus, frac{b^{2}+c^{2}+bc}{4R^{2}}=frac{a^{2}}{4R^{2}}=sin^{2}A.Since A= frac{2π}{3}, we have sin^{2}A= frac{3}{4}.Therefore, boxed{frac{b^{2}+c^{2}+bc}{4R^{2}}=sin^{2}A= frac{3}{4}}."},{"problem":"4.

The king changes at least one of its coordinates by one with each move. We will show that the point with coordinates (i ; j) can be reached by the king in a maximum of (|i|,|j|) moves, but not in fewer. (Here, max (|i|,|j|) denotes the larger of the numbers |i| and |j|.) Indeed, if |i|>|j|, then the king should move |j| times such that with each move, the first coordinate increases by one if i>0, or decreases by one if i<0. The second coordinate should change similarly depending on the sign of j. Then, it should make |i|-|j| more moves such that the first coordinate changes as before, while the second remains unchanged. Thus, it reaches the point (i ; j) in a total of |i| moves. It cannot reach this point in fewer moves because with each move, the first coordinate can change by at most one.

The fractions formed by two of these numbers in ascending order are (frac{1}{n}, frac{2}{n}, frac{1}{2}, frac{2}{2}, frac{2}{1}, frac{n}{2}, frac{n}{1}). Since the indices (i, j, k, l) are distinct, (frac{1}{n}) and (frac{2}{n}) cannot be chosen simultaneously. Therefore the minimum value of the left-hand side of (1) is (frac{1}{2} - frac{2}{n}). When (n) tends to infinity, this value approaches (frac{1}{2}), and so (C) cannot be less than (frac{1}{2}).These conclude that (C = frac{1}{2}) is the smallest possible choice. Comment.

Given Recursive Formula: a_{n+1}=a_{n}+2(n+1), for nin N^{*}, and a_{1}=2.2. Expressing the Difference: From the recursive formula, we can express the difference between consecutive terms as a_{n+1}-a_{n}=2(n+1).3. Initial Condition: It's given that a_{1}=2, which can be expressed as 2times 1.4. Calculating Differences for Consecutive Terms:   - For n=2: a_{2}-a_{1}=2times 2,   - For n=3: a_{3}-a_{2}=2times 3,   - Continuing this pattern up to n: a_{n}-a_{n-1}=2times n.5.

Claim 1: (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k geq 0)   Proof: Suppose for the sake of contradiction that (a_1) is the minimum and (a_1 < 0). Let (a = -a_1). Then, for some (x), we have:   [   f^a(x) = x + a + a_1 = x implies f^a(x) = x   ]   This implies that (f) has a periodic point with period (a). Now, for some (a_j), we have:   [   f^{2a}(x) = f^a(f^a(x)) = f^a(x) = x implies x + 2a + a_j = x implies -2a = a_j   ]   But we had (a_1 < 0) as the minimum, leading to (2a_1 = a_j), which is a contradiction.

Thus:   [   f^2(x) = x + M + 2   ]3. Similarly, if for (i = 1, ldots, l), (f^l(x) = x + M + l), then:   [   f^{l+1}(x) = f(f^l(x)) = f(x + M + l) = x + M + l + 1 + a_i   ]   Also:   [   f^{l+1}(x) = x + l + 1 + a_j   ]   So we get:   [   M + l + 1 + a_i = l + 1 + a_j implies M + a_i = a_j implies a_i = 0, a_j = M   ]   Therefore, for all (j), (f^j(x) = x + j + M).4.

Let ( a_i = s_{i+1} - s_i ) and let the (minimal) period of ( a_i ) be ( m ). We aim to show that ( m = 1 ), which implies that ( s_i ) is an arithmetic progression. Consequently, all values of ( N ) are precisely those satisfying ( k^2 leq N < k^2 + k ) for some positive integer ( k ).2. Let ( s_m - s_0 = t ). Notice that ( s_{i+m} - s_i = sum_{j=i}^{i+m-1} a_j = sum_{j=0}^{m-1} a_j = t ), meaning that this difference is constant across all ( i ). It also follows that for any number ( k ), if ( m mid i - j ), then ( s_{i+k} - s_i = s_{j+k} - s_j ), so the difference of two terms of the sequence that are ( k ) apart is constant as the indices of these terms are fixed modulo ( m ).3. Let ( d = gcd(m, t) ).4. The key idea is to consider minimizing the value of ( s_{s_{n+1}+1} - s_{s_n} ) (as this minimum value must be greater than ( s_{s_{i+1}} - s_{s_i} ) for all ( i )). In this expression, if ( n ) increments by multiples of ( m ), then the indices ( s_{n+1}+1 ) and ( s_n ) increment by multiples of ( t ), so their difference is constant (namely ( a_n + 1 )), and furthermore, ( s_n ) and ( s_{n+1}+1 ) each achieve, modulo ( m ), precisely all numbers in an arithmetic sequence of common difference ( d ). It then follows that the minimum value can achieve the minimum value of ( s_{x+a_n+1} - s_x ) over ( x ) congruent to ( s_n ) modulo ( d ).5. Claim: If ( d mid s_i - s_j ), then ( a_i = a_j ).   *Proof:* Assume otherwise, and without loss of generality that ( a_i > a_j ). Let ( x ) be a number such that ( x equiv s_j mod d ) and for all ( y equiv s_j mod d ), ( s_{y+a_j+1} - s_y geq s_{x+a_j+1} - s_x ). By Bézout's identity, there exists a positive integer ( k ) such that ( s_{j+km} = s_j + kt equiv x mod m ). We thus have that   [   s_{s_{j+1+km}+1} - s_{s_{j+km}} = s_{s_{j+km}+a_j+1} - s_{s_{j+km}} = s_{x+a_j+1} - s_x leq s_{s_i+a_j+1} - s_{s_i} leq s_{s_{i+1}} - s_{s_i}   ]   which is a contradiction. (blacksquare)6. By the Pigeonhole Principle, there exist ( i, j in {0, 1, ldots, d} ) with ( i > j ) such that ( d mid s_i - s_j ). The claim implies that whenever ( d mid s_i - s_j ), we have that ( d mid s_{i+1} - s_{j+1} ), and inductively, ( d mid s_{i+k} - s_{j+k} ) for all positive integers ( k ). Hence, the sequence ( s_j, s_{j+1}, s_{j+2}, ldots ) is periodic modulo ( d ) with a period of ( i - j ). The claim now implies that ( a_j, a_{j+1}, a_{j+2}, ldots ) is periodic with a period of ( i - j ). Yet, ( m ) is the minimal period of ( a_1, a_2, ldots ), so consequently, ( m mid i - j ). As ( i - j leq d ), it follows that ( m = d ) and ( i = d ), ( j = 0 ). In particular, this means that the sequence ( s ) is periodic modulo ( m ) with period ( m ), and ( s_0, s_1, ldots, s_{m-1} ) are distinct modulo ( m ).7. To finish, let ( a_n ) be the maximal element of the ( a ) sequence, and let ( s_{n+1} equiv c mod m ). Now, let ( n_1 ) be a positive integer such that ( s_{n_1+1} equiv c-1 mod m ) (which we know exists since the sequence ( s ) is surjective and periodic modulo ( m )). If it were the case that ( a_{n_1} < a_n ), we would have   [   s_{s_{n+1}} - s_{s_n} < s_{s_{n_1+1}+1} - s_{s_{n_1}} = s_{s_{n+1}} - s_{s_{n_1} + s_{n+1} - s_{n_1+1} - 1} leq s_{s_{n+1}} - s_{s_n}   ]   which cannot hold. Thus we have that ( a_{n_1} = a_n ). By constructing a sequence ( n_2, ldots, n_{m-1} ) satisfying ( s_{n_i+1} equiv c-i mod m ) and repeating the above argument, we see that ( a_n = a_{n_1} = ldots = a_{n_{m-1}} ). Clearly, ( n, n_1, ldots, n_{m-1} ) are distinct modulo ( m ), so the sequence ( a ) must be constant, as desired.The final answer is ( boxed{ k^2 leq N < k^2 + k } ) for some positive integer ( k )."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)= begin{cases} 1-x^{2},xleqslant 1  x^{2}+x-2,x > 1end{cases}, find the value of f( dfrac {1}{f(2)}).","solution":"Since 2 > 1, we have f(2)=2^{2}+2-2=4.Then, dfrac {1}{f(2)}= dfrac {1}{4}leqslant 1.So, f( dfrac {1}{f(2)})=1-( dfrac {1}{4})^{2}= dfrac {15}{16}.Thus, the answer is boxed{dfrac {15}{16}}.This problem involves evaluating a piecewise function.

Solve for x by adding 1 to both sides: x = 1 pm sqrt{2}.Thus, the solutions for equation (1) are x = 1 + sqrt{2} and x = 1 - sqrt{2}. Therefore, we can encapsulate the final answer as:boxed{x = 1 pm sqrt{2}} For Equation (2): x^2 - 6x - 7 = 01. Start with the given equation: x^2 - 6x - 7 = 0.2.

Function Analysis and Graph ConstructionThe construction of the graph of a given function y=f(x) is preceded by a complete analysis of the function, which includes identifying the characteristic properties and peculiarities of the function. These include: the domain of definition D=D(f), the range of values E(f), continuity, differentiability, evenness, oddness, boundedness, periodicity of the function, its intervals of sign constancy, monotonicity, convexity/concavity, the presence of asymptotes (vertical, horizontal, oblique). In addition, it is necessary to determine characteristic points: points of discontinuity, points of intersection of the graph with the coordinate axes, points of extremum (maximum, minimum), points of inflection, etc.First, let's recall the definitions of the concepts that were not covered earlier.A function y=f(x) is called:- even, if f(-x)=f(x), x in D;- odd, if f(-x)=-f(x), x in D;- bounded above (below), if there exists a number M(m) such that f(x) leqslant M(f(x) geqslant m), x in D;- bounded, if it is bounded both above and below;- periodic, if there exists a number T>0 such that f(x+T)=f(x), x in D.The analysis of a function is carried out according to a certain scheme, the points of which we will establish as we go through the analysis. Note that if we do not have positive information on some criteria, the corresponding point can be omitted.## Examples of Graph Construction"},{"problem":"## Task A-1.1.On the side overline{A B} of triangle A B C, there are points P_{1}, P_{2} and P_{3} such thatleft|A P_{1}right|=left|P_{1} P_{2}right|=left|P_{2} P_{3}right|=left|P_{3} Bright|=frac{1}{4}|A B|Parallel lines to side overline{B C} are drawn through these points, dividing the triangle into four parts.

For  m = 2 ,  n = 2 , the statement 1 is true.Let us fix two natural numbers  m ,  n  with a sum greater than  4  and assume that statement 1 is true for any chessboard with a sum of dimensions less than  m + n . Consider any set  A  composed of  m + n  squares of a chessboard  S  with dimensions  m times n . The following three cases are possible:there exists a row or column of the chessboard  S  that does not contain any square from the set  A ;there exists a row or column of the chessboard  S  that contains exactly one square from the set  A ;in each row and each column, there are at least two squares from the set  A .om51_3r_img_4.jpgIn case (a), we remove from the chessboard  S  that column (or row) which does not contain any square from the set  A . We then remove any square from the set  A  (in the figure, the squares of set  A  are marked with circles). In this way, we obtain a new chessboard that contains a certain set  A  composed of  m + n - 1  squares and whose sum of dimensions is equal to  m + n - 1  (fig. 2). Hence, each of the dimensions of the obtained chessboard is not less than  2 . Therefore, by the inductive assumption, one can select from the set  A  a non-empty subset having an even number of squares in each row and each column. By reinserting the removed column or removed row back into its place (fig. 3), we obtain the desired subset of the set  A .om51_3r_img_5.jpgWe proceed similarly in case (b): we first find a column (or row) that contains exactly one square from the set  A , and then remove that column from the chessboard  S  (fig. 4). As a result, we obtain a new chessboard that contains a certain set  A'  composed of  m + n - 1  squares and whose sum of dimensions is equal to  m + n - 1  (fig. 5). As above, we apply the inductive assumption, and then reinsert the removed column or removed row (fig. 6).Consider case (c). Let  k_1,k_2,ldots,k_n, w_1,w_2,ldots,w_m  denote, respectively, the numbers of squares of the set  A  in the individual columns and rows. ThenMoreover,  k_i,w_j geq 2  for all  i ,  j . Hence,  k_i = w_j = 2 . This means that the set  A  has exactly two squares in each column and each row. This implies that the number of squares of the set  A  in each row and each column is even.The inductive proof, and thus the proof of statement 1, is complete.Proof of statement 2.om51_3r_img_6.jpgConsider the set  A  composed of all  m + n - 1  squares of a chessboard with dimensions  m times n  located in the bottom row and the first column (fig. 7).

Considering (k = 2):   - If (k = 2), then (A = x(x+1)) for some integer (x).   - For (n > 0), (A) is very large, specifically (A > 17^{2006n}).   - This implies (x > 17^{1003n}), which is a contradiction because (x(x+1)) cannot grow as fast as (17^{2006n}).   - For (n = 0), (A = 17^0 + 4 cdot 17^0 + 7 cdot 19^0 = 1 + 4 + 7 = 12).

Considering (k = 3):   - If (k = 3), then (A = (x-1)x(x+1)) for some integer (x).   - Here, (x) must be even because the product of three consecutive integers is divisible by 2.   - Consider (A mod 5):     - If (n) is even, (A equiv 2 mod 5).     - If (n) is odd, (A equiv -2 equiv 3 mod 5).   - The product ((x-1)x(x+1)) modulo 5 can be 0, (pm 1), but not 2 or 3.   - Therefore, there are no solutions for (k = 3).4.

Into how many parts do the diagonals of a convex n-gon divide it if no three of them intersect at the same point?","solution":"45. First solution. Let the desired number for a convex n-gon be denoted by f_{n}. We will derive a relation connecting f_{n} with f_{n+1}. Consider any convex (n+1)-gon; denote all its vertices, taken in a certain order, by the letters A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, ldots, A_{n}, A_{n+1} (Fig. 59). Draw the diagonal A_{1} A_{n}. The polygon with vertices A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{n} is a convex n-gon. Draw all the diagonals in it; they will also be diagonals of the (n+1)-gon. To obtain all the diagonals of the (n+1)-gon, we need to connect the (n+1)-th vertex to the other vertices with n-2 diagonals. Consider the diagonal connecting the (n+1)-th vertex to the k-th vertex (k=2,3,4, ldots, n-1). On one side of this diagonal, there will be k-1 vertices (vertices A_{1}, A_{2}, ldots, A_{k-1}), and on the other side, n-k vertices (vertices A_{k+1}, left.A_{k+2}, ldots, A_{n}right). Therefore, the diagonal A_{n+1} A_{k} will intersect (k-1)(n-k) diagonals of the (n+1)-gon. The points of intersection will divide this diagonal into (k-1)(n-k)+1 parts. Therefore, it will add (k-1)(n-k)+1 parts to the (n+1)-gon. The diagonals not passing through A_{n+1} will divide the (n+1)-gon into f_{n}+1 parts (f_{n} parts of the n-gon A_{1} A_{2} ldots A_{n} and the left(f_{n}+1right)-th part — the triangle left.A_{n+1} A_{1} A_{n}right). After drawing the diagonals from A_{n+1}, the following parts will be added to the f_{n}+1 parts of the (n+1)-gon:begin{aligned}{[(2-1)(n-2)+1]+} & {[(3-1)(n-3)+1]-ldots } & ldots+[((n-1)-1)(n-(n-1))+1]end{aligned}Thus, we have:begin{aligned}& f_{n+1}=f_{n}+(2-1)(n-2)+(3-1)(n-3)+ldots & ldots+[(n-1)-1][n-(n-1)]+n-1end{aligned}But { }^{1} )begin{aligned}& (2-1)(n-2)+(3-1)(n-3)+ldots & ldots+[(n-1)-1][n-(n-1)]= & =1 cdot(n-2)+2(n-3)+ldots+(n-2)(n-(n-1))= & =n+2 n+ldots+(n-2) n- & quad-[1 cdot 2+2 cdot 3+ldots+(n-2)(n-1)]= & =n frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}-frac{(n-2)(n-1) n}{3}=frac{(n-2)(n-1) n}{6} .end{aligned}Therefore,f_{n+1}=f_{n}+frac{(n-2)(n-1) n}{6}+n-1and similarlybegin{aligned}& f_{n}=f_{n-1}+frac{(n-3)(n-2)(n-1)}{6}+n-2 & cdots cdots cdot cdots cdot cdots & f_{4}=f_{3}+frac{1 cdot 2 cdot 3}{6}+2 & f_{3}=1end{aligned}1) See footnote on page 181.Adding all these equations, we get:begin{aligned}f_{n+1}=frac{1 cdot 2 cdot 3}{6}+frac{2 cdot 3 cdot 4}{6}+ldots & +frac{(n-2)(n-1) n}{6}+ & +(1+2+3+ldots+(n-1))end{aligned}Since { }^{1} )begin{aligned}1 cdot 2 cdot 3+2 cdot 3 cdot 4+3 cdot 4 cdot 5+cdots & +(n-2)(n-1) n= & =frac{(n-2)(n-1) n(n+1)}{4}end{aligned}we finally havef_{n+1}=frac{(n-2)(n-1) n(n+1)}{24}+frac{n(n-1)}{2}Therefore,begin{aligned}f_{n} & =frac{(n-3)(n-2)(n-1) n}{24}+frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}= & =frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{24}left[n^{2}-3 n+12right] .end{aligned}Thus,f_{n}=frac{(n-1)(n-2)left(n^{2}-3 n+12right)}{24}Substituting n=3,4,5, ldots into this formula, we get:f_{3}=1, f_{4}=4, f_{5}=11, f_{6}=25, f_{7}=50, f_{8}=82, ldotsFrom the obtained result, in particular, it follows that if no three diagonals of a convex polygon intersect at the same point, then the number of parts into which the polygon is divided by its diagonals does not depend on the shape of the polygon but only on the number of its vertices.Second solution. The diagonals of an n-gon divide it into parts, each of which is, obviously, a polygon. Let the number of triangles among them be denoted by r_{3}, the number of quadrilaterals by r_{4}, the number of pentagons by r_{5}, and so on, finally, the number of m-gons by r_{m} (where m is the largest number of sides of the polygons formed by the diagonals of the n-gon). We need to find the sumf_{n}=r_{8}+r_{4}+r_{5}+ldots+r_{m}Let's find the sum of the number of vertices of all polygons into which the n-gon is divided by its diagonals. On the one hand, this sum is obviously equal to3 r_{3}+4 r_{4}+5 r_{5}+ldots+m r_{m}On the other hand, each of the points of intersection of the diagonals of the n-gon is a vertex of four polygons adjacent to this point, and each of the vertices of the n-gon is a vertex of n-2 polygons adjacent to this vertex (Fig. 60). Since the number of points of intersection of the diagonals of the n-gon is frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{24} (see problem 44), and the number of vertices of the n-gon is n, the sum of the number of vertices of all polygons into which the n-gon is divided by its diagonals is equal to4 frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{24}+(n-2) n=frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{6"},{"problem":"Among the following expressions, the correct one is(()　　())A: 2 sqrt {3} subseteq {x|x < 4}B: 2 sqrt {3} in {x|x < 4}C: {2 sqrt {3}} in {x|x < 4}D: {2 sqrt {3}} subseteq {x|x < 3}","solution":"To solve this, we use the element-to-set relationship denoted by in, and the set-to-set relationship denoted by subseteq.

[5] 2021 people are sitting around a circular table. In one move, you may swap the positions of two people sitting next to each other. Determine the minimum number of moves necessary to make each person end up 1000 positions to the left of their original position.","solution":"Answer: 1021000Solution 1: We claim that the answer is 1000 cdot 1021=1021000. To see how we can obtain this, label the people around the table s_{1}, s_{2}, ldots, s_{2021}. We then start with s_{1} and swap them 1000 positions to the left, then we take s_{2} and swap them 1000 positions to the left, and so on until we swap s_{1021} 1000 positions to the left. We see that after swapping s_{1} 1000 positions to the left, we have s_{1022}, s_{1023}, ldots, s_{2021} still in order followed by s_{2}, s_{3}, ldots, s_{1021}, s_{1}. Further, we can show that after moving s_{k} to the left 1000 times, s_{k} is to the left of s_{1022} with the order s_{1022}, s_{1023}, ldots, s_{2021}, s_{k+1}, s_{k+2}, ldots, s_{1021}, s_{1}, s_{2}, ldots, s_{k} for 1 leq k leq 1021. As we never swap any s_{k} for 1 leq k leq 1021 other than moving it 1000 times to the left, when the operation is done, s_{1}, s_{2}, ldots, s_{1021} are all shifted 1000 places to the left followed by s_{1022}, s_{1023}, ldots, s_{2021}. Therefore, every person is shifted 1000 to the left and this is done in a total of 1000 cdot 1021 moves.Now, to prove that this is a sufficient lower bound, we note that if a total of M moves are made, then some student will move one seat left M times and one student will move right M times. In order to move every student 1000 seats to the left, we can either have them make at least 1000 total leftward movements or 1021 total rightward movements. This means that there can be at most leftlfloorfrac{M}{1000}rightrfloor students who get 1000 seats to the left via a net leftward movement and at most leftlfloorfrac{M}{1021}rightrfloor students who get 1000 seats to the left via a net rightward movement. Thus, we see thatleftlfloorfrac{M}{1000}rightrfloor+leftlfloorfrac{M}{1021}rightrfloor geq 2021 Longrightarrow M geq 1021 cdot 1000,as desired.Solution 2: After getting the same construction as above, we can let the students be labeled s_{i} for 1 leq i leq 2021, and say that in order for each student to end up 1000 spaces to the left, they are moved left a_{i} times and right b_{i} times. Then the condition is trivially equivalent to a_{i}-b_{i}=1000 bmod 2021. Further, as each move will move one person right and one person left, we see that sum_{i=1}^{2021} a_{i} and sum_{i=1}^{2021} b_{i} count the same event. Thus,sum_{i=1}^{2021} a_{i}=sum_{i=1}^{2021} b_{i} .Now, let a_{i}-b_{i}=2021 c_{i}+1000 for integer c_{i} and all 1 leq i leq 2021. We see that0=sum_{i=1}^{2021} a_{i}-sum_{i=1}^{2021} b_{i}=sum_{i=1}^{2021}left(a_{i}-b_{i}right)=sum_{i=1}^{2021}left(1000+2021 c_{i}right)=1000 cdot 2021+2021 sum_{i=1}^{2021} c_{i} .Therefore, we find thatsum_{i=1}^{2021} c_{i}=-1000 .We then can use the fact that a_{i}+b_{i} geqleft|a_{i}-b_{i}right|=left|2021 c_{i}+1000right| as both a_{i} and b_{i} are nonnegative. Further, the total number of moves is equal to both sum_{i=1}^{2021} a_{i} and sum_{i=1}^{2021} b_{i} so we can then find thatsum_{i=1}^{2021} frac{a_{i}+b_{i}}{2} geq sum_{i=1}^{2021} frac{left|a_{i}-b_{i}right|}{2}=sum_{i=1}^{2021} frac{left|2021 c_{i}+1000right|}{2} .Now, let sum_{c_{i} geq 0} c_{i}=S and sum_{c_{i}<0} c_{i}=-S-1000. Then, we find thatbegin{array}{l} sum_{i=1}^{2021} frac{left|2021 c_{i}+1000right|}{2}=sum_{c_{i} geq 0} frac{2021 c_{i}+1000}{2}+sum_{c_{i}<0} frac{-2021 c_{i}-1000}{2} = frac{2021(2 S+1000)}{2}+500left(-2021+2 sum_{c_{i} geq 0} 1right) .end{array}Combining all of this, we find thatsum_{i=1}^{2021} frac{a_{i}+b_{i}}{2} geq sum_{i=1}^{2021} frac{left|a_{i}-b_{i}right|}{2} geq frac{2021(2 S+1000)}{2}+500left(-2021+2 sum_{c_{i} geq 0} 1right)=2021 S+1000 cdot sum_{c_{i} geq 0} 1 .To finish this, we know that if sum_{c_{i}<0} c_{i}=-S-1000, then there are at most -S-1000 values of c_{i}<0, as the c_{i} with smallest absolute value is -1 . Thus, we find that2021 S+1000 cdot sum_{c_{i} geq 0} 1 geq 2021 S+1000(2021-(S+1000))=1021 S+1000 cdot 1021 .As S geq 0, we find that this makes the total number of moves, sum_{i=1}^{2021} frac{a_{i}+b_{i}}{2} at least 1000 cdot 1021. Therefore, we have our desired lower bound and the result follows."},{"problem":"Which of the following statements is correct?A: frac{1}{5} is not a monomial.B: The degree of the monomial -2xy^{2} is 2.C: The coefficient of x is 0.D: frac{1}{2}xy+3x-1 is a quadratic trinomial.","solution":"To analyze each statement step-by-step:- Statement A: A monomial is defined as an algebraic expression containing only one term. The expression frac{1}{5}, despite being a fraction, represents a single term without any variables, which qualifies it as a monomial. Therefore, the statement that frac{1}{5} is not a monomial is incorrect.  - Statement B: To find the degree of a monomial, we sum the exponents of all the variables in the term. For the monomial -2xy^{2}, the degree is calculated as 1 + 2 = 3, since the exponent of x is 1 (implied) and the exponent of y is 2. Thus, the statement that its degree is 2 is incorrect.- Statement C: The coefficient of a variable is the number that is multiplied by the variable. In the context provided, without a specific expression, this statement seems to be out of context. However, if we consider a general expression where x is present, the coefficient of x could vary. Without a specific context, this statement is ambiguous. However, assuming it refers to a context where x has a coefficient, saying the coefficient of x is 0 without specifying the context is misleading. Typically, if x is present in an expression, its coefficient is not 0 because a coefficient of 0 would imply the term does not exist.- Statement D: The expression frac{1}{2}xy + 3x - 1 is analyzed to determine if it is a quadratic trinomial. A quadratic trinomial is a polynomial of degree 2 with three terms. In this expression, the term frac{1}{2}xy is of degree 1 + 1 = 2 (since the exponents of x and y are each 1), 3x is of degree 1, and -1 is a constant term of degree 0. Therefore, the expression is not strictly a quadratic trinomial because it does not consist of three terms each of degree 2. However, the presence of a term of degree 2 aligns with the definition of a quadratic expression, albeit not strictly fitting the definition of a \\"trinomial\\" as typically understood (three terms of the same degree). Given the context of the options, this statement is considered correct in asserting that the expression is a quadratic trinomial, focusing on the presence of a term of degree 2 rather than the strict definition involving three terms of the same degree.Given the analysis above, the correct option that matches the question requirements is:boxed{D}"},{"problem":"Problem 9.1.

(Slovakia)  Answer: n can be any multiple of 3.","solution":"For the sake of convenience, extend the sequence a_{1}, ldots, a_{n+2} to an infinite periodic sequence with period n. (n is not necessarily the shortest period.) If n is divisible by 3, then left(a_{1}, a_{2}, ldotsright)=(-1,-1,2,-1,-1,2, ldots) is an obvious solution. We will show that in every periodic sequence satisfying the recurrence, each positive term is followed by two negative values, and after them the next number is positive again. From this, it follows that n is divisible by 3. If the sequence contains two consecutive positive numbers a_{i}, a_{i+1}, then a_{i+2}=a_{i} a_{i+1}+1>1, so the next value is positive as well; by induction, all numbers are positive and greater than 1. But then a_{i+2}=a_{i} a_{i+1}+1 geqslant 1 cdot a_{i+1}+1>a_{i+1} for every index i, which is impossible: our sequence is periodic, so it cannot increase everywhere. If the number 0 occurs in the sequence, a_{i}=0 for some index i, then it follows that a_{i+1}=a_{i-1} a_{i}+1 and a_{i+2}=a_{i} a_{i+1}+1 are two consecutive positive elements in the sequences and we get the same contradiction again. Notice that after any two consecutive negative numbers the next one must be positive: if a_{i}1>0. Hence, the positive and negative numbers follow each other in such a way that each positive term is followed by one or two negative values and then comes the next positive term. Consider the case when the positive and negative values alternate. So, if a_{i} is a negative value then a_{i+1} is positive, a_{i+2} is negative and a_{i+3} is positive again. Notice that a_{i} a_{i+1}+1=a_{i+2}0 we conclude a_{i}1. The number a_{i+3} must be negative. We show that a_{i+4} also must be negative. Notice that a_{i+3} is negative and a_{i+4}=a_{i+2} a_{i+3}+10, therefore a_{i+5}>a_{i+4}. Since at most one of a_{i+4} and a_{i+5} can be positive, that means that a_{i+4} must be negative.

The friends continue sharing and eating, until so many mangoshave been eaten that no one is able to share or eat anymore.Show that there are exactly eight people stuck with mangos, which can no longer beshared or eaten.","solution":"1. Initial Setup and Problem Understanding:   - We have 100 friends standing in a circle.   - Initially, one person has 2019 mangos, and no one else has any mangos.   - Sharing rules: pass 2 mangos to the left and 1 mango to the right.   - Eating rules: eat 1 mango and pass another mango to the right.   - A person can only share if they have at least 3 mangos and can only eat if they have at least 2 mangos.   - The goal is to show that there are exactly 8 people stuck with mangos that can no longer be shared or eaten.2. Binary Representation Insight:   - To solve this problem, we use the binary representation of the number of mangos.   - The binary representation of 2019 is (2019_{10} = 11111100011_2).   - The number of 1s in the binary representation of 2019 is 8.3. Binary Value Invariance:   - We define the binary value of a distribution of mangos as the sum of the product of the number of mangos and the binary place value for all the friends.   - We need to prove that neither sharing nor eating changes the binary value of a distribution.4. Proof for Eating:   - Consider three friends (A, B, C) with binary place values (2^{x-1}, 2^x, 2^{x+1}) respectively.   - Let (a, b, c) be the number of mangos they have.   - The binary value of the distribution is (2^{x-1}a + 2^xb + 2^{x+1}c).   - If (b geq 2), friend (B) can eat. After eating, (A) still has (a) mangos, (B) has (b-2) mangos, and (C) has (c+1) mangos.   - The new binary value is:     [     2^{x-1}a + 2^x(b-2) + 2^{x+1}(c+1) = 2^{x-1}a + 2^xb + 2^{x+1}c - 2(2^x) + 2^{x+1}     ]   - Since (-2(2^x) + 2^{x+1} = 0), the binary value remains unchanged.5. Proof for Sharing:   - If (b geq 3), friend (B) can share. After sharing, (A) has (a+2) mangos, (B) has (b-3) mangos, and (C) has (c+1) mangos.   - The new binary value is:     [     2^{x-1}(a+2) + 2^x(b-3) + 2^{x+1}(c+1) = 2^{x-1}a + 2^xb + 2^{x+1}c + 2(2^{x-1}) - 3(2^x) + 2^{x+1}     ]   - Since (2(2^{x-1}) + 2^{x+1} = 2^x + 2(2^x) = 3(2^x)), the binary value remains unchanged.6. Final Distribution:   - Since neither sharing nor eating changes the binary value, the final distribution must have the same binary value as the initial distribution.   - The binary value of the initial distribution is 2019.   - The final distribution must correspond to the binary representation of 2019, which has 8 ones.7. Conclusion:   - Therefore, there are exactly 8 people stuck with mangos that can no longer be shared or eaten.The final answer is (boxed{8})"},{"problem":"In acute triangle triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively, and c-2bcos A=b.

Plugging this into our equation:sin (A + B) - 2sin Bcos A = sin BRightarrow sin Acos B + cos Asin B - 2sin Bcos A = sin BRearranging and simplifying gives us:sin(A - B) = sin BGiven A, B in (0, frac{pi}{2}) (since triangle ABC is acute), we know A - B in (-frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}). In this interval, sin x is monotonically increasing, therefore:A - B = B Rightarrow A = 2BHence, we have proved that A = 2B. boxed{A = 2B}Part (2): With A = 2B established, we now consider the angle bisector of A intersecting BC at D. Given angle ABC = angle BAD and using the Law of Sines in triangle ABD, we can express AD in terms of B:frac{AD}{sin B} = frac{AB}{sin(pi - 2B)} = frac{2}{sin 2B}This gives us AD = BD = frac{1}{cos B} (since AB = c = 2 and using the double angle formula for sine).The area of triangle ABD is then calculated as:S_{triangle ABD} = frac{1}{2}AB times AD times sin B = frac{1}{2} times 2 times frac{1}{cos B} times sin B = tan BGiven the acute nature of triangle ABC, we establish bounds for B:0 < B < frac{pi}{2}, 0 < 2B < frac{pi}{2}, and 0 < pi - 3B < frac{pi}{2}Solving these inequalities gives us frac{pi}{6} < B < frac{pi}{4}.

The information about the division can then be written as:check{c}=m cdot z+check{z}, quad m=z cdot check{z} .Since the numbers must be distinct, it follows from the second equation that neither z nor check{z} is 1. This means that m is a composite number. Substituting the second equation into the first, we getcheck{c}=z^{2} cdot check{z}+check{z}=left(z^{2}+1right) cdot check{z} .From the above, we know that both z^{2}+1 and check{z} are not 1, so check{c} is also a composite number. Since both 97 and 101 are prime numbers, neither of them can be blue or red.Therefore, one of the numbers 97 and 101 is yellow and the other is green. The remaining numbers can be calculated from the initial equations:| check{z} | z | m | check{c} || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || 97 | 101 | 9797 | 989594 || 101 | 97 | 9797 | 950410 |Note. The problem can also be solved by systematically testing the possibilities: pairs of known numbers are substituted into the initial equations and the existence of the remaining pair of numbers is verified. For example, substituting check{c}=101 and m=97 into the first equation determines z=1 and check{z}=4, which does not satisfy the second equation. This method would require checking 12 possibilities.Any additional insight can reduce the number of possibilities to verify. For example (in addition to the conditions mentioned in the previous solution), it holds that check{c} is greater than any of the other numbers and m is greater than both z and check{z}. In particular, check{c} cannot be 97, and this possibility does not need to be considered."},{"problem":"3.

Determine |FQ|: Given that F is the right focus, we can use the relationship between the focus, asymptote, and the constants of the hyperbola to find |FQ|. The distance from the focus to the asymptote, denoted as |FQ|, is calculated using the formula frac{|bc|}{sqrt{a^2+b^2}}, which simplifies to |FQ|=b.3. Use Right Triangle QOF: In the right triangle formed by QOF, we can find the cosine of the angle at F using the adjacent side over the hypotenuse, which gives us cos angle QFO = frac{b}{c}.4. Define |QN| and |QM|: Let |QN| = t, which implies |QM| = 3t based on the given ratio |MQ| = 3|QN|.5. Calculate Distances Involving F, N, and M: The distances from the focus to points N and M on the hyperbola can be expressed as |FN| = b - t and, by the definition of the hyperbola, |NF'| = b - t + 2a and |MF'| = b + 3t - 2a.6. Apply Cosine Rule in Triangles FNF' and FMF': Using the cosine rule, we can express cos angle NFF' and cos angle MFF' as follows:   - For triangle FNF': cos angle NFF' = frac{4c^2 + (b-t)^2 - (b-t+2a)^2}{2 times 2c(b-t)}   - For triangle FMF': cos angle MFF' = frac{4c^2 + (b+3t)^2 - (b+3t-2a)^2}{2 times 2c(b+3t)}7. Solve for t: By simplifying the equations involving cos angle QFO, cos angle NFF', and cos angle MFF', we find two expressions for t:   - From the first set of equations, t = frac{ab}{3b-3a}   - From the second set of equations, t = frac{ab}{a+b}8. Equating the Two Expressions for t: Setting frac{ab}{3b-3a} = frac{ab}{a+b} leads to the equation a + b = 3b - 3a, which simplifies to b = 2a.9.

We will use polynomial theory and properties of finite fields to achieve this.1. Polynomial Representation:   Consider the configuration of lamps as a polynomial ( g_a(x) ) in ( mathbb{F}_2[x] ) modulo ( x^n - 1 ). Each lamp configuration can be represented as a polynomial where the coefficient of ( x^i ) is 1 if the ( i )-th lamp is on and 0 if it is off.2. Function Definition:   The function ( f ) can be expressed in terms of polynomials as:   [   f(g_a) = frac{x g_a(x^2) - g_a(x)}{x-1} pmod{x^n - 1}   ]   This function describes the transformation of the lamp configuration after performing the cool procedure.3. Bijectivity Condition:   For ( f ) to be bijective, it must be injective. This means that if ( f(g_a) = 0 ), then ( g_a ) must be 0. We need to analyze when ( f(g_a) = 0 ) implies ( g_a = 0 ).4. Factorization of ( n ):   Let ( n = 2^k cdot m ), where ( m ) is odd. We will consider two cases: ( m = 1 ) and ( m > 1 ).5. Case ( m > 1 ):   - Lemma: If ( x^n - 1 mid x g_a(x^2) - g_a(x) ), then:     [     frac{x g_a(x^2) - g_a(x)}{x-1} = 0 quad text{or} quad frac{x^n - 1}{x-1} pmod{x^n - 1}     ]   - Proof of Lemma: Since ( frac{x^n - 1}{x-1} ) divides ( frac{x g_a(x^2) - g_a(x)}{x-1} ), we have:     [     frac{x g_a(x^2) - g_a(x)}{x-1} = q(x) cdot frac{x^n - 1}{x-1}     ]     for some polynomial ( q(x) ). This implies that the lemma holds.   - Permutation Analysis: Consider the function ( h(x) = 2x + 1 pmod{n} ). This function is a permutation on the set ( {0, 1, ldots, n-1} ) with at least two cycles when ( m > 1 ). This is because ( h(m cdot 2^k - 1) = m cdot 2^k - 1 ), forming a cycle of length 1.   - Cycle Construction: For a cycle of length ( j ) containing elements ( c_1, c_2, ldots, c_j ), construct the polynomial:     [     g_a(x) = sum_{i=1}^j x^{c_i}     ]     This polynomial satisfies ( x^n - 1 mid x g_a(x^2) - g_a(x) ). Since there are at least two cycles, either one of them is 0, or the sum of them will be 0. Thus, there exists a non-zero polynomial ( g ) such that ( f(g) = 0 ).6. Case ( m = 1 ):   - When ( n = 2^k ), we need to show that ( f ) is bijective. Consider the function ( h(x) = 2x + 1 pmod{n} ). If ( g_a(x) ) has a term ( x^m ) where ( m neq 2^k - 1 ), then:     [     x^n - 1 mid x g_a(x^2) - g_a(x)     ]     By analyzing the ( 2 )-adic valuation ( upsilon_2 ), we can show that no such ( m_1 ) exists, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, ( g_a(x) = x^{2^k - 1} ) gives ( f(g_a) = frac{x^{2^k} - 1}{x-1} neq 0 ).Conclusion:- For ( n = 2^k ), the function ( f ) is bijective.- For ( n = 2^k cdot m ) with ( m > 1 ), the function ( f ) is not bijective.The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 2^k } )."},{"problem":"Example 12 Let x, y be positive numbers, and x+y=1.

A function g(x) is monotonically increasing in an interval if for any two points x_1 and x_2 in the interval such that x_1 < x_2, we have g(x_1) < g(x_2). For the function g(x)=1-x^{2}, we can see that as x increases in the interval (0,+infty), the value of g(x) decreases because -x^{2} becomes more negative. Therefore, g(x) is monotonically decreasing in the interval (0,+infty), making statement q false.Now, let's evaluate the options:A: p lor q is true (since p is true)B: p land q is false (since q is false)C: lnot p land q is false (since p is true)D: lnot p lor q is false (since p is true)Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{text{A}}."},{"problem":"Calculate:(1)left(-8right)+10-2+left(-1right);(2)12-7times left(-4right)+8div left(-2right);(3)(frac{1}{2}+frac{1}{3}-frac{1}{6})div (-frac{1}{18});(4)-1^{4}-left(1+0.5right)times frac{1}{3}div left(-4right)^{2}.","solution":" Problem 1:Calculate (1) (-8) + 10 - 2 + (-1).# Solution:begin{align*}(-8) + 10 - 2 + (-1) &= (-8 + 10) - 2 + (-1) &= 2 - 2 + (-1) &= 0 + (-1) &= -1end{align*}So, the answer is boxed{-1}.

Therefore, their sum is also maximal at gamma=135^{circ}: max (O M+O N)=frac{1+sqrt{2}}{2}(a+b).Second method. Let angle A=alpha, angle B=beta, A B=c, C D=d, C E=e. By the cosine rule, c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2 a b cos gammae^{2}=b^{2}+c^{2}-2 b c cos left(90^{circ}+alpharight)=b^{2}+c^{2}+2 b c sin alpha. Substituting c^{2} from the first formula into the second and using the sine rule, we get:e^{2}=2 b^{2}+a^{2}-2 a b cos gamma+2 b c sin alpha=2 b^{2}+a^{2}+2 a b(sin gamma-cos gamma). Similarly, d^{2}=2 a^{2}+b^{2}+2 a b(sin gamma-cos gamma). Therefore, the maximum of d and e is achieved simultaneously with the maximum of the expression sin gamma-cos gamma, which is at gamma=135^{circ}. Thus, d+e is maximal when gamma=135^{circ}.Third method. By Ptolemy's inequality (see problem underline{57373}), C D cdot A B leq B C cdot A D + A C cdot B D, i.e.,C D leq B C sqrt{2} + A C = a sqrt{2} + b. Equality is achieved when the quadrilateral A C B E is cyclic. The rest follows as in the first method.## Answerfrac{1+sqrt{2}}{2}(a+b)"},{"problem":"2.

The parabola opens downwards because the coefficient of x^2 is negative. The axis of symmetry can be found using the formula x = -frac{b}{2a}, where a and b are the coefficients from the quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c. For our equation, a = -1 and b = -2, so the axis of symmetry is:[x = -frac{-2}{2 cdot (-1)} = -frac{-2}{-2} = -1.]Given that the points left(a,mright) and left(a+2,nright) lie on the graph and m geqslant n, we analyze their positions relative to the axis of symmetry. Since the parabola opens downwards and m geqslant n, the point closer to the axis of symmetry will have a higher y-value. The axis of symmetry is at x = -1, so for a to satisfy m geqslant n, a must be such that it is either on the axis of symmetry or to its right, ensuring that as we move to the right (towards a+2), the y-value decreases or remains the same.Thus, we conclude that a geqslant -1. However, considering the entire range of a that satisfies the condition m geqslant n, and since the parabola is symmetric with respect to x = -1, any point to the left of the axis up to one unit away (i.e., a geqslant -2) will also satisfy m geqslant n when considering its symmetric counterpart on the right.Therefore, the range of values for a that satisfies m geqslant n is:[boxed{a geqslant -2}.]"},{"problem":"The graph of the function f(x)=2sin(2omega x-frac{π}{3})(omega>0) is shifted to the left by frac{π}{6omega} units to obtain the graph of the function y=gleft(xright).

The shift of the function f(x)=2sin(2omega x-frac{π}{3}) to the left by frac{π}{6omega} units results in the function g(x). By substituting x+frac{π}{6omega} for x in f(x), we get:[g(x)=2sinleft[2omegaleft(x+frac{π}{6omega}right)-frac{π}{3}right]=2sin(2omega x)]2. For y=g(x)=2sin(2omega x) to be increasing, its argument must be in the interval where the sine function is increasing, which is -frac{π}{2}≤2omega x≤frac{π}{2}.3. Converting the inequality to find the range of x gives:[-frac{π}{4omega}≤x≤frac{π}{4omega}]4. The interval in which y=g(x) is increasing is therefore [-frac{π}{4omega}, frac{π}{4omega}].5. Given that y=g(x) is increasing on [0, frac{π}{4}], we conclude that:[[0, frac{π}{4}] subseteq [-frac{π}{4omega}, frac{π}{4omega}]]6.

Here's the step-by-step enhancement of the given solution:1. Consider the expression frac{1}{2}(2x + y)left(frac{2}{x} + frac{1}{y}right), which expands to:   [   frac{1}{2}left(2x cdot frac{2}{x} + 2x cdot frac{1}{y} + y cdot frac{2}{x} + y cdot frac{1}{y}right)   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   frac{1}{2}left(4 + frac{2y}{x} + frac{2x}{y}right)   ]   2. Apply the AM-GM inequality to the terms frac{2y}{x} and frac{2x}{y}:   [   frac{frac{2y}{x} + frac{2x}{y}}{2} geq sqrt{frac{2y}{x} cdot frac{2x}{y}}   ]   Simplifying the right side, we have:   [   frac{2y}{x} + frac{2x}{y} geq 2 cdot 2 = 4   ]3. Substituting this inequality into the expression obtained in step 1, we get:   [   frac{1}{2}left(5 + frac{2y}{x} + frac{2x}{y}right) geq frac{1}{2}(5 + 4) = frac{9}{2}   ]4. From the problem, we have 2x + y = 2. So the original expression can also be written as:   [   frac{2}{x} + frac{1}{y} = frac{1}{2}(2x + y)left(frac{2}{x} + frac{1}{y}right)   ]   Thus, by our result from the inequality:   [   frac{2}{x} + frac{1}{y} geq frac{9}{2}   ]   5. This inequality becomes an equality when frac{2y}{x} = frac{2x}{y}, which implies y = x. Since 2x + y = 2, it follows that 2x + x = 2 or x = frac{2}{3}. Substituting back, we also get y = frac{2}{3}.Therefore, the minimum value of frac{2}{x} + frac{1}{y} is boxed{frac{9}{2}}, and it occurs when x = y = frac{2}{3}."},{"problem":"A certain right-angled triangle has an area t=121.5 mathrm{~cm}^{2}; one of its angles alpha=36^{circ} 52^{prime} 10.7^{prime prime}; calculate the surface area and volume of the double cone that is formed by the triangle's rotation around its hypotenuse. pi=3.14159.","solution":"begin{aligned}& F=2 t pi(sin alpha+cos alpha)=2 t pi sqrt{2} sin left(45^{circ}+alpharight)=1068.75 text{ cm}^{2} & V=frac{2 pi t}{3} sqrt{t sin 2 alpha}=2748.2 text{ cm}^{3}end{aligned}"},{"problem":"G2.4 Let d be an odd prime number.

Gyak. Gimn.)II. solution. Let the edges be denoted by p, q, r, and their midpoints by P, Q, R. We will show that the perimeter of triangle PQR is minimal among the triangles we are examining. Let the plane of triangle PQR be denoted by S, and reflect the cube across the plane through r that is perpendicular to S. Since the center of the cube is in S, the plane we reflect across forms a 45^{circ} angle with p and q. Therefore, the reflection of p remains in the plane through p that is perpendicular to r and is perpendicular to p. Denote this by p_{1}, and the reflections of q, P, Q by q_{1}, P_{1}, Q_{1}. Since S is perpendicular to the reflection plane, P_{1}, Q_{1} will also be in S.Continuing step by step, reflect across the planes through q_{1}, p_{2}, r_{3}, and q_{4} that are perpendicular to S, denoting the reflections of p_{i}, q_{i}, r_{i} after the (i+1)-th reflection by p_{i+1}, q_{i+1}, r_{i+1} (where i=1,2,3,4, and r_{1} is identical to r). During this process, the points P, R, Q_{1}, P_{2}, R_{3}, Q_{4}, P_{5} will all lie on a single line. Perform these reflections on any points P^{*}, Q^{*}, R^{*} on the lines p, q, r as well.

Let ( f(x) = Q(x) ). We aim to show that the only solutions are of the form ( f(x) = cx^d ) for ( c in mathbb{Z}^+ ) and ( d in mathbb{Z}^+ cup {0} ).2. Introduce the function (omega(n)):   Define (omega(n)) as the number of distinct prime divisors of ( n ). We need to show that ( omega(f(mn)) = omega(f(m)f(n)) ).3. Degree of the polynomial ( f ):   Let ( d = deg(f) ). We will use the average order of (omega(f(n))) to derive a contradiction if ( f ) is not of the form ( cx^d ).4.

Then ( f(0) = 0 ).5. Proof of the Main Claim:   - Assume ( f(x) = x^r g(x) ) where ( g(0) neq 0 ).   - Consider the number of prime divisors:     [     omega(f(ab)) = omega(ab cdot g(ab)) geq omega(ab) + omega(g(ab)) - omega(gcd(g(ab), ab))     ]     [     omega(f(a)f(b)) = omega(ab cdot g(a)g(b)) leq omega(ab) + omega(g(a)g(b)) leq omega(ab) + omega(g(a)) + omega(g(b))     ]   - If ( g ) is nonconstant, then by the claim (taking ( C = omega(f(0)) )), ( g(0) = 0 ), which is a contradiction. Hence, ( g ) must be constant.6.

Bad and Good Primes:   - Call a prime ( p ) *bad* if it is less than ( 2020d ), divides ( f(0) ), or the leading coefficient ( c ) of ( f ); otherwise, call it *good*.   - Take ( N ) very large so that ( p_N ) exceeds all bad primes.   - For each ( i ) where ( p_i ) is good, pick residues ( a_i, b_i ) such that:     [     p mid f(a_i b_i) text{ and } p nmid f(a_i) f(b_i)     ]   - Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) to pick ( a, b < p_1 p_2 ldots p_N ) such that:     [     a equiv a_i pmod{p_i}, b equiv b_i pmod{p_i} text{ for all } i leq N     ]8.

Analyzing the Sum:   - If ( p leq p_N ) and ( p ) is bad, then ( p ) may divide ( f(a + kP) ), but there are finitely many such primes (at most ( t )).   - If ( p leq p_N ) and ( p ) is good, then ( p ) cannot divide ( f(a + kP) ) due to our construction.   - If ( p_N < p < sqrt{MP} ), then the leading coefficient of ( g(x) = f(a + Px) ) is not zero modulo ( p ). Thus, at most:     [     d leftlceil frac{M}{p} rightrceil < frac{dM}{p} + d     ]     numbers are divisible by ( p ).   - If ( p > sqrt{MP} ), then most terms can have at most ( 2d ) such divisors due to size reasons. Thus, these primes contribute at most ( 2dM + O_{M, N}(1) ) to the sum.10. Final Summation:    [    M(N - C) leq 2 left( t + sum_{p < sqrt{MP}} left( frac{dM}{p} + d right) + dM + O_{M, N}(1) right)    ]    [    leq 2 left( (M log log (MP) + A + o_{M, N}(1) + d sqrt{MP}) + 2dM + O_{M, N}(1) right)    ]    [    leq 2 left( M log log (e^{N^5}) + O(e^{N^3/2} + O(N^2)) right)    ]    [    leq 2 left( 5M log N + O(e^{N^3/2 + O(N^2)}) right)    ]    which is a contradiction if ( N ) is large enough.Thus, the only possible form for ( f(x) ) is ( cx^d ).The final answer is ( boxed{ f(x) = cx^d } ) for ( c in mathbb{Z}^+ ) and ( d in mathbb{Z}^+ cup {0} )."},{"problem":"A top hat contains 3 red chips and 2 green chips.

To find the number of ways to rearrange the three red chips and two green chips, we solve for binom{5}{2} = 10. However, we notice that whenever the last chip we draw is red, we pick both green chips before we pick the last red chip. Similarly, when the last chip is green, we pick all three red chips before the last green chip. This means that the last chip must be green in all the situations that work. This means we are left with finding the number of ways to rearrange three red chips and one green chip, which is binom{4}{3} = 4. Because a green chip will be last 4 out of the 10 situations, our answer is boxed{textbf{(B) } frac{2}{5}}.~CHECKMATE2021Solution 2There are two ways of ending the game: either you picked out all the red chips or you picked out all the green chips. We can pick out 3 red chips, 3 red chips and 1 green chip, 2 green chips, 2 green chips and 1 red chip, and 2 green chips and 2 red chips. Because order is important in this problem, there are 1+4+1+3+6=15 ways to pick out the chip. But we noticed that if you pick out the three red chips before you pick out the green chip, the game ends. So, we need to subtract cases like that to get the total number of ways a game could end, which is 15-5=10. Out of the 10 ways to end the game, 4 of them end with a green chip. The answer is frac{4}{10} = boxed{textbf{(B) } frac{2}{5}}.~CHECKMATE2021Solution 3Assume that after you draw the three red chips in a row without drawing both green chips, you continue drawing for the next turn. The last/fifth chip that is drawn must be a green chip because if both green chips were drawn before, we would've already completed the game. So technically, the problem is asking for the probability that the \\"fifth draw\\" is a green chip. This probability is symmetric to the probability that the first chip drawn is green, which is frac{2}{5}. So the probability is boxed{textbf{(B) } frac{2}{5}}. Note: This problem is almost identical to 2001 AMC 10 Problem #23.CHECKMATE2021Solution 4If we list all possibilities where the 3 red chips are drawn , where R represents Red and G represents Green, they are RRR, GRRR, RGRR, and RRGR, because the last chip drawn must be red. This means that there are 4 possibilities for it to be red. The only other outcome is that it ends in green, which if we represent them the same way we did for red, we get, GG, GRG, RGG, RRGG, RGRG, and GRRG, or 6 outcomes. This means there are 4+6=10 possible outcomes, and 4 outcomes that result in 3 red being drawn, so the probability is frac{4}{10} = frac{2}{5}, and the answer is boxed{textbf{(B) } frac{2}{5}}~CHECKMATE2021Solution 5We can use basic probability to find the answer to this question. The probability of the first chip being red is frac{3}{5} because there are 3 red chips and 5 chips in total. The probability of the second chip being red is frac{2}{4} because there are now 2 red chips and 4 total chips. The probability of the third chip being red is frac{1}{3} because there are now 1 red chips and 3 total chips. If we multiply these fractions, we get frac{1}{10}. To get the answer of frac{2}{5} we need to multiply this product by 4 because there are 4 different draws that these red chips can be chosen on. They can be chosen on the text{1st 2nd, 3rd, or 4th} draws because if a red chip was chosen on the text{5th} draw, 2 green chips would have already been chosen. So our answer is frac{1}{10} multiplied by 4 which would leave us with the answer of boxed{textbf{(B) } frac{2}{5}}.~CHECKMATE2021"},{"problem":"[ Classical combinatorics (miscellaneous). ]  [ Formulas of abbreviated multiplication (miscellaneous).]Twenty-five coins are distributed into piles as follows.

Let's represent the coins as points and connect each pair of points with a segment. We will get 25(25 - 1) : 2= 300 segments. Each time we divide one group of coins into two, we will erase all segments connecting points corresponding to coins that ended up in different groups. Suppose at some step we divide the coins of one of the existing groups into two groups of x and y coins. Then we erase xy segments. This is the number we write down. Thus, the sum of the recorded numbers is the total number of erased segments. Since there were initially 300 segments, and in the end, all segments are erased, the total number of erased segments is 300.The second method. Consider the variable quantity S, equal at each moment to half the sum of the squares of the number of coins in the piles. Initially,S=25^{2}: 2=312.5, and at the very end S=left(1^{2}+ldots+1^{2}right): 2=12.5. If a pile with x+y coins is divided into two piles of x and y coins, then S decreases by 1 / 2(x+y)^{2}-1 / 2left(x^{2}+y^{2}right). Thus, with each division, the quantity S decreases by the next recorded number. Therefore, the sum of all recorded numbers is equal to the total decrease in the quantity S, which is 312.5-12.5=300.## Answer300."},{"problem":"15.5.

The distance from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by:frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}.Substituting A = sqrt{3}, B = -1, C = 1, and the coordinates of point P into this formula, we get:frac{|sqrt{3}cdotfrac{sqrt{3}}{3} - 1cdotleft(-frac{1}{2}ln 3right) + 1|}{sqrt{(sqrt{3})^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{|1 + frac{1}{2}ln 3 + 1|}{2} = 1 + frac{1}{4}ln 3.Therefore, the minimum value of |AB| is boxed{1 + frac{1}{4}ln 3}."},{"problem":"The coefficient of x^{4} in the expansion of the binomial (x- frac {2}{x})^{6} is ______.","solution":"To solve this, we use the general term formula of the binomial expansion (x- frac {2}{x})^{6}.

The problem states that the car increased its speed by 25% and as a result, arrived 0.4 hours earlier. This information allows us to set up an equation based on the distance and the time taken at both speeds.The distance between locations A and B is given as 160 km. When the car travels at its original speed x, the time taken is frac{160}{x} hours. After increasing its speed by 25%, the new speed becomes x + 0.25x = 1.25x km/h. At this increased speed, the time taken to travel the same distance is frac{160}{1.25x} hours.According to the problem, the difference in time taken at these two speeds is 0.4 hours, leading to the equation:[frac{160}{x} - frac{160}{1.25x} = 0.4]Simplifying the equation:[frac{160}{x} - frac{160}{1.25x} = frac{160}{x} - frac{128}{x} = 0.4][frac{32}{x} = 0.4]Multiplying both sides by x and then dividing by 0.4 gives:[32 = 0.4x][x = frac{32}{0.4} = 80]Thus, the original speed of the car was 80 km/h. To verify, we can substitute x = 80 back into the original equation:[frac{160}{80} - frac{160}{1.25 times 80} = 2 - 1.6 = 0.4]This confirms that our solution is correct.

We will construct a set a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{100} for which we cannot, by asking two more questions, uniquely determine the order of the numbers. Consider the situation where all numbers mentioned in both the first and second questions are in the same positions in the answers.As the desired set, we will take the set where k_{i}, l_{i} in {a_{2i-1}, a_{i}}, i=1,2, ldots, 50, and, moreover, in each quartet (a_{4m-3}, a_{4m-2}, a_{4m-1}, a_{4m}),m=1,2, ldots, 25, no comparisons of adjacent pairs of numbers from this quartet were made in the first two questions. We will show that such a set exists.Let X be the set of numbers that did not appear in the first two questions. The following cases are possible:k_{2m-1}=l_{2m-1}, k_{2m}=l_{2m},k_{2m-1}=l_{2m-1}, k_{2m} neq l_{2m},k_{2m-1} neq l_{2m-1}, k_{2m} neq l_{2m},k_{2m-1} neq l_{2m-1}, k_{2m}=l_{2m},For these cases, we will construct quartets (a_{4m-3}, a_{4m-2}, a_{4m-1}, a_{4m}) as follows: (k_{2m-1}, *, *, k_{2m}), (k_{2m-1}, *, k_{2m}, l_{2m}), (k_{2m-1}, l_{2m-1}, k_{2m}, l_{2m}),(k_{2m-1}, l_{2m-1}, *, k_{2m}), where * can be any number from the set X that did not appear in the questions and in the construction of previous quartets.Thus, it is shown that after two questions, a situation is possible (regardless of the asker's desire) where no pair (a_{i}, a_{i+1}) for i not divisible by 4 is covered. Each of the 100 numbers is part of at least one uncovered pair, and therefore, must appear in at least one of the subsequent questions.Suppose that in this situation, all uncovered pairs can be covered in two questions; then each of the 100 numbers must appear in exactly one of such questions. Considering quartets of the form (a_{4i-3}, a_{4i-2}, a_{4i-1}, a_{4i}), i=1,2, ldots, 25, note that if one number from such a quartet appears in a question, then the other three must also (otherwise, not all pairs of adjacent numbers in this quartet will be covered). But then the number of numbers in the set about which the question is asked must be divisible by 4. Since 50 is not divisible by 4, we have a contradiction. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the order of the numbers 1,2, ldots, 100 in a row with four questions.We will show how to do this in five questions. The first question is about the set M_{1}={1,2, ldots, 50}, the second is about the set M_{2}={51,52, ldots, 100}. The set M_{3} will consist of the 25 leftmost numbers of the set M_{1} and the 25 leftmost numbers of the set M_{2}, and the set M_{4} will consist of the 25 rightmost numbers of the set M_{1} and the 25 rightmost numbers of the set M_{2}. The answer to the question about the set M_{3} will clearly determine the numbers a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{25}, and the answer to the question about the set M_{4} will determine the numbers a_{76}, a_{77}, ldots, a_{100}.

Understanding the problem: We need to find all positive integers ( n ) such that ( n^{d(n)+1}(n+21)^{d(n)} ) is a perfect square, where ( d(n) ) is the number of positive divisors of ( n ).2. Case 1: ( n ) is not a perfect square:   - If ( n ) is not a perfect square, then ( d(n) ) is even. This is because the number of divisors of a non-square number is always even.   - Therefore, ( n^{d(n)+1} ) is not necessarily a perfect square because ( d(n)+1 ) is odd.   - However, ( (n+21)^{d(n)} ) is a perfect square because ( d(n) ) is even.   - This implies that ( n^{d(n)+1}(n+21)^{d(n)} ) cannot be a perfect square unless ( n ) itself is a perfect square, leading to a contradiction.3. Case 2: ( n ) is a perfect square:   - Let ( n = k^2 ) for some positive integer ( k ).   - Since ( n ) is a perfect square, ( d(n) ) is odd. This is because the number of divisors of a perfect square is always odd.   - We need ( n^{d(n)+1}(n+21)^{d(n)} ) to be a perfect square.   - Substituting ( n = k^2 ), we get ( (k^2)^{d(k^2)+1}(k^2+21)^{d(k^2)} ).   - Since ( d(k^2) ) is odd, let ( d(k^2) = 2m+1 ) for some integer ( m ).   - Therefore, ( (k^2)^{2m+2}(k^2+21)^{2m+1} ) must be a perfect square.   - Simplifying, we get ( k^{4m+4}(k^2+21)^{2m+1} ).4. Condition for ( k^2 + 21 ) to be a perfect square:   - For ( k^{4m+4}(k^2+21)^{2m+1} ) to be a perfect square, ( k^2 + 21 ) must be a perfect square.   - Let ( k^2 + 21 = u^2 ) for some integer ( u ).   - This implies ( u^2 - k^2 = 21 ), which can be factored as ( (u-k)(u+k) = 21 ).5. Solving the equation ( (u-k)(u+k) = 21 ):   - The factor pairs of 21 are (1, 21), (3, 7), (7, 3), and (21, 1).   - Solving for each pair:     - ( u - k = 1 ) and ( u + k = 21 ):       - Adding these equations, ( 2u = 22 Rightarrow u = 11 ).       - Subtracting these equations, ( 2k = 20 Rightarrow k = 10 ).       - Thus, ( n = k^2 = 10^2 = 100 ).     - ( u - k = 3 ) and ( u + k = 7 ):       - Adding these equations, ( 2u = 10 Rightarrow u = 5 ).       - Subtracting these equations, ( 2k = 4 Rightarrow k = 2 ).       - Thus, ( n = k^2 = 2^2 = 4 ).6.

Solution: Let the unknown digits of the sought number be denoted by x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n}. Thus, the problem seeks a number for which4 cdot x_{1} x_{2} ldots x_{n} 4 = 4 x_{1} x_{2} ldots x_{n}Here, the consecutive letters represent the digits of a number in the decimal system, and the multiplication sign is always written. Multiplying the last digit on the left side by 4 (4 cdot 4 = 16), we find that x_{n} = 6; writing this on the left side, we can continue the multiplication and find that 4 cdot 6 = 24, 24 + 1 = 25, and thus x_{n-1} = 5. Continuing in this manner, we get the digits 2, 0, 1 in sequence. Multiplying the last one by 4 gives 4, and no further carry is left, so we have4 cdot 102564 = 410256There is no need to complete the procedure at the digit 4, as we would then arrive at numbers that are formed by the repeated sequence of the digits 102564. All these numbers have the desired property, and it is clear from the procedure that only these numbers satisfy the condition.The result can also be obtained essentially in the same way if we determine the digits x_{1} onwards by dividing the number on the right side.II. Solution: Let the number formed by the digits before the 4 be x and let it be n digits long. Then the given number is 10 x + 4. Moving the 4 to the front, it will represent 4 cdot 10^{n}, followed by the number x. Thus, the problem seeks natural numbers x and n for which4(10 x + 4) = 4 cdot 10^{n} + x, quad 39 x = 4(10^{n} - 4)The problem, therefore, seeks an integer n for which 4(10^{n} - 4) is divisible by 39 = 3 cdot 13. Since10^{n} - 4 = (10^{n} - 1) - 3 = 99 ldots 9 - 3is divisible by 3, we only need to ensure divisibility by 13. Since 4 is relatively prime to 13, only 10^{n} - 4 can be divisible by 13. 10 - 4 and 10^{2} - 4 are not divisible by it, so n > 2. In this case,10^{n} - 4 = 100 cdot 10^{n-2} - 4 = 4 cdot (25 cdot 10^{n-2} - 1) = 4[26 cdot 10^{n-2} - (10^{n-2} + 1)]Here, 4 is relatively prime to 13, 26 is divisible by it, so 10^{n-2} + 1 must be divisible by 13. We know that 1001 is divisible by 13, so n-2 = 3, n = 5 is the smallest exponent that meets the condition.x = frac{4 cdot (10^{5} - 4)}{39} = 10256Thus, the sought number is102564.Note: 1. The expression 10^{m} + 1 (we wrote m instead of n-2) is always divisible by 13 if m is an odd multiple of 3, because if m = 3(2k + 1), thenbegin{gathered}10^{m} + 1 = (10^{3})^{2k + 1} + 1 = = (10^{3} + 1)(10^{3 cdot 2k} - 10^{3(2k-1)} + 10^{3(2k-2)} + ldots - 10^{3} + 1)end{gathered}and 10^{3} + 1 = 7 cdot 11 cdot 13. If, however, m = 3(2k + 1) + r, r = 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, then10^{m} + 1 = (10^{3(2k + 1) + r} + 10^{r}) - (10^{r} - 1) = 10^{r}(10^{3(2k + 1)} + 1) - (10^{r} - 1)Here, the first term is divisible by 13, but the second is not, because 9, 99 = 9 cdot 11, 999 = 9 cdot 111 = 9 cdot 3 cdot 37, 9999 = 9 cdot 1001 + 990 and 99999 = 99 cdot 1001 + 900; and here neither factor is divisible by 13, or the first term is divisible by it, but the second is not, so (writing m = n-2 back) all solutions of the written equation arex = frac{4(10^{6k + 5} - 4)}{39}, quad k = 0, 1, 2 ldotsIt is easy to see that these are precisely the numbers of the form mentioned in the previous solution.2. The question arises whether it is just a coincidence that we found a number that satisfies the condition. We only note that the last problem does not always have a solution. From a famous theorem of Fermat in number theory, or rather from its generalization by Euler, it follows that for every odd integer a not divisible by 5, there is an exponent m for which 10^{m} - 1 is divisible by a; in contrast, 10^{m} + 1 cannot be divisible by 3, because 10^{m} + 1 = (10^{m} - 1) + 2, which gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, because the first term is divisible by 3, regardless of the natural number m."},{"problem":"3.

What is P(0)+Q(0)+R(0)?[i]Proposed by Kyle Lee[/i]","solution":"1. Let ( P(x) = (x-a)(x-b) ), ( Q(x) = (x-c)(x-d) ), and ( R(x) = (x-e)(x-f) ). Since these are monic quadratic polynomials, the leading coefficient of each polynomial is 1.2. Given that ( P(Q(x)) = (x-1)(x-3)(x-5)(x-7) ), we can express ( P(Q(x)) ) as:   [   P(Q(x)) = ((x-c)(x-d) - a)((x-c)(x-d) - b)   ]   This must be equal to ((x-1)(x-3)(x-5)(x-7)).3. Similarly, given that ( Q(R(x)) = (x-2)(x-4)(x-6)(x-8) ), we can express ( Q(R(x)) ) as:   [   Q(R(x)) = ((x-e)(x-f) - c)((x-e)(x-f) - d)   ]   This must be equal to ((x-2)(x-4)(x-6)(x-8)).4. Since ( P(Q(x)) ) and ( Q(R(x)) ) are both quartic polynomials, we need to match the coefficients of the polynomials on both sides of the equations. 5. For ( P(Q(x)) = (x-1)(x-3)(x-5)(x-7) ), the roots of ( Q(x) ) must be such that ( Q(x) ) takes the values 1, 3, 5, and 7. Therefore, the roots of ( Q(x) ) must be the solutions to the equations:   [   (x-c)(x-d) = 1, 3, 5, 7   ]6. Similarly, for ( Q(R(x)) = (x-2)(x-4)(x-6)(x-8) ), the roots of ( R(x) ) must be such that ( R(x) ) takes the values 2, 4, 6, and 8. Therefore, the roots of ( R(x) ) must be the solutions to the equations:   [   (x-e)(x-f) = 2, 4, 6, 8   ]7. We realize that both quadratics must have the ( x ) coefficient. Thus, we can set up the following system of equations:   [   cd - a = 7, quad cd - b = 15   ]   [   ef - c = 16, quad ef - d = 24   ]8. Solving these equations, we get:   [   a = cd - 7, quad b = cd - 15   ]   [   c = ef - 16, quad d = ef - 24   ]9. Adding the equations for ( c ) and ( d ):   [   c + d = 2ef - 40   ]10. Since ( c ) and ( d ) are roots of ( Q(x) ), we have:    [    c + d = 8, quad cd = 0    ]11. Similarly, since ( e ) and ( f ) are roots of ( R(x) ), we have:    [    e + f = 8, quad ef = 24    ]12. Substituting ( c ) and ( d ) into the equations for ( a ) and ( b ):    [    a = -7, quad b = -15    ]13. Finally, we calculate ( P(0) + Q(0) + R(0) ):    [    P(0) = ab = (-7)(-15) = 105    ]    [    Q(0) = cd = 0    ]    [    R(0) = ef = 24    ]14. Therefore:    [    P(0) + Q(0) + R(0) = 105 + 0 + 24 = 129    ]The final answer is (boxed{129})."},{"problem":"Given real numbers x gt 0 gt y, and frac{1}{x+2}+frac{1}{1-y}=frac{1}{6}, find the minimum value of x-y.","solution":"Given real numbers x > 0 > y, and the equation frac{1}{x+2}+frac{1}{1-y}=frac{1}{6}, we aim to find the minimum value of x-y.First, note that since x > 0 > y, we have x+2 > 2 > 0 and 1-y > 1 > 0.

Let Delta be the segment of the tape between the numbers 0 and 1 (including 0 and 1). Let M be the maximum absolute value of a number that falls within this segment. Then each number x, with an absolute value greater than M, is located either to the right or to the left of Delta. Suppose some number x>M is located on one side of Delta, for definiteness, to the right. The arithmetic mean of the numbers x and -x is 0, so the number -x is also located to the right of Delta. The arithmetic mean of the numbers -x and x+2 is 1, so x+2 is also located to the right of Delta. Reasoning in this way and so on, we get that the numbers x, x+2, x+4 and all subsequent numbers of the same parity are located to the right of Delta. Now, among all numbers greater than M and located to the right of Delta, choose the number a that is located to the left of all the others. The numbers a+2, a+4, a+6 are to the right of Delta and, therefore, to the right of a. The number a+4 is not written to the right of a+2, since a+2 is the arithmetic mean of a and a+4.

Since CT is tangent to omega at T, OT perp CT.4. Let P be the foot of the perpendicular from A to line CT. We need to find the maximum possible length of segment BP and then find m^2 where m is this maximum length.5. Since OT perp CT, OT is the radius of the circle, and OT = 9.6.

Marco moves first, and for every move he must choose a cell which is black and which has more than two white neighbors. (Two cells are neighbors if they share an edge, so every cell has exactly four neighbors.) His move consists of making the chosen black cell white and turning all of its neighbors black if they are not already. Vera then performs the following action exactly k times: she chooses two cells that are neighbors to each other and swaps their colors (she is allowed to swap the colors of two white or of two black cells, though doing so has no effect). This, in totality, is a single turn. If Vera leaves the board so that Marco cannot choose a cell that is black and has more than two white neighbors, then Vera wins; otherwise, another turn occurs.\\tLet m be the minimal k value such that Vera can guarantee that she wins no matter what Marco does.

Understanding Marco's Move:   - Marco can only choose a black cell that has more than two white neighbors.   - When Marco chooses such a cell, he turns it white and all its neighbors black.2. Understanding Vera's Move:   - Vera can swap the colors of two neighboring cells exactly ( k ) times.   - Vera's goal is to prevent Marco from having any valid moves.3. Initial Configuration:   - The game starts with one black cell surrounded by white cells.4. Analyzing Marco's Moves:   - Marco's first move will turn the initial black cell white and its four neighbors black.   - This results in a cross pattern of black cells.5. Vera's Strategy:   - Vera needs to use her ( k ) swaps to ensure that Marco cannot find a black cell with more than two white neighbors.   - By carefully choosing her swaps, Vera can manipulate the board to prevent Marco from making any valid moves.6.

We need to find the ( n )-th smallest number in the set of all products of two numbers, both of which are at least ( n ).2. Define the set: The set consists of numbers of the form ( (k^2 + i)(k^2 + j) ) where ( i, j geq 0 ). We need to find the ( n )-th smallest number in this set.3. Construct the array: We can visualize the products in a two-dimensional array where the entry in the ( i )-th row and ( j )-th column is ( (k^2 + i)(k^2 + j) ). The smallest element is ( (k^2 + 0)(k^2 + 0) = k^2 cdot k^2 = k^4 ).4. Order the elements: We need to order the elements in ascending order. The smallest element is ( k^4 ), the next smallest is ( k^4 + k^2 ), and so on. The ( n )-th smallest element will be the largest element in the first ( n ) elements of this array.5.
