The scoring system is 2 points per match, so the total score is 10 times 2=20 points. The first place has no draws, so the score of the first place must be an even number. Each person plays 4 matches, so the maximum score is 8 points. If the first place gets 8 points, then they must have won all their matches, which means they should have beaten the second place. However, the second place has not lost any matches, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the first place cannot have 8 points. If the first place gets 4 points, since the five people have different scores, the remaining four people's scores can only be 3, 2, 1, 0. The total score of the five people would then be 10 points, which contradicts the total score of 20 points. Therefore, the first place can only have three wins and one loss, totaling 6 points, with the one loss being to the second place. Since the five people have different scores, the remaining four people's scores can be at most 5, 4, 3, 2. At this point, the total score of the five people is exactly 20 points, which is the highest total score. In other cases, the total score of the five people would be lower than 20 points.

Understanding the problem: We need to find the largest prime number ( p ) such that a regular polygon with ( p ) sides coincides with itself after rotating by an integer number of degrees.2. Rotation symmetry of a regular polygon: A regular polygon with ( p ) sides will coincide with itself after a rotation by ( frac{360^circ}{p} ) degrees. This is because the polygon has rotational symmetry of order ( p ).3. Condition for rotation: For the polygon to coincide with itself after rotating by an integer number of degrees, ( frac{360^circ}{p} ) must be an integer. This implies that ( p ) must be a divisor of 360.4. Prime factorization of 360: The prime factorization of 360 is:   [   360 = 2^3 cdot 3^2 cdot 5   ]   The prime factors of 360 are 2, 3, and 5.5.

Define the sums of the subsets:   Let ( sum_{i in S_1} i = A ) and ( sum_{i in S_2} i = B ). Since ( S_1 cup S_2 = S ) and ( S_1 cap S_2 = emptyset ), we have:   [   A + B = sum_{i=1}^{2n} i = frac{2n(2n+1)}{2} = n(2n+1)   ]   We are given that ( A mid B ).2. Establish bounds for ( A ) and ( B ):   Note that ( A geq 1 + 2 + ldots + n = frac{n(n+1)}{2} ) and ( B leq 2n + (2n-1) + ldots + (n+1) = frac{n(3n+1)}{2} ). Therefore:   [   B leq frac{n(3n+1)}{2} < frac{3n(n+1)}{2} leq 3A   ]   Since ( A mid B ), this implies that ( B in {A, 2A} ).3. Case 1: ( B = A ):   If ( B = A ), then:   [   A = frac{n(2n+1)}{2}   ]   For ( A ) to be an integer, ( n(2n+1) ) must be even, which implies ( n ) must be even. For all even ( n ), we can construct ( S_1 ) as follows:   [   S_1 = {1, 2n} cup {2, 2n-1} cup ldots cup left(frac{n}{2}, 2n+1-frac{n}{2}right)   ]   It is straightforward to check that ( |S_1| = n ) and ( A = n(2n+1) ).4.

Since ( 2n+1 ) is always odd, ( n ) must not be congruent to 2 modulo 3, i.e., ( n notequiv 2 pmod{3} ).5. Intermediate sums:   Consider the collection ( mathcal{F} ) of all sets ( X subseteq {1, 2, ldots, 2n} ) such that ( |X| = n ). The minimum sum of the elements of a set in ( mathcal{F} ) is:   [   m = 1 + 2 + ldots + n = frac{n(n+1)}{2}   ]   and the maximum sum is:   [   M = 2n + (2n-1) + ldots + (n+1) = frac{n(3n+1)}{2}   ]   We claim that all intermediate sums in ([m, M]) can be achieved by a set in ( mathcal{F} ). Assume all sums in ([m, t]) have been achieved for some ( t geq m ). If ( t = M ), we are done. If not, we want to find a set that achieves ( t+1 ). Let ( T = {x_1, ldots, x_n} ) be a set such that its elements sum to ( t ).   If there are two elements of ( T ) that are not consecutive, we may increment the smallest one of them by one and finish. Moreover, if ( x_n neq 2n ), we may increment ( x_n ) by one and finish. If neither of these happens, set ( T ) must necessarily be ( {n+1, n+2, ldots, 2n} ), which is a contradiction as we assumed ( t neq M ).6.

There is a general opinion that puzzles requiring the measurement of a certain amount of liquid can only be solved by a series of trials, but in such cases, general formulas for solutions can be found. Taking advantage of an unexpected leisure, I examined this question more closely. As a result, some very interesting things were discovered. Let's consider, for example, the simplest case, where a person comes to a stream with only two vessels and wants to measure a certain amount of water. If we are dealing with, say, a barrel of wine, we may encounter various complications related to whether the barrel is empty or full, whether we know its capacity and contents, whether the loss of wine is allowed, and whether it is possible to pour the wine back into the barrel. By the stream, all these complications disappear. Perhaps the problem has simplified to such an extent that it makes no sense to talk about it as a puzzle at all? Let's see.A person comes to a stream with two vessels of 15 and 16 liters capacity. How can he measure exactly 8 liters of water in the fewest number of operations? Filling a vessel, emptying it, or pouring water from one vessel to another counts as one operation.This puzzle is not difficult, but I think the reader will find it quite entertaining and instructive. It goes without saying that no tricks, such as marks on the vessels or tilting them, are allowed.","solution":"393.(A)(B)begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}hline 15 l & 16 l & (15 pi) & 16 l & 15 l & 16 l & 15 l & 16 l hline 0 & (16^{*}) & 15 & (5^{*}) & (15^{*}) & 0 & 0 & 11 hline 15 & (1^{*}) & 0 & 5 & 0 & 15 & 15 & 11 hline 0 & 1 & 5 & 0 & 15 & 15 & (10^{*}) & 16 hline 1 & 0 & 5 & 16 & (14^{*}) & 16 & 10 & 0 hline 1 & 16 & 15 & (6^{*}) & 14 & 0 & 0 & 10 hline 15 & (2^{*}) & 0 & 6 & 0 & 14 & 15 & 10 hline 0 & 2 & 6 & 0 & 15 & 14 & (9^{*}) & 16 hline 2 & 0 & 6 & 16 & (13^{*}) & 16 & 9 & 0 hline 2 & 16 & 15 & (7^{*}) & 13 & 0 & 0 & 9 hline 15 & (3^{*}) & 0 & 7 & 0 & 13 & 15 & 9 hline 0 & 3 & 7 & 0 & 15 & 13 & (8^{*}) & 16 hline 3 & 0 & 7 & 16 & (12^{*}) & 16 & & hline 3 & 16 & 15 & (8^{*}) & 12 & 0 & & hline 15 & (4^{*}) & 0 & 8 & 0 & 12 & & hline 0 & 4 & 8 & 0 & 15 & 12 & & hline 4 & 0 & 8 & 16 & (11^{*}) & 16 & & hline & 16 & & & 11 & & & hlineend{tabular}Each row in the column represents an operation. Thus, in the case of (A), we first fill the 16-liter container, then pour 15 liters into another container, leaving 1 liter; then, by emptying the 15-liter container, we pour the 1 liter from the 16-liter container into it, and so on.The asterisks show how we can sequentially measure 1, 2, 3, 4 liters, and so on. We can also proceed differently, as shown in case (B): first fill the 15-liter container, and then sequentially measure 14, 13, 12, 11 liters, and so on. Continuing the \\"strategy\\" of (A), we get the pouring scheme (B) in reverse order. From this, it is clear that to measure from 1 to 7 liters, we should use method (A), and from 8 to 14 liters, method (B). Using method (A), we can measure 8 liters in 30 operations, and using method (B) in only 28, which is the correct answer.Surprisingly, using any two coprime measures (i.e., measures that do not have common divisors, such as 15 and 16), we can measure any integer number of liters from 1 to the largest measure. Using 4-liter and 6-liter containers (each divisible by 2), we can only measure 2, 4, and 6 liters. With 3-liter and 9-liter containers, we can only measure 3, 6, and 9 liters. In our table, the measurable volumes are in the correct sequence.

Let p_{n} be the probability that after n steps, the calculator will show an odd number, and express p_{n+1} in terms of p_{n}.If the last operation was multiplication, the result will be odd only if both factors are odd; the probability of this is 1 / 2 p_{n}.If the last operation was addition, the result will be odd if the last addend differs in parity from the penultimate one; the probability of this is 1 / 2.The last operation can be either multiplication or addition, and both of these options are equally likely.Therefore, the formula for total probability gives:p_{n+1}=1 / 2 cdot 1 / 2+1 / 2 cdot 1 / 2 p_{n}=1 / 4+1 / 4 p_{n}.Rewriting this equality as p_{n+1}-1 / 3=1 / 4left(p_{n}-1 / 3right), we see that when n increases by 1, the difference p_{n}-1 / 3 decreases by a factor of 4.

The polynomial is given by:   [   (x+a)(x^2+bx+c)(x^3+dx^2+ex+f)=0   ]   This polynomial is a product of three polynomials of degrees 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The total degree of the polynomial is (1 + 2 + 3 = 6). Therefore, it has 6 roots.    Since the roots of the polynomial are the solutions to the equation, we need to check if these roots can be integers. Let's denote the roots by (r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5, r_6). The polynomial can be written as:   [   (x-r_1)(x-r_2)(x-r_3)(x-r_4)(x-r_5)(x-r_6) = 0   ]   Comparing this with the given polynomial, we need to find integers (a, b, c, d, e, f) such that the roots (r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5, r_6) are integers.

If in any three islands there is an island with bridges connected to each of the other two islands, call these three islands an \\"island group\\". We know that any two \\"island groups\\" have at least 1 common island. What is the minimum number of islands with only 1 bridge connected to it?   To solve this problem, we need to analyze the structure of the graph formed by the islands and bridges. The graph has 2023 vertices (islands) and 2022 edges (bridges). Since the graph is connected and has (n-1) edges, it is a tree.   In a tree, there are always at least two leaves (vertices with degree 1). We need to find the minimum number of leaves in this tree.    Given that any two \\"island groups\\" have at least one common island, we can infer that the tree has a high degree of connectivity. However, since the tree has 2023 vertices and 2022 edges, it must have at least two leaves.   Therefore, the minimum number of islands with only 1 bridge connected to it is:   (boxed{2})3.

Since (D) is a point on (BC) such that (angle PDB = angle QDC), we have:   [   angle PDB = angle QDC   ]   Therefore, (D) is the midpoint of (BC).

Prove that the points (D, E, X, Y) are concyclic.   To prove that the points (D, E, X, Y) are concyclic, we need to use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and reflections.   Since (X) is the reflection of (B) with respect to the line (CD), we have:   [   angle BCD = angle XCD   ]   Also, since (Y) is the point on the plane such that quadrilateral (DKEY) is a parallelogram, we have:   [   angle DKE = angle DYE   ]   Therefore, the points (D, E, X, Y) are concyclic.

The mouse wants to move to the bottom-right square to eat the cheese. For each step, the mouse can move from one square to an adjacent square (two squares are considered adjacent if they share a common edge). Now, any divider can be placed on the common edge of two adjacent squares such that the mouse cannot directly move between these two adjacent squares.   A placement of dividers is called \\"kind\\" if the mouse can still reach the cheese after the dividers are placed. Find the smallest positive integer (n) such that, regardless of any \\"kind\\" placement of 2023 dividers, the mouse can reach the cheese in at most (n) steps.   To solve this problem, we need to analyze the structure of the grid and the placement of dividers. The grid has (100 times 100 = 10000) squares, and the mouse can move from one square to an adjacent square.   Since the mouse can move from one square to an adjacent square, the shortest path from the top-left square to the bottom-right square is (100 + 100 - 2 = 198) steps.   Now, we need to find the smallest positive integer (n) such that, regardless of any \\"kind\\" placement of 2023 dividers, the mouse can reach the cheese in at most (n) steps.   Since the dividers can block the mouse's path, the mouse may need to take a longer path to reach the cheese. However, since the dividers are \\"kind\\", the mouse can still reach the cheese.

If n>49, then n is at least 7 times 41, while the average pirate has 7 coins, so the initial division is impossible. So, we can have n=7, n=41 or n=49. Each of these cases is possible (e.g. if n=49, the average pirate has 41 coins, so the initial amounts are from 41-24=17 to 41+24=65 ).If n is even, then 2009 is multiple of the sum S of the oldest and the youngest pirate. If S<7 times 41, then S is at most 39 and the pairs of pirates of sum S is at least 41 , so we must have at least 82 pirates, a contradiction. So we can have just S=7 times 41=287 and S=49 times 41=2009; respectively, n=2 times 7=14 or n=2 times 1=2.

The operation decreases one of the amounts by 6 and increases the other ones by 1 , so the residues will be different at all times. The largest possible amount in one pirate's possession will be achieved if all the others have as little as possible, namely 0,1,2,3,4 and 5 coins (the residues modulo 7 have to be different). If this happens, the wealthiest pirate will have 2009-14=1994 coins. Indeed, this can be achieved e.g. if every day (until that moment) the coins are given by the second wealthiest: while he has more than 5 coins, he can provide the 6 coins needed, and when he has no more than five, the coins at the poorest six pirates have to be 0,1,2,3,4,5.

Then from x^2+y^2=1001, we plug in y to find x^2=boxed{110}.Solution 4Let E be the intersection of the diagonals. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, applying the Pythagorean Theorem multiple times we havebegin{align*} BC^2&=BE^2+CE^2  &=(AB^2-AE^2)+(CD^2-DE^2)  &=CD^2+sqrt{11}^2-(AE^2+DE^2)  &=CD^2+11-AD^2  &=CD^2-990 end{align*}Followed by dropping the perpendicular like in solution 1, we obtain system of equation[BC^2=CD^2-990][BC^2+CD^2-2sqrt{11}CD=990]Rearrange the first equation yields[BC^2-CD^2=990]Equating it with the second equation we have[BC^2-CD^2=BC^2+CD^2-2sqrt{11}CD]Which gives CD^2=frac{BC^2}{11}.Substituting into equation 1 obtains the quadratic in terms of BC^2[(BC^2)^2-11BC^2-11cdot990=0]Solving the quadratic to obtain BC^2=boxed{110}.~ Nafer"},{"problem":"2.

(The leading digit of N cannot be zero.)[i]Based on a proposal by Yannick Yao[/i]","solution":"1. Understanding the constraints:   - N is a 5-digit number in base 10.   - N contains no digits greater than 3, so each digit of N can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.   - The leading digit of N cannot be zero.   - gcd(N, 15) = 1 and gcd(N, 20) = 1.2. Analyzing the gcd conditions:   - gcd(N, 15) = 1 implies N is not divisible by 3 and 5.   - gcd(N, 20) = 1 implies N is not divisible by 2 and 5.3. Implications for the digits of N:   - Since N is not divisible by 2, the units digit must be odd (1 or 3).   - Since N is not divisible by 3, the sum of its digits must not be divisible by 3.   - Since N is not divisible by 5, the units digit cannot be 0 or 5. Given the digits allowed (0, 1, 2, 3), the units digit must be 1 or 3.4. Counting valid numbers:   - The units digit has 2 choices: 1 or 3.   - The leading digit has 3 choices: 1, 2, or 3 (it cannot be 0).   - The middle three digits can be any of 0, 1, 2, or 3, giving 4^3 = 64 combinations.5. Ensuring the sum of digits is not divisible by 3:   - We need to count the combinations where the sum of the digits is not divisible by 3.   - Let's denote the digits of N as d_1d_2d_3d_4d_5, where d_1 is the leading digit and d_5 is the units digit.   - The sum of the digits is d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + d_5.6. Calculating the total number of valid numbers:   - For each choice of the units digit (1 or 3), we need to ensure the sum of the remaining digits is not divisible by 3.   - We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the valid combinations.7. Final calculation:   - For each choice of the units digit (1 or 3), there are 3 times 64 = 192 combinations for the other digits.   - We need to exclude the combinations where the sum of the digits is divisible by 3.   - By symmetry and the properties of modular arithmetic, approximately one-third of the combinations will have a sum divisible by 3.   - Therefore, we exclude frac{192}{3} = 64 combinations for each choice of the units digit.8. Total valid numbers:   - For each units digit (1 or 3), there are 192 - 64 = 128 valid combinations.   - Since there are 2 choices for the units digit, the total number of valid numbers is 2 times 128 = 256.The final answer is boxed{256}."},{"problem":"46.

Determine the minimum number of colors that must be used to color the vertices of this graph such that no two vertices sharing an edge are the same color.","solution":"1. Understanding the Graph Construction:   - We have a graph with vertices ( v_1, v_2, ldots, v_{1000} ).   - An edge exists between ( v_i ) and ( v_j ) if and only if ( i ) divides ( j ) (i.e., ( i mid j )).2. Identifying Cliques:   - A clique is a subset of vertices such that every two distinct vertices are adjacent.   - Consider the vertices ( v_1, v_2, v_4, ldots, v_{512} ). These vertices form a clique because:     - ( 1 mid 2 ), ( 1 mid 4 ), ( 2 mid 4 ), and so on.     - Each vertex ( v_{2^k} ) (where ( k ) ranges from 0 to 9) divides ( v_{2^m} ) for ( m > k ).3. Clique Size:   - The vertices ( v_1, v_2, v_4, ldots, v_{512} ) form a clique of size 10 because ( 2^9 = 512 ) and ( 2^{10} = 1024 ) which is greater than 1000.   - Therefore, we need at least 10 colors to color this clique since each vertex in a clique must have a unique color.4. Coloring Strategy:   - We color the vertices based on the number of prime factors in their prime factorization (counted with multiplicity).   - For example, ( 12 = 2^2 times 3 ) has 3 prime factors (2, 2, and 3).5. Prime Factorization and Coloring:   - Since ( 1000 < 2^{10} ), each number ( v_i ) (where ( 1 leq i leq 1000 )) has at most 9 prime factors.   - Therefore, we need 10 colors to ensure that no two adjacent vertices (where one divides the other) share the same color.6. Verification:   - If ( i mid j ), then the number of prime factors of ( i ) is less than or equal to the number of prime factors of ( j ).   - Thus, by coloring vertices based on the number of prime factors, we ensure that adjacent vertices have different colors.Conclusion:[boxed{10}]"},{"problem":"Given the arithmetic sequence {a_{n}} where a_{1}=3, and a_{2}+a_{5}=11.(I) Find the general term formula a_{n} for the sequence;(II) If c_{n}=2^{a_{n}-2}+n, find the sum of the first 10 terms S_{10} for the sequence {c_{n}}.","solution":"(I) For the arithmetic sequence {a_{n}}, we know that a_{1}=3 and a_{2}+a_{5}=11.

Adding dilute ammonia to water, the ionization of the hydrated ammonia produces OH^-, leading to an increase in the concentration of OH^- in the solution and inhibiting the ionization of water. Thus, the equilibrium shifts in the reverse direction, making statement A incorrect.  B. Adding solid sodium hydrogen sulfate, the ionization of sodium hydrogen sulfate produces H^+, increasing the concentration of H^+ in the solution. This inhibits the ionization of water. However, the temperature remains constant, so the ion product constant does not change, making statement B correct.  C. Adding solid NaOH, the ionization of NaOH produces OH^-, leading to an increase in the concentration of OH^- in the solution and inhibiting the ionization of water. Thus, the equilibrium shifts in the reverse direction, the concentration of H^+ decreases, but the temperature remains constant so the ion product constant does not change, making statement C incorrect.

Then from the previous equation y=p^{a}-1=1-1=0, which is not a natural number, so we have not obtained a solution to the original equation.In the second case, let b=0.

We'll make use of the following fact: if P is a point in the interior of triangle XYZ, and line XP intersects line YZ at point L, then dfrac{XP}{PL} = frac{[XPY] + [ZPX]}{[YPZ]}.This is true because triangles XPY and YPL have their areas in ratio XP:PL (as they share a common height from Y), and the same is true of triangles ZPY and LPZ.We'll also use the related fact that dfrac{[XPY]}{[ZPX]} = dfrac{YL}{LZ}.  This is slightly more well known, as it is used in the standard proof of [Ceva's theorem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Ceva%27s_theorem).Now we'll apply these results to the problem at hand.Since AP = PD = 6, this means that [APB] + [APC] = [BPC]; thus triangle BPC has half the area of triangle ABC.  And since PE = 3 = dfrac{1}{3}BP, we can conclude that triangle APC has one third of the combined areas of triangle BPC and APB, and thus dfrac{1}{4} of the area of triangle ABC.  This means that triangle APB is left with dfrac{1}{4} of the area of triangle ABC:[[BPC]: [APC]: [APB] = 2:1:1.]Since [APC] = [APB], and since dfrac{[APC]}{[APB]} = dfrac{CD}{DB}, this means that D is the midpoint of BC.Furthermore, we know that dfrac{CP}{PF} = dfrac{[APC] + [BPC]}{[APB]} = 3, so CP = dfrac{3}{4} cdot CF = 15.We now apply [Stewart's theorem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Stewart%27s_theorem) to segment PD in triangle BPC—or rather, the simplified version for a median.  This tells us that[2 BD^2 + 2 PD^2 = BP^2+ CP^2.] Plugging in we know, we learn thatbegin{align*} 2 BD^2 + 2 cdot 36 &= 81 + 225 = 306,  BD^2 &= 117. end{align*}Happily, BP^2 + PD^2 = 81 + 36 is also equal to 117.  Therefore triangle BPD is a right triangle with a right angle at B; its area is thus dfrac{1}{2} cdot 9 cdot 6 = 27.  As PD is a median of triangle BPC, the area of BPC is twice this, or 54.  And we already know that triangle BPC has half the area of triangle ABC, which must therefore be boxed{108}.Solution 2 (Mass Points, Stewart's Theorem, Heron's Formula)Because we're given three concurrent [cevians](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Cevian) and their lengths, it seems very tempting to apply [Mass points](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Mass_points). We immediately see that w_E = 3, w_B = 1, and w_A = w_D = 2. Now, we recall that the masses on the three sides of the triangle must be balanced out, so w_C = 1 and w_F = 3. Thus, CP = 15 and PF = 5. Recalling that w_C = w_B = 1, we see that DC = DB and DP is a [median](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Median) to BC in triangle BCP. Applying [Stewart's Theorem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Stewart%27s_Theorem), BC^2 + 12^2 = 2(15^2 + 9^2), and BC = 6sqrt {13}. Now notice that 2[BCP] = [ABC], because both triangles share the same base and the h_{triangle ABC} = 2h_{triangle BCP}. Applying [Heron's formula](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Heron%27s_formula) on triangle BCP with sides 15, 9, and 6sqrt{13}, [BCP] = 54 and [ABC] = boxed{108}.Solution 3 (Ceva's Theorem, Stewart's Theorem)Using a different form of [Ceva's Theorem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Ceva%27s_Theorem), we have frac {y}{x + y} + frac {6}{6 + 6} + frac {3}{3 + 9} = 1Longleftrightarrowfrac {y}{x + y} = frac {1}{4}Solving 4y = x + y and x + y = 20, we obtain x = CP = 15 and y = FP = 5.Let Q be the point on AB such that FC parallel QD.Since AP = PD and FPparallel QD, QD = 2FP = 10. (Stewart's Theorem)Also, since FCparallel QD and QD = frac{FC}{2}, we see that FQ = QB, BD = DC, etc. ([Stewart's Theorem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Stewart%27s_Theorem))Similarly, we have PR = RB (= frac12PB = 7.5) and thus RD = frac12PC = 4.5.PDR is a 3-4-5 [right triangle](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Right_triangle), so angle PDR (angle ADQ) is 90^circ.Therefore, the area of triangle ADQ = frac12cdot 12cdot 6 = 36.Using area ratio, triangle ABC = triangle ADBtimes 2 = left(triangle ADQtimes frac32right)times 2 = 36cdot 3 = boxed{108}.Solution 4 (Stewart's Theorem)First, let [AEP]=a, [AFP]=b, and [ECP]=c. Thus, we can easily find that frac{[AEP]}{[BPD]}=frac{3}{9}=frac{1}{3} Leftrightarrow [BPD]=3[AEP]=3a. Now, frac{[ABP]}{[BPD]}=frac{6}{6}=1Leftrightarrow [ABP]=3a. In the same manner, we find that [CPD]=a+c. Now, we can find that frac{[BPC]}{[PEC]}=frac{9}{3}=3 Leftrightarrow frac{(3a)+(a+c)}{c}=3 Leftrightarrow c=2a. We can now use this to find that frac{[APC]}{[AFP]}=frac{[BPC]}{[BFP]}=frac{PC}{FP} Leftrightarrow frac{3a}{b}=frac{6a}{3a-b} Leftrightarrow a=b. Plugging this value in, we find that frac{FC}{FP}=3 Leftrightarrow PC=15, FP=5. Now, since frac{[AEP]}{[PEC]}=frac{a}{2a}=frac{1}{2}, we can find that 2AE=EC. Setting AC=b, we can apply [Stewart's Theorem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Stewart%27s_Theorem) on triangle APC to find that (15)(15)(frac{b}{3})+(6)(6)(frac{2b}{3})=(frac{2b}{3})(frac{b}{3})(b)+(b)(3)(3). Solving, we find that b=sqrt{405} Leftrightarrow AE=frac{b}{3}=sqrt{45}. But, 3^2+6^2=45, meaning that angle{APE}=90 Leftrightarrow [APE]=frac{(6)(3)}{2}=9=a. Since [ABC]=a+a+2a+2a+3a+3a=12a=(12)(9)=108, we conclude that the answer is boxed{108}.Solution 5 (Mass of a Point, Stewart's Theorem, Heron's Formula)Firstly, since they all meet at one single point, denoting the mass of them separately. Assuming M(A)=6;M(D)=6;M(B)=3;M(E)=9; we can get that M(P)=12;M(F)=9;M(C)=3; which leads to the ratio between segments, [frac{CE}{AE}=2;frac{BF}{AF}=2;frac{BD}{CD}=1.] Denoting that CE=2x;AE=x; AF=y; BF=2y; CD=z; DB=z.Now we know three cevians' length, Applying Stewart theorem to them, getting three different equations:begin{align} (3x)^2 cdot 2y+(2z)^2 cdot y&=(3y)(2y^2+400),  (3y)^2 cdot z+(3x)^2 cdot z&=(2z)(z^2+144),  (2z)^2 cdot x+(3y)^2 cdot x&=(3x)(2x^2+144). end{align}After solving the system of equation, we get that x=3sqrt{5};y=sqrt{13};z=3sqrt{13};pulling x,y,z back to get the length of AC=9sqrt{5};AB=3sqrt{13};BC=6sqrt{13}; now we can apply Heron's formula here, which is [sqrtfrac{(9sqrt{5}+9sqrt{13})(9sqrt{13}-9sqrt{5})(9sqrt{5}+3sqrt{13})(9sqrt{5}-3sqrt{13})}{16}=108.]Our answer is boxed{108}.~bluesoulNote (how to find x and y without the system of equations)To ease computation, we can apply Stewart's Theorem to find x, y, and z directly. Since M(C)=3 and M(F)=9, overline{PC}=15 and overline{PF}=5. We can apply Stewart's Theorem on triangle CPE to get (2x+x)(2x cdot x) + 3^2 cdot 3x = 15^2 cdot x + 6^2cdot 2x. Solving, we find that x=3sqrt{5}. We can do the same on triangle APB and triangle BPC to obtain y and z. We proceed with Heron's Formula as the solution states. ~kn07Solution 6 (easier version of Solution 5)In Solution 5, instead of finding all of x, y, z, we only need y, z. This is because after we solve for y, z, we can notice that triangle BAD is isosceles with AB = BD. Because P is the midpoint of the base, BP is an altitude of triangle BAD. Therefore, [BAD] = frac{(AD)(BP)}{2} = frac{12 cdot 9}{2} = 54. Using the same altitude property, we can find that [ABC] = 2[BAD] = 2 cdot 54 = boxed{108}.-NL008Solution 7 (Mass Points, Stewart's Theorem, Simple Version)Set AF=x, and use [mass points](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Mass_points) to find that PF=5 and BF=2x. Using [Stewart's Theorem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Stewart%27s_Theorem) on APB, we find that AB=3sqrt{13}. Then we notice that APB is right, which means the area of APB is 27. Because CF=4cdot PF, the area of ABC is 4 times the area of APB, which means the area of ABC=4cdot 27=boxed{108}.Solution 8 (Ratios, Auxiliary Lines and 3-4-5 triangle)We try to solve this using only elementary concepts. Let the areas of triangles BCP, ACP and ABP be X, Y and Z respectively. Then frac{X}{Y+Z}=frac{6}{6}=1 and frac{Y}{X+Z}=frac{3}{9}=frac{1}{3}. Hence frac{X}{2}=Y=Z. Similarly frac{FP}{PC}=frac{Z}{X+Y}=frac{1}{3} and since CF=20 we then have FP=5. Additionally we now see that triangles FPE and CPB are similar, so FE parallel BC and frac{FE}{BC} = frac{1}{3}. Hence frac{AF}{FB}=frac{1}{2}. Now construct a point K on segment BP such that BK=6 and KP=3, we will have FK parallel AP, and hence frac{FK}{AP} = frac{FK}{6} = frac{2}{3}, giving FK=4. Triangle FKP is therefore a 3-4-5 triangle! So FK perp BE and so AP perp BE. Then it is easy to calculate that Z = frac{1}{2} times 6 times 9 = 27 and the area of triangle ABC = X+Y+Z = 4Z = 4 times 27 = boxed{108}.~LeoleSolution 9 (Just Trig Bash)We start with mass points as in Solution 2, and receive BF:AF = 2, BD:CD = 1, CE:AE = 2. [Law of Cosines](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Law_of_Cosines) on triangles ADB and ADC with theta = angle ADB and BD=DC=x gives[36+x^2-12xcos theta = 81][36+x^2-12xcos (180-theta) = 36+x^2+12xcos theta = 225]Adding them: 72+2x^2=306 implies x=3sqrt{13}, so BC = 6sqrt{13}. Similarly, AB = 3sqrt{13} and AC = 9sqrt{5}. Using Heron's,[[ triangle ABC ]= sqrt{left(dfrac{9sqrt{13}+9sqrt{5}}{2}right)left(dfrac{9sqrt{13}09sqrt{5}}{2}right)left(dfrac{3sqrt{13}+9sqrt{5}}{2}right)left(dfrac{-3sqrt{13}+9sqrt{5}}{2}right)} = boxed{108}.]~sml1809"},{"problem":"5.

This is because the logarithm of a number to its base squared equals 2. Given also that log_{b}a=frac{a}{b}, we can equate this to 2, leading to frac{a}{b}=2.Step 2: Solve the system of equations.From the equation frac{a}{b}=2, we can rewrite it as a=2b.

Identify Variables: Let's denote the decrease in selling price as x yuan. Consequently, the selling price becomes (90 - x) yuan per item. This decrease in price results in an increase in the number of items sold by x, making the total items sold per day (30 + x).2. Express the Profit Function: The profit for each item sold is the selling price minus the cost price, which is (90 - x) - 60 = 30 - x yuan. Therefore, the total profit per day, denoted as y, can be expressed as a product of the profit per item and the number of items sold: y = (30 - x) cdot (30 + x)3. Simplify the Profit Function: Next, we simplify the expression for y:y = (30 - x)(30 + x)y = 30^2 - x^2y = 900 - x^2This represents a quadratic function in the form of y = -x^2 + 900, indicating that the graph of this function is a parabola opening downwards, with its vertex representing the maximum point.4. Find the Maximum Profit: The maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola. Since the profit function is given by y = -x^2 + 900, and the maximum profit occurs when x = 0 (as there's no coefficient for x to consider for differentiation or completing the square), we deduce that reducing the price does not increase the profit beyond what it is when x = 0.5. Calculate the Optimal Selling Price: When x = 0, the selling price per item is (90 - x) = 90 yuan.

Analogously, angle BQK also has the same size.Triangles AKP and BKP have the same area, congruent sides AK and BK, and thus also the heights to these sides, and they also coincide in the angle opposite them. From the construction of a triangle given a side, the height to this side, and the opposite internal angle, and from the symmetry of the constructed solutions, it follows that triangle AKP is congruent either to triangle KBQ or to triangle BKP.

What is the smallest number of sides of an even length such a polygon can have?","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We are given a polygon built from 2005 dominoes, each of size (1 times 2). We need to determine the smallest number of sides of even length that such a polygon can have.2. Initial Considerations:   Each domino covers two unit squares. Therefore, the total area covered by the dominoes is (2005 times 2 = 4010) unit squares. 3. Chessboard Coloring Argument:   Consider a standard chessboard coloring of the coordinate grid. Each unit square is either black or white, and adjacent squares have different colors. Each domino covers one black and one white square.4. Vertices and Side Lengths:   Let (P) be the polygon formed by the dominoes. The vertices of (P) lie on the grid points. For each vertex (p) in (P), define (f(p)) as the difference between the number of black and white squares incident to (p). 5. Sum of (f(p)):   For vertices not on the boundary of (P), (f(p) = 0). For vertices on the boundary, (f(p)) can be (-1) or (1) depending on the orientation of the sides. Since the polygon has all odd sides, the sum of (f(p)) over all vertices must be non-zero, implying an imbalance between black and white squares.6. Green's Theorem Application:   Using Green's theorem, we can relate the sum of (f(p)) to the geometry of the polygon. Specifically, if all sides were odd, the sum would not balance, leading to a contradiction.7. Height Function Argument:   The height function argument states that for any cycle enclosing a region tiled by dominoes, the sum of the height function over the vertices of the cycle must vanish. If all sides were odd, this sum would not vanish, leading to another contradiction.8. Conclusion:   Since having all sides of odd length leads to contradictions, the polygon must have at least some sides of even length. The smallest number of sides of even length that balances the conditions is 2. This is because having exactly two sides of even length can balance the sum of (f(p)) while maintaining the tiling by dominoes.The final answer is (boxed{2})."},{"problem":"## 71.

First, let's denote the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse as a and b, respectively. From the equation of the ellipse, we have a^2 = 49 and b^2 = 24. Therefore, a=7 and b=2sqrt{6}.2. Recall that for an ellipse, the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant and equal to the length of the major axis. Mathematically, |PF_1| + |PF_2| = 2a = 14.3. Given that |PF_1| : |PF_2| = 4 : 3, we can write |PF_1| = frac{4}{7} cdot 14 = 8 and |PF_2| = frac{3}{7} cdot 14 = 6.4. Now, let's find the distance between the two foci, F_1F_2. The distance between the foci of an ellipse is given by 2sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = 2sqrt{49-24} = 2sqrt{25} = 10.5. To find the area of the triangle triangle PF_1F_2, we will use Heron's formula, which states that the area of a triangle with sides a, b, and c is given by sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}, where s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, given by s = frac{a+b+c}{2}.6. In our case, the sides of the triangle are |PF_1| = 8, |PF_2| = 6, and |F_1F_2| = 10. Therefore, the semi-perimeter is s = frac{8+6+10}{2} = 12.7.

Define the problem and constraints:   We need to find the number of distinct sums that can be made by adding exactly 8 numbers chosen from the set ({1, 4, 7, 10}), with each number in the set chosen at least once.2.

Determine the smallest possible degree of f.(Note, for example, that the degree of the polynomial g(x,y)=4x^3y^4+yx+x-2 is 7 because 7=3+4.)[i]Ankan Bhattacharya[/i]","solution":"To determine the smallest possible degree of the polynomial ( f ), we need to analyze the conditions under which ( f ) evaluates to zero. The polynomial ( f ) is zero if and only if the given ( 2n ) points form the vertices of a regular ( 2n )-gon or are all equal.  Step 1: Establishing the Sign of ( f )First, we note a key property of ( f ):Claim: Either ( f ge 0 ) or ( f le 0 ).Proof: This follows from the fact that the zero-set of ( f ) is very sparse. If ( f ) takes on both positive and negative values, we can move the points ( A_1, dots, A_{2n} ) from a configuration where ( f ) is negative to one where ( f ) is positive without ever having them form a regular ( 2n )-gon, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, ( f ) must be non-negative or non-positive. (blacksquare) Step 2: Degree BoundTo show that (deg f ge 2n), we will animate the points ( A_1, dots, A_{2n} ) linearly in a variable ( t ). Define ( g(t) = f(A_1(t), dots, A_{2n}(t)) ). The degree of ( g(t) ) is at most (deg f), assuming ( g(t) ) is not identically zero. Step 3: Multiple RootsThe previous lemma establishes that any root of ( g(t) ) must be a multiple root. If we can show that there are at least ( n ) roots, we will have shown (deg g ge 2n), and thus (deg f ge 2n). Step 4: Geometric ConstructionWe need to exhibit ( 2n ) linearly moving points such that they form a regular ( 2n )-gon a total of ( n ) times, but not always form one. Draw ( n ) mirrors through the origin, as lines making angles of (frac{pi}{n}) with each other. Any point ( P ) has a total of ( 2n ) reflections in the mirrors. Draw the ( n ) angle bisectors of adjacent mirrors. The reflections of ( P ) form a regular ( 2n )-gon if and only if ( P ) lies on one of the bisectors. Step 5: AnimationAnimate ( P ) on any line which intersects all ( n ) bisectors, and let ( P_1, dots, P_{2n} ) be its reflections. These points will form a regular ( 2n )-gon at least ( n ) times. They will not always form a regular ( 2n )-gon, establishing (deg f ge 2n). Step 6: Construction of ( f )We will construct ( f ) as a sum of squares. Write ( f = f_1^2 + dots + f_k^2 ). If their degrees are ( d_1, dots, d_k ), then ( f ) has degree at most ( 2 max(d_1, dots, d_k) ). Step 7: ConstraintsWe need polynomials of degree at most ( n ) such that ( 2n ) points are the vertices of a regular ( 2n )-gon if and only if the polynomials are all zero at those points. Assume ( A_1 + dots + A_{2n} = 0 ). First, impose the constraints that all ( |A_i|^2 = x_i^2 + y_i^2 ) are equal. This uses multiple degree 2 constraints. Now, the points lie on a circle with center 0. If the circle has radius 0, all ( A_i ) coincide. Step 8: Lemma for Regular ( 2n )-gonLemma: Suppose ( a_1, dots, a_{2n} ) are complex numbers of the same nonzero magnitude, and ( a_1^k + dots + a_{2n}^k = 0 ) for all ( k in {1, dots, n} ). Then ( a_1, dots, a_{2n} ) form a regular ( 2n )-gon centered at the origin.Proof: Assume ( a_1, dots, a_{2n} ) lie on the unit circle. By Newton's sums, the ( k )-th symmetric sums of ( a_1, dots, a_{2n} ) are zero for ( k in {1, dots, n} ). Taking conjugates, ( a_1^{-k} + dots + a_{2n}^{-k} = 0 ) for ( k in {1, dots, n} ). The first ( 2n-1 ) symmetric sums of ( a_1, dots, a_{2n} ) are zero, implying they form a regular ( 2n )-gon. (blacksquare) Step 9: Encoding ConstraintsWrite ( a_r = x_r + y_r i ). The constraint ( a_1^k + dots + a_{2n}^k = 0 ) can be expressed as ( p_k + q_k i = 0 ), where ( p_k ) and ( q_k ) are real polynomials. Impose ( p_k = 0 ) and ( q_k = 0 ), conditions of degree ( k le n ). Step 10: Final PolynomialTaking the sum of squares of all these constraints gives a polynomial ( f ) of degree at most ( 2n ) which works whenever ( A_1 + dots + A_{2n} = 0 ). The centroid-shifting trick gives a polynomial which works in general.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ 2n } )"},{"problem":"3.

Identify the problem constraints and initial conditions:   - Lucía multiplies some positive one-digit numbers and obtains a number ( n ) greater than 10.   - She then multiplies all the digits of ( n ) and obtains an odd number.   - We need to find all possible values of the units digit of ( n ).2. Analyze the units digit of ( n ):   - The units digit of ( n ) must be such that when all digits of ( n ) are multiplied, the result is an odd number.   - For the product of the digits of ( n ) to be odd, all digits of ( n ) must be odd (since the presence of any even digit would make the product even).3. Possible odd digits:   - The odd digits are ( 1, 3, 5, 7, ) and ( 9 ).4. Consider the units digit of ( n ):   - If the units digit of ( n ) is ( 1, 3, 7, ) or ( 9 ), then ( n ) must be of the form ( 3^a cdot 7^b ) (since any factors of ( 2 ) or ( 5 ) would make the units digit ( 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 ) or ( 0, 5 ), respectively).5. Analyze the form ( 3^a cdot 7^b ):   - We need to check the possible units digits of ( 3^a cdot 7^b ) modulo 20.   - Notice that ( 3^a cdot 7^b equiv 21^b cdot 3^{a-b} equiv 3^{a-b} pmod{20} ).6. Calculate the units digits of powers of 3 modulo 20:   - ( 3^0 equiv 1 pmod{20} )   - ( 3^1 equiv 3 pmod{20} )   - ( 3^2 equiv 9 pmod{20} )   - ( 3^3 equiv 27 equiv 7 pmod{20} )   - ( 3^4 equiv 81 equiv 1 pmod{20} )7. Possible units digits of ( n ):   - From the above, ( n equiv 1, 3, 9, 7 pmod{20} ).8. Check the tens digit condition:   - If the tens digit of ( n ) is odd, then the remainder when ( n ) is divided by 20 would have an odd tens digit, which is a contradiction since the product of the digits of ( n ) must be odd.   - Therefore, ( n ) must have an even tens digit.9. Conclusion:   - The units digit of ( n ) cannot be ( 1, 3, 7, ) or ( 9 ) because the tens digit must be even.   - The only remaining possibility is that the units digit of ( n ) is ( 5 ), which works for ( n = 3 cdot 5 = 15 ).The final answer is (boxed{5})"},{"problem":"1.

For n=3, Zoé cannot play if Yvan removes the second card. For 4 leqslant n leqslant 13, Yvan removes the fourth card. Two cases arise: either Zoé removes cards with a number greater than 4: in this case, there are at most 3 sequences of consecutive cards. Zoé cannot play in the first, and the other two sequences contain at most 9-2=7 cards. In particular, the smallest sequence contains at most 3 cards, so there is only one possibility for Zoé to play. Either Yvan cannot play, or he takes three cards from the middle of the largest sequence, in which case Zoé cannot play (there will be at most 4 cards left in the sequence, but if there are that many, they will be split into 2, so Zoé cannot play.If Zoé removes cards that are lower, she cannot remove 4 lower cards on the next turn. Yvan then removes 3 cards if possible from the middle of the n-4 leqslant 9 largest cards, so that there are at most 3 consecutive cards left, which is possible because 3+3+3 geqslant n-4. Thus, Zoé cannot play.Let's show that for n=14, Zoé can play two turns. If Yvan takes the first or second card, Zoé takes the next two cards, leaving at least 10 consecutive cards. In particular, by removing 3 cards, 7 cards are left divided into two sequences, so one sequence must contain at least 4 cards, and Zoé can play. If Yvan takes the third or fourth card, Zoé can take the first two cards, leaving 10 consecutive cards, and Zoé can ensure she plays a second turn in the same way. If Yvan takes the fifth, sixth, or seventh card, Zoé takes the next two cards. There will then be 4, 5, 6 cards on the left and 7, 6, 5 cards on the right consecutively, and Zoé can play her second move by removing 4 cards from the consecutive sequence in which Yvan did not draw. Since the game is symmetric, the case where Yvan draws the i-th card with i geqslant 8 is the same as if Yvan had drawn the 15-i-th card and 15-i leqslant 7.

Factorizing yieldsp(p+1)=(n-q)(n+q+1)If p is a divisor of n-q, there is no solution, as p+1 is then smaller than n+q+1. Thus p divides the term n+q+1. Analogous to the factorization above, we get that q is a divisor of n+p+1. First we consider the possibility p=q. Then 2 p(p+1)=n(n+1) . p divides n+1. Thus p+1 is a divisor of n and therefore 2 is a divisor of n+1. It follows that 2(n+1)=p and p=n, i.e. p=2. This gives us the solution (p, q, n)=(2,2,3).Now we can assume that p is greater than q. Thus p is greater than n / 2-1. Furthermore, q is smaller than n. It follows that we must consider the three cases p=n+q+1,2 p=n+q+1 and 3 p=n+q+1. In the first case, there is no solution as p is smaller than n. In the second case, with 2 p-n-1=q and q mid n+p+1, we get that q is a divisor of 3 p. Since p is greater than q, the possibility q=3 remains. Inserting q=3 and n=2 p-4 yields the quadratic equation 3 p^{2}-15 p=0 and thus the solution (p, q, n)=(3,5,6). In the third case, with 3 p-n-1=q and q mid n+p+1, we get that q is a divisor of 4 p. Since p is greater than q, the case q=2 remains. Inserting n=3 p-3 shows that p(8 p-16)=0. However, the left-hand side is strictly positive for p>q=2, so we do not get a solution in this case.This means that (2,2,3) and (3,5,6) are the only two solutions."},{"problem":"3.

It is clear that p is not congruent to 0 modulo 3, so p equiv 2(bmod 3). Suppose that p^{2} mid n. Then p^{2} equiv 1(bmod 3), so p^{2}+2 equiv 0 (bmod 3).

When the last diagonal is removed, it no longer intersects with any remaining diagonals, and the graph is reduced by 1 region, leaving 1 region. Thus, d_{C_{n}^{2}-n}^{2}+1=1.

Imagine transplanting a red rose to each bow-shaped region at the vertices, then the number of roses is the number of regions. This problem is the same as a problem in the 1999 No. 3 issue of the High School Mathematical Olympiad training questions, and a new proof is provided here.Consider the recursive relationship between f(k) and f(k+1) (as shown in Figure 14).For the case of k points, when point A_{k+1} is added, A_{k+1} connects to the previous k points with k lines (dashed lines in Figure 14). At this point, the graph has mathrm{C}_{k+1}^{4} diagonal intersection points, and the number of new intersection points added is C_{k+1}^{4}-C_{k}^{4}. Since each line A_{k+1} A_{i}(1 leqslant i leqslant k) intersects with the sides or diagonals of the original k-sided polygon at d_{i} points left(d_{i} geqslant 0right), these intersection points divide A_{k+1} A_{i} into d_{i}+1 non-overlapping small segments. Each such small segment divides the region it is in into two, so the line A_{k+1} A_{i} adds d_{i}+1 regions. Summing up,begin{array}{c}f(k+1)-f(k)=sum_{i=1}^{k}left(d_{i}+1right) =sum_{i=1}^{k} d+k=left(C_{k+1}^{4}-C_{k}^{4}right)+k=C_{k}^{3}+C_{k}^{1} text { Therefore, } f(n)=sum_{k=5}^{n}(f(k)-f(k-1))+f(4) =sum_{k=5}^{n}left(C_{k-1}^{3}+C_{k}^{1} 1right)+8 quad(f(4)=8) =left(C_{n}^{3}+cdots+C_{3}^{3}right)-C_{3}^{3}+left(C_{n}^{1} quad+cdots+C_{2}^{1}+right.end{array}Therefore, f(n)=sum_{k=5}^{n}(f(k)-f(k-1))+f(4)begin{aligned}& left.mathrm{C}_{1}^{1}right)-mathrm{C}_{3}^{1}-mathrm{C}_{2}^{1}-mathrm{C}_{1}^{1}+8 = & mathrm{C}_{n}^{4}+mathrm{C}_{n}^{2}+1end{aligned}Note: This problem has the background of Euler's theorem, and the formula F=E-V+2 can be directly substituted to solve it.(2) The general formula can be rewritten asf(n)=frac{1}{24}left(n^{4}-6 n^{3}+23 n^{2}-18 n+24right)The problem is transformed into solving the equationfrac{1}{24}left(n^{4}-6 n^{3}+23 n^{2}-18 n+24right)=99which simplifies ton^{4}-6 n^{3}+23 n^{2}-18 n-2352=0,or (n-8)left(n^{3}+2 n^{2}+39 n+294right)=0Since n is a positive integer, we haven^{3}+2 n^{2}+39 n+294>0 text {. }Solving this, we get n=8Therefore, when n=8, there are exactly 99 roses in the rose garden.(Luo Zengru, Shaanxi Normal University, 710062)"},{"problem":"8.

For example, the geometric interpretation of the algebraic expression |x-2| is \\"the distance between the point corresponding to x on the number line and the point corresponding to 2.\\" Based on the above material, please try to solve the following problem: If the minimum value of |x+a|+|x-3| is 5, then a is ______.","solution":"To solve the problem of finding the value of a such that the minimum value of |x+a|+|x-3| is 5, we analyze the expression geometrically as the sum of distances on the number line. We consider two cases based on the positions of -a and 3 on the number line:Case 1: When -a > 3, the expression |x+a|+|x-3| simplifies to (x+a)+(x-3) because both x+a and x-3 will be positive if x is chosen to be greater than both -a and 3. This simplifies to 2x+a-3. The minimum value of this linear expression in terms of x is achieved when x is as small as possible, which, under our assumption, happens when x approaches -a (since -a > 3). Thus, we set 2x+a-3=5 and substitute x=-a to find a:begin{align*}2(-a)+a-3 &= 5 -2a+a &= 5+3 -a &= 8 a &= -8.end{align*}Case 2: When -a < 3, the expression |x+a|+|x-3| simplifies to (x+a)-(x-3) or (3-x)+(x+a) because one of the terms will be positive and the other negative if x is between -a and 3. This simplifies to a+3. The minimum value of this constant expression is simply its own value, so we set it equal to 5 to find a:begin{align*}a+3 &= 5 a &= 5-3 a &= 2.end{align*}Therefore, based on our analysis, the value of a that satisfies the given condition can either be -8 or 2.

Case 1: All terms are the same:   The sequence is ({2n - 2k + 1, 2n - 2k + 1, 2n - 2k + 1}).   - There is only 1 possible joke sequence in this case.3.

By conclusion (*), this subgraph has at most left[frac{5^{2}}{4}right] = 6 edges, so the number of triangles with A_{1} as a vertex is at most 6, which is a contradiction.(2) If 6 edges A_{1} A_{2}, A_{1} A_{3}, cdots, A_{1} A_{7} are drawn from A_{1}, then similarly, the number of triangles with A_{1} as a vertex is at most left[frac{6^{2}}{4}right] = 9, which is a contradiction.(3) If 7 edges A_{1} A_{2}, cdots, A_{1} A_{8} are drawn from A_{1}, since there is no tetrahedron, the subgraph formed by the points A_{2}, cdots, A_{8} has no triangles. Using conclusion (*), this subgraph has at most left[frac{7^{2}}{4}right] = 12 edges.

Verification: We need to verify that for any three elements ( a, b, c ) in ( M ), the condition ( |a + b - c| > 10 ) holds.4.

Conclusion: Since the assumption leads to a contradiction, the condition ( |a + b - c| > 10 ) holds for all ( a, b, c ) in ( M ).6.

Let's find the volume of the pyramid.Construction of the image. Let the quadrilateral S A B C with its diagonals be the image of the given pyramid (Fig. 85). This image is complete. Considering triangle A B C as the image of a regular triangle, we use two parameters, considering [S O] as the image of the height of the pyramid, we also use two parameters. Construct [S D] - the median of triangle S B C - the image of the apothem of the lateral face of the pyramid. Let [A K] be the image of the perpendicular dropped from the vertex A of the given pyramid to the apothem of the opposite lateral face. As it is not difficult to show, the segment A K will then also be the image of the height dropped from the vertex of the base to the lateral face. This metric condition, imposed on the image, entails the use of another parameter. Thus, all five parameters have been used on the image. However, the condition that in the original left|A_{0} B_{0}right|=a and left|A_{0} K_{0}right|=b has remained unaccounted for. The fact that these data are literal gives some freedom; we will consider that on the constructed image |A B|:|A K|=a: b. Thus, we impose another metric condition on the image and, consequently, use another parameter. But then the image becomes metrically overdefined. Nevertheless, with the fulfillment of a certain dependence between a and b (we will obtain this dependence in the study) the constructed image is correct.Since by the meaning of the problem the height A_{0} K_{0} exists, then from Delta S_{0} A_{0} D_{0}, where left|A_{0} K_{0}right|=b and left|A_{0} D_{0}right|=frac{a sqrt{3}}{2}, it can be calculated that left|D_{0} K_{0}right|:left|S_{0} K_{0}right|=frac{3 a^{2}-4 b^{2}}{4 b^{2}-2 a^{2}}. 130Choosing different (admissible) values of a and b, we will obtain different values of the ratio left|D_{0} K_{0}right|:left|S_{0} K_{0}right|, i.e., and different positions of the point K_{0}.

With such a specific assignment of values of a and b, as we see, the position of the point K_{0} will be quite determined, since left|D_{0} K_{0}right|:left|S_{0} K_{0}right|=11: 14. This means that the arbitrariness in the image of the point K_{0} is no longer permissible.Given: quad S A B C- regular pyramid, S-vertex, [A K]- height dropped to the face S B C,|A B|=a,|A K|=b.To find: V- volume of the pyramid.","solution":"Solution.

A larger R^2 value indicates a better fit of the model.

To find the value of frac{b}{a}+frac{a}{b}+1, we proceed as follows:   [   frac{b}{a}+frac{a}{b}+1 = frac{b^2+a^2}{ab}+1 = frac{(a+b)^2-2ab}{ab}+1 = frac{(-5)^2}{-6}-1   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   frac{25}{-6}-1 = -frac{31}{6}   ]   Therefore, the value is encapsulated as:   [   boxed{-frac{31}{6}}   ]3. For the equation x-frac{2023k-2022k^2}{x-1}=2023k-2022, we recognize it as a cross fraction equation. By comparing it to the standard form and simplifying, we find:   [   (x_{1}-1)(x_{2}-1) = -2023k+2022k^2 = k(-2023+2022)   ]   and   [   (x_{1}-1)+(x_{2}-1) = 2023k-2023   ]   Given k > 2 and x_{1} > x_{2}, we deduce:   [   x_{1}-1 = 2022k-2023, quad x_{2}-1 = k   ]   Therefore, x_{1} = 2022k-2022 and x_{2} = k+1. Substituting these into frac{x_{1}+4044}{x_{2}}, we get:   [   frac{2022k-2022+4044}{k+1} = frac{2022(k+1)}{k+1} = 2022   ]   Thus, the value is encapsulated as:   [   boxed{2022}   ]"},{"problem":"Given vectors a=(2,-1), b=(-1,m), and c=(-1,2), if (a+b) parallel c, find the value of m.","solution":"This problem involves vector coordinate operations and the condition for vector parallelism.

Find the sum of the digits of 9A.","solution":"1. Let ( A ) be a natural number whose decimal digits form an increasing sequence. We can represent ( A ) as ( A = overline{a_n a_{n-1} a_{n-2} dots a_0}_{10} ), where ( a_n, a_{n-1}, dots, a_0 ) are the digits of ( A ) and ( a_n < a_{n-1} < cdots < a_0 ).2. To find the sum of the digits of ( 9A ), we first express ( 9A ) in terms of ( A ):   [   9A = 10A - A   ]3. Consider the decimal representation of ( 10A ). If ( A = overline{a_n a_{n-1} a_{n-2} dots a_0}_{10} ), then:   [   10A = overline{a_n a_{n-1} a_{n-2} dots a_0 0}_{10}   ]   This shifts all digits of ( A ) one place to the left and appends a zero at the end.4. Now, subtract ( A ) from ( 10A ):   [   9A = 10A - A = overline{a_n a_{n-1} a_{n-2} dots a_0 0}_{10} - overline{a_n a_{n-1} a_{n-2} dots a_0}_{10}   ]5. Perform the subtraction digit by digit:   [   overline{a_n a_{n-1} a_{n-2} dots a_0 0}_{10} - overline{a_n a_{n-1} a_{n-2} dots a_0}_{10} = overline{(a_n)(a_{n-1} - a_n)(a_{n-2} - a_{n-1}) dots (a_0 - a_1 - 1)(10 - a_0)}_{10}   ]6. Since the digits of ( A ) form an increasing sequence, each subtraction ( a_{i-1} - a_i ) results in a non-negative digit, and the last term ( 10 - a_0 ) is also a non-negative digit.7. The sum of the digits of ( 9A ) can be calculated as follows:   [   sum_{i=1}^{n} (a_{i-1} - a_i) + (10 - a_0)   ]8. Notice that the sum of the differences ( (a_{i-1} - a_i) ) telescopes to ( a_n - a_0 ):   [   (a_n - a_{n-1}) + (a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}) + cdots + (a_1 - a_0) = a_n - a_0   ]9. Therefore, the sum of the digits of ( 9A ) is:   [   a_n - a_0 + (10 - a_0) = a_n - a_0 + 10 - a_0 = a_n + 10 - 2a_0   ]10. Since ( a_n ) and ( a_0 ) are digits of ( A ) and ( a_n < a_0 ), the sum of the digits of ( 9A ) simplifies to:    [    9    ]The final answer is (boxed{9})."},{"problem":"Example 5 Let n be a natural number, a, b be positive real numbers, and satisfy a+b=2.

Define ( P_k(z) ) as:   [   P_k(z) := (1-z)^{b_1}(1-z^2)^{b_2}cdots(1-z^k)^{b_k}   ]   This polynomial has the property that if we multiply it out and discard all terms involving ( z ) to a power larger than ( k ), what is left is just ( 1-2z ). We aim to show that this property holds for all ( k ).2. Base Case:   For ( k = 1 ), we have:   [   P_1(z) = (1-z)^{b_1}   ]   To satisfy ( P_1(z) = 1-2z ), we need ( b_1 = 2 ). Thus, ( P_1(z) = (1-z)^2 = 1 - 2z + z^2 ), and discarding the ( z^2 ) term leaves ( 1-2z ).3. Inductive Step:   Assume the property holds for ( k ), i.e., ( P_k(z) = 1-2z + a_{k+1}z^{k+1} + cdots ). Then for ( k+1 ):   [   P_{k+1}(z) = P_k(z)(1-z^{k+1})^{b_{k+1}}   ]   To maintain the property, we need ( b_{k+1} = a_{k+1} ).4.

Base Case for Sum of Powers:   For ( n = 1 ), ( b_1 = 2 ), and the sum of the roots of ( P_1 ) is 2.7. Inductive Step for Sum of Powers:   Assume ( Q_{n,n} = 2^n ). The sum of the ( n )-th powers of the roots of ( P_{n+1} ) is the sum of the ( n )-th powers of the roots of ( P_n ) plus the sum of the ( n )-th powers of the roots of ( (1-z^{n+1})^{b_{n+1}} ).8. Roots of Unity:   Let ( omega ) be a primitive ((n+1))-th root of unity. Then:   [   1 + omega^n + omega^{2n} + cdots + omega^{n^2} = 0   ]   Thus, ( Q_{n+1,n} = Q_{n,n} ).9. Newton's Sums:   Using Newton's Sums, since all coefficients of ( P_n ) smaller than ( n ) (excluding the ( 1-2z ) terms) are zero, we get:   [   0 = Q_{n+1,n+1} - 2Q_{n+1,n} = Q_{n+1,n+1} - 2Q_{n,n}   ]   Therefore:   [   Q_{n+1,n+1} = 2Q_{n,n} = 2^{n+1}   ]10. Expression for ( Q_{n,n} ):    We need another expression for ( Q_{n,n} ) in terms of the ( b_i ).

The derivative of y is y' = frac{x_0(3 - 2ln x_0) + frac{1}{x_0}}{(1 - ln x_0)^2}. Since 3 - 2ln x_0 in [1, 3], the derivative is always positive, meaning the function y is increasing on [1, e].

Then, in the corresponding A-type groups A_{k_{1}}, A_{k_{2}}, cdots, A_{k_{n}} and B-type groups B_{s_{1}}, B_{s_{2}}, cdots, B_{s_{b}}, each number x_{i} in the A-type group A_{k_{i}} must appear in some B-type group B_{x_{j}}, and each number x_{j} in the B-type group B_{x_{j}} must appear in some A-type group A_{r_{i}} (otherwise, there would be an edge connecting to a vertex outside the component, leading to a contradiction).Therefore, the sum of the numbers in the a A-type groups A_{k_{1}}, A_{k_{2}}, cdots, A_{k_{1}} should equal the sum of the numbers in the b B-type groups B_{x_{1}}, B_{s_{2}}, cdots, B_{s_{b}}, i.e., 49a = 41b, from which it follows that 41 mid a and 49 mid b.Thus, a + b geq 41 + 49 = 90, which is a contradiction.Therefore, the graph G is connected.Thus, the graph G has at least 90 - 1 = 89 edges, i.e., n geq 89.On the other hand, we can construct a sequence of 89 terms x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{89} that satisfies the conditions of the problem.For example, take[begin{array}{l}x_{1} = x_{2} = cdots = x_{41} = 41, x_{42} = x_{43} = cdots = x_{75} = 8, x_{76} = x_{77} = x_{78} = x_{79} = 7, x_{80} = x_{81} = x_{82} = x_{83} = 1, x_{84} = x_{85} = 6, x_{86} = x_{87} = 2, x_{88} = 5, x_{89} = 3,end{array}]i.e., the sequence has 41 terms with a value of 41; 34 terms with a value of 8; and the remaining seven 8s can be split into seven pairs: four pairs of {7,1}, two pairs of {6,2}, and one pair of {5,3}, yielding 14 more terms.Thus, each A-type group can consist of one 41, one 8, or one 41 and a pair of terms that sum to 8, resulting in 41 A-type groups, each with a sum of 49.To obtain 49 B-type groups with a sum of 41, we can form one group for each of x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{41}, and the remaining numbers can be combined into eight B-type groups: four groups of {8,8,8,8,8,1}, two groups of {8,8,8,8,7,2}, one group of {8,8,8,8,6,3}, and one group of {8,8,7,7,6,5}.Thus, the minimum value of n is 89."},{"problem":"In the sequence {a_n}, it is known that S_n=1-5+9-13+17-21+cdots +{(-1)}^{n-1}(4n-3), then the value of S_{17}+S_{22} is.","solution":"AnalysisThis problem examines the use of grouping to transform and calculate the sum of a sequence, separately finding S_{17} and S_{22} to obtain the result.SolutionSince S_n=1−5+9−13+17−21+⋯+{(-1)}^{n−1}(4n−3),we have S_{17}=1-5+9-13+⋯+left(4×17-3right)=8×left(-4right)+left(4×17-3right)=33,and S_{22}=1-5+9-13+⋯+left(4×21-3right)-left(4×22-3right)=11×left(-4right)=-44,Therefore, S_{17}+S_{22}=-11.Hence, the answer is boxed{-11}."},{"problem":"14th Mexico 2000 Problem A2 A triangle is constructed like that below, but with 1, 2, 3, ... , 2000 as the first row.

Therefore, option A is correct, stating that the real part of z is frac{2}{5}, while option B is incorrect as it suggests the imaginary part is positive frac{1}{5}.Next, we compute the modulus of z to check option C:[|z| = sqrt{left(frac{2}{5}right)^2 + left(-frac{1}{5}right)^2} = sqrt{frac{4}{25} + frac{1}{25}} = sqrt{frac{5}{25}} = frac{sqrt{5}}{5}]This shows that the modulus of z is frac{sqrt{5}}{5}, not frac{1}{5}, hence option C is incorrect.Finally, considering the point corresponding to complex number z on the complex plane, which is left(frac{2}{5}, -frac{1}{5}right), it is evident that it lies in the fourth quadrant, not the first, making option D incorrect.Therefore, the correct choice is:[boxed{A}]"},{"problem":"5.

If n is odd, S is the sum of an odd number of odd terms, which naturally produces an odd number. Therefore, S can only take values that differ from n by an even number, that is, values in the setA={-n,-(n-2), ldots, n-2 l, ldots, n-2, n}The previous example provides an idea of how to show that any number of the form k=n-2 l in the set A can be obtained.Draw a \\"snake\\" with length n+k=2 n-2 l on the y-axis and length n-k=2 l on the x-axis as indicated in the drawing below![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_01_4747cb56a5540358921fg-40.jpg?height=568&width=602&top_left_y=384&top_left_x=630)The segments on the y-axis will contribute the number frac{n+k}{2}=n-l and those on the x-axis will contribute the number -frac{n-k}{2}=l.

The theorem of Gauss then indicates that 3^{z} divides 3^{2x} (since 5^{x} - 3^{y-2x} times 2^{y} is not divisible by 3, and thus is coprime with 3^{z}) and that 3^{2x} divides 3^{z} (since 673^{z} is not divisible by 3, and thus is coprime with 3^{2x}).

It is also x neq y; if x=y, we would get lfloor x / yrfloor=lfloor y / xrfloor=1, so from the first equation we would get x=5 and from the second equation y=-6, which contradicts the equality x=y. Similarly, it cannot be x=-y, so it is even |x| neq|y|.If both unknowns had the same sign, one of the numbers x / y, y / x would be in the interval (0,1), so its integer part would be 0, which does not lead to a solution.

From them, it also follows that x<0 and y>0.The signs of the numbers x, y are different and the absolute values of these numbers are also different, so exactly one of the numbers x / y, y / x is in the interval (-1,0), and its integer part is therefore -1.First, we examine the case lfloor x / yrfloor=-1.

It is said that few people solved this problem that year, indicating its considerable difficulty. The challenge lies in the fact that using Cauchy, adjustments, or directly applying local inequalities for magnification are all difficult to achieve. First, we can easily guess the answer to be frac{3}{2}, with equality holding if and only if a_{1}=a_{2}=1, a_{3}=a_{4}=cdots=a_{n}=0 and its cyclic permutations. In this case, frac{a_{1}}{a_{2}^{2}+1}=frac{1}{2}, frac{a_{2}}{a_{3}^{2}+1}=1, and their positions are unequal, so we consider splitting these two terms.

Establish Relationship Between Selling Price and Sales Volume:   According to the given information, when the selling price is reduced by 1 yuan, the sales volume increases by 80 kilograms. When the selling price is 26 yuan, 320 kilograms are sold. Therefore, if the selling price is x yuan, the sales volume can be expressed as 320 + 80(26 - x).

Let the major and minor axes of the ellipse be 2a and 2b, respectively, and the transverse and conjugate axes of the hyperbola be 2a' and 2b', respectively.Since one endpoint of the ellipse's minor axis is B, and the line F_1B is parallel to one of the hyperbola's asymptotes, we have:k_{F_1B} = frac{b'}{a'} Rightarrow frac{b}{c} = frac{b'}{a'} Rightarrow frac{b'^2}{a'^2} = frac{b^2}{c^2} Rightarrow frac{c^2}{a'^2} = frac{a^2}{c^2}Thus, (frac{c}{a'})^2 = (frac{a}{c})^2.Given that e_1 = frac{c}{a} and e_2 = frac{c}{a'}, we have e_1 cdot e_2 = 1.Since e_1 and e_2 are both positive numbers, we have:3e_1^2 + e_2^2 > 2sqrt{3e_1^2e_2^2} = 2sqrt{3}The equality holds if and only if 3e_1^2 = e_2^2, i.e., e_2 = sqrt{3}e_1, e_1^2 = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, and e_2^2 = sqrt{3}.Therefore, the minimum value of 3e_1^2 + e_2^2 is 2sqrt{3}.Hence, the answer is boxed{2sqrt{3}}.This problem tests the comprehensive application of the properties of hyperbolas and ellipses, the relationship between the slope formula of a line and eccentricity, and the application of basic inequalities.

So the question becomes counting the number of such groupings, and we count using the pattern of grouping, as follows:begin{tabular}{|c|l|}hline Pattern & hline 6 & 1 hline 5-1 & C_{1}^{6}=6 hline 4-2 & C_{4}^{6}=15 hline 4-1-1 & C_{4}^{6}=15 hline 3-3 & C_{3}^{6} div 2=10 hline 3-2-1 & C_{3}^{6} times C_{2}^{3}=60 hline 3-1-1-1 & C_{3}^{6}=20 hline 2-2-2 & C_{2}^{6} times C_{2}^{4} div 3!=15 hline 2-2-1-1 & C_{2}^{6} times C_{2}^{4} div 2=45 hline 2-1-1-1-1 & C_{2}^{6}=15 hline 1-1-1-1-1-1 & 1 hlineend{tabular}Hence the answer is 1+6+15+15+10+60+20+15+45+15+1=203.Remark.

As a result of all three transfers, the number of matches in all piles became the same, i.e., 48: 3 = 16 matches in each pile.

Therefore, before the third transfer, there were 16: 2 = 8 matches in the first pile. In the third pile, from which 8 matches were taken, there were 16 + 8 = 24 matches before the third transfer. Thus, before the third transfer, the distribution of matches in the piles was as follows: the first pile - 8 matches, the second pile - 16 matches, the third pile - 24 matches. During the second transfer, the number of matches in the third pile was doubled by adding as many matches as it already had. Therefore, before the second transfer, there were 24: 2 = 12 matches in the third pile. In the second pile, from which 12 matches were taken, there were 16 + 12 = 28 matches before the second transfer. Thus, before the second transfer, the distribution of matches in the piles was as follows: the first pile - 8 matches, the second pile - 28 matches, the third pile - 12 matches. During the first transfer, the number of matches in the second pile was doubled by adding as many matches as it already had. Therefore, before the first transfer, there were 28: 2 = 14 matches in the second pile. In the first pile, from which 14 matches were taken, there were 8 + 14 = 22 matches before the first transfer.

When I first encountered the previous problem, it immediately struck me that C essentially does nothing, playing the role of a kind of \\"free accessory.\\" Indeed, when B spoke, the falsity of his statement could have been established without C's involvement (see the solution to the previous problem). The following version of the problem allows us to get rid of the \\"excess\\" in the conditions.Suppose the stranger asked A a different question: \\"How many knights are there among you?\\" And to this question, A answered inaudibly. So the stranger had to ask B: \\"What did A say?\\" B replied: \\"A said that there is one knight among us.\\" And then C shouted: \\"Don't believe B! He is lying!\\"Who among B and C is the knight and who is the liar?","solution":"27. The answer in this problem is the same as in the previous one, but the reasoning is somewhat different.First of all, note that B and C cannot both be knights or both be liars, since B contradicts C. Therefore, B and C cannot both be knights or both be liars: one of them is a knight, and the other is a liar. If A were a knight, there would be two knights in total. Therefore, A did not lie and said that among the three individuals, there is only one knight. On the other hand, if A were a liar, the statement that among the three islanders A, B, and C, there is only one knight, would be true. But then A, being a liar, could not have made this true statement. Therefore, A could not have answered the stranger's question: \\"Among us, there is one knight.\\" Consequently, B incorrectly reported A's statement, from which we conclude that B is a liar, and C is a knight."},{"problem":"Exercise 4. Find all pairs of non-zero natural numbers (x, n) such that3 cdot 2^{mathrm{x}}+4=mathrm{n}^{2}","solution":"Solution to Exercise 4 For x=0, the equation becomes n^{2}=7 which has no solution. Suppose x>0, we factorize: 3 cdot 2^{x}=(n-2)(n+2). The left-hand side is even, so the right-hand side is even. The two factors on the right-hand side are of the same parity, so they are both even, and we have two cases:- Case 1: 3 cdot 2^{mathrm{a}}=mathrm{n}-2 and 2^{mathrm{b}}=mathrm{n}+2, with mathrm{a}+mathrm{b}=mathrm{x}. We can combine these two equations to get 2^{b}=3 cdot 2^{a}+4. Note that n+2 and n-2 have a difference of 4, so they cannot both be divisible by 8. Therefore, we have a leqslant 2 or b leqslant 2. Since 2^{b}>4, we have b>2 and we deduce that a leqslant 2. If a=0,2^{b}=3+4=7 which is not possible. If a=1,2^{b}=6+4=10 which is not possible either. If a=2, then 2^{b}=12+4=16 so b=4. We get x=6 and mathrm{n}=14. Conversely, we verify that 3 cdot 2^{6}+4=196=14^{2} and the pair (6,14) is indeed a solution.- Case 2: 3 cdot 2^{mathrm{a}}=mathrm{n}+2 and 2^{mathrm{b}}=mathrm{n}-2, with mathrm{a}+mathrm{b}=mathrm{x}. The two equations combined give overline{2^{mathrm{b}}+4}=3 cdot 2^{mathrm{a}}. Similarly, we have mathrm{a} leqslant 2 or mathrm{b} leqslant 2.1. If b leqslant 2, then b=0,1 or 2. If b=0, then 5=3 cdot 2^{a} which is not possible. If b=1, 6=3 cdot 2^{mathrm{a}} and mathrm{a}=1, so mathrm{x}=2 and mathrm{n}=4 and we verify that 3 cdot 2^{2}+4=16=4^{2} and (2,4) is indeed a solution. If mathrm{b}=2, then 8=3 cdot 2^{mathrm{a}} which is not possible.2. If a leqslant 2, then a=0,1 or 2. If a=0,2^{b}+4=3<4 which is not possible. If a=1, we fall back to the case where b=1 and the pair (2,4). If a=2,2^{b}+4=12 so b=3. This gives x=5 and mathrm{n}=10. Conversely, we verify that 3 cdot 2^{5}+4=100=10^{2} and (5,10) is indeed a solution.Thus, the set of pairs (boldsymbol{x}, mathfrak{n}) that are solutions is {(2,4),(5,10),(6,14)}Graders' Comment: The exercise is generally well solved, but many students forget some cases, or simply forget to verify the solutions found, which is crucial in a Diophantine equation."},{"problem":"Given f(x) = a - frac{2}{3^x + 1} where a in mathbb{R}:(1) Prove that f(x) is an increasing function on mathbb{R}.(2) Determine if there exists a real number a such that f(x) is an odd function. If it exists, find the value of a; if not, explain the reason.","solution":"(1) Let's prove f(x) is an increasing function:For all x in mathbb{R}, the denominator 3^x + 1 is always positive, therefore f(x) is well-defined over mathbb{R}.Consider two arbitrary numbers x_1 and x_2 from mathbb{R} with x_1 < x_2. The change in the function's value from x_1 to x_2 is:f(x_{1}) - f(x_{2}) = frac{2}{3^{x_2} + 1} - frac{2}{3^{x_1} + 1} = frac{2(3^{x_1} - 3^{x_2})}{(3^{x_1} + 1)(3^{x_2} + 1)}.Since y = 3^x is an increasing function on mathbb{R} and given x_1 < x_2, we have 3^{x_1} < 3^{x_2}. Thus, the numerator 2(3^{x_1} - 3^{x_2}) is negative and the denominator (3^{x_1} + 1)(3^{x_2} + 1) is positive, resulting in the fact that f(x_{1}) - f(x_{2}) < 0 which implies f(x_{1}) < f(x_{2}). Thus, f(x) is indeed an increasing function on mathbb{R}.(2) To address the second part, if f(x) is to be an odd function over mathbb{R}, it must satisfy the condition f(0) = 0. Thus, we set f(0) = a - frac{2}{3^0 + 1} = a - frac{2}{2} = 0, which implies that a=1. Now let's prove that with a=1, the function f(x) = 1 - frac{2}{3^{x} + 1} is odd. For any x in mathbb{R},f(-x) = 1 - frac{2}{3^{-x} + 1} = 1 - frac{2 cdot 3^x}{1 + 3^x} = 1 - frac{2(3^x + 1) - 2}{1 + 3^x} = -1 + frac{2}{1 + 3^x} = -(1 - frac{2}{1 + 3^x}) = -f(x).Therefore, f(x) is an odd function on mathbb{R}.Thus, there exists a real number a = boxed{1} such that f(x) is an odd function on mathbb{R}."},{"problem":"3.

Determine all pairs ((m, n)) of strictly positive integers such that:125 times 2^{n} - 3^{m} = 271","solution":"## Solution to Exercise 8Since 125 is a cube, it would be good to prove that n and m are multiples of 3 to be able to factor the left side of the equation. For this purpose, we look at the equation modulo a prime number congruent to 1 modulo 3.For example, let's look modulo 7. The powers of 3 modulo 7 are 1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1 and those of 2 are 1, 2, 4, 1. Since 271 equiv 5 pmod{7} and 125 equiv -1, the only possibilities are to have the power of 2 equal to 1 and the power of 3 equal to 1, or the power of 2 equal to 4 and the power of 3 equal to 5. Thus, we have n equiv 0 pmod{3} and m equiv 0 pmod{6} or n equiv 2 pmod{3} and m equiv 5 pmod{6}. If we can exclude the second possibility, then m and n are divisible by 3. Note that we must have n geq 2 because 250 < 271. Looking modulo 4, we have 3^m equiv 1, so m is even, and we cannot have m equiv 5 pmod{6}. The second possibility is therefore excluded, and the integers m and n are divisible by 3.We set m = 3k and n = 3ell. The equation becomes271 = left(5 times 2^kright)^3 - left(3^ellright)^3 = left(5 times 2^k - 3^ellright)left(25 times 2^{2k} + 5 times 2^{k+1} times 3^ell + 3^{2ell}right)Since 271 is prime and left(25 times 2^{2k} + 5 times 2^{k+1} times 3^ell + 3^{2ell}right) is positive and strictly greater than left(5 times 2^k - 3^ellright), we have 5 times 2^k - 3^ell = 1. If k geq 3, then 3^ell equiv -1 pmod{8}, which is not possible because 3^ell is 1 or 3 modulo 8. Therefore, we have k = 0, 1, 2. For k = 0, we get 3^ell = 4, which is impossible. For k = 2, we get 3^ell = 19, which is also impossible. For k = 1, we get 3^ell = 9, so ell = 2, and thus (n, m) = (3, 6).Conversely, 125 times 2^3 - 3^6 = 1000 - 729 = 271, so (3, 6) is indeed a solution.The only solution to the equation is therefore the pair (3, 6).## Alternative Solution 1By looking at the equation modulo 5, we find that -3^m equiv 1 pmod{5}, so 3^m equiv -1 pmod{5}. The order of 3 modulo 5 is 4, and the powers alternate between 1, 3, -1, -2. We deduce that m equiv 2 pmod{4}.Suppose that n geq 4. Then, looking at the equation modulo 16, we have -3^m equiv 271 equiv -1 pmod{16}, so 3^m equiv 1 pmod{16}. The order of 3 modulo 16 is 4, since 3^0 equiv 1, 3^1 equiv 3, 3^2 equiv 9, 3^3 equiv 11, and 3^4 equiv 1 pmod{16}. Therefore, we must have m equiv 0 pmod{4}, which contradicts the previous assumption.Thus, we have n < 4.- If n = 3, the equation is equivalent to 729 = 3^m. Since 729 = 3^6, the equation gives m = 6. We find that the pair (6, 3) is a solution.- If n = 2, we get 3^m = 229, which is not divisible by 3, a contradiction.- If n = 1, 3^m = 250 - 271 < 0, which is impossible.Thus, the unique solution is (m, n) = (6, 3).Comment from the graders: The exercise was not widely attempted, but the submitted solutions were mostly excellent. However, be careful to be rigorous in your justifications. Some students obtain that the product of two factors is 271, which is prime, and directly deduce that the first factor is 271 and the second factor is 1: to obtain this, it is necessary to justify that both terms are positive and that the first is greater than the second."},{"problem":"Given the random variable X sim B(8, frac{3}{4}), determine D(X)= _______.","solution":"The problem asks us to find the variance (D(X)) of a binomial distribution with parameters n=8 and p=frac{3}{4}.

If the former, then A cap B subseteq C, A cup B subseteq C; if the latter, then A cap B supseteq C, A cup B supseteq C.Thus, after the operation, the number of other containment pairs does not decrease, so the number of containment pairs increases by at least 1 after each operation.Since this number can be at most mathrm{C}_{n}^{2}=frac{n(n-1)}{2} and at least 0, the number of operations is at most frac{n(n-1)}{2}.Next, provide an example where the number of operations is frac{n(n-1)}{2}.Define the setsA_{i}={i, i+1, cdots, i+n-2}(i=1,2, cdots, n).Next, prove that starting from A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{n}, frac{n(n-1)}{2} operations can be performed.Use mathematical induction.When n=2,A_{1}={1}, A_{2}={2} text {, }1 operation can be performed, which is frac{2(2-1)}{2}=1.If the conclusion holds for n, consider the case for n+1.Perform one operation on A_{1}={1,2, cdots, n} and A_{2}={2,3, cdots, n+1}, obtaining the intersection {2,3, cdots, n} and leaving it, and the union continues to operate with A_{3}={3,4, cdots, n+2}, obtaining the intersection {3,4, cdots, n+1} and leaving it, and the union continues to operate with A_{4}, and so on.After n operations, the union of all original sets {1,2, cdots, 2 n} and another n setsbegin{array}{l}{2,3, cdots, n},{3,4, cdots, n+1}, cdots, {n+1, n+2, cdots, 2 n-1} .end{array}are obtained.Finally, consider only the operations among the last n sets.Since reducing all elements by 1 does not change the relationships between sets, consider the setsbegin{array}{l}{1,2, cdots, n-1},{2,3, cdots, n}, cdots, {n, n+1, cdots, 2 n-2} .end{array}By the induction hypothesis, these sets can be operated on mathrm{C}_{n}^{2}=frac{n(n-1)}{2} times, so the original n+1 sets can be operated onfrac{n(n-1)}{2}+n=frac{n(n+1)}{2}=mathrm{C}_{n+1}^{2},times, meaning the conclusion holds for n+1.In summary, the maximum possible number of operations ismathrm{C}_{n}^{2}=frac{n(n-1)}{2} ."},{"problem":"The triangle K_2 has as its vertices the feet of the altitudes of a non-right triangle K_1.

The orthic triangle ( K_2 ) is formed by the feet of the altitudes of ( K_1 ).1.

Verify the solution:   - If ( A = 60^circ ), ( B = 60^circ ), and ( C = 60^circ ), then triangle ( K_1 ) is an equilateral triangle.   - The orthic triangle of an equilateral triangle is also an equilateral triangle, hence ( K_1 ) and ( K_2 ) are similar.5.

For i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, let p i (n) = prob that the final score is n+i if the player stops when his total score is at least n. We note that p(n) is also the probability that the player's total equals n on some throw if he throws repeatedly. Now we can see that p 5 (n) = 1/6 p(n-1), because the only way to achieve a final score of n+5 without passing through n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4 is to reach n-1 and then throw a 6. Similarly, p 4 (n) = 1/6 p(n-1) + 1/6 p(n-2), because to reach n+4 without passing through n, n+1, n+2, n+3 you must either to through n-1, which requires reaching n-1 and then throwing a 5, or not, in which case you must reach n-2 and then throw a 6. Similarly, p 3 (n) = 1/6 p(n-1) + 1/6 p(n-2) + 1/6 p(n-3), p 2 = 1/6 p(n-1) + 1/6 p(n-2) + 1/6 p(n-3) + 1/6 p(n-4), and p 1 (n) = 1/6 p(n-1) + 1/6 p(n-2) + 1/6 p(n-3) + 1/6 p(n-4) + 1/6 p(n-5). Adding, we get: 1 = p(n) + p 1 (n) + p 2 (n) + p 3 (n) + p 4 (n) + p 5 (n) = p(n) + 5/6 p(n-1) + 4/6 p(n-2) + 3/6 p(n-3) + 2/6 p(n-4) + 1/6 p(n-5). In the limit, p(n-5) = p(n-4) = ... = p(n). Hence we get: p 1 (n) = 5/6 p(n), p 2 (n) = 4/6 p(n), p 3 (n) = 3/6 p(n), p 4 (n) = 2/6 p(n), p 5 (n) = 1/6 p(n). But they sum to 1, so p(n) = 2/7. The objection to the above is that it fails to establish that lim p(n) exists. So one should arguably add the following. We have (as above) p(n) = 1/6 p(n-1) + 1/6 p(n-2) + 1/6 p(n-3) + 1/6 p(n-4) + 1/6 p(n-5) + 1/6 p(n-6) (*). Let m(n) = min{ p(n-1), p(n-2), p(n-3), p(n-4), p(n-5), p(n-6) }. Then (*) establishes that p(n) ≥ m(n), and so m(n+1) ≥ m(n). Similarly, let M(n) = max{ p(n-1), p(n-2), p(n-3), p(n-4), p(n-5), p(n-6) }. Then (*) shows that p(n) ≤ M(n), so M(n+1) ≤ M(n). Thus m(n) is a monotonic increasing sequence and M(n) is a monotonic decreasing sequence. But m(n) is obviously bounded above by any M(m), and M(n) is bounded below by any m(m). So both sequences converge. Suppose they converged to different limits. So m(n) converges to m and M(n) converges to M with M - m > 36k > 0. Take n sufficiently large that m(n) > m - 6k. At least one of the terms on the rhs of (*) must equal M(n) and the others are at least m(n), so p(n) ≥ 5/6 m(n) + 1/6 M(n) > 5/6 (m - 6k) + 1/6 M > 5/6 m - 5k + 1/6 (m + 36k) = m+ k. But that means that m(n) > m+k for all sufficiently large n. Contradiction. Hence M and m are the same and p(n) must have the same limit. 21st Putnam 1960 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 15 Feb 2002"},{"problem":"10.

The number of periods of ( 2pi ) within this range is given by:   [   frac{200}{2pi} = frac{100}{pi}   ]9. Since each period contains 2 intersections, the total number of intersections is:   [   2 times frac{100}{pi}   ]10. Using the approximation (pi approx 3.14), we get:    [    frac{100}{pi} approx frac{100}{3.14} approx 31.85    ]11. Since we are looking for the number of intersections, we round ( 31.85 ) to the nearest whole number, which is 32.12. Therefore, the total number of intersections is:    [    2 times 32 = 64    ]13. However, we must consider the intersection at ( x = 0 ) which is counted twice (once for positive and once for negative x-values).

Find the set A:   - We start by solving the inequality for set A: x(x-1)leqslant 0.   - This can be factored and understood as (x)(x-1) leqslant 0.   - The product of two terms is non-positive when one of the terms is non-positive and the other is non-negative, or both are zero.   - The roots of the quadratic equation are x=0 and x=1.   - By testing values or using the number line method, we find that the inequality holds for 0 leqslant x leqslant 1.   - Therefore, A=[0,1].2. Find the set B:   - The set B is defined by the inequality ln x leqslant a.   - Solving for x, we exponentiate both sides to get x leqslant e^{a}.   - This means that set B consists of all x such that x is in the interval (0, e^{a}].3.

Find the least nin Z_+, for which every set of n perfect squares not divisible by p contains nonempty subset with product of all it's elements equal to 1 (text{mod} p)","solution":"1. Base Case for ( p = 3 ):   - For ( p = 3 ), the conclusion is straightforward. We can take a one-element subset since any perfect square modulo 3 is either 0 or 1. Since we are considering perfect squares not divisible by ( p ), the only possible residue is 1. Thus, any single perfect square will satisfy the condition.2. General Case for ( p > 3 ):   - We need to find the smallest ( n ) such that any set of ( n ) perfect squares not divisible by ( p ) contains a nonempty subset whose product is congruent to 1 modulo ( p ).3. Inductive Step:   - Suppose we can find the required subset for any ( n ) perfect squares. Then, we can also find it for ( n+1 ) perfect squares. Conversely, if it is impossible for ( n ) perfect squares, it will also be impossible for ( n-1 ) perfect squares. Therefore, it suffices to show that for a certain set of ( frac{p-1}{2} - 1 ) perfect squares, the choice is impossible, but for any set of ( frac{p-1}{2} ) perfect squares, the choice exists.4. Proof for ( frac{p-1}{2} - 1 ) Perfect Squares:   - Consider the set of ( frac{p-1}{2} - 1 ) perfect squares, all being ( 2^2 ). Since ( p mid 2^{p-1} - 1 ) (by Fermat's Little Theorem), we cannot have ( p mid 2^{p-3} - 1 ) because it would imply ( p mid 3 ), which is a contradiction for ( p > 3 ). Hence, ( 2^{2 cdot left(frac{p-1}{2} - 1right)} ) is not divisible by ( p ).5. Proof for ( frac{p-1}{2} ) Perfect Squares:   - Consider the set ( { x_1^2, x_2^2, ldots, x_n^2 } ) where ( x_i in mathbb{Z} ) and ( n = frac{p-1}{2} ). Assume, for contradiction, that it is impossible to find the required subset. The numbers ( x_1^2, (x_1 x_2)^2, ldots, (x_1 x_2 cdot ldots cdot x_n)^2 ) do not give residues 0 or 1 modulo ( p ) (by the problem's assumption and our contrary assumption).6. Application of the Pigeonhole Principle:   - For ( p > 2 ), there are ( frac{p-1}{2} - 1 ) quadratic residues modulo ( p ) different from 0 and 1. By the pigeonhole principle, there exist ( k, l in mathbb{Z} ) with ( 1 le k < l le n ) such that ( p mid (x_1 cdots x_k)^2 - (x_1 cdots x_l)^2 = (x_1 cdots x_l)^2 ((x_{l+1} cdots x_k)^2 - 1) ). Since the numbers ( x_i ) are not divisible by ( p ), it follows that ( p mid (x_{l+1} cdots x_k)^2 - 1 ), which contradicts our contrary assumption.Therefore, the least ( n ) for which every set of ( n ) perfect squares not divisible by ( p ) contains a nonempty subset with a product equal to 1 modulo ( p ) is ( frac{p-1}{2} ).The final answer is ( boxed{frac{p-1}{2}} )."},{"problem":"53.

Clear the Denominators:   By multiplying each term by the least common denominator, x(x-1), we aim to clear the denominators:   [   2x-(x+2)=0   ]   This step simplifies the equation by eliminating the fractions.3. Simplify the Equation:   We then simplify the equation by distributing and combining like terms:   [   2x-x-2=0   ]   This simplification is achieved by subtracting (x+2) from 2x.4.

This is clearly identical to the circumsphere of the cube, so the half-space diagonal of the cube is equal to the circumsphere radius: (R=frac{sqrt{3}}{2} a).The insphere with radius (r) touches the tetrahedron faces from the inside, where each tetrahedron face spans a tangent plane to the insphere at the point of contact.

Since s_{1}, s_{2}, ldots, s_{k-1} can each be expressed as a linear combination of u_{1}, u_{2}, v_{1}, v_{2}, the expressions for s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{3}, s_{4} yield a system of linear equations in four unknowns u_{1}, u_{2}, v_{1}, v_{2}.

Therefore, we have a=0 or b=c-1. Similarly, we have b=0 or c=a-1 and c=0 or a=b-1.Suppose that a=0. The third equation becomes c^{2}=b^{2}, or b= pm c. If b=c, then 0=b+c=2 b=2 c so a=b=c=0. Conversely, the triplet (0,0,0) satisfies the three equations. If b=-c, the first equation gives c^{2}=-c, or 0=c^{2}+c=c(c+1). If c=0, then b=-a-c=0 and we have found the triplet (0,0,0) again. If c+1=0, then c=-1=-b. Conversely, the triplet (0,1,-1) satisfies the equations.We treat the case where b=0 in the same way, which gives the two triplets (0,0,0) and (-1,0,1), which we verify are indeed solutions to the problem, as well as the case where c=0, which gives the two triplets (0,0,0) and (1,-1,0), which we verify are indeed solutions to the problem.Now suppose that none of the real numbers a, b, or c is zero. Then we have c=b+1, b=a+1 and a=c+1. But then a=c+1=b+2=a+3, which is absurd.The only triplet solutions are therefore {(0,0,0),(0,1,-1),(-1,0,1),(1,-1,0)}.Comment from the graders: This problem was difficult and very few students solved it entirely. However, many managed to make progress and provide very relevant leads, which naturally earned points for their authors.- The concept of square root is often misused. Some students use that sqrt{x+y}=sqrt{x}+sqrt{y}, which is false, especially when some quantities could be negative. For example, a=b^{2}-c^{2} does not imply that sqrt{a}=b-c.- Students often found (0,0,0) as a solution. But rarely did they see that (1,0,-1), for example, was a solution. Finding (0,0,0) as a solution should have encouraged them to look at b=0 to find other solutions: to get points for finding solutions, one must often find them all.- Often students factored certain expressions and ended up, for example, with (c-b)(c+b)=c+b. Some simplified without hesitation to get c-b=1, but they should not forget the case where b+c=0.- A good number of students managed to prove that a+b+c=0. But often, the reasoning abruptly stops by saying that necessarily (a, b, c)=(0,0,0). One must be rigorous and honest: hastily concluding that (a, b, c)=(0,0,0) prevents a complete proof and the development of relevant ideas to move forward.- Solutions found must always be verified.

Understanding ( a(k) ):   - For any positive integer ( k ), ( a(k) ) is the exponent of the highest power of 2 that divides ( k ).

Each such rectangle is obtained by selecting ( k ) consecutive verticals and ( l ) consecutive horizontals (Fig. 61). A group of ( k ) consecutive verticals can be chosen in ( 8-k+1=9-k ) different ways (the first vertical of the group can be the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ..., ((8-k+1))-th vertical of the board); similarly, ( l ) consecutive horizontals can be chosen in ( 8-l+1=9-l ) ways. Therefore, a rectangle of width ( k ) and height ( l ) can be chosen in [(9-k)(9-l)]different ways, i.e., there are ((9-k)(9-l)) such rectangles on the board.Now let's count how many different rectangles of a given width ( k ) exist on the chessboard. The height ( l ) of the rectangle can vary from 1 to 8; therefore, the number of such rectangles is[begin{aligned}& (9-k)(9-1) + (9-k)(9-2) + ldots + (9-k)(9-8) = & quad = (9-k)(8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1) = 36(9-k)end{aligned}]Considering now that the width ( k ) of the rectangle can also vary from 1 to 8, we find that the total number of different rectangles is[begin{aligned}& 36(9-1) + 36(9-2) + ldots + 36(9-8) = & quad = 36(8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1) = 36 cdot 36 = 1296end{aligned}]b) Analogously to the solution of part a), we conclude that the number of all possible rectangles of width ( k ) and height ( l ) on an ( n^2 )-cell board is ((n+1-k)(n+1-l)).

The slope of the line y=x-4 is 1. We'll find the derivative of the curve y=x^2-ln x to determine the slope of its tangent at any point. The derivative of y with respect to x is given by: y' = frac{dy}{dx} = 2x - frac{1}{x} We set this equal to 1, the slope of the line y=x-4, to find the points of tangency where the slopes are equal: 2x - frac{1}{x} = 1 Multiplying through by x to clear the fraction, we have: 2x^2 - 1 = x Rearranging, we get a quadratic equation: 2x^2 - x - 1 = 0 which can be solved by factoring or using the quadratic formula.In factoring, we look for two numbers that multiply to -2 and add to -1, however, this is not factorable in this case, so we resort to the quadratic formula: x = frac{-(-1) pm sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(2)(-1)}}{2(2)}  x = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 + 8}}{4}  x = frac{1 pm 3}{4} Therefore, we have two solutions: x = 1 or x = -frac{1}{2}.We discard the negative solution since the natural logarithm is undefined for non-positive values of x.Thus, the x-coordinate of the tangency point is x = 1. Now we need to find the corresponding y-coordinate by plugging it into the equation of the curve: y = 1^2 - ln 1 = 1 - 0 = 1 Therefore, the tangency point is (1,1). To find the distance d from this point to the line y=x-4, we use the formula for the distance from a point (x_0,y_0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0: d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} For the line y=x-4, we can rewrite it as -x + y + 4 = 0. Using (1,1) for (x_0,y_0), we have: d = frac{|-1 + 1 + 4|}{sqrt{(-1)^2 + 1^2}}  d = frac{4}{sqrt{2}}  d = 2sqrt{2} boxed{d = 2sqrt{2}}"},{"problem":"5. Let p be a prime number. How many colors are needed at minimum to place tokens on a square p times p board, each token being colored with one of these colors, so that each field of the board has exactly one token and there are no two tokens of the same color that attack each other? Two tokens attack each other if they are on the same row, column, or if the line connecting them is parallel to one of the diagonals of the square.","solution":"Solution. It is not hard to check that for p=2 the solution is 4, and for p=3, the solution is 5. Let p>3. To each cell of the board, we will assign coordinates (i, j), which means that the cell is in the i-th row, counting rows from top to bottom, and in the j-th column, counting columns from left to right. The cells with coordinates (i, i) will be said to form the main diagonal of the board, and the other diagonal will be called the secondary diagonal. On each of the cells (i, i) of the main diagonal, we will place tokens of p different colors numbered 0,1,2, ldots, p-1 - the possible remainders upon division by p. Then, in each row, we fill in the cells cyclically, placing in each next cell a number that is 2 greater than the number in the previous cell. In this way, after p-2 come 0,2,4, ldots, and after p-1 come 1,3, ldots.Thus, in the cell with coordinates (i, j), we place a token whose color is marked by the number which is the remainder upon division of the number i+2(j-i)=2j-i by the number p. Since p is a prime number greater than 3, it is odd, so it is clear that in each row, p colors will be represented, meaning that tokens of the same color will not be present.If in column j two tokens of the same color are encountered, for example in rows m and n (m>n), then the numbers 2j-m and 2j-n give the same remainder upon division by p, so their difference will be divisible by p. It follows that m-n is divisible by p, which is not possible since m and n are less than p. Therefore, in no column can two tokens of the same color be encountered.From the placement of the tokens, it is obvious that in diagonals parallel to the main diagonal, it is not possible for two tokens of the same color to be present.If two cells are on the secondary diagonal or on a diagonal parallel to the secondary diagonal, then the sums of their coordinates are mutually equal. Assuming that on the cells with coordinates (m, k-m) and (n, k-n) there are tokens of the same color, it follows that the numbers 2(k-m)-m and 2(k-n)-n give the same remainder upon division by p. This means that 2k-3m and 2k-3n give the same remainder upon division by p, from which it follows that 3(m-n) is divisible by p. However, p is coprime with both 3 and m-n, so it is not possible for 3(m-n) to be divisible by p.Finally, it follows that if p>3, then there is an arrangement of tokens of p colors that satisfies the condition of the problem, so p is the smallest number of colors."},{"problem":"8.

In approximate calculations, the sizes of the berries can be considered the same and much smaller than the size of the bucket. If the berries are laid out in one layer, then in the densest packing, each berry will have 6 neighbors: the centers of the berries will be at the vertices of equilateral triangles with sides equal to the diameter of the berries. When pouring the next layer, the berries will be located in the depressions between the berries of the previous layer. In such a packing, each berry will have 12 neighbors, and the centers of the berries will be at the vertices of regular tetrahedrons.To calculate the fraction of the volume occupied by the berries, one can mentally \\"cut out\\" a parallelepiped from the lattice formed by the centers of the berries with edges of length 2 N R, where R is the radius of the berries, and N is the number of berries that fit along one side, and in two opposite vertices of the edge, they meet at an angle of 60^{circ}. The volume of such a parallelepiped is 4 sqrt{2} N^{3} R^{3}, and it contains approximately N^{3} berries, each with a volume of frac{4}{3} pi R^{3} (berries near the walls are not fully placed, but their number is of the order of N^{2}, so this can be neglected for large N). Therefore, the ratio of the volume of the berries to the volume of the bucket is approximately frac{pi sqrt{2}}{6} approx 0.74, so in a 10-liter bucket, with the densest packing, there are about 7.4 kg of berries. In reality, there are somewhat fewer due to the lack of density.The ratio of the volume of the berries to the volume of the container can also be calculated differently. For example, consider a rectangular parallelepiped in which the berries are laid out in layers, the distance between which is equal to the height of the tetrahedron mentioned above frac{2 sqrt{2} R}{sqrt{3}}. In each layer, the distance between rows is equal to the height of the equilateral triangle R sqrt{3}.

We'll determine when the function is increasing or decreasing, and thus, identify its local extrema.We begin by finding the derivative of f(x): f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 6x^2 + m) = -3x^2 + 12x.To identify the critical points where the function could reach a local minimum or maximum, we set f'(x) equal to zero and solve for x: -3x^2 + 12x = 0.Factoring out 3x, we get: 3x(-x + 4) = 0.Setting each factor to zero gives us two points: x = 0 quad text{and} quad x = 4.To determine the intervals where the function is increasing or decreasing, we analyze the sign of f'(x) around the critical points. From our factoring, we can see that the sign of f'(x) changes at x = 0 and x = 4.- For x in (-infty, 0), f'(x) is negative, implying that f(x) is decreasing.- For x in (0, 4), f'(x) is positive, meaning that f(x) is increasing.- For x in (4, +infty), f'(x) is again negative, indicating that f(x) is decreasing.We know the local minimum can't be at x = 4 because f(x) decreases thereafter. Thus, f(x) reaches a local minimum at x = 0 or as x to +infty. Since the problem specifies that the minimum value is 23, we evaluate f(x) at x = 0: f(0) = -(0)^3 + 6 cdot (0)^2 + m = m.

If three vertices of the prism lie on the circumference of the base of the cone, this means that the three vertices of the prism are equidistant from point T, i.e., three of the segments T A, T B, T C, T A_{1}, T B_{1}, T C_{1} are equal to each other. Note that T A_{1}=T C_{1}>T A=T C; moreover, T A>T B, T A_{1}>T B_{1}. From these inequalities, it follows that the segments T A_{1} and T C_{1} are the longest, and the segment T B is the shortest. Therefore, the segments T A, T C, and T B_{1} are equal to each other.a) Let T B_{1}=3 x, T B=2 x. Then T A=3 x. By the Pythagorean theorem for triangle A B T, we find that A B=x sqrt{5}.

The radius of the base of the cone is the radius of the circle circumscribed around triangle A B_{1} C. Its sides are: A B_{1}=C B_{1}=x sqrt{30}, A C=x sqrt{5}.

So if he reads 6 books per week, it would take 60: 6=10 weeks, which means Vasya would have completed the entire list 12-10=2 weeks before the end of the vacation.## AnswerTwo weeks.Submit a comment"},{"problem":"Given that the solution set of the inequality (2a-b)x+(a+b) > 0 with respect to x is {xmid x > -3}, find the value of frac{b}{a}.","solution":"We are given that the solution set of the inequality (2a-b)x+(a+b) > 0 with respect to x is {xmid x > -3}.

Identify the Pattern in Denominators: The denominators are consecutive odd numbers starting from 1. This means for the nth term, the denominator is the nth odd number, which can be represented as 2n - 1. 2. Identify the Pattern in Numerators: The numerators start from 1 and increase by 1 every two numbers. This means the numerator for the nth term can be represented as lceil frac{n}{2} rceil, where lceil cdot rceil denotes the ceiling function, which rounds a number up to the nearest integer. However, since we are dealing with a sequence that increases in a pattern without fractions in the numerator, we can simplify this to frac{n+1}{2} for our sequence, where n is odd for positive terms and even for negative terms.3. Determine the Sign of the 2023rd Term: Since positive numbers are in odd positions and negative numbers are in even positions, and 2023 is odd, the 2023rd term is positive.4. Calculate the Denominator for the 2023rd Term: Using the pattern identified in step 1, the denominator is 2 times 2023 - 1 = 4045.5. Calculate the Numerator for the 2023rd Term: Using the simplified pattern from step 2, since we need the numerator for the sequence and 2023 is an odd term (thus positive), the numerator is frac{2023 + 1}{2} = frac{2024}{2} = 1012.Combining these findings, the 2023rd number in the sequence is positive, with a numerator of 1012 and a denominator of 4045.

The given function is f(x) = x^3 + ln(x + sqrt{x^2 + 1}).2. Since f(-x) + f(x) = -x^3 + ln(-x + sqrt{x^2 + 1}) + x^3 + ln(x + sqrt{x^2 + 1}) = 0, the function f(x) is an odd function defined on mathbb{R}.3.

The foci of the hyperbola, denoted as F_1 and F_2, are positioned such that the line x=2a intersects the hyperbola at points A and B. 1. Finding Points A and B:   - The equation of the line is x=2a. Substituting this into the equation of the hyperbola gives frac{(2a)^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, which simplifies to 4 - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1. Solving for y yields y = pm sqrt{3}b. Therefore, the coordinates of A and B are (2a, pm sqrt{3}b).2. Finding the Centroid of triangle ABD:   - The centroid of a triangle is found by averaging the x and y coordinates of its vertices. For triangle ABD, the vertices are (2a, sqrt{3}b), (2a, -sqrt{3}b), and (0, b) or (0, -b). Averaging the x-coordinates gives frac{2a + 2a + 0}{3} = frac{4a}{3}, and averaging the y-coordinates gives frac{sqrt{3}b - sqrt{3}b + b}{3} = pm frac{b}{3}. Thus, the centroid is (frac{4a}{3}, pm frac{b}{3}).3. Equation of the Circle with Diameter F_1F_2:   - The equation of a circle with diameter F_1F_2 is x^2 + y^2 = c^2, where c is the distance between F_1 and F_2, which is also the length of the major axis of the hyperbola. For a hyperbola, c^2 = a^2 + b^2.4. Finding the Relationship between a and b:   - Since the centroid lies on the circle, substituting its coordinates into the circle's equation yields left(frac{4a}{3}right)^2 + left(pm frac{b}{3}right)^2 = a^2 + b^2. Simplifying gives frac{16}{9}a^2 + frac{1}{9}b^2 = a^2 + b^2. Rearranging and solving for frac{b}{a} yields frac{b}{a} = frac{sqrt{14}}{4}.5. Determining the Equation of the Asymptote:   - The equation of the asymptotes for a hyperbola frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 is given by y = pm frac{b}{a}x. Substituting frac{b}{a} = frac{sqrt{14}}{4} into this equation gives the asymptotes as y = pm frac{sqrt{14}}{4}x.Therefore, the equation of the asymptote of C is y = pm frac{sqrt{14}}{4}x, which corresponds to choice boxed{text{D}}."},{"problem":"A sheet of a notebook was colored in 23 colors by cells.

Procedure Analysis:   - We choose 2 scripts randomly and analyze the possible outcomes:     - Both scripts have odd scores:       - We add one mark to one of them, making it even.       - We put the script with the new even score back in the box and keep the other script (with an odd score) outside.       - This decreases the number of odd scripts by (1).     - Both scripts have even scores:       - We put one script back in the box and keep the other script outside.       - The number of odd scripts remains unchanged.     - One script has an odd score and the other has an even score:       - We put the script with the odd score back in the box and keep the script with the even score outside.       - The number of odd scripts remains unchanged.3.

Final Condition:   - We are given that after following the procedure a number of times, there are (3) scripts left, with at least one script having an odd score and at least one script having an even score.   - Since the number of odd scripts must be even (as it started even and can only change by (2) or remain the same), and there is at least one odd script, the only possible even number of odd scripts among the (3) left is (2).Conclusion:The number of scripts with odd scores among the three left is (2).The final answer is (boxed{2})."},{"problem":"Let t be TNYWR.Over the winter, Oscar counted the birds in his backyard.
