Doctors suggest since she may need upto 3 stents to be put, her kidneys may get damaged as a side effect of the dye and hence need dialysis afterwards. She's too old for a bypass... what other alternatives do we have? how effective are medicines at this stage?","Doctor":"Hi,The treatment of choice for 3 blocked arteries is a bypass surgery. Alternatives are multi-vessel stenting (angioplasty) or keep her on medical therapy. Now as she is very elderly, bypass will definitely be more risky than a younger patient. Other option angioplasty is a good alternative and can be done safely if the kidneys are fine. Risk of damage to kidney post angioplasty can be prevented by proper hydration and that will also prevent need of dialysis. 3rd option, medical management is a good option for her if she does not have very frequent chest pains. Medicines these days are very effective for chronic stable angina.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

For the diagnosis, you need to do ECG at the time of palpitation & tachycardia. If the duration of palpitations are short enough to reach a nearby hospital, we put a 24hr ECG monitoring (Holter Monitor). You also need to do a 2D Echo & thyroid function test to see for any associated abnormality if any.Looking at your symptoms, you also seems to have gastritis.

The only medical history I have is an underactive thyroid.","Doctor":"Hello Thank you for your questionI see a lot of patients with complains like yours.The fact that the pain is in the left side ,movements makes it worse and a deep breath too, first step is to do a Chest X ray,hole blood count,CRP and a EKG.However pain with this features are rarely with heart origin but to be sure.Have you had a viral situation lately, with e little fever?Do you see any marks on the skin in the basal left side of your chest?Sometimes viral situations can cause pain with these characteristics as you explain.Wish you good healthDr.JolandaPulmonologist"},{"Patient":"Hello, my mum who is 42 years of age and 4ft 11, has just started suffering with chest pains. she explains it's quite hard to swallow and breathe. She looks very uncomfortable, and has now become very emotional. She suffers with lupus and arthritis. Would you have any idea why these chest pains have occured? Could it be stress? Or something more serious? thankyou. Kerry.","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for asking.In the situation of your mother that she suffer from lupus and arthritis the doctor should be very careful with the complains she has.Difficulty in swallowing might be one of the complication of the lupus diseases.For the chest pain and the difficulty in breathing it would be better to do a chest X ray,Spirometry with Dlco in order to see if the lung tissue is compromised.So i think that a reconsultation with the rheumatologist specialist should be done.Thank youDr.JolandaPulmonologist"},{"Patient":"Hi, My fiance is 23 and has never smoked but has been going out to bars and clubs every week -sometimes twice a week- for the past 7 years - most of them outside that allow smoking but some of them inside that still allow it. I wouldn't say they are overly smokey, just a few people every so often I guess. She said she stayed away from people that smoked there but I know it's still really bad and i'm worried that she has done long term damage to herself and her lungs - During the week she doesnt have any exposure, just on the weekends for a few hours a night. Can she heal back to normal after this or do we always have to worry for the future of respiratory problems?","Doctor":"Hi and thank you for asking.I understand your question.According to the several giudelines it is assummed that passive smoking is nearly like smoking itself in the medical aspect.In your case to be sure if any damage is starting in her lungs she might do a chest X Ray and a Spiromtry test.If they come negative as i believe she does not  have to do anything else further but only to stay away from the environment with dust smoke as all of us should do. I do not think that you should worry for the future as she will be without complains as she is now.Thank youdr.JolandaPulmonologist"},{"Patient":"Dear doctor, well i'm only 14yrs old and i have been noticing a deep change with my body system well last month i had a sickness because i decided to give up smoking the two months before i gotten sick... but in them two months later i have been coughing, having a running nose and ear aches. but in the next month after which is this month i had vommitted twice because i had been near smokers and that the smoke that they;ve been smoking well it's making me cough but now every time i cough my chest burns and it makes me cough badder and then it starts to hurt my liver.

In my routine work i see several patients with this concern.This kind of pain that you prescribe have several lung factors.The inflamation of pleural space may cause this.The costocondritis might be another factor.Pneumotorax (air in the pleural space) is another factor.So my opinion is that you should some tests to explore the lungs as listed:Chest X Ray p-a and right lateral viewBlood count, CRP, EKGAbdominal ultrasoundAnd then to see which is the factor that cause the painThank youDr.JolandaPulmonologist"},{"Patient":"I have quit smoking after 15 year I am at the 12 week mark.

My lungs feel very clear now but tye cough remains.","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for asking.I congratulate you for stop smoking.It is a difficult process and not everyone  succeeds.You say that you have been smoking for 15 years so your lungs are full of smoke.Exercising in fresh air help lungs to extend better and to improve the compliance of them.The secretions that you remove with the cough process means that the lungs are cleansed and may be this will go on for some time.Meanwhile you should drink a lot of water to help this.Don*t worry for the cough.If you do not have any other complain like fever difficulty in breathing ,chest pain you do not have to do anything further.The cough will go away slowly in the same way tha lungs are repairing.Thank youDr.JolandaPulmonologist"},{"Patient":"I have a pronounced line on my ear lobe running at a slant from the top of my ear lobe to the bottom of the lobe.

Patient self medicated with Paracetamol, an recalled antibiotic and Salbutamol nebulization. An hour prior to admission patient had perrsistent coughing, with expectoration of blood tinged sputum and dyspnea. This prompted admission.

Since then I haven't been smoking. During my later medical controls I was also diagnosed with low level of iron, vitamin D and a increased rate of cholesterol (and got supplements for the iron and Vitamin D). I was an underweight person, yet after quitting smoking I gained 8 kgs (around 16 pounds) in a very short period of time. I try to do exercises and lost half of the newly gained weight and have been still trying to get rid of the rest. My specific question is that I realized an interesting sensitivity to the smell of the cigarette smoke and also to some types of smell such as paint fumes. I feel a pain in my chest and in my neck and it feels like I smoked again. I thought that it was a psychosomatic reaction but not so sure. I also feel a pain in my chest (like around my heart) when I run and also wonder its cause. Do you think I should search for further illnesses?

Also, for her paralysis, possibilities might be hypokalemic or hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. So you should get her potassium levels done during the episode.

He hasn't ran a fever, but his left tonsil is at least double in size as the right one.   no other symptoms, except that 4/4/2011 was given amox for a sinus infection.  What are the chances of this being whooping cough?","Doctor":"Hello dear, Thank you for your question.Whooping cough is highly contagious, especially in the first couple of weeks after the onset of cough. Schools are among the most common places where children can get the infection from their mates. I would suspect whooping cough, if your child had had cough for at least 14 days, especially if the cough is accompanied with a suffocation sensation or vomiting. A PCR testing of a nasal swab may help the diagnosis of whooping cough.The tonsil enlargement is not typical of whooping cough, but is a possible finding.I usually treat my patients with Erythromycin or Azythromycin. Since these are prescription based drugs, you will have to consult your pediatrician. Keep in mind that the medication will only accelerate the healing and prevent complications, but cannot stop the cough, that will last for several weeks. Your kid needs to take a break from school, since it's a highly contagious disease.I hope this helped.Kind regards, Dr. Alma"},{"Patient":"Im A 20 year old male and ill get a feeling like i cant breath and then feel like im going to pass out and my body gets tinlgy but then it goes away and will come back later on i went and got tests done and my heart is fine the doctor said? what could this be?","Doctor":"Hello dear, Thank you for your question,It is common among young men to complaint about breathing problems. Your young age and the lack of history indicative for pulmonary disease suggests that you might be suffering from stress. There are some test that you can run in order to be sure and help recover from this stressful situation. Since the test performed on your heart came back normal, it is safe to say that there is nothing to worry about. I always suggest my patients to engage in physical activities, meditation, healthy diet, engage in social activities and avoid excessive intake of alcohol, cigarettes and coffee. If your problems persists you might seek help from a professional specialist that can help manage stress.I hope this helped.Kind regards, Dr. Alma"},{"Patient":"I have bronchitis, uncomfortable productive cough without fever and am scheduled for a transesophageal endoscopy. Should it wait? I am 62, weigh 152 pounds and have mitral prolapse leaking - recently in CHF. Recommended repair/replacement surgery soon.","Doctor":"Hello dear, Thank you for your question.In my opinion, the bronchitis needs to be treated with antibiotics and cough syrup. I always suggest my patients to drink plenty of water, in order to alleviate the passing of the secretions. Your doctor will examine your lungs with a stethoscope and may also request a chest X-ray. He or she will be able to prescribe therapy accordingly. Please do not underestimate the treatment of bronchitis, which is particularly important in your case, since CHF has started.I think you are scheduled for a transesophageal heart ultrasound, so your doctor can evaluate the state of your mitral valve before the operation. It maybe uncomfortable to have the examination while having bronchitis. Therefore, if it is possible, I would advise to postpone the procedure.I hope this helped.Kind regards, Dr. Alma"},{"Patient":"Age 65, F, 5'7\\", epilepsyMy doctor has told me I have an upper respiratory virus and to take Claritin, rest, and drink two quarts of water a day. I've been doing that but this is day 12. I'm absolutely miserable with dry cough that has turned productive, headache and neck ache in the back when I cough (and following). No fever. Short of breath","Doctor":"Hello dear, Thank you for your question.In my opinion the conversion from dry to productive cough might be a sign of a secondary bacterial infection, that not necessarily is manifested with fever. If this is the case a consult with your doctor is in order.It is known that older antihistamines like: brompheniramine and chlorpheniramine decrease secretions and widen airways. Newer non-sedating antihistamines, like loratadine (Claritin) aren't effective as cough suppressants. I hope this helped.Best wishes,Dr. Alma"},{"Patient":"Hi, I developed a bruise on my chest this morning (centered basically where a necklace would hang), and I've been coughing a fair bit today.  I figured the cough was from allergies, but now I'm starting to feel a bit dizzy.  Are these symptoms related?  Should I go and see a doctor, or am I being a hypochrondriac?","Doctor":"Hello dear, Thank you for your question. Bruises usually come from local trauma whereas hives (urticaria) are the main manifestation of allergy. And usually allergic skin manifestations are numerous in different parts of the body. So your bruise doesn't seem connected with the other symptoms.Cough can come from different causes including: allergic, infective etc. You need to check it with your doctor, in case it persists.The dizziness you have been experiencing, needs attention especially in presence of other symptoms or when you have had it for more than a couple of days. In your case dizziness and cough might come from a simple viral infection that can pass in a few days.I hope this helped.Best wishes,Dr. Alma"},{"Patient":"Get rid of bad breath Hi im 18 years old and i can have bad breath often. i learned to deal with it and somewhat hide it but i would like to know if it is possible to get rid of it fully. ive been taking birth control for a few months and the bad breath came way before this. im under stress often but im learning to control that. i eat very health and take my daily vitamins daily.","Doctor":"Hello dear, Thank you for your question. Halitosis or bad breath is caused from a wide range of conditions of the oral space, throat or even the stomach. The first step can be to consult a dentist to evaluate the health of your teeth and gums. The next step I would suggest is to consult an ENT specialist (Ear,Nose,Throat). He/she will check your tonsils, which can also cause bad breath. The inflammation of the oesophagus or even the stomach should be considered by a gastroenterologist.I hope this helped.Best wishes,Dr. Alma"},{"Patient":"My wife fainted about a week ago after standing up from a seated position. She came back to a few seconds later. After about 15 minutes she felt able to sit up and i took her home. That whole night she said her legs felt shaky all night.

Went back to gp and she passed out again and said she felt like it was hard to breathe. Sent her to er. Doctors did ct and mri on head and chest. Ct showed pneumonia in lungs everything else ok. After 4 days in hospital she was released. Now at home she still feels really week and legs and arms feel trembly. No fever and nonproductive cough. Is the shaky arms and legs normal for a 37 year old.","Doctor":"Hello dear, Thank you for your question. Infectious diseases like Pneumonia go through 3 stages of development. The first stage may include fever, malaise, weakness, headache, or even fainting as you described. After that, the disease develops with fever and productive cough. The healing phase often presents with weakness and hypotension, which may also be experienced with arms and legs shaking. In such cases, I suggest to my patients to drink plenty of water, in order to prevent dehydration that leads to hypotension. I would advice her not to get up from the bed immediately, but to sit and rest for a bit.

My daughter has these chest or lower rib pain, or spasms, daily, and now complains of back ache.  I, her mother have just noticed, the middle of her back, she has what appears to be her spine, but three bumps sticking out.  Is this her spine, or something else related to her outgoing chest spasms?","Doctor":"Hello dear, Thank you for your question. In my opinion the bumps you have noticed, might seem more evident because of her specific body structure. The BMI (Body Mass Index) is within normal range, which is a sign of good development. The back pain may come from the forced posture that she applies in order to minimise the pain from the muscle spams.I hope this helped.Best wishes,Dr. Alma"},{"Patient":"Yes my 8 year daughter was complaining of her chest hurting today so went to er they did chest x-ray and than ekg and found an abnormal reading..

My resting heart rate is about 68, and over 100 during attacks. I have no health problems, take no meds and avoid caffiene. What could possibly be the cause?","Doctor":"Hello,This can be arrhythmia like psvt or atrial fibrillation, where your heart rate suddenly goes up and BP falls. You will need evaluation like ecg, thyroid test and holter monitoring. You should also get one hemoglobin levels done. So visit nearby cardiologist for these investigation.Also, to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard. Till the time your evaluation is complete, you can ask your local doctor for tab ciplar LA 20 mg . If none of the above is successful then last option is of electrophysiological studies which is invasive test which can diagnose and treat the arrhythmia permanently in most of the cases.Hope I have answered your query.

Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hello dear, Thank you for your question. In my opinion, the nature of the red spots may suggest an allergic reaction from the antibiotics. In order to create the right idea, I would like to ask you a few questions:-What type of antibiotic has your daughter taken? -Did the ER doctors prescribe a different antibiotic or the same one?-Can you describe the shape, dimensions and location of the red spots?

In many cases with asthma patients may experience some periods where they symptoms are not fully controlled from therapy. It can be related to changes in air humidity, infections or even stressful situations. In these cases I usually refer my patients to consult a specialist.

It should always be confirmed on echo. So it's not wise to comment on cardiomegaly at this point. Any high thyroid hormones can cause cardiomegaly, but you would be symptomatic.  Secondly chest pain you are describing doesn't sound like cardiac it's more like of acidity and reflux disease, you should have some antacid and avoid spicy, oily food.

Is this something the E.R. needs to checkout? Could this be cancer. The reason i quit smoking is because it got to where i could barely breath after having one and it would take me a minute to recover.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely visit emergency room and rule out heart diseases. You are a chronic smoker, having left sided chest pain, breathlessness on exertion, all these are commonly seen with heart diseases like heart failure and coronary artery disease (CAD). So immediately consult doctor and get done blood pressure monitoring, ecg, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test) to rule out heart related diseases. You may need cardiac supportive drugs on the basis of these reports. Don't worry, you will be alright. But don't wait at home, consult doctor as soon as possible. Hope I have solved your query.

My arms are feeling somewhat better after 45 minutes but heart is still rapid and pounding. Heartbeat is around 100 beats per minute.","Doctor":"Hello ThereAfter going through your medical query I understand your concern and I would like to tell you that rapid heart rate can be because of restlessness which is why you are facing insomnia as well, an ECG is recommended for you and take an anxiolytic and sleep well .Hopefully this information will guide you properly.Kind Regards Dr Bhanu Partap"},{"Patient":"i got symptoms of heart attack like electric shocks and i was unable to stand sit or lye down .

But I saw my doctor last Thursday for these symptoms and my BP was 197/119, pulse 52. He added 5mg of amlodipine to my meds and said to monitor BP for a week. I'm doing so every couple hours, but it is staying between 150-186 systolic and 94-110 diastolic, pulse 48-56. Should I consider going to the ER?","Doctor":"Hello,BP is high, here I would added further medicine like tab Telmisartan or dose of Amlodipine would have increased to 10 mg.

The emergency Dr. had me admitted due to the fact my blood pressure was 176/100,family history and he said my EKG was not prestine and was not normal. After 3 days of testing I was told not to worry about the EKG and was having coronary spasams and if the chest pain (radiating to my jaw) continues (I have only had 5 in 6 months) I will need a catherization.Should I have had it while still in the hospital?  Thank You","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely get done coronary angiography while still in the hospital. You are having following risk factors for heart diseases. 1. Hypertension 2. Positive family history 3. Abnormal ecg. So possibility of coronary artery disease (CAD) is more in your case. And undiagnosed CAD can lead to Sudden cardiac death. So better to rule out CAD in your case to prevent future serious complication.

I can understand your concern. Yes, broken rib can cause pain on coughing and deep breathing. But broken rib causes extreme pain and tenderness which are absent in your case, so broken rib is less likely in your case. In my opinion, you are mostly having musculoskeletal pain. So better to apply warm water pad on affected areas. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs. You will mostly improve with all these in 2-3 days. If not improving after 3 days then get done chest x ray to rule out broken rib.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

So consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too.

Yes, inappropriate, too tight inner wear (bra) can cause chest pain on regular use. This kind of tight bra can restrict respiratory movements so ribs and intercostal muscles tend to work more.

So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is needed to rule out bronchitis. You may need antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) on the basis of these reports. In any case, smoking cessation as soon as possible is needed. Don't worry, you will be alright but please quit smoking as early as possible. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hello, I am a 27 year old male. I was diagnosed with Orthostatic Hypotension with a tilt test by a cardiologist about a year ago. I ve been very interested in monitoring my blood pressure so I bought a home kit that I use. My average blood pressure is at about 130/85 when sitting. I am aware that my blood pressure drops when standing. When I test myself standing, the readings puzzle me because I do not know how to interpret the results. There is also very little information online about this - readings such as 113/87 HR 85, 115/85 HR 84. I find the lack of disparity between the Systolic and Diastolic reading puzzling I am also aware that my HR should go when I stand up to compensate for the pooling of blood in my legs, however, it seems to slow to 65 BP from 90 BP or so, before jumping to about 98 BP after standing. When this happens, I get a sensation in my stomach similar to gagging (I don t gag, just the stomach pressure) and pressure building behind my ears from my neck. I replicated the slowing of the HR by utilizing my gag complex successfully. I m curious if this is related to the odd blood pressure reading or if any of this is part of the Orthostatic Hypotension I was diagnosed with...","Doctor":"Hi,Normally heart rate should go up with response to decrease in BP but sometimes due to pooling of blood in legs, blood coming to heart decreases and heart contacts rapidly and vigourously. So when empty hearts contracts vigorously then there other reflex is activated called as bezold jarish reflex which leads to slowing of heart beat. Have plenty of oral fluids and avoid standing abruptly. Use measure like crossing of legs, bed rest during episodes.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Sagar Makode"},{"Patient":"I seem to be suffering allergies for a few days (not normally) and having post nasal, heavy coughing that can upset my stomach and constant throat clearing. Also, feel tired and chest is heavy. Is this normal? Age 42, wght 148, on statin and bp medication.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Since you are having allergy, we should rule out allergic bronchitis in your case. Chest tightness, coughing, post nasal discharge etc are commonly seen with allergic bronchitis. So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Also take combination of antihistamine (levocetrizine or fexofenadine) and anti allergic (montelukast) drugs. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have an ulcer. I have been taking Cimetidine on and off for about three years. But lately i am coughing a bad cough.

I sometimes cough and i have blood in phelgem. What could it be?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. You are having hemoptysis (blood in sputum). Hemoptysis is mostly due to bronchitis or lung infection or lung cancer.. So better to get done chest x ray first. If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for lung infection or lung cancer. You are not taking appropriate treatment for bronchitis and this is the reason why you are not improving. Best treatment of bronchitis is inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid. And treatment guided by severity. So get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) to know the severity of bronchitis. On the basis of PFT report you will need inhaled treatment. Don't worry, you will be alright with all symptoms including hemoptysis after inhaled treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. Normal ecg does not rule out heart diseases in all cases. Ecg can be normal at rest despite of heart disease. You are having risk factors for heart diseases like age of 50 years, hypertension, high cholesterol levels etc. So we should definitely investigate thoroughly for heart diseases in your case. So get done 2d echo, stress test (trade mill test) and Coronary angiography (if required). If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Somtimes, simple musculoskeletal pain can be the cause. So avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Take simple painkiller like ibuprofen. Don't worry, you will be alright but first rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Being a long diabetic you must be well aware of sugar control, just check your blood sugar at midnight night or between 3 to 5 am sometimes mid night hypoglycemia causes hyperadrenalism causes high BP and pulse.

Apart from above, one of the complications of DM is autonomic neuropathy. It may be the cause of your symptoms. Otherwise sudden episodic cause of High BP and pulse may be pheochromocytoma, an endocrine tumor from suprarenal gland or other body organs.

I can understand your concern. No, this value does now suggest active tuberculosis. These are antibodies against tuberculosis. They can be present if child is vaccinated with BCG vaccine in past. So borderline positive antibodies don't suggest TB. Simple viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI)  is the most common cause for cervical Lymphadenopathy in children. So give him treatment for URTI for 1 week. His swellings will mostly reduced. Don't start anti tubercular drugs on this report. Give him plenty of fluids orally. Avoid oily and spicy food. Warm water gargles 5-6 times a day is also beneficial. Don't worry, he will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi, my mother got some tests done because she has been coughing consistently w/phlegm. She said she feels like she has a respiratory infection. She's worried about having septicimia. Antibiotics haven't worked yet. The results of the pharyngeal exudate say that she has a \\"development of proteus mirabilis\\". What is this & how do you treat it?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. No need to worry for septicemia. Possibility of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) with proteus mirabilis is more. It is gram negative bacteria. And her symptoms are also suggestive of URTI. Septicemia is severe blood stream infection. And this gives life threatening symptoms like hypotension, coma, organ failures etc. So no need to worry for septicemia. She needs antibiotics, antihistamine and anti inflammatory drugs for URTI. Also tell her to drink plenty of fluids orally,avoid oily and spicy food. Warm water gargles 5-6 times a day is also advisable. If she don't improve with all these in 1 week then get done chest x ray to rule out lung infection.. Don't worry, she will be alright with all these in 1 week. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks."},{"Patient":"i'm 25 years old.. 5' in height..100 pounds. i suffered from ptb when i was 12. i had treatment back then but was not fully recovered i guess cause i didn't finish taking meds. i thought i was okay already until i was 20 in 3rd year college i underwent medical exams cause i got the opportunity to go to singapore for training. they found out through my xray result that i have ptb minimal at first they thought its pneumonitis. so i took my meds seriously this time almost for 9 months after that my doctor said that my lungs are clear now. is it possible not to have a scar from ptb minimal after a successful treatment?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. It is very difficult to say predict this. Tuberculosis in lung heals by mostly fibrosis, calcification or both fibro calcified lesions. Rarely it can cause complete resolution. So some fibrotic lesions are commonly seen after successful anti tubercular treatment. No one can predict about complete resolution in any patient. So there is still possibility that even after 9 months of treatment, you may have scarred lesions on chest x ray. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hello My Uncle has scarring of the lungs and about 7 year ago he had a stent put in This has worked OK apart from chest infections occasionally cleared up by anti biotics.For about 3 months now he has had what some would describe as a cold but its not obviously lasting all this time. He is 86 years old slim build and no weight problem.He is about 5 8 tall Thank you","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist for your uncle. Scarred lungs can cause bronchitis and chronic lung infection like tuberculosis. And both of them can cause recurrent cough with expectoration. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. PFT (pulmonary function test) 3. CT thorax. He may need inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and anti tubercular drugs on the basis of reports. Don't worry, he will be alright. First diagnose the cause and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your uncle.

For about a week and half now she has been getting pain in her chest and she tells us that it is heartburn. She is now admitted into the hospital, she is getting bad headaches and sweats. What do you think could be the problem and what could we do?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should rule out heart diseases in her case. She was already having heart disease in past and current symptoms like chest pain, sweating etc favour heart diseases more. So get done blood pressure monitoring, ecg, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test). She may need Coronary angiography if required to confirm heart diseases. On the basis of these reports, she will need cardiac supportive drugs. Don't worry, she will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"my husband had a chest exray and they said they saw some crystalization in his lungs and want to do a CT scan with contrast. This is very expensive and we don't have insurance. What does this crystalization mean? He is 60 and is a carpenter and has been working with asbestos in the past.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Crystallization of lungs means fibrotic thickening of lungs. This is commonly seen with chronic dust or chemicals orally Fumes exposure. Actually, they all cause inflammation in lungs when inhaled chronically. This continuous inflammation will cause fibrosis and  thickening of lung parenchyma. And these will appear as Crystallization on chest x ray. This kind of diseases are commonly seen with asbestos, silica exposure. Chest x ray is just a screening tool. We have to go for CT scan to confirm this. So CT scan is mandatory in his case. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your husband.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should rule out bronchitis in your case. Bronchitis (inflammation of airways) is common after lung infection like tuberculosis. Bronchitis can cause breathing difficulty. So get done PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only.

I can understand your concern. Yes, you should follow these steps for better improvement in lung capacity and lung functions.1. Enroll in pulmonary rehabilitation center where chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercises are done. 2. Take pneumococcal and influenza vaccines to prevent recurrent respiratory tract infection. 3. Do yoga and pranayam every day in morning. 4. Avoid smoking if you do. 5. Get done annual PFT (pulmonary function test) to track your lung functions. 6. Take antioxidants and multivitamin tablet for better lung immunity. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

I have consulted many general physicians but a single answer I get is, there is no problem. But I am worried bout my continues cough. I recently have a kind of burning sensation at the upper part of stomach. This might be due to irregular food. Could you please advice on any tests that can prove useful? Should I go for Complete health checkup? Would that help?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Since you are active smoker, continuous cough with phlegm since 3 years should be investigated thoroughly. So consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x ray 3. PFT (pulmonary function test). Chest x ray is needed to rule out lung infection like tuberculosis and pneumonia. PFT is needed to rule out asthma and bronchitis.

I can understand your concern. Left sided chest pain on activity is mostly seen with heart diseases. So we should first rule out heart diseases in your case. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If both these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes, simple musculoskeletal pain can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid bad postures in sleep. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Take painkiller like ibuprofen if required. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these but first rule out heart diseases.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi...

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out heart diseases for your symptoms. So get done blood pressure monitoring, ecg, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test). If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases.Some energy pills do contain steroids. And these steroids can cause similar kind of side effects.

I have been to the doctors many times for this and nothing has changed in the trweatment which I am getting.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. I have gone through the x ray report you have mentioned. This kind of x ray report is suggestive of chronic bronchitis (COPD). And you are taking only xeponex (levoalbuterol) for this. You are not taking proper treatment this is the reason for persistent symptoms. Ideally treatment of COPD should be guided on severity and severity is known by PFT (pulmonary function test). So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will improve with long acting inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

In my opinion, your symptoms are mostly due to stress and anxiety. No need to worry for heart diseases as your blood pressure is normal and cholesterol level is low. You are approaching menopause and in this age, women tend to have stress, anxiety and panic. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

She hasn't been facing any severe symptoms even now except that she feels shortness of breath while climbing the stairs. A local doctor has put her on Ecosprin 150 mg at the rate of 1 tablet in the night. Kindly suggest me whether I need to go for further treatment at the moment.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Your mother is having shortness of breath on exertion (climbing stairs). And in ASD patient, this can be the early sign of heart failure. Ecosprin is anti platelet. It is for prevention of blood clots. It has no role in heart failure. So you should definitely consult her to cardiologist and get clinical examination, blood pressure monitoring and 2d echo to rule out heart failure. She might be improved with diuretics and other cardiac supportive drugs. No harm in continuing Ecosprin but it won't relieve her symptom of breathlessness on exertion. Diuretics and other cardiac supportive drugs are needed. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother.

I can understand your concern. Possibility of musculoskeletal cause is more for your chest tightness. But better to rule out heart diseases first. So get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test). If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes during sun bed activity, you might pull your muscles and which cause you chest tightness. So better to sit with proper back and chest support. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest. Avoid stress and tension, if you have any. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query.

Chest x ray is needed to rule out lung infection as lung infection is common after pleurisy (infection of pleura) and can cause similar symptoms.

This is a common complication which occurs with aging. After many years blood vessels become more rigid and thus more fragile, susceptible to rupture from small trauma.

On seventh day , due to negligence of Hospital staff my Nephew expired because they gave him solid food instead of Liquid and that choked in his wind pipe. Doctors gave the reason Fat Ambolism . After our Protest , Postmortom was done and the Organs were sent to Forensic Lab and Pathology Lab . Forensic Lab writes No common poison could be detected and Pathology Lab writes Microsections examined show areas of Haemorthage and congestion in the right lung. Based upon these reports Postmortom Doctors gave cause of death is Septicemia. Can this be the reason for the Death. I request you to please answer my Query. Regards Rajesh Khattar","Doctor":"septicemia can be the cause of death, when patients mostly on the ventilators the infection rates are more and they can go into septicemia, infection can cause congestion of lungs, vasodilatation, lowers blood pressure, hemorrhage etc"},{"Patient":"AGe 65, female, height 5 ft 7 1/4, weight 147. I have had bronchiectasis for about 20 years, and cough lots of sputum, often yellow, and several times a year green. Hi Doctor, I cannot pay anything. But I have had a scary episode - pain in my chest on the right side, and coughing up blood. I spent 5 hours in the emercency room, and the CT scan showed globules which could have been many things. My doctore said to do a sputum culture. That was on my short visit to the US. Now I am back in Rome, Italy, and the results of the culture showed pseudomonas alcaligenes and several medicines that can be effective. But I don understand Italian. I will see the doctor this afternoon, and want to know what to ask. Thank you Mary Ann PS I am a nun.","Doctor":"this pseudomonas alcaligenes infection is rare in normal people but it can occur usually in cystic fibrosis patients, your ct scan showed globules so it may be a favour of cystic fibrosis, it can be diagnosed with many other tests like sweat test"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am a 37 year old female. Weihgt is 66 kilograms. I often get allergic cold. Have been operated for nasal polypectomy in 2003 and also tonsillectomy the same year. I often have cold fever and sore throat. I have to take levocetrizine once a day.My mother suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis in 2003. She took a 9 month treatment and was cured. This year finally she passed away due to lung complications, kidney failure and BP, diabetes problems. My family doc asked me to do mycobacterium TB IGM as I often have mild fever and cold. test result 0.629. The report says result is negative. However my doc wants me to start with a short term TB treatment. When I consulted another doc he said there is no need to and that I don t have TB. What should I do? Pls let me know. Thanks.","Doctor":"i think you don't need to take treatment because you didin't have any symptoms of tb, mild fever and cold are not tb symptoms, tb symptoms are weight loss, cough for more than 2 weeks, evening or night fever etc if you have these then you have to take the treatment. your doctor has doubt then you take chest x ray which can diagnose some cases"},{"Patient":"Before, i was hit in the chest and i had pain for awhile badly and it recently started feeling better then i was pushed over off a sofa falling onto my side and my chest is hurting badly when i lay down and try to get up for deep breaths or any kind of stretching. Should i see a doctor or will it just pass?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely consult doctor and get done chest x ray. You were having chest pain before chest trauma (falling over sofa) and worsening paint after fall. So we should rule out lung related causes for your chest pain first. So get done chest x ray. If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for lung diseases. Your chest pain is mostly due to musculoskeletal pain.. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in musculoskeletal pain. 1. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Avoid movements causing pain. 3. Apply warm water pad on affected areas.. 4. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these in 1-2 weeks. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"hello sir,i am bhargavi.i am suffering with severe pulmonary artery hypertension with RVSP=110 AND PADP 48MMHG.i am also having diabetes type-2.i have been operated by PDA at the age of 9years.i am presently taking fruselac-ds(frusemide&spironolactone),penegra(sildenafyl citrate).","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. I have gone through the reports you have mentioned. Severe pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) in female can be due to underlying connective tissue disease (CTD). So better to first get done reports for CTD. Along with penegra, you should also start bosentan and tadalafil. Both are add on drugs for PAH when disease is noted controlled by single drug (penegra). Along with drugs, you should also follow these lifestyle modifications for better symptomatic relief. 1. Strict salt restrictions in diet. 2. Avoid fatty and oily food. Avoid spicy food. Avoid junk food. 3. Avoid excessive water intake. You should drink less than 1.5 liters of fluid daily. 4. Enroll in pulmonary rehabilitation center where chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercises are done. These will improve your lung functions. So consult your pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. No need to worry for heart diseases as your ecg is normal twice. So no need to ga for angiogram. By your history and description, possibility of simple musculoskeletal pain is more. You might be sleeping in bad awkward position which is causing this pain in morning only. This pain improves when you relax. This also favours musculoskeletal pain. So avoid bad postures in sleep. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. You can take simple painkiller like ibuprofen if pain is more. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query.

By her symptoms, possibility of stress related symptoms is more. But better to rule out hyperthyroidism as this can cause all such symptoms in young females. So get done serum TSH, Free T3 and free T4. If all these are normal then no need to worry for thyroid diseases. Sometimes, uncontrolled stress and anxiety can cause such symptoms. So consult psychiatrist for her and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in her life and start working on it's solution. She may need anxiolytic drugs too.

PFT will not only diagnose asthma but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).

I can understand your concern. Lung sounds clear means, there are no abnormal sounds like crepitation, rhonchi or wheezing. Crepitation heard in pneumonia.

Central chest pain more on lying down is mostly due to GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of central chest pain, burning stomach pain, belching etc. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in GERD. 1. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Take pantoprazole tablet on empty stomach. 5. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. 6. Quit smoking and Alcohol if you have these habits. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these in 1-2 weeks.

I can understand your concern. Yes it is quite possible. See any foreign body (glass) in lungs will irritate bronchial mucosa. This irritated mucosa will cause coughing to remove that foreign body. This is the main mechanism or you cat say protective role of cough reflex. Coughing expels small foreign bodies like peanut, glass pieces, dentures etc. And this is confirmed by CT scan. So no need to worry now. Coughing spells have removed foreign body from lungs of your son. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your son.

Can this be connected to reduced capacity of the lungs that would have occurred due to TB?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, previous tb infection can cause reduced lung functions. Actually tb infection heals by fibrosis or calcification. You had tuberculosis 10 years back. Tb heals with fibrosis or calcification in lungs. So you must be having fibro calcified lesions in your lungs. These lesions are non functioning. So they can not take part in oxygenation. So over all functional lung volume is reduced. So some degree of breathing difficulty on exertion is normal after tb infection. You can do chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercises to improve function of remaining lung. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hello, I am a 28yr old active female.  For the last year or two I have experienced chest tightness.  I also started rock climbing about a year ago.  I am not sure if this pain is caused by climbing... but I don't think it's connected.  I was anorexic for about 2 yrs. in college.  Since then, I have been healthy - no blood pressure issues.  I told my primary care physician about his in September, and he attributed my heart pain to muscle issues.  I am still having it, however.  Also, I recently have had a lot of left shoulder pain (had left elbow tendonitis last year) and my left middle finger has been numb at the tip for about 2 weeks.  This could be a pinched nerve, in my opinion, but I'm getting a little concerned since it's all on my left side and I'm still getting this heart pain.  Any thoughts?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out cardiac cause for your symptoms because left sided chest pain and shoulder discomfort are more associated with heart diseases. So get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test) first. If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes, stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution.

I can understand your concern. TB bacteria are also known as acid fast bacilli. Since your sputum report is negative for acid fast bacilli, you are not having tuberculosis at present. You had tuberculosis in the past. So there must be fibro calcified lesions in your lung due to healing of previous tb. These lesions can cause hemoptysis (blood in sputum) due to friction from coughing. So take antihistamine and anti inflammatory drugs for cough suppression. Don't worry, you will be alright with these drugs. No need to worry for reactivation of tuberculosis as your sputum for acid fast bacilli is negative. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Can costochondritis also go along the diaphram bones as well as the sternum.

And yes, it can affect sternum and diaphragm bone. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in costochondritis. 1. Avoid movements causing pain. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 4. Sit with proper back and chest support. 5. Take combination of painkiller and anti inflammatory drugs. 6. Apply warm water pad on affected areas.

Yes, bronchitis can cause chest pain. Bronchitis can cause pleurisy (inflammation of pleura) and this pleurisy can cause chest pain. And honestly speaking, bronchitis is not diagnosed by chest x ray.

I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of left sided chest pain, burning stomach pain, bloating, gaseous distention of stomach, chest tightness, pressure etc. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in GERD. 1. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. 2. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Take pantoprazole and levosulperide combination twice daily on empty stomach. 5. Quit smoking and Alcohol if you have these habits. 6. Go for walking after meals.

I can understand your concern. Yes, this spot will remain as it life long. You had tuberculosis which was healed by six months treatment. TB lesions heal by either fibrosis or calcification. These lesions are scar tissue which is inactive. So they will remain as it is through out the life and will be seen in all future x rays. These lesions are inactive. They are not carrying any bacteria so not infectious. Hence, no drug or operation is required to clear them. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

What are the chance that I have a blood clot","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. D dimer is very non specific test. High d dimer can not 100%suggests pulmonary embolism (blood clot in lungs). Apart from pulmonary embolism, high d dimer is seen with muscular injury, skeletal injury, infection, inflammation etc. So I don't think you are having pulmonary embolism because you are not having cough, breathlessness. But better to get done CT scan to rule out pulmonary embolism. If CT scan is normal then no need to worry for pulmonary embolism.

I can understand your concern. I also feel that you are having acute exacerbation of asthma. Normal chest x ray rules out pneumonia or lung cancer or other lung diseases. Chronic cough, congestion, phlegm, wheezing, shortness of breath etc in asthmatic patient is suggestive of acute worsening of asthma more. So get done PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will tell you about severity of asthma and treatment is based on severity only. You may need long acting inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).

I can understand your concern. Most common cause for palpitations is stress and anxiety.

So consult doctor and get done ecg, 2d echo and Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg). If all these are normal then no need to worry for arrhythmia or other heart diseases. Sometimes undiagnosed and uncontrolled stress can also cause palpitations. So consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions.

She cannot talk, can only make some grunts, can only move her eyes and her fingers flutter a little. Fed via nose tube fortified milk 7 times daily at 3 hour intervals. Since she is lactose intolerant we finally found Peptamine milk the best for her (no diarrhea). Has a catheter for urine and we have a nurse come in half a day twice a week. But my mother is doing pretty OK because her vital organs are rather strong. However, she produces a lot of phlegm and though she sometimes coughs (or sneezes out) the phlegm, we are quite concerned. We have bought a suction machine for the nurse to use. In between we give her chest physio (twice a week) and give her mucosolvan to dilute the phlegm. Any advise from you much appreciated. Thanks.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should rule out lung infection and bronchitis in your mother's case. She is not taking food orally. She fed via nasogastric tube. This can lead to micro aspiration of food particles in airways and lung. These can cause bronchitis and aspiration pneumonia. Both of them can cause excessive phlegm production.So better to consult pulmonologist for her and get done Clinical examination of respiratory system and Chest x ray to rule out pneumonia and bronchitis. She may need antibiotics and inhaled treatment on the basis of these reports. Don't worry, she will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother.

I can understand your concern. No, I don't think it is serious issue. I also don't think that both these pains are connected. Possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more. So avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Take simple painkiller like ibuprofen. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Avoid masturbation or sex for few days if you are sexually active. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

I have been told by my regular doctor that it is allergies, but I have tried allergy medicines and they don't help. I have gone from 255  pounds down to 220 in about 1 1/2 months without changing my diet or exercise. What can be wrong with me?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. You are having allergies, chest pain and weight loss. So we should first rule out allergic bronchitis in your case. Bronchitis can cause pleurisy and this pleurisy can cause chest pain. Bronchitis if untreated can lead to weight loss. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only.. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Don't worry, you will be alright. First diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment.

I've been having sharp, stabbing pains on my right side, just underneath my rib cage every time I breathe in. The pain seems to get worse while sitting or laying down. In the hospital, they told me it was a gas pain, but now I'm not so sure. Any other suggestions?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having musculoskeletal pain. Cesarean section needs manipulation of rib cage. So post operative musculoskeletal pain is common. Your pain is also associated with specific position (sitting and lying down). This also favours musculoskeletal pain more. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in musculoskeletal pain. 1. Avoid movements causing pain. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 4. Sit with proper back and chest support. 5. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. 6. Take combination of painkiller and muscle relaxant drug. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

I don't cough at night but start about half hour after waking. I have taken medication for reflux, deep asthma, lung fungus, H-pylori. I am a 56 year old healthy, relatively fit, female. I am 5ft 6in in height and weigh 58kg. Do you have any suggestions?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. You have done all investigations to rule out various causes for cough. If you are getting cough despite of all normal reports and treatment, possibility of psychogenic cough is more. You are not having cough in night while sleeping. And you start coughing after waking. So you are not coughing when your mind is resting in sleep. This also favours psychogenic cough more. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I have been to a cardiologist and had a stress test done to rule out my heart and all test came back that my heart was in excellent condition.  I have had x-rays done of my chest and nothing has ever come up on  the resluts.  History: I have worked very hard the past 1 1/2 years to loose weight and get into better shape.  Which I have accomplished by leaps and bounds because a year ago I my starting weigh was over 210lbs.  I exercise for an hour 3 to 4 times a week.  I had to have had my gallbladder removed last year, October 2010 and felt wonderful afterwards.  Within 4 months I started feeling the reflux issues again.  Had a scope done and found that I had a small Hiatel hernia and was diagnosed with GERD.  I just worry because I have this what I call sore feeling in my chest.  When I breathe it hurts...its not a painful hurt but like a soreness hurt (i feel like I have worked out my chest muscles extrememly hard)  I recently noticed also when I went swimming for the first time that getting into the water made my chest feel like I had someone sitting on top of me and made it that much harder to breathe in the water.  I am just concerned that somethng else could be going on or have I done something and strained something that could be causeing the constant soreness, but that still doesn't explain my shortness of breathe unless that is a result from the soreness and I am just not able to breathe in as deep because it hurts.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should rule out bronchitis in your case. Bronchitis can cause shortness of breath, soreness of chest and it is commonly seen with hiatus hernia and GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) patient. GERD causes micro aspiration in lungs. These can cause constant irritation and inflammation of the airways (bronchitis). So in my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or salmeterol). For GERD, take pantoprazole tablet on empty stomach. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food.

I can understand your concern. Omastin is having fluconazole. It is antifungal drug. This drug can cause reflux and heart burn. So your symptoms like upper chest pain, breathing difficulty etc are mostly due to fluconazole side effects (reflux and heart burn). So drink plenty of fluids orally. Avoid oily and spicy food. Take pantoprazole tablet on empty stomach before Omastin dose. Quit smoking and Alcohol if you are having these habits. Well, for your skin disease, I think, you should consult dermatologist and start topical antifungal creams (ketoconazole, nystatin etc). Hope I have solved your query.

I can understand your concern. I don't think he needs chest x ray at present because he is having chest pain only, no coughing. His current chest pain is mostly due to musculoskeletal pain because of riding bike very fast. His chest pain few months back is also due to musculoskeletal pain. Actually coughing involves ribs, intercostal muscles. So chronic coughing will cause sore ribs and muscles which cause chest pain. So I don't think he needs any chest x ray at present. His chest pain is simple musculoskeletal pain only. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your son.

She has been advised that they need to inject something into her muscle cartlidge of her ribs, is there any way that a pulmonologist could assist in this regard and tell us what the correct treatment is and if it is infact pleurisy?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely consult pulmonologist before giving that injection. Pleurisy is inflammation of pleura. This is commonly seen with lung infection (pneumonia or tuberculosis), pleural effusion, bronchitis, pulmonary infarction etc. So before giving an injection, we should rule out all these causes first. So consult pulmonologist for your mother and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x ray 3. CT scan of thorax 4. PFT (pulmonary function test). She may need antibiotics if it is infection or pleural effusion. She may need inhaled treatment if it is bronchitis. She may need anticoagulants if it is lung infarction.

She feels that it is a growth spert, I question that, because, she has never been this way before, and has had many growth spirts.  What are your thoughts?  Her blood sugar was also tested, and is normal.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Chronic cough in children is commonly seen with asthma and allergic bronchitis. Albuterol is short acting drug for asthma. So it might not give Complete relief.

PFT will not only diagnose asthma and bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the diseases and treatment is based on severity only. She will mostly improve with long acting inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Oral combination of antihistamine (levocetrizine or fexofenadine) and anti allergic (montelukast) is also beneficial in such cases. Don't worry, she will be alright.

Now i feel like my chest burns and my food stays in my throat. is it normal?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, this kind of symptoms are common after heavy beer drinking. Beer is alcoholic drink. And alcoholic drinks are known to cause GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms burning central chest pain, nausea, vomiting etc. So better not to drink beer or other alcoholic drinks. Take pantoprazole and levosulperide combination on empty stomach for symptomatic relief. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm.

I can understand your concern. You are having orthopnea (breathing difficulty on lying down). Orthopnea is classical symptom of heart diseases like heart failure and coronary artery disease (CAD). So without wasting much time, you should immediately consult cardiologist and get done 1. Blood pressure monitoring 2. Ecg3. 2d echo 4. Stress test 5. Coronary angiography (if required).

I can understand your concern. Chlamydia infection can cause pneumonia (lung infection). And this pneumonia can cause pleuritic chest pain. This is the reason why doctor asked you about chest pain. Since you are active smoker, you are at risk of lung infection (pneumonia). So in my opinion, you should definitely get done chest x ray to rule out pneumonia as a cause for your chest pain. If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for pneumonia. This chest pain can be due to simple musculoskeletal pain. In any case, it is better to quit smoking as soon as possible. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I have not injured myself recently and this has been going on for about a month.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Well, in my opinion, we should first rule out cardiac cause for your chest pain because you are having pulsating chest pain. So get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test. If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes without injury, pulled muscle is there. This is due to awkward sleeping position or bending or jerky movements. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in such chest pain. 1. Avoid movements causing pain. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 4. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. 5. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. But first rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query.

My diet is great, i only eat whole grains, i eat alot of protein, and veggies, and stay away from fast food. I am 17 years old. but i take zoloft, and wellbutrin for depression and anxiety. I also have been taking pre workout supplements that contain ingredients such as caffeine. my nurse in school said that its probably just anxiety or the weather since it has been rainy and humid for a straight week.

By your history and description, possibility of stress and anxiety related chest pain is more. At your age of 17 years, heart diseases are unlikely. And yes, decreasing dose of anxiety medicine can cause worsening of anxiety symptoms. You are also having other stressors which contribute more in your symptoms. So in my opinion, you should consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Discuss your problems, stressors with psychiatrist and find out the solutions. Don't decrease dose by your own. Counselling plays very important role along with anxiolytic drugs in control of symptoms. Don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Hope I have solved your query.

Although now seem to have lower lung infection shortness of breath and trouble clearing throat. Will the bone disolve eventually in the airway like doctor mentioned? Any advice please","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. No, bone can not dissolve in lung tissue. By your history and description, possibility of aspiration pneumonia after accidental aspiration of bone is more. Bone will react as foreign body in lungs. So there will be development of infection, inflammation, collapse, consolidation in that part of lung. So better to take it out as soon as because it won't dissolve in lungs. You should consult pulmonologist and get done bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy is not only diagnostic but it will also remove bone (therapeutic).

Would it most likely be a pinched nerve?  Should I worry about a blood disease?  I am a healthy 32 year old woman.  5'10\\", 160 lbs.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. First of all, no need to worry for major heart or lung related diseases because your reports are normal. It is unlikely for pinched nerve to cause chest pain and arm pain together. In my opinion, at your age of 32 years, we should rule out vitamin B12 deficiency as a cause for this kind of pain. So get done vitamin B12 level and if deficiency then you will need supplements. If this is normal then stress and anxiety are likely cause for your symptoms. Undiagnosed, uncontrolled stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm.

Sent me home with zofran and Lortab because he said the insurance company would not pay to keep me overnight unless I was vomiting for 2-3 days.

Severe vomiting, chest pain, chest heaviness etc are commonly seen with peptic perforation and intestinal obstruction. Both of these conditions need urgent surgical intervention as a treatment. CT scan of abdomen was done to rule out these life threatening causes for your symptoms.

For this you should consult pulmonologist and get done PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only.

Pls help me thanks....","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. I have gone through the x ray report you have mentioned. It is suggestive of right upper lobe minimal densities. These are mostly due to healing from tuberculosis. You had TB 5 years back. Tb lesions heal after treatment. They heal by fibrosis or calcification. And these fibrosis or calcification will stay life long. This is the reason why same opacity is seen in different x rays taken in 2009 and 2011. So these densities are old, healed, fibrotic lesions. And they don't need treatment. And I don't think you will be rejected in your pre employment medical test. So don't worry. You are not having active TB and so you will not need treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Dear doctor.

I spent two hours standing up against a wall with my arms above my head trying to breathe and withstand the pain.  We called my mom and I could barely get a few words out at a time.  I think this was caused because I slept on the floor at a friends.  This has happened before at a friends house when the air first got really humid and hot.  I had the same symptoms and could not breathe with chest pain on the right side.  My mom had me put ice on it and stay close to a freezer or ac unit to breathe in cold air.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should immediately take your son to emergency room. He is having epistaxis, chest pain and tiredness. And all these are seen with pneumonia. So he needs clinical examination of respiratory system and chest x ray for the diagnosis of pneumonia. He will need intravenous antibiotic, fluids and other supportive drugs. Don't worry, he will be alright with all these. But don't wait at home, consult emergency room and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

After a few hours I noticed that I had small dry flakes blood on one of my nostrils. After noticing that I spit out not from the saliva in my mouth but I forced some from behind my throat and noticed it was bloody as well.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. You are having hemoptysis (blood in sputum). It is commonly seen with lung infection, bronchitis, tuberculosis, lung cancer and upper respiratory tract infection (pharyngitis). So better to consult doctor and get done 1. Chest x ray to rule out lung infection, tuberculosis, lung cancer etc. 2. PFT (pulmonary function test) to rule out bronchitis. 3. Clinical examination of throat to rule out pharyngitis. Since you are having blood on pharyngeal wall, possibility of pharyngitis is more. You will need antibiotic, antihistamine and anti inflammatory drugs. Do warm water gargles 5-6 times a day. Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep your self hydrated. Avoid oily and spicy food. Avoid hard to chew food. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these but first rule out lung diseases.

Did have high cholestoral, but nothing major.  If cholestoral were issue, wouldn't I have high blood pressure?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. No, high cholesterol can not always cause high blood pressure. High cholesterol can block blood vessels especially coronary arteries and this can cause heart diseases. Your symptoms like left sided chest tingling and numbness in left arm are commonly seen with heart diseases. So despite of normal blood pressure and pulse, I advice you to consult cardiologist and get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test) to rule out heart diseases. If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I feel like there is fluid in my lungs so I try to exhale with force to get it out and that will trigger my coughing.. but I can't breath well if I don't do that...  I can't sleep because of the cough and I will have these coughing fits that gets to the point where I actually throw up. Sometimes the coughs are dry even though I feel what seems to be fluid in my lungs but they are pretty productive most of the time and I do cough out a lot of moisture.. I stay healthy, I've not been sick, I do have allergies but nothing ever like this.. I can't get an appointment with my doctor for about a week so I wanted to know if I should be concerned?? Thanks a ton in advance!Ashley","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Since you are having allergies, possibility of allergic bronchitis is more. Bronchitis is inflammation of airways. Your all symptoms like coughing, phlegm, breathing difficulty etc are suggestive of bronchitis more. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT is needed for the diagnosis of bronchitis. It will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Oral anti allergic (montelukast) is also beneficial in your case. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Your age is more than 50 years,  you are obese and have strong family history of heart disease so we should first rule out cardiac cause for your symptoms. So get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test. If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Yes, gaseous distention of stomach can cause similar symptoms. In my opinion, you are mostly having GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of chest tightness, chest pressure, pain, gaseous distention etc. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in GERD. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 2. Take pantoprazole and levosulperide combination on empty stomach. 3. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. 4. Go for walking after meals. 5. Loose weight and stay healthy. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query.

Having been told that she would probably not live to be 12, I feel that she has already beaten the odds. Can you tell me, based on your experience, if she is right and doesn t have long to live. I truly believe everyone has a time and that hers is not to die at 53. Help if you can!","Doctor":"Hi,Life expectancy in a cardiac patient is less than the same age population. It depends of the current status, the surgery she has undergone. If she already had a open heart surgery, opening the chest again for redo surgery will be definitely risky and will be more difficult as compared with the previous surgery. But it is not impossible and is being routinely done. It depends on the probability of life expectancy with disease and after surgery. If there is not much difference, we keep the patient on medical management. AF has a risk of clot formation which requires blood thinners to prevent clot formation. It is not essential to convert it into sinus rhythm as rate controlled AF is equivalent to sinus rhythm. So don't worry about that. Finally, be cheerful as nobody knows how long he or she will live.

The day after my mid stomach has a dull pain remaining most of day and night. Zantac, Tums, and Gas X did not help. Any thoughts?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) related chest pain is more because your pain is associated with eating. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of chest tightness, chest pain, burning, burping etc. Excess of body weight is the main cause for laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Only drugs are not sufficient to control GERD symptoms. You need to follow below mentioned lifestyle modifications for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. 2. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Go for walking after meals. 5. Loose weight and stay fit and healthy. 6. Quit smoking and Alcohol if you have these habits. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more because your chest pain is associated with specific movement (bending). So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in musculoskeletal pain. 1. Avoid movements causing pain. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 4. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. 5. Sit with proper back and chest support. 6. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant drug combination. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

I would appreciate any advice. Thank you.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Sore throat with chest tightness is commonly seen with viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). But better to rule out heart diseases (Coronary artery disease) because you are hypertensive patient. So get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test). If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Do warm water gargles. Take combination of antihistamine and anti inflammatory drugs. Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep your self hydrated. Avoid oily and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these but first rule out heart diseases.Hope I have solved your query .I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I have random chest pains that are sharp, I also have hot flashes, dizziness, disorientation, and extreme nausea.

I don't know what the problem is but it seems to be getting more frequent and lasting longer","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should rule out thromboembolism in your case. Vasculitis patients are at increased risk of thromboembolism. So they may dislodge and cause Coronary artery blockage (chest pain) or retinal artery blockage (blackout) etc. So better to consult your doctor and get done 1. Ecg 2. 2d echo 3. D dimer study 4. CT angiography You may need blood thinners like warfarin. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

But the tightness doesn't feel muscular. This happened a few months ago for several days, I had an ECG and a 24 hour monitor, nothing majorly \\"off\\" was found, but I also didn't feel these symptoms when I actually had the monitor on for those 24 hours. I figured it was just stress or anxiety, but I'm off work this week and it started up again even though I'm relaxed. It kind of scares me. I had some headaches the past few days and have been tired in general, but I figured it was just my body catching up from lots of work lately... The only significant thing in my medical history is mono and knee surgery.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. No need to worry for heart diseases as your extensive cardiac work up is normal. In my opinion, your all symptoms are due to uncontrolled stress and anxiety. So better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Counselling sessions and drugs together play very important role in symptomatic control. Don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Hope I have solved your query.

I was wanting to get someones opinion. Thank You.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x ray 3. PFT (pulmonary function test). Chest x ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis. Both, lung infection and bronchitis can cause similar kind of symptoms with chest pain. If all these are normal then no need to worry for major lung diseases.Sometimes simple musculoskeletal pain can also cause similar kind of chest pain. So avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

For the past couple months everything has been fine. But last night I decided to sleep in the newly painted room with the window open. All day today I felt no pain but as it got later into the night my chest started aching. Only when I breathe in it feels like a sharp pain in both lungs. I think this happened the last time I slept in a painted room. Or maybe its a pre-existing problem? Uknown cardiac issues? Broken rib? Idk help...","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. No need to worry for broken ribs. Possibility of heart related diseases is also less because you are having bilateral chest pain on breathing. In my opinion, you are mostly having bronchitis (inflammation of airways) which is causing this chest pain on breathing. Paint Fumes when inhaled can cause irritation and inflammation of the airways. This is more pronounced in already damaged lungs (past history of pneumonia). So at present, your bilateral chest pain is due to paint Fumes induced bronchitis. So take painkiller and anti inflammatory drugs. Avoid paint exposure. Inhale fresh air. You will mostly improve with all these in 1-2 days. If not improving or worsening (more cough, pain or started breathing difficulty) then consult doctor. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out heart related diseases for your symptoms because you are having hypothyroidism and slow heart rate. So heart blocks can cause similar kind of symptoms. So consult cardiologist and get done ecg, 2d echo, stress test (trade mill test) and Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg). If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart block or other heart diseases. Sometimes uncontrolled hypothyroidism can also cause similar symptoms. So get done serum TSH and free T3, free T4. If it is altered then you should change your thyroid drug dose.So consult doctor and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query.

But im 21 and i never had that lump there before .","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. I don't think it is Scoliosis. Scoliosis is related to spine, not sternum. Scoliosis is sideways protrusion of spine. So I don't think your lump near sternum is due to Scoliosis. In my opinion, you are mostly having costochondritis. It is inflammation of costal cartilage and it can cause swelling. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in costochondritis. 1. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 2. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 3. Take anti inflammatory and painkiller drugs. 4. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. You will mostly improve with all these in 1-2 weeks. If still not improving then get done ultrasound examination of local part and CT scan to identify the cause of swelling. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

It can be normal sinus tachycardia due to anxiety or stress or it could be abnormal supra ventricular tachycardia. For the diagnosis, you need to do ECG at the time of palpitation and tachycardia.

I can understand your concern. No need to worry for this pain or go to ER (emergency room). By your history and description, possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more because you are having chest pain on movements. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in musculoskeletal pain. 1. Avoid movements causing pain. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 4. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. 5. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these in 5 days.

Lastly, when inhaling deep (thoart), my check tightens not to mention I always conjested. Yes I do have sinus","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Since you are having sinus problem, possibility of asthma is more for your symptoms. Asthma can cause palpitations, breathing difficulty in night, chest congestion etc. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose asthma but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids.

It is commonly seen with costochondritis. Since you are smoker, costochondritis can recur. So better to quit smoking as soon as possible. Also get done chest x ray to rule out lung related causes. If chest x ray is normal then costochondritis is likely cause for this. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in costochondritis. 1. Avoid movements causing pain. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 4. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. 5. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. 6.

He has also lost 40 lbs in approx. 6 mos.  Is he at end stage?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Multiple myeloma can spread to lungs and cause multiple lung metastases. These metastatic lesions look like black spots on lungs. So we should definitely rule out lung metastases in your brother 's case. So get done PET scan first. If it shows increased uptake then he will need Biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of cancer. And lung metastases in multiple myeloma suggest poor prognosis. So if these spots are cancerous then he is having life expectancy of less than 1 year. Hope I have solved your query.

Now most of my friends are my age, height, about 40-80lbs heavier and smoke (which I do not) and yet they can last longer than me.  I also experience a discomfort, not pain under my left lower rib (feels as if you were to hold your stomach in for too long.).  These syptoms have been for 5 or more years.

A great number of things can raise these values, and one large value does not necessarily represent any significant illness or issues; it will not be enough to say anything is wrong or right. What it can do is signify that your body is in a more inflammatory/reactionary state than usual; but as I stated before this can be due to a number of things (Stress, elevated BP, viral or bacterial illness (even simple colds that you don't realize you have). Are you suffering any other symptoms? I hope this has helped, I wouldn't place too much emphasis on your ESR by itself, but if there are any other symptoms, I'd be happy to discuss these with you."},{"Patient":"I am a man; some of my friend twisted my nipple long time back and it were hard, formed some hard disc underneath the nipple and used to hurt but as the time pass by there is hardly any pain but i feel a bit heavy in chest. I gained my weight 30+ from that time. Can somebody answer waht to do?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. That incidence might have injured the soft tissue of nipple and areola. This injury heals by fibrosis which gives hard feeling underneath your nipple. No need to worry for this hard disc like feeling. This can not cause heaviness in chest. So for your heaviness feeling, we should rule out heart diseases because you gained weight also. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If both these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes, simple stress and anxiety can also cause similar heaviness in chest. So avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

My worry is she sings in a choir should she stop doing this could she damage her voice?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Night time coughing in 14 year old patient is commonly seen with allergy. I don't think it is due to singing in chorus. In my opinion, you should take her to pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). If PFT is showing obstructive Airway defect then possibility of allergic asthma related cough is more. Combination of anti allergic (montelukast) and anti histamine (levocetrizine or fexofenadine) is more superior than plain antihistamine. Sometimes, inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are also beneficial. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Don't worry, she will be alright with appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your daughter.

I can understand your concern. Yes, we should definitely rule out heart diseases in your grand mother's case. She is almost 90 years of age. So possibility of age related coronary artery disease (CAD) is high and this can cause similar symptoms. So better to consult cardiologist and get done 1. Ecg 2. 2d echo3. Stress test (trade mill test) 4. Coronary angiography (if required). She may need cardiac supportive drugs on the basis of these reports. If all these reports are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your grandmother.

My throat felt like it was closing up.  He immediately rolled his window down and turned the device off.  He said he had never seen anyone react to his cigarette in this manner.  After a brief time my breathing was normal and the constrictive feeling  in my throat disappeared.  Was this an allergic reaction?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, this can be the acute allergic reaction due to cigarette smoke. Cigarette smoke carries many harmful chemicals. When inhaled, in some people, it can cause allergic reaction. Allergic reaction causes laryngospasm, bronchospasm and coughing. All these give symptoms of choking, breathing difficulty etc. Your symptoms relieved by its own once the exposure has been cut. So all these suggest acute allergic reaction two cigarette smoke.

Thank you","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. First of all relax and be calm as apical pleural thickening is not a lethal or life threatening condition. Pleural thickening is suggestive of old, healed, non active scar lesions. This is mostly seen after pneumonia or tuberculosis healing. So you might be having pneumonia or tuberculosis in the past which was healed and produce this thickening. These kind of healed lesions are seen through out the life. Since they are inactive scar lesions, no treatment is required for this. So no need to worry for this apical pleural thickening.

I can understand your concern. Burning sensations in lungs especially on exertion (walking up Hill) is mostly seen with inflammation of the airways (bronchitis). You are more than 60 years of age and having history of smoking, so you are at risk of development of bronchitis. So we should definitely rule out bronchitis for your symptoms. So consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. PFT (pulmonary function test).

I can understand your concern. Hemangioma is benign tumour of blood vessels. It can be seen in all organs like lungs, liver, kidney, spleen etc but commonly seen in face and mouth. In lungs, these Hemangioma can cause arteriovenous shunting of blood. This means, Hemangioma causes mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. So body will sense low oxygen and so increase respiratory rate to compensate. So Hemangioma in lungs can cause breathlessness.

She is taking injection broadactam 4.5 thrice a day for 7 days. Do you think this is the remedy for her? And being a type 2 diabetic what are her chances of recovery and what precautions should she take or does she need to go for more advance tratment? Please help also suggest me best pulmonologist in kolkata im showing dr ashok sengupta and i want to change my doctor!!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Diabetic patients are at increased risk of bacterial, fungal and parasitic infection due to poor immunity. Lung infection is especially more common because lungs are exposed to environmental air directly. Broadbectum injection is for bacterial infection. Best treatment for lung infection should be guided according to culture and sensitivity report. Culture report will isolate the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. So get done repeat bronchoscopy and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis, bronchoscopic Biopsy for further evaluation. Also get done BAL for fungal culture and anaerobic culture to diagnose fungal and uncommon bacterial infection. On the basis of these reports, she might need antifungal or other higher antibiotic with anaerobic coverage. In Kolkata, visit wokhardt hospital. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have a granddaughter that just had her middle right lobe of her lung removed due to lobar emphysema. She is five weeks old now. What are the chances of another lobe developing this condition? Will she have any other affects or a shortened life span because of this?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Your grand daughter is having congenital emphysema. And this can be develop in other lobes of lungs in future life. Surgery is not the only option for lobar emphysema. At present, she undergone surgery is ok. But if she develops emphysema into future then no need for surgery. She should first start medical management of emphysema which includes inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Exact percentage of chances of future development of emphysema is difficult to tell. But over all in whole life she is having 50-60% chances. And definitely, this will hamper her quality of life and life expectancy also. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your grand daughter.

I can understand your concern. Echoic mass in abdominal and chest wall is more suggestive of cancerous growth. Size (5.4*3.6) of the mass is also more. So possibility of rhabdomyosarcoma (muscle tumour) or bone tumour is more in your case. So MRI is needed to confirm the malignant nature and to know the extension in the deeper and adjacent structures. You will also need fine needle aspiration cytology (FNACFNAC) or Biopsy from the mass to identify the type of cancer. You may need excision Biopsy and chemotherapy after confirmation of diagnosis.

She is suffering from arthritis and asthma for long 30 years for which she has taken steroids for all these years. For last 5 years she has been suffering from diabetes also and her asthma revived a year back as it had been silent for all these years may be due to intake of steroids which she has left. And now recently she is diagnosed with Lvef 35% only. Now she is not taking any arthritis steroids but now she is badly suffering from asthma (beathlessness), severe cough, and low blood pressure(84/64). She has been hospitalised twice recently due to low blood pressure and acute breathlessness and recovered quite well both the times but again health deteriorates after few days.Although she is taking tretment from chest doctor as well as heart doctor but her condition is not improving especialy breathlessness. Please advise.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Since she is having ejection fraction (EF) (heart function) only 35%, her heart is failing. She is going in recurrent heart failure. She is also having chronic, steroid dependent asthma. This also causes respiratory failure. So combination of heart and lung failure is causing her frequent episodes of breathlessness. Honestly speaking, these are not good diseases for prognosis. She is having poor prognosis. She needs diuretics, cardiac inotropic drugs and other cardiac supportive drugs along with strict control of diabetes and asthma. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

I can understand your concern. Your chest pain is central and associated with burping and eating. So possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) related pain is more. But you are also having green phlegm which suggest lung infection. So better to first get done chest x ray. If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for lung infection. GERD is likely in your case due to antibiotics and other drugs. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of chest pain, burping, belching etc. So take pantoprazole and domperidone tablet on empty stomach.

I dont know what it is but it has been bothering me for a month or 2 now. Tylenol seems to help but im taking 3 tylenol every 4 hrs to keep the pain away. What is it??","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Since your chest pain is associated with lifting things and breathing, possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more. But as it is left sided chest pain, we should first rule out heart related chest pain. So first get done ecg and 2d echo. If both these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Musculoskeletal pain is more likely in your case. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid movements causing pain. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 4. Sit with proper back and chest support. 5. Take painkiller like ibuprofen. 6. Apply warm water pad on affected areas.

Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of burning esophageal pain, chest tightness etc. You are taking antacid (pantoprazole). Only drugs are not important in this. You need to follow below mentioned lifestyle modifications also for better symptomatic relief. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. 2. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bed to prevent reflux. 5.

You are afraid about aspiration of foreign body (sunflower seed) in the lungs. If this would have happened, you must be having continuous cough, chest pain, breathing difficulty etc. Since all these symptoms are absent, I don't think you have aspirated sunflower seed. So no need to rush to the hospital. You can wait for 1-2 days. If during this period you develop constant chest pain, continuous coughing and breathlessness then immediately consult pulmonologist and get done bronchoscopy.

I can understand your concern. Normal chest x ray is taken in posteroanterior view (PA view). In this view, lung apex (upper part) is not clearly visualized because of overlapping ribs, clavicle and lung shadows. So any opacity or lesion in apex is not properly visualized in normal PA view. So exact opinion about the etiology is not possible. To overcome this issue apicolordotic view is needed. In this, chest x ray is taken in such a way that apex of th lung is clearly visualized without hindrance of ribsribs and clavicle shadow.

I can understand your concern. Sometimes, CT scan is not confirmatory about the diagnosis whether it is simple pneumonia or tuberculosis or cancer. This dilemma is very common in old age. So in my opinion, we should go for microbiological investigations to confirm her diagnosis. So first get done sputum microscopic examination and sputum cytology. If sputum is not available then she will need bronchoscopy,  BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) and Biopsy. BAL analysis will diagnose if she is having tuberculosis or not.

Why is that so and is it normal? One more thing, my mother s side has a history of hypertension.","Doctor":"Hi,Regarding your concern, I would explain that elevation of blood pressure is common after physical activity. It is related to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, causing a load of chatecholamines (adrenaline and noradrenaline) in your blood. This causes an increased heart rate and blood pressure. Anyway, isolated high blood pressure values are not indicative of high blood pressure. So, I would recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure frequently during the day for a week (in sitting position after 10 minutes of total relax) and refer those values to your doctor. Some tips will help maintain normal blood pressure naturally: - reduce salt and caffeine intake- reduce smoking contacts- perform a lot of physical activity (walking, aerobics, etc.)Hope I have answered your query.

I am a 40 y/o/f, smoke approx 3/4 pack a day, and recently (since February) started working out and running.  For the last 2 weeks, on top of these symptoms, I have been extremely tired to the point that I don't feel like working out or doing anything.  This afternoon I took a nap.  I was woke up in the middle of my nap feeling like I was suffocating.  I just couldn't catch my breath.  I sat in front of a fan coughing and trying to breathe.  Since then I still continue to feel like I can't take a deep breath, I'm having heart palpitations, and at times have what I think are chest pains.  Sometimes they're sharp and sometimes it just feels like someone is squeezing my chest.  Also for the last few days when I breathe, it sounds like I have bubbles when breathing.  What could these symptoms mean and should I go to the ED tonight or wait to see my family doctor tomorrow?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Since you are active smoker, we must rule out heart diseases like Coronary artery disease (CAD) and lung disease like bronchitis in your case for your symptoms .

Clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test) for the diagnosis of bronchitis.

The swelling you are talking about is mostly due to costochondritis because it is tender on touch. But better to get done ultrasound examination of chest and local part to rule out other causes of swelling like abscess, nodule, mass etc. If ultrasound is normal then no need to worry much for this swelling. Ask your husband to do following things for 1 week and swelling will subside. 1. Avoid movements causing pain. 2. Avoid bad postures in sleep. 3. Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 4. Apply warm water pad on swelling area. 5. Take combination of painkiller and anti inflammatory drugs. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

Is there any other illness that will also have this symptoms?","Doctor":"Hi,I carefully passed through your question and would explain that your complaints could be related to an airway infection. Fever is a strong argument in favor of this diagnosis. There are not many disorders that can cause this clinical scenario. Other possible diagnosis would be pericarditis, pleuritis and myocarditis. All these are inflammatory or infectious disorders. Coming to this point, I would recommend performing some tests to investigate for the possible underlying causes: - a chest X ray study and respiratory function tests- a resting ECG and a cardiac ultrasound- some blood lab tests (complete blood count, PCR, ESR, blood electrolytes, kidney and liver function tests). You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. Hope I have answered your query.

We are on holiday when they want the samples, do they have to be fresh or can we hold onto them for 5 days until we return?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, fresh samples are required to know whether MAI (mycobacterium avium intracellular) infection is treated or not. So don't collect sputum sample while you are on holiday because bacilli can be dead and degenerate if kept for 2-3 days in container. So chances of false negative result is high in this. Take samples once you reach home and able to send to laboratory on the same day. This will give exact results. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

I had this strange burning feeling running up my Aorta into the back of my heart and then out into my left arm only and also under my armpit, thats when all this started.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. No acid can note affect or burn aorta. By your history and description, possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of burning chest pain, back pain etc. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in GERD. 1.  Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. 2. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Take pantoprazole tablet on empty stomach. 5. Quit smoking and Alcohol if you have these habits. 6. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in bed to prevent reflux. 7. Loose weight if you are obese. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

Post CABG (Coronary artery bypass grafting), there are 10-15 % chances of blockage in new vessels after 1 year. And this can cause such kind of chest pain. So get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test) first. If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart related chest pain. Sometimes simple musculoskeletal pain can be the cause.

I can understand your concern. At your age of 66 years, most common cause for lung mass is malignancy (cancer). You are also having chronic cough and blackish looking thing obstructing airways. All these also favour lung cancer. Confirmatory diagnosis of lung cancer is only done by histopathological examination of Biopsy tissue.

Other possible causes to consider would be a musculo-skeletal pain. The fact that the pain is triggered by pressure or palpation. I agree with your doctor on starting antibiotics. But, I would also recommend performing a chest x-ray study besides blood work. Meanwhile, I recommend taking some ibuprofen for the pain. It will help against the pain and inflammation.

Fussy spot on chest x ray is commonly seen with 1. Lung infection like tuberculosis or pneumonia 2. Old fibrotic lesions 3. Lung cyst 4. Malignant nodule.

I can understand your concern. Barbecue causes plenty of smoke exposure. So when you inhale smoke, this can be cause irritation and inflammation of the airways. This is known as bronchitis. It is not seen with all individuals but some of the exposed persons can develop. And bronchitis can cause similar shortness of breath. So in my opinion, you are mostly having bronchitis.. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only.

I can understand your concern. Phenyl is irritant to mucous membrane. So on ingestion, it is likely to damage esophageal mucosa. While ingestion, some Phenyl might have aspirated in trachea and lungs. So Phenyl ingestion is likely to damage esophageal and tracheal mucosa. Damage to esophageal mucosa causes ulceration and burning chest pain. Damage today respiratory mucosa will cause inflammation of the airways and bronchitis. This bronchitis is the likely cause for his breathing difficulty. Usually these all are self limiting in 1-2 days. Ask patient to drink plenty of fluids orally. Avoid hot and spicy food.

About your x ray report, Heterogeneous opacity means, irregular lesions and this is commonly seen with lung infection. Upper lobe lesions are common with tuberculosis. So radiologist advised to see for tuberculosis. Since you are already diagnosed case of tuberculosis, this lesions on chest x ray are mostly due to healing from tuberculosis. Trachea midline is normal. Nothing to worry about this. R/O means Rule out. Radiologist wants your primary doctor to rule out (R/O) tuberculosis in your case.

Thanks Sean","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Since your pain is associated with eating and you are also having vomiting, so possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) related symptoms is more. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause symptoms of chest pain and vomiting. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in GERD. 1. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. 2. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 3. Take pantoprazole and domperidone combination on empty stomach. 4. Quit smoking and Alcohol if you have these habits. 5. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"i was out in the rain all weekend and now i have a persistent cough. But now that i think about it I was using bleach and CLR on sunday afternoon and now i have a persistent cough that is like a sudden coughing fit and i feel like i could cough at any time. do you think it was the chemicals or being out in the rain all day?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, your cough is mostly due to bleach and CLR use. These chemicals produce Fumes. And when these Fumes go inside airways and lungs, they cause irritation and inflammation. And they inturn cause cough. So while cleaning, you might have inhaled Fumes from these cleaning chemicals which is causing you cough. Usually this kind of cough is self limiting in nature in 1-2 days. So drink plenty of fluids orally and keep your self hydrated. Do warm water gargles 5-6 times a day. Take simple antihistamine like levocetrizine. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. If you still have cough (after 2-3 days) or develop breathing difficulty then consult doctor. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi  Doctor, 2 months 5 days ago, doctor have diagnoised for pleural effusion TB.

Thanks in advance. kind regards, siva","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Your chest x ray is not improving even after anti tubercular drugs and pleural fluid aspiration. So we should rule out multi drug resistance (MDR) tb and lung cancer in your case. So better to get done ultrasound examination of chest and CT thorax to identify whether there is fluid collection or mass like lesion. If fluid is there then get done pleural fluid gene expert to rule out MDR TB. If mass is there then get done Biopsy from the lesion for the diagnosis of cancer. I don't think you will be allowed for job interviews Australia with this chest x ray. So better to consult first diagnose the cause for your chest x ray lesions and then start appropriate treatment. This may take more than 6 months also. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi Gooday.

You are also having chest pain and breathing difficulty on walking upstairs, so possibility of heart failure dye to underlying valvular heart disease is more. In severe cases, surgical correction is the only treatment. So better get done ecg and 2d echo. 2d echo will tell you about severity of the valvular heart disease.

My doc said my heart was at 30% and im only 24 years old male and im in good shape I have no idea how I got this","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, these symptoms are worrisome in your case. Your heart is working only 30%. This can cause heart failure and retention of fluid in the body. This excess fluid accumulate in the lungs and cause pulmonary edema.This is the reason for your breathlessness and other chest symptoms. So along with other drugs, you should also start diuretics and cardiac inotropic drugs. Diuretics will remove excess fluid while inotropic drugs will increase force of contraction and improve heart function. Cause if this in your case is unknown. Consult cardiologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I am also feeling fatigued, my heart is beating very fast and i've just finished my antibiotics is this normal? I've had this for over a month now but doesnt feel like it's healed much. Does this usually take this long to heal? Thank you","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. No, this is not normal. Usual time for healing in pleurisy is 2 weeks. Since you are not improving even after 30 days, better to first consult pulmonologist. You should postpone your flight because tachycardia and fatigue are suggestive of uncontrolled pleurisy in your case. So consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x ray 3. PFT (pulmonary function test). Chest x ray is needed to rule out worsening of lung infection. PFT is needed to rule out bronchitis as a cause for pleurisy. You may need higher antibiotic, inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) on the basis of these reports.

I have undergone lots of tests and they found I had bronchiectasis (possibly from whooping cough as a child) other than that no other diagnosis. I take various asthma drugs/inhalers. When I cough I produce coloured sputum (yellowy green). I have been given antibiotics and steroids several times but within days of finishing them the sputum returns to the same colour. I often feel weary and wondered if this continued production of coloured sputum would cause that?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Your continued cough, yellowish sputum are due to bronchiectesis. Bronchiectesis is permanent dilatation of airways. It is common in asthma patients after lung infection. In Dilated airways, secretions tend to collect. So these collected secretions catch up infection easily and produce recurrent cough with yellowish expectoration. Best treatment for this is identification of causative organism and starting antibiotic which are effective for those organisms. So get done sputum culture and sensitivity report. Culture will isolate the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide you about effective antibiotic treatment. Also enroll in pulmonary rehabilitation center where chest physiotherapy and deep breathing exercises are done. These are also useful in bronchiectesis and asthma. Also take anti oxidants for better outcomes. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I'm 19 years old, a college student. I've been sick for 3 weeks already. At first, I had a serve headache. I thought it was migraine. That night I had flu. For 3 days or 4 my flu is on and off. I came to see a doctor in our schedule. She prescribed some antibiotics and medication. And then the following days I started coughing and yellow greenish phlegm came out of me when I coughed. 2nd week the cough I came to see another doctor, she advised me to rest and prescribed some medications. So i stopped taking in my previous medications so I could follow the new prescription. Wednesday that week, I had myself undergo a medical examination for my practicum. So I undergo X-ray. 2 days after, the results were out and I was diagnosed I have right basal pneumonia. So i came to see the latter doctor again. Wednesday that week I weighted 47 kg, and then Sunday I weighted 45 kg. I lost 2 kg. So she advised me to be confined in the hospital and prescribed me another antibiotic and medicines, and also stresstabs -multivitamins. But I didn't get myself confined yet since the 3rd week was crucial for my studies and I have to go to my practicum. But every day after school and practicum, my body couldn't afford to stay up anymore so I just sleep as early as 8 or 9 in the evening then wake up at 7 or 8 in the morning. That was my routine for 3 days or 4. And then I was feeling better for two nights I was able to extend my day until 11pm or 12am. I have been more productive. Today I saw the doctor again she checked my weight. I'm back to 47 again. My blood pressure is 90/60 unlike last week i was low blood (i don't remember the exact measurement anymore). But my heartbeat, the doctor said, is still not normal, and now every time i cough, the right part near my stomach hurts. So I had myself Xray-ed again today, results will be out on Monday. She advised me to continue my antibiotics and other medications but she said it's okay if i don't get myself confined in the hospital. So what should i do now?","Doctor":"u are on antibiotics and several medications they may have induced gastritis or ulcer in ur stomach so when u are coughing some part of stomach may be going into chest due to that medications they may be relaxing LES also that tender mucosa into les may be creating pain for u i think take proton pump inhibitors alon with other medications"},{"Patient":"A week ago, I fell off my bike and got a bruise on the right side of my chest right around the top of my breast.

A few weeks ago I had a couple of incidents. I developed a half dollar sized discolored swelling on my left lower leg with under the skin hemorraging below it. I thought it might be lifestyle related ( I sit at a desk for 9-10 hours a day and wear somewhat restrictive short stocking.) I elevated my leg at home, took 1 hr walks mid work day and quit wearing anything restrictive. My leg returned to normal. Then I aspirated 1/2 a potassium tablet one evening and manages to cough all or most of it up. I'm slightly asthmatic and after the aspiration experienced some chest tightness. I went to the urgent care center and the Doc gave me an RX inhalor. It helped a little. That night I woke with a sharp right side chest pain, fairly hight towards the middle of my body. I went to the ER and they took a chest xray. During my 3 hours there the pain lessened and it was the doctor's opinion that it was likely unrelated to either (what I thought was) the leg clot or the aspiration.The opinion was that I had strained a mustle moving heavy things. My blood pressure runs low, around 100, however the systolic was 86 that night.The shallow cough hasn't gone away and last night my chest started hurting in the same general location again and hurts on inspiration. This morniing  it's much worse when standing, which I can't do for too long because I'm not taking in enough air and I almost passed out. Could this be mustle strain? I've never had a mustle strain in this location, although I did carry a laptop and gallon of water yesterday evening.

They are not caused by steroid injections. There are certain factors which make someone prone to develop keloids like black race, dark pigmented skin, Asian race. There's some genetic correlation too. Wounds with any foreign body, infection are more likely to heal by such abnormal scar.Treatment includes compression bandages, intralesional steroid injections & silicon occlusive dressings.Hope my answer helps you.Thank you"},{"Patient":"hi,i have been suffering from shortness of breath and numb hands,week feeling in arms and legs,knees feel shaky wen walking up any stairs,i had a car accident years ago and think nerves maybe getting pinched I also hav constant eye trouble,trouble focusing and always feel slightly dizzy,","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having viral bronchitis. Bronchitis is causing shortness of breath and viral infection is causing weakness, dizziness, shaky feeling etc. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1.

PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only.

Complete blood count (CBC) to know hemoglobin level 2. Lower GI (gastrointestinal) scopy for the search of bleeding site. If hemoglobin is very low then you might need blood transfusion and iron tablets. Also get done chest x ray to rule rule out lung related cause for breathlessness and pain.

So possibility of pneumonia is more in your case. So consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. Chest x ray 3. Sputum culture and sensitivity report. Chest x ray is needed for the diagnosis of pneumonia. Sputum culture will isolate the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide you about effective antibiotic treatment. This way we can achieve quick recovery. So don't take treatment by your own, consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have been coughing up yellow/green mucus on a daily basis since last August. Been on several antibiotics none have worked.

I can understand your concern. Unfolded aorta is an anatomical variation of thoracic aorta. Normally thoracic aorta arising fromm heart, going upwards and right side between two pulmonary veins and turn around left pulmonary vein and goes down. But in some individuals, instead of going towards right side, thoracic aorta goes straight up or left sided and then comes down. This is known as unfolding of aorta. It is not a disease. It is anatomical variation which is present due to developmental defect. It does not cause any symptoms. So it is not serious problem. So unfolding aorta is not a cause for your chest pain.

My 85 year old mother went o the emergency room last Thursday morning with shortness of breath and coughing. They admitted her because her electrolytes wee low...specifically her sodium was 120. They x-rayed her lungs and she had fluid all around them so they gave her Lasix...a couple hours later she had a seizure and stopped breathing...they were able to put her on ventilator. Tested her sodium again and it was 117. The family had her transferred to Baylor Dallas. Once there she was monitored, put on sodium drip, antibiotic iv, catheter, a heart respiration monitor until the next evening...was taken off ventilator and put on oxygen and sodium was tested again. From there they did a chest x-ray, checked her kidneys, checked her heart. Kidneys ok. Heart ok, except early congestive heart failure. Lungs had area at bottom left lobe but they didn t think anything of it or at least they said it was probably collapsed. Moved her out of ICU and into another room. Told us she could go home in a day and to follow up with a primary care giver. Let me preface this by saying my mother only has Medicare...which explains the rush. We protested on the day they said she could go home. We had no answers, she wasn t even off the oxygen, which she has never had to use before, the catheter wasn t out, she had not even gotten up out of the bed, she was very weak and her heart was going up and down. A different Doctor quickly agreed that she should not leave yet. Update a day later. The doctors had her sodium, potassium and magniesium levels stable and they started dropping immediately lower every day. We pressed for some kind of answer. She had lost 65 pounds in the last year along with muscle wasting and no energy. She has a meningeoma on her frontal left head and one on her spine by her neck. These things we already knew and so did they. Finally they came back with well she could be producing a hormone from the meningiomas that is keeping her from having the correct sodium level or it could be cancer. So we asked them... well what about the area o her lung? They had no answer. We told them we wanted to do a body scan. They said they also were considering that. They ordered a body scan. Here is the latest update...she has arterial fibulation, CT scan showed shadow on the left lung, they think it could be pneumonia...hello? we asked them that and they said no 2 days earlier . he has too much CO2 in her blood, they don t know why yet. Her pancreas has inflammation and they will need to do a more in depth study on that.

Next, a chest xray, which showed fluid in his lungs and something in his chest. A ct scan revealed the swollen lymph nodes in his neck and either a mass or swollen lymph nodes in his chest. He went to get the fluid drained off his lung. They took a gallon off and said they would take the other gallon within a week (he has an appt. Monday).

About two weeks ago I had treated an enclosed camp cabin for bed bugs with a heat treatment that involves heating the room with propane heaters to around 150 degrees. I had to routinely( every 10 minutes) for over the next hour, check the room s heat and monitor the equipment. I was entering from outside at a temperature of 30 degrees, to interior cabin temperature of 150 degrees. The following day myself and my co worker that worked with the treatment had congestion and cough. It soon developed to what I believe is to be a severe sinus infection. Is this possibly the reason for the illness both of us obtained? My co worker later told me that it happens each time he treats cabins this way. After research online about temperature fluctuations, most sources say it is unrelated to illness. Yet this was a temperature fluctuation over 100 degrees.

Yes, you are right. All your symptoms are due to inhalation of barbecue smoke. This kind of smoke can cause irritation and inflammation of the throat. And this can cause symptoms like coughing, bad taste, sore throat etc. So drink plenty of fluids orally and keep your self hydrated. Do warm water gargles 5-6 times a day.

Does this effects sexual Life as I m getting married ?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Bronchitis is inflammation of airways. And best treatment for this is inhaled treatment. Inhaled treatment reaches lungs directly, so onset of action is fast. It acts on lungs only, so systemic side effects are minimal. Hence it is better to take inhaled treatment as compare to oral treatment for bronchitis. And if untreated, this bronchitis can gradually worsen over period of time. It can cause coughing, expectoration, breathlessness on exertion, weakness etc. Sexual activity is considered as heavy exertion. So untreated bronchitis can also interfere with your sexual activity. So better to treat bronchitis by inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query.

No need to worry for major heart or lung or abdominal pathology for your symptoms. I don't think it is costochondritis because costochondritis can not cause burning and pressure kind of pain.

I can understand your concern. At your age of 75 years, 2.5 to 3 cm mass in right lung is more likely due to malignancy (cancer). Your hoarseness of voice is also due to recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement due to malignant mass in lung. So wait for FNAC (Fine needle aspiration cytology) report. This will be confirmatory for malignant mass. If it is malignant lung mass then we well have to determine staging because treats based on staging only.

I tooke ciprofoxicine for 21 days then had exrays of sinus no problems","Doctor":"Hi,Slight elevation of blood pressure in the morning is a natural phenomenon. Above our kidney lies adrenal gland. Adrenal gland secrete hormones called cortisol adrenaline and other catecholamines. These hormones are responsible for maintaining blood pressure to normal, as the level of cortisol is higher in morning, so blood pressure is higher in morning.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Rishu Saxena"},{"Patient":"I'm a bit concerned about my father (54 years old and 5'4 ). During this month, he has been telling me that he sometimes feels pain in his chest, and feels a tingling sensation in one of his arms. We took him to a cardiologist, and he said that there is no reason why he should be having pain there. He believed it was just anxiety and prescribed him with anxiety pills and something to lower his blood pressure. He also said that he had high blood pressure, but the doctor said it was normal for a person his age. My father is overweight, but it is hereditary since my father follows a strict food diet and exercises. After a week of my father's visit to the cardiologist, he did not feel the pain going away, so we went to another cardiologist. This cardiologist said the same thing as the previous one. Overall, my question is if the cardiologists are right? Isn't there more to my father's pain than anxiety.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, that cardiologist doctor was not right. Anxiety should be put forward as diagnosis in chest pain without doing any cardiac reports. Chest pain with high blood pressure in 54 years obese patient should definitely investigated thoroughly for heart diseases like coronary artery disease (CAD), angina etc.So better to consult another cardiologist and get done 1. Ecg 2. 2d echo. 3. Stress test 4. Coronary angiography (if required). He may need cardiac supportive drugs after above reports. Don't worry, he will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your father.

They are on antibiotics so should start feeling better... now my runny/stuffy nose is also combined with sinus pressure. I have been taking Ibuprofen and mucinex to help with all of that but when I cough my chest feels real tight and hurts in my sternum area even long after I am done coughing. I do not smoke. I think I have an upper respiratory infection, but what is the pain in my chest???","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should rule out post infectious bronchitis in your case. Bronchitis is inflammation of airways. It is common after viral upper respiratory tract infection. And it can cause cough, chest congestion, chest tightness, chest pain etc. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). If PFT is normal then simple musculoskeletal pain due to coughing can be the cause for your chest pain.

I am 50, female, don't smoke, I weigh about 143, and I exercise fairly hard 3 times a week. I have low blood pressure--sometimes in the 90s on top and 50's-60s on the bottom. I never feel faint or dizzy or have chest pains. When I get out of bed following this tightening, I'm not dizzy or lightheaded.  What do you think this might be?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Possibility of gastritis or GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is more likely for your chest tightness. But since you are perimenopausal female, we should first rule out heart related diseases for your chest discomfort because heart diseases are common in this age. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If both these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Gastritis and GERD can cause similar symptoms due to acid reflux. So take pantoprazole tablet on empty stomach. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep your self hydrated. Avoid stress and tension if you are having stressful life. Don't worry, you will be alright.

The pain is directly related to breathing and goes away when i get to warm air. I utilized a warm air humidifier in my room to sleep or i would wake up from this pain/ shortness of breath. i have no cold symptons other  than the chest pain but no cough, could this be asthma?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, this can be due to asthma. Asthma is allergic Airway disease. You might be allergic to cold air and on exposure it causes bronchospasm and all the symptoms of cough, breathlessness, chest tightness etc. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose asthma but it will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment of asthma is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).

By your history and description, possibility of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) more. GERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause similar symptoms. Alcohol, stress etc are risk factors for GERD and both are present in your case.

Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. 3. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. 4. Take pantoprazole tablet on empty stomach. 5. Keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. 6. Quit alcohol and smoking if you are smoker. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query.

Take combination of painkiller and muscle relaxant drug. 5. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. 6. Wear lumber belt for back support. Situated with proper back and chest support.

I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of uncontrolled stress, anxiety and depression related chest tightness and pain are more. But better to first rule out heart diseases as you are having left sided chest discomfort. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If both these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. In my opinion, you should consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You may need anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs too. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query.

I felt like I was suffocating.  It lasted about a minute or minute and a half.  I jumped out of the shower in a panic and could then breathe. My legs were shaking. I have had a panic attack in the shower before but this was different.  I had been able to breathe before.  This was the most frightening thing that has happened to me.  I did call my doctor and he felt it was anxiety. I have fibromyalgia and anxiety issues.  I also have been having  some stomach issues lately such as reflux, fullness in chest after eating, and a lot of burping.  I have a hiatal hernia. I think I am also in perimenopause.  This happened 2 days ago and still at times (when I think about it) I feel a little short of breath.  Could a hot shower cause this?  Or does it sound like asthma?  (I had no wheezing or coughing, or history of asthma)  Or anxiety? Thank you.  Sue","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. I don't think your symptoms are due to asthma or hot water shower. In my opinion, your all symptoms like breathing difficulty, shaking of legs, burping, belching, reflux etc are due to worsening stress, anxiety and panic disorder. Your perimenopausal age is also contributing to all these because in this age females are prone for hormonal imbalance and psychological issues.. So in my opinion, you should consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Also get done hormone levels and if imbalance is there then start hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm.

Only painkiller drugs are not always beneficial in costochondritis for symptomatic relief. You need to worry follow certain lifestyle modifications for this.

These happen for seemingly no reason and somewhat frequently. Also, during exercise I have breathing difficulties that come with high pitched sounds. What can this be caused by?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of bronchitis (inflammation of airways) is more. And the high pitch sound you are talking about is mostly due to wheezing which is again very common in bronchitis.. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system2. PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment is based on severity only. You will improve with inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).

I can understand your concern. That loud sound while swallowing is mostly due to burping and belching office gas from the stomach. This is normal and can be seen in gastritis. But more important thing than this sound is blood in stool. This is known as dysentery and most common cause for this is intestinal infection. Other causes anal piles, anal fissures. Gastric ulcers etc. So better to consult gastroenterologist and get done 1. Upper GI scopy for gastritis and gastric ulcer 2. Anal and rectal examination for piles and fissures.

Opaque spot on chest x ray is commonly due to lung infection like pneumonia or tuberculosis and lung cancer. Since patient is young, no need to worry for lung cancer.

Thanks","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Blue baby syndrome is commonly seen with cynotic heart diseases. So in my opinion, we should should first rule out heart diseases in your case. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes, uncontrolled stress and anxiety can also also cause similar symptoms. So consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm.

I have gone through the x ray report you have mentioned. This x ray report is suggestive of reactivation of tuberculosis. You are having primary tb complex in childhood. This can cause reactivation of tuberculosis in later part of life. Reticulonodular densities with mottled appearance is characteristic of early tb infection. Absence of symptoms can not rule out tuberculosis in you. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. CT thorax 2. Bronchoscopy and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis. CT scan is more informative than chest x ray in evaluation of such densities. Bronchoscopy and BAL analysis will confirm tuberculosis. You will need anti tubercular drugs.

I can understand your concern. No need to worry for heart diseases as you are too young (22 years) and having normal ecg recently. In my opinion, you are mostly having stress and anxiety related GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) because you are having chest pain and burping immediately after  eating.

Yes, you are right, pneumonia can not cause bilateral hearing loss. Some antibiotics can cause damage to inner ears and cause hearing loss. Since your hearing loss is started after taking antibiotic, better to immediately colour doctor and discuss about stopping this drug. Also get done audiogram to know the severity of hearing loss.

You are having right middle lobectomy, means your middle lobe of right lung has been removed. After such debulking surgery, there is empty space remained in the chest cavity. This empty space is gradually obliterated by hyperinflation of other lobes (upper and lower lobes). This process takes almost 6-8 months.

Your x ray reports are mostly due to old, fibrotic densities. You might be having lung infection like (pneumonia or tuberculosis) in the past and now after healing it is showing old densities. Since these are old, healed lesions, you will not show any symptoms like cough, expectoration. So in my opinion, if you want to clear medical examination then get done CT thorax and bronchoscopy. CT scan is more reliable for old densities as compare to chest x ray. Bronchoscopy is more appropriate to rule out active lung infection.

I had pneumonia in February last year(2013) where I was hospitalised. I won t get into details of what happened there but I started experiencing chest pain when I was discharged. I went to my gp who didn t believe me and after a few weeks said to my face you re lying . I didn t go back. In April we did two very fast moves (in three days, and the second move was to a different country) and I was given a new gp. He was more willing to help me but was stuck as in he couldn t figure out what was wrong with me. We tried a lot of different painkillers, a lot of them knocked me out for a few hours and then I was still in the same amount of pain. Months passed and the pain increased. My doctor put me down as chronic in May. I went home to visit my family in my home country during the summer where I got even worse and ended up going to the doctor I saw before moving to live with my husband. He diagnosed me with Tietze s Syndrome and started me on Prednisolone 40 mg that I were to decrease every week by ten mg until I was down to zero. It worked like a miracle and I was feeling so much better! I went back home and informed my gp of what happened and he accepted the diagnose but kept calling it costochondritis instead, I realised later that there wasn t that much of a difference in between the diagnoses, but kept me on the treatment I was on. Then catastrophe struck (in my opinion) and I was up all night vomiting. An ambulance was called and the crew gave me morphine to deal with the pain. At this point I was crying almost nonstop and kept speaking my first language rather than English. My pain didn t decrease so they gave me another dose, then another s in the bus as we were heading to the hospital and then another one when I was taken in to hospital. The doctors there put me nil on mouth for 24 hours. We (my husband and I) asked for a translator but was not provided one. The next day in hospital I passed out from the pain and when I came to a staff member, I don t know if he was nurse or otherwise, was shouting at me for not answering when he called and pressed on my chest. I was screaming in pain and when a doctor finally came she eventually put me back on Prednisolone. But 1mg. The third day in the afternoon I had been moved for the third time and I had had enough. So I put my foot down and demanded that they provide me of the translator that I had asked for when I came in, phone my mother and phone my doctor in my home country. They replied by discharging me thirty minutes later and put me back on the dose of Prednisolone that I had been on when I went in along with some extra painkillers. It didn t take a week for me to realise that the effect of my treatment wasn t the same as when I had initially been given it. It took a few months before things got kick started for me and I was referred on to the pain clinic. Then Christmas came and I had a mental breakdown due to social events that I d rather not go through and I spent the entire Christmas holidays and New Years unable to deal with more than three people in a room before having a fast oncoming panic attack. The pain clinic decided to give me injections which I received only a month and a half after seeing the consultant. I was now in March of this year (2014). The treatment s effect was almost instantaneous and I was able to get out of bed on my own for the first time in over 6 months. We re now in May and I ve been granted a second treatment but have to wait until September for it. I have had a few bad days since the treatment, instead of constantly bad days which is good in my opinion, and unfortunately due to a hospital visit two weeks ago I ve had near constant high pain again. The hospital visit was due to an asthma attack which got my costochondritis to flare up again. I was thankfully discharged the same day and was asked to take it easy. A week ago on Monday my husband and I were asked to move out which is not only causing a lot of stress but also a lot of anxiety and I have to fight a lot so I don t fall apart every day but I don t have a lot of strength left. What I would want to do is to get back to work, be able to have some kind of sex life without having to be unable to do anything for the next three consecutive days, and get back to the weight I was before this all began.

I have no history of allergies and have no changed anything in my lifestyle or environment.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Hives, swelling of lips improving with benadryl (antihistamine), chest pain etc are more suggestive of allergy and asthma. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done 1. Clinical examination of respiratory system 2. PFT (pulmonary function test). PFT will not only diagnose asthma but it will also tell you about severity of the disease. And treatment is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilator and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Combination of antihistamine (levocetrizine or fexofenadine) and anti allergic (montelukast) is also beneficial in your case. Don't worry, you will be alright.

He said that it was the reason for my being tired all the time and feeling bloated etc.   I am a bit worried.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Altered echotexture and small size of liver are suggestive of liver cirrhosis. It is one kind of disease in which liver start loosing it's functions. Liver is having synthetic functions like synthesis of all nutrients, immunoglobulins, hemoglobin, protein etc. So in cirrhosis, patient feels weakness, tiredness because liver is noted producing these essential substances. Most common cause for this cirrhosis of liver is alcohol ingestion. So if you are alcoholic then you should definitely quit it. Other causes are primary billiary cirrhosis, cholangitic cirrhosis, idiopathic etc. So for confirmation, liver Biopsy is needed. So consult gastroenterologist and discuss all these.

I am on citalopram for panics attacks that had started just over a year ago.But when I have a heart palpitations its like it misses a beat and then the next one is a huge beat, is this something to worry about or what should I do?Also pretty much any pain I feel in around my jaw/arm or chest or nearly anywhere really scares me just because I fear its something to do with my heart.","Doctor":"Hello, I would explain that the skipped heartbeats could be related to anxiety. Nevertheless, I would recommend performing an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring in order to examine your heart rhythm trends through the day and exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia. It is also advisable performing some blood lab tests: complete blood count for anemia, thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction, blood electrolytes for possible electrolyte imbalance. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

He has had 4 stints put in his heart and we was told he had heart disease and that half his heart tissue is dead. They are now talking of putting a defribulator in his chest. How long is he going to be around? How is the defibulator gonna work. My husband is not a healthy eater, he is a drinker and does many drugs. (We are separated but I still worry about him)","Doctor":"Hi,Life expectancy depends upon his functioning of the heart, if heart function is OK like 25 to 30% then can have good life expectancy provided he is on proper medicine. I think from he had episodes of ventricular tachycardia and for that purpose they are planning to defibrillator, if yes then I think it should be because it's life saving measure. Also he should at least now have healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly. Regular exercises like brisk walking at least 30 minutes a day and 5 days a week. Eat lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, fish once or twice a week, and avoid meat. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. There shouldn't be abdominal fat deposition or obesity.Hope I have answered your query.

I can understand your concern. Yes, stress and anxiety are likely causes for tachycardia (rapid pulse rate), left sided chest pain and high blood pressure. But better to first rule out heart diseases as all these symptoms are commonly seen with heart diseases. So first get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test). If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm.
