Best time for pregnancy is between 19-35 yrs. Let me just explain - A lady has highest level of eggs ( around 7 million eggs) when in your mother's womb at 5th month. At birth lady has only around 4-5 lakhs eggs, At adolescence has around 1 lakh eggs , you will ovulate around 400-450 times in lifetime. In the race for ovulation every month healthiest eggs will rupture first & by age of 35 yrs healthiest of eggs will get over. At 40 yrs age most of the healthy eggs will get over. Chances of pregnancy is not zero after 40yrs age , but is reduced. Don't get disheartened , oldest mother's age is 45 yrs. The reason for reduced periods bleeding may be reduced hormones from the eggs. You can find the number of eggs in ovaries by checking Serum AMH level . This test can tell you the quantity of eggs , not quality.At this age you can think of IVF / ICSI. Do try other methods , if not successful take an earlier  early decision for IVF. But even if you don't have good number of eggs, you have to go for Donor eggs. Then the embryos will be of age of donor. So irrespective of your age , you can keep having babies till the embryos get over. Donor will be known to you or not known. She will receive all the injections, once eggs are ready , they are taken out under scan guidance & then she is free to go.Your husband's sperms are taken the same day & embryos are made in lab by embryologist. They will be kept into your uterus on right timeHope I have clarified all your queries, do write back if any further queriesAll the bestDr.Balakrishnan"},{"Patient":"I have a rash on my arms every morning that itches all day long but the rash somewhat disappears by mid morning.

Endometriosis is a progressive condition. Every month when you have periods , little blood will enter the abdomen through tube. This will cause collection of blood around uterus &  causing adhesions , this can lead to block in tubes & prevent egg from coming out of ovaries. So the treatment is to stop the periods , The best method to do that is have Pregnancy !!!. 10 months of no periods will resolve endometriosis. Don't worry about the lesion on cervix , picture was mostly of an erosion on cervix , which is normally seen on any sexually active lady's cervix. Do check if any of these investigations is missing , which could be a hindrance to your pregnancy. Husband- Semen analysis at least 2-  done 4 weeks apart preferably in an infertility center ( examination done by andrologist), Blood sugarsWife - Blood Sugars, Thyroid profile Ultrasound scans to evaluate Uterus , Ovaries & adnexa          Confirm tubal patency- most important- Tube is the connection           between uterus & ovaries( the bridge where sperm meets the egg &           forms a baby) this is size of hair follicle & cannot be seen on scans.           So check with HSG( Xray with dye), or SSG ( Scan with dye) or           LaparoscopyIf all this done & found normal , nothing can stop a pregnancy with God's willOnly advise would be never delay pregnancy & once you deliver , never delay the second pregnancy. You can have as many pregnancy as you want, don't give a big gap between pregnanciesAll the best, do write back if any more queriesAll the bestDr.Balakrishnan"},{"Patient":"Hi a couple months ago I noticed an inch rash between my legs and I started treating the rash since it started to get larger.

Both these conditions are usually itchy therefore I would also suggest adding an OTC oral antihistamine e,g cetrizine 10mg tablet for symptomatic relief from itching. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"I Have this rash on my stomach its mostly righ above and around my belly button. I thought I mite have got scabies because my boyfriend caught it from work And I know it every contagious but I went into walkin clinic and the doctor there told me it wasnt it was just some bacterial affection and that scabies wont be on the stomach and just gave me hidiclens but it keeps spreading up and around my stomach so my question is do you think I should have another doctor look at it and can scabies be on the stomach?","Doctor":"Hi, I too think that it is not scabies. Perhaps it is a fungal infection. A fungal infection extends outwards and is dry, scaly as well itchy with a red patch. Body folds like axilla, groin, umbilicus are common sites for a fungal infection as moisture, occlusion and warmth favor growth of the fungus. I suggest you try an OTC topical antifungal e.g Clotrimazole 1% cream or Ketoconazole 2% cream or Miconazole Nitrate 2% cream, twice daily for a few days.  In addition, I suggest you take an oral antihistamine e.g Tab Cetirizine once a day for symptomatic relief from itching. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if you need any more assistance."},{"Patient":"I am female, 20 years old, single and never had any sexual contact with anyone. But I feel worried because my genital area is now reddish. It started when I had my menstruation last week. I thought it was just a rash caused by my sanitary pads (because I had them before and it went away after my period) but now it didn t. I noticed that my butt cheeks also have this redness and scaly-like skin texture. I also had this thick and white discharge. I m afraid to go to a gynecologist and very much afraid to know that I have a disease. Please help me to treat this because sooner or later I m going to have a medical/laboratory examination for a job. Thank you very much.","Doctor":"Hi, You seem to have a fungal infection. Moisture from occlusion, warmth and humid weather favor the growth of the fungus. In addition, you seem to have a candida vaginitis which is responsible for the thick vaginal discharge. I suggest you take an oral antifungal e.g tablet Fluconazole or Itraconazole for 2- 4 week. This would take care of both cutaneous as well as vaginal fungal infection. In addition, I suggest you apply an OTC topical antifungal e.g Clotrimazole 1% cream or Ketoconazole 2% cream, for the skin involvement. twice daily for 2-4 weeks. You may as well keep a Clotrimazole pessary in the vaginal canal every night for a few days. Since fungal infection and candida vaginitis are usually itchy therefore I suggest you to also take an OTC antihistamine e.g Tab Cetirizine for relief from itching. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if you need any more assistance."},{"Patient":"I am a 28 year old female and have developed what me and my husband assumed were chigger bites a week ago. I have never had chigger bites and the itching was and still is constant and driving me insane. I ve tried benadryl and calamine and hydrocortisone and triamcanilone (sp? .5% ointment. Nothing is making them better I ve actually developed a few more spots. I tried Epsom salt baths and oatmeal baths with no relief and the bites especially the ones on back of my thigh close to butt has spread into a red scaly rash that itches worse than before. I have no idea what this is! I can send pictures if needed. They are on my thigh and legs and ankles and a few o my arms.","Doctor":"Hi, Perhaps you have papular urticaria. It is a hypersensitivity reaction to insect bites and usually happens on exposed sites like legs and arms. It is extremely itch. Another possibility is that it could be prurigo simplex which is mostly idiopathic but a few patients may have prurigo secondary to underlying atopy. I suggest you to apply a topical steroid and antibiotic combination ointment e.g. Fluticasone Propionate 0.05% and Mupirocin 2% ointment, for a few days. In addition I suggest you to take an oral antihistamine e.g. Tab Cetirizine for symptomatic relief from itching. Hope I have answered your query.

It provides relief but doesn t heal the damaged skin. The skin has permanently turned darker. Please suggest what else i can use to get rid of this infection. I researched about it. I think it s tinea cruris.","Doctor":"Hi, Yes, you do seem to have tinea cruris which is a fungal infection of the groin and perineal region. The cream you have been using contains a potent topical steroid i.e Clobetasol Propionate, which may provide temporary relief but in the long run, it would favor the growth of the fungus. In addition, it may cause additional side effects like skin thinning, striae etc. I advise you to discontinue it. I would rather suggest you to take an oral antifungal e.g Fluconazole or Itraconazole for a few weeks. In addition, I suggest you apply a plain antifungal e.g Luliconazole 1% or Sertaconazole 2% cream for a few weeks. Since fungal infection is usually itchy, I suggest you also take an oral antihistamine e.g Tab Cetirizine once a day for symptomatic relief from itching. Hope I have answered your query.

Immediately after the nuclear solution was placed in my veins, I felt very hot, I got home and notice a rash above my belly button. I made a Doctor s appointment and told my Doctor how I was feeling. She told me that, it couldn t happen from that test. I made three additional appointments. Still, they would not accept that for the cause of my rash, which now covered my entire body, including my scalp again, I was told that the rashwas not caused from the Stress Test, I felt that my Doctor was not listening, so I made three ER visits, and my condition became worst. Now, my skin from my hands and feet, began to completely peel, which is causing great pain. This is still going on and it caused my hair to fall out, I was treated to a treatment for Scabies. Which, I did not have. I was Hospitalized for a week and now I am entering the 4th month. Have you ever encounter this kind of reaction from a Nuclear Test before? Thank You, Rosemary B have.","Doctor":"Hi, Higher doses of radiation therapy can lead to a condition called radiation dermatitis.

Now what i have to do. i am very fear to operation. is their any suggestion without operation. pls help me, what can i do for the best and early child birth.","Doctor":"Hi , How do you do ?Let me give you the positive part, you are still 31 yrs, till 35 yrs every lady has good chance of pregnancy. If your periods are irregular , it means you are not ovulating every month on time. This could be due to Overweight - Your weight has to be Weight(in Kgs)= Height (in cms)-100eg- If height 160cms, 160-100= 60-65 kg is expected weight.Once you reduce weight to normal range, you won't need any medicine to get periods or to get pregnant & pregnancy will be healthy. To reduce weight -NO FASTING, No junk food/ fast foods/ red meat, reduce snacks in between mealsHave low calories food, high proteinsRegular exercise, aerobics , yoga, brisk walkingtry to reduce 2-4 kgs / month. Don't hurry on weight reduction, it will be difficult to maintain. As soon as you reduce atleast 5 kgs , you will see changes.Even if you are in normal weight range , try this schedule, it will help.Other possibility is Abnormal Thyroid profile or Serum Prolactin level. This can be corrected by medications.Any treatment for pregnancy needs correction of these problems as a pre-requisiteTube is the bridge between uterus & ovaries , where the egg meets the sperms & baby is formed, from here the embryo moves to the uterus. If this is blocked 1. Open or by Laparoscopically clear the block2. As you want to avoid the surgery, only option is IVF / ICSI.Here you will be given hormone injections to stimulate more eggs. Once they are ready they are pulled out of body under scan guidance. The same day husband's semen is collected & each egg is injected with one sperm. This forms in the embryo or baby in the lab. Once the embryo is of right size, 1 or 2 embryo are kept back into the uterus . Remaining embryos are kept frozen in your name. It is not by surgery, just like a scan. After delivery of baby, you can have next baby with those frozen embryo.You can keep having baby till the embryos get over. Age of embryos will be your present age. Embryo's age will not increase with your age. So you can have pregnancy irrespective of your ageHope I have clarified your queries  , do write back if any more queriesAll the bestDr.Balakrishnan"},{"Patient":"I have a rash on the inside of my buttock near the anal region and it s been about a week since it started, it now burns when I urinate and the urine touches the rash, on occasion when I wipe, I see small blood spots from where I feel the rash, I ve tried cremes and at first I would just keep it clean and dry, but that never seemed to work either, now it s become near unbearable to walk or even sit, please help me, I really want to get rid of whatever this is","Doctor":"Hi, You could be suffering from a condition called Intertrigo.

Let me start by assuring you that if you have only the inactive pills chances of pregnancy is nearly zero The active pills have the hormones that suppress the ovulation & get your periods on time. The inactive or dummy pills are only to remind you when you have to take the next packet. So If you have missed the inactive pills don't worry, neither your periods will get altered ,nor will you get pregnant. But this cannot be said if you miss any of the hormone or active pills. If you miss the hormone pills you better have emergency contraceptives. These secretions may occur even in normal periods .

I am taking Cetirizine tab as well and sometimes i combined it with Dexamethasone tab, just to ease the rashes... what is this skin infection that i have now??

It favors sites like inner thighs, groin and other body folds like axilla, sub mammary folds etc as patches and rings with redness, scaling and darkening of skin.

I m currently getting laser for Rosecea. The desonide is no longer eliminating these red rashes I get so my Dermatologist gave me Elidel and cloderm for it. I have been reading about both, and side effects including cancer was mentioned. I was skeptical to take them. I really was curious what you think about these creams and in general, thx","Doctor":"Hi, Well, both these creams or ointments advised to you will definitely help in reducing rashes and redness. As far as side effects are concerned it is not always seen by everyone and is just a list that is given on the internet from a mild to the severe outcome and not everything happens to everyone.

Please help me to answer this question. Thanks With Regards Sabyasachi Chatterjee Ph-0000 YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hi , How are you doing ?These medicines are to control the psychiatric problems. All three drugs do cause defects in the newly formed baby, these defects are usually multiple & not correctable. Carbamazepine can cause - Spina bifida, craniofacial defects, cardiovascular malformations, hypospadias, and anomalies involving various body systems. But instead of this combination, if used alone, this can be saferLithium can cause - heart defect, sudden death of baby etc better avoided in pregnancyArip MT is contraindicated in pregnancy, only animal studies are available.So if I may advise, kindly consult your Neurologist & change over to less toxic drugs , reduce the dosage gradually under supervision & if possible switch to single drug. Once all stabilized pregnancy will be okay. This can avoid all the unnecessary anxiety with the medicines with known teratogenicity.

There could be many reasons for the rash: psoriasis/eczema/allergy/fungal infection to name a few. You can start an oral anti allergic medication (antihistamine) taken twice a day till the itch settles. Subsequently, you could also start applying a mild steroidal cream which will help settle the itching sensation of the rash. Mind you, if the rash is due to fungal infection, the steroidal cream should be avoided. Also make sure you moisturise the body well, as it can reduce the itch slightly.

Jock itch is an infection of the groin region and occurs commonly due to fungal infection while can also be due to bacterial infection..As the area of the crease in the groin region is more prone to accumulation of moisture and sweat it leads to maintaining a favourable environment for bacterial and fungal overgrowth..Other cause can be obesity, poor immunity,excessive workout leading to sweating and friction..I would suggest you to wash the area with warm water and mild soap and pat dry..Apply a combination of antifungal and steroid ointment..Avoid using any harsh chemical containing detergents and also avoid using any bleaches and fabric softeners..You should wear loose fitting and cotton undergarments..You can apply a coat of zinc oxide ointment over the area as it will have a soothing and sedative effect..Make a solution of one part of vinegar and three parts of water and soak a wash cloth in it and place over the infected area.Hope I have answered your query.

But this just means poor preparation for IVF by your doctor. All you need is a good course of antibiotics & rest for few weeks.Poor follicular response is when - 1. Overaged- usually >37-40 yrs. Just have serum AMH to know how many eggs left in ovaries2. Untreated endometriosis- needs good suppression of periods for few months3. Inadequate down regulation with hormones before the IVF, to be done by doctor .Both Pelvic infection & endometriosis can cause pain in lower abdomen , back & thighs.

Clomid is Clomiphene is hormone which causes increase in hormone which makes the follicular  growth better. But it's main side effect is it will reduce the inner lining of the uterus.

Husband- Semen analysis at least 2-  done 4 weeks apart preferably in an infertility center ( examination done by andrologist), Blood sugarsWife - Blood Sugars, Thyroid profile Ultrasound scans to evaluate Uterus , Ovaries & adnexa          Confirm tubal patency- most important- Tube is the connection           between uterus & ovaries( the bridge where sperm meets the egg &           forms a baby) this is size of hair follicle & cannot be seen on scans.           If all this done & found normal , nothing can stop a pregnancy with              God's willDon't worry about those follicle not growing , I don't think that IUI cannot be considered. Proper IUI is start Ovulation Induction medicines along with Hormone injections for the follicle to grow daily or atleast on alternate days. When the follicle is of right side , give injection for it to rupture & when it does , do IUI. I simulate it to , if a seed is sown , you need to water it every day , not just once in a while. So that's the reason the follicles didn't grow. If rightly stimulated with correct dose , they will rupture on time. May be if you complete the investigations & do a PROPER IUI , you shouls get a positive resultHope I have clarified your queries All the best.Dr.Balakrishnan"},{"Patient":"iv been suffering from hives over 2 yrs. they say its because I have hoshimoto disease. but I believe theres something triggering them late at night when my body temp rises they seem to onset no food allerigies I had a biopsy and was told it was chronic urticara im miserable nothing seems to help them","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.

So, laparoscopy sometimes can tell you the problem which HSG and ultrasound can't detect. If you don't want laparoscopy to be done, you can go for IUI. In this, uou will be given some medicines for growth of your follicles and track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound.  When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  IUI will be done the next day.  Progesterone will be happy for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 cycles.  If it doesn't work then you can go for laparoscopy or straight away to IVF.  Hope I have answered your question.

I started using E45 but it was getting worse and it looked as if the moisturising cream was encouraging the rash to expand.  It felt more like fungus and my arms were particularly bad and felt as if I have been beaten up and it was very painful.  I did some research and found bleach bath twice a week might help and I did 3 bleach bath in two weeks and miraculously the redness and pain were gone.  I have recently seen my GP who is also a dermatologist  and has prescribed Betnovate cream and Epaderm for my eczema but didn't tell me how to apply them.  Can I apply Epaderm straight after I've applied Betnovate?","Doctor":"Hi, there are several reasons for your skin rash: It could well be a fungus or a yeast infection, especially since you mentioned it got better after the bleach baths. This should be diagnosed before applying corticoid creams like the Betnovate. If it is an infection, the steroid cream will make it look better, but actually make it spread faster. My recommendation would be to find out the cause first and then treat it with either an antifungal/anti-yeast cream or a steroid cream. I personally am not a big fan of combinations unless absolutely necessary. I hope this answer helps...

I don t shave. It just got worse and the pain is unbearable. My whole bedsheets got soaked with this smelly watery bloody pus stuff last night too","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.You have probably have developed an infection of hair follicles in the area, called folliculitis. It is may be due to excessive sweating or moisture, friction against undergarments or clothes, etc., which caused the follicles to be prone to infection even without shaving. You may have tiny pustules and boils at the hair base, discharge as you mentioned, pain, swollen lymph nodes, and fever.We also must rule out a probable fungal infection in the area with secondary infection. There may have been in contact with someone who has an infection, even through infected towels, clothing, and toiletries. It could also have started as an allergy to hygiene products/cosmetics/sanitary napkins/synthetic clothing, etc., leading to rashes with discharge. Try to narrow down on the possible cause.You will need to apply an antibiotic cream like Fusidin twice daily after cleaning the area gently with water. Do not rub or itch. No powders for now. Oral antibiotic course such as Augmentin is advised. In case of allergy and itching, you can take an antihistamine like Levocet. Pain can be helped by an Ibuprofen orally.I would advise you to visit the dermatologist if it does not show signs of healing in 2 to 3 days. Exact diagnosis needs to be made to treat a fungal infection or allergy differently. Testing of the pus will also help to find out infecting bacteria and treat you with best antibiotic medication for your infection. Anything that you suspect may have caused allergy must be avoided.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Dinah Levillard"},{"Patient":"I have a rash or brusing on my arm between the wrist and elbow. It occurs most often when my arms are covered with long sleeves, like a jacket or sweater, If I wear a watch or any metal, it will also happen if I carry any item such as a bag containing any item over 8 oz","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.From your description of your rash it could be one of these possibilities:Allergy or eczema, which usually appears in such areas, especially, if you have a prior history of any allergies. It could be aggravated by contact with the synthetic/woolen fabric or any metallic object, most commonly containing nickel such as watches and jewelry. This is allergic contact dermatitis. Without treatment it may persist and aggravate each time you come in contact with certain items.Sweat/certain cosmetics/strong soaps can also make it worse. The strap of the bag may be causing a reaction rather than the weight. The bag rubbing on the rash may also aggravate it.Also, rule out similar rashes elsewhere on the body and in family members to check for fungal infections, etc.First step is to note down exactly all the causes that give you a rash and avoid them. Once you are allergic to something, repeated exposure will cause repeated and worse rashes.Check with a dermatologist to confirm and certain blood and skin tests may be done to check allergy levels and to find out allergens as well such as patch testing.Avoid direct sun/dust exposure on the area. Wear loose cotton clothing. Use a mild nonfragranced soap and always moisturize with a hypoallergenic product such as Cetaphil.For the rash apply Calamine lotion 2 to 3 times a day when itchy. During a recurrence of new rashes or severe rash apply a steroid-based cream like Mometasone for 5 to 7 days till it heals. Do not use for a prolonged period, more than 2 weeks.Antihistamines like Levocet or Benadryl can be taken till itching subsides.Keep in mind that it is recurrent if exposed to allergic items and will take a while to heal. Don’t scratch the area. Visit a dermatologist for follow-up or if it persists.I have answered your query.

Sometimes this two conditions can present together, that\`s why I also recommend you use a topical OTC corticosteroid once a day for 1-2 weeks. you can also mix the two medications together.

Clexane as well as warfarin, does have a possibility of causing irritation and rashes at the injection sites. It can also be an effect of the drug itself, increasing the bleeding and chances of swelling. The reaction can also be due to antiseptic or cleansing agents used at the site before injection, as it did not appear immediately.It may be an irritant dermatitis.In any case, you may clean it with clean water and apply a calamine lotion if there is only itching. If it is very inflammed, you may need to apply a mild steroid like mometasone cream for a few days to bring it down. take an antihistamine for the itching.Do consult your surgeon before starting any new medication to confirm whether it is alright. An allergic rash does tend to go away, but if it is inflammed there is a chance of infection, so it is better to treat it. If the rashes are spreading, or new ones are appearing, keep a check on what triggers it to happen as well.hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi I went to the doctor yesterday to show him a rash on the back of my hands, but he didn't see the white lines and circles that show up and then go away. The redness also goes away then comes back and my feet and palms itch. The circles and lines look really scary, like crop circles or something","Doctor":"Hi. Welcome to HCMfrom what you described you seem to be having allergic reactions causing wheals or hives. Is this the first episode or do you have a previous history of allergies in the past. Try and recall any possible cause of the rash. Any history of outdoor activity, exposure to plants, dust, animals, chemicals, any medication , any particular food. Anything you have been allergic to in the past?Once you can narrow down the possible factor, you will have to avoid it or you will keep having similar reactions. Seeing circles and lines, either white or reddish wherever you apply pressure, or scratch, is called dermographism and is a sign of sensitivity and high allergy levels in blood. So do consult a doctor regarding tests for the blood levels of eosinophils, serum IgE etc, which can show allergy. Skin tests can also be done to check specific reactions.Very rarely this reaction can happen even in normal skin.Apply a menthol/calamine lotion for the itching, 2-3 times a day. Start an antihistamine daily for 5-7 days after consulting the dermatologist. They may advise a longer course after seeing your blood work. This can help bring the allergy levels in control.If it is severe or persistent, you may be advised a cortisone shot in the ER.Use a mild soap for washing, avoid harsh chemicals. In case you have severe swelling, puffiness of face, lips, difficulty breathing, etc go to the ER immediately.Hope this helps guide you. Try to see the doctor as soon as the rashes appear."},{"Patient":"My daughter was treated with hives last night having had a shot of predizilone and benadryl.

What should I do to ensure that this rash does not return or should we keep treating it with benadryl? Should we take her back to urgent care for an allergy test?","Doctor":"hello. welcome to HCMYour daughter seems to have developed an allergic reaction to something which she came in contact with at night. Was this the first such reaction or has she had similar allergies in the past?It is important to find out what caused the allergy, as re-exposure to it will cause the hives and itching again.Was there any contact with dust, pollen, outdoor plants, insects, pets, any possible bed bugs, mites, or new medication? Any history of eating out, especially seafood, nuts,etc? Did anyone else experience similar symptoms?The benadryl can be continued for a few days until the symptoms subside. prednisolone may be needed if there is a severe outbreak of rashes. In case of severe symptoms like breathlesness, puffiness of face, lips, go to the ER immediately.Apply calamine lotion over the itchy skin.These are just temporary symptomatic treatments. To prevent further attacks, the trigger cause needs to be found. If this happens often, keep a note of any possible factors, as I mentioned, that could be the trigger each time.Antihistamine needs to be continued till the symptoms subside completely, maybe 3-5 days.Visit the dermatologist if they are persistent even on treatment. Your doctor may suggest blood tests if needed. Skin tests for allergy are generally not done during an active episode of hives. A later date may be given to you.You may be referred to an allergy specialist.For now, continue treatment as advised and observe. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I have what appears to be a rash.

Usually the action of rubbing off an insect when it bites, can cause a line like rash. Also note if you have any metallic or allergic object that has been in contact with your skin. Rule out causes like plants, outdoor activity, bed bugs, pets , any cosmetic application or procedure, food allergies,etc.An allergy should generally subside with an application of mild cortisone cream and antihistamine tablets.Note if any family members or contacts have similar complaints.If the rash spreads inspite of this, or you develop new symptoms, do consult a dermatologist to diagnose exactly and change the treatment as required.hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Hi, we have been trying for a baby for almost 12 months now - and each month I am noticing changes or signs in my body that could be pregnancy - but I end up getting my period.

Summer/spring allergies are fairly common due to more dust, pollen in the air, as well as sun. Since you are unable to narrow down the cause, I would advise you to take precautions during this season. Wear comfortable cotton clothing, covering as much skin as possible. Avoid mid day sunexposure. Always use a sunscreen.Wash hands, face when you come back from outdoor activity. Shower with warm water and apply a good moisturiser immediately after like Cetaphil DAM or an intensive moisturizer. AVoid fragrances and strong chemicals in soap, lotions.When you have active rashes try to avoid commonly allergy causing items like nuts, seafood etc.Also during rashes take an antihistamine tablet once daily like fexofenadine and apply calamine lotion over the area when irritation occurs.In case of severe redness or actively spreading rash in the summer, use a fluticasone cream for about a week over the rashes and stop. Continue the other tips advised.You can consult a dermatologist regarding certain skin allergy tests and blood tests which can point out the substances you are allergic to.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"My arm touched a wet rock at the edge of a stream and started burning and itching.

Should I be worried? Was there some unseen organism that caused this?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCMYou seem to have developed an allergic reaction to moss/lichen or some similar substance present on the rock. The rash developed as your skin reacted to it.I would advise you to clean the area with soap. Do not rub or scratch the area. If the rash has stopped spreading or is reducing on its own, you can apply a soothing menthol or calamine lotion to calm the itching. If the rash is still active and irritating, apply a mometasone cream over the area for 3-5 days till rash goes away.Also take an antihistamine tablet once daily such as fexofenadine, levocet for 5 days.This should bring the allergy under control.In case you notice any blistering, discharge, swelling or fever or persisting rash, do consult a dermatologist who may prescribe steroids or antibiotics as required. Also if you have any breathing difficulty, wheezing, dizziness etc, visit the ER and get a cortisone shot.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Have swollen eyes, red almost burnt like patches on side of face, itching and burning/itching under my ear lopes what is this.

The causes maybe various- food items, dust, pollen , outdoor plants, any recent outdoor activity, new cosmetics or jewellery(earrings), also could be due to sun exposure which may have aggravated an allergy. Did you take any new medication?In any case keep a note of whether it is increasing and if there are any factors which cause it to increase. Does anyone around have similar complaints?Take a course of antihistamines like fexofenadine daily for a week.If the rash is severe apply a light layer of fluticasone cream at night for a week and stop. During the day you can use a soothing lotion with calamine/aloe vera for the face. Use a gentle cleanser.If it persisits inspite of treatment consult your dermatologist .

Did he have similar complaints from a very young age?It could be an allergy which increases with weather changes, dust, exposure to sun, certain plants, animals etc. Also certain foods like nuts, seafood, processed foods,etc.You will need to keep a track of when exactly the rashes come up and if there is a common cause each time.Allergies generally reduce as the child grows, but repeated exposure to the cause can make it recur often.Use a mild sunscreen when outside. When rashes appear , apply a desonide cream on the face for 5- 7 days till rash subsides, not longer.Use an antihistamine like hydroxyzine every night for atleast 10 days during episodes.To confirm you can consult a dermatologist and run tests to check allergy levels in blood, also skin tests for possible causes.

Pregnancy also causes your body to react differently to certain substances.But do try and recall if there were any factors such as outdoor activity, footwear, food intake, cosmetic application etc that could have triggered a reaction. Swelling of your feet may also cause the skin to become itchy.Also it may increase as you near the end of your pregnancy.If you have had any previous allergies, avoid those itemsApply a mometasone cream lightly over itchy areas once daily whenever itching is most. you may apply calamine or a soothing menthol lotion 2-3 times a day.

Its an allergic manifestation of skin, where an allergen leads to release of certain substances from your blood, leading to itchy skin rash and swelling over soft tissues. Its proper management requires thorough history, clinical and laboratory work-up.You may have to go for specific tests like patch test, food prick test, IgE antibody levels etc. As for treatment part, best would be the avoidance of allergen as far as possible. Try to eliminate possible triggering foods from diet. I would also advise you various anti-histaminics for long duration( atleast 3 months) with or without oral corticosteroids. For non- responding cases there are many other drugs like dapsone, cyclosporine, montelukast, omalizumab etc which can be used in certain selected cases. Hope this will help you in resolving your query.Thank you Dr Hardik Pitroda"},{"Patient":"I have just been told that the cat I was caring for had severe scabies, I developed an itchy rash in the last four days, but I also remember not feeling well and having a low temperature before the rash developed.

Firstly, i would suggest treatment of your secondary infection (if any) with oral and topical antibiotics.The key to successful treatment of scabies lies in treating everyone simultaneously in the family and others who are in close physical contact. Your doctor would prescribe oral drugs like ivermectin which will kill the parasite. You might also be advised application of permethrin 5% cream and a corticosteroid with fusidic acid cream. Apply the medicated creams exactly as advised by your doctor. Take antihistaminics as advised to relieve itching and irritation.

Thank you for writing to usI suggest a possibility of either Tinea faciei Or a Polymorphic light eruption/ PMLE..Fungal infections have a typical morphology i.e peripheral expanding, raised, red and scaly rim and central clearing.The ring may be partial or complete.PMLE may present as an eruption of red bumps or patches over sun exposed skin. The lesions  in PMLE are usually itchy but lack a characteristic ring shaped morphology of fungal infections.However, it may be difficult to diastinguish tinea from PMLE on clinical examination.Confirmation of diagnosis would require a clinical examination and may also require a lab test, if doubtful.KOH wet preparation made by scraping a small amount of scale can be examined under the microscope to look for fungal elements.Treatment would be guided by the diagnosis.Fungal infection would require topical antifungals with or without Oral antifungals whereas a light eruption would respond to sun protection along with topical steroids.An OTC oral antihistamine e.g cetrizine 10 mg once daily will provide symptomatic relief from itching.I suggest that you visit a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis as well as for the needful.Regards"},{"Patient":"I have broken out in small red, raised bumps on the back of my hands.

Thank you for writing to usThe cream that you kept on using for 4 years contains a superpotent topical steroid i.e clobetasol propionate 0.05%.This strong steroid is not recommended for face and never for such a long duration.Two weeks is the upper limit for it if in case it has to be used on face.Potent topical steroids can cause side effects like acne, skin thinning, sun sensitivity, persistent redness and telangiectasias (steroid induced rosacea), hirsutism etc on regular use.The skin problems that you experience right now are part of the side effects that I just mentioned.You skin would be sensitive and would turn red, specially in sun and would also feel dry and itchy.I suggest you to use a broad spectrum sunscreen throughout the day to protect your skin from sun.

Firstly, i would suggest treatment of your secondary infection (if any) with oral and topical antibiotics.The key to successful treatment of scabies lies in treating everyone simultaneously in the family and others who are in close physical contact. Your doctor would prescribe oral drugs like ivermectin which will kill the parasite. You might also be advised application of permethrin 5% cream and a corticosteroid with fusidic acid cream. Apply the medicated creams exactly as advised by your doctor. Take antihistaminics as advised to relieve itching and irritation.

Thank you for writing to us.It could very well be related to psoriasis. The salient features being that it is itchy at times and there is a positive history of psoriasis in your family.Moreover, history of trauma preceding the rash is significant and is a feature of psoriasis. This phenonmena is known as koebnerization.I suggest you to get it reviewed with a dermatologist.Psoriasis is fairly distinctive in appearance and classically affects extensor skin surfaces of legs e.g knee and shin.Psoriasis may involve other body sites as well and could be a clue to diagnosis. Scalp involvement with itchy scaly patches is commonly seen in psoriasis.If this turns up as psoriasis it would most likely be treated with topical potent steroid ointments with or without salicylic acid Or topical calcitriol/ calcipotriol with or without topical steroids.Topical emollients would help and you may use them frequently.Regards"},{"Patient":"For last 15 days I found some rashes and some pimple like things on the inner surface of the penis which are itching and burning.Is it a matter of concern?As advised by doctor I've taken Lynx injection and applied T-bact ointment and Bactroban ointment for last 8days and injection for last 3 days but these things are still there and still burning.

Firstly, i would suggest treatment of your secondary infection (if any) with oral and topical antibiotics.The key to successful treatment of scabies lies in treating everyone simultaneously in the family and others who are in close physical contact. Your doctor would prescribe oral drugs like ivermectin which will kill the parasite. You might also be advised application of permethrin 5% cream and a corticosteroid with fusidic acid cream. Apply the medicated creams exactly as advised by your doctor. Take antihistaminics as advised to relieve itching and irritation.

Detergents and other irritants like soaps may be an inciting cause in pompholyx.Pompholyx presents as itchy fluid filled blisters/vesicles along the sides of the fingers and toes, palms and soles. The blisters are deep, tense and feel like grains.They can increase in size and become painful, the thick skin of palms and fingers preventing them from rupturing.

Food allergies such as allergies to nuts, strawberries, citrus fruit, egg, food additives, spices, chocolate, or shellfish can cause urticaria.sometimes viral infection or contact with allergens can cause it.Calamine lotion or menthol 1% in aqueous cream can help with itching. you can increase the dose of allegra 180mg upto 4 times to control itching.hope this will help you.regards"},{"Patient":"I had a picc line removed last Saturday and now have a rash around the dressing sight that itches and will not go away.

Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicThe rash that you notice at the dressing site is most likely due to allergic contact dermatitis either to the topical antiseptic/ antibacterial that may have been part of the dressing Or it could be due to allergy to adhesive used to hold the dressing at the site.If I was the treating doctor I would suggest you to use a moderately potent topical steroid e.g fluticasone propionate 0.05% cream, twice daily, at the site of rash.Steroids are antiinflammatory, immunosuppressive in action and would take care of the allergic rash.Regarding the knot, it is most likely due to thrombophlebitis of the vein thorough which the picc line was accessed.The knot would resolve on its own in a few days. An Oral antiinflammatory e.g ibuprofen would help decrease the pain, swelling.Topically you may use a heparin sodium gel, which would act as an antithrombotic.Regards"},{"Patient":"I have a sore vulva and red burn patches on both of my inner thighs  I am not sexually active and post menopausal.

Pain on 1st few days of periods is very common and is normal in most cases. You can take pain killers for that. Hope I have answered your question.

It has gotten to be more persistent as I've gotten older. How can I treat or avoid this?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicI would keep a possibility of Intertrigo, which is inflammation of the body folds. Intertrigo clinically presents as red, moist, scaly, sore patches of skin on closely opposed body folds like axilla, groins, submammary folds etc.Closely opposing body folds trap sweat and moisture and therefore make the area prone to inflammation from rubbing against each other.Candidal infection may superimpose (Candidal Intertrigo) thereby exacerbating the inflammation (redness and soreness).You may use an OTC topical antifungal e.g clotrimazole 1% cream, twice daily in the affected folds for 4- 6weeks.If I was the treating doctor I would have also started you on oral antifungals e.g Oral Fluconazole, in addition to the topical antifungal cream for 4-6 weeksOral antifungals are faster acting and better in controlling the candidal superinfection. Oral antifungals are prescription drugs.Once the condition has improved significantly on topical and oral antifungals (usually within 2-4 weeks), you may use an antifungal dusting powder e.g clotrimazole dusting powder in the folds, twice daily, for maintenance of improvement.An antifungal dusting powder not only keep the folds dry but also inhibits the growth of fungus/yeast thus preventing recurrence/exacerbation of Intertrigo.I suggest you to present yourself for examination to a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis. Your dermatologist will tell you more about this condition and how to prevent it.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have been on clomid from second day of my period for 5 days.Then I was given injections to induce ovulation.

There may be fluid filled lesions if inflammation is intense.The lesions are commonly distributed on arms, legs and face.It is a type of hypersensitivity reaction to various triggers, most commonly Herpes Simplex Virus in people who have a history of cold sores.Treatment is with topical steroid+antibiotic cream combination and once daily Oral antihistamine e.g cetrizine 10 mg once daily.In those cases who are preceded by an episode of cold sores, a course of an antiviral is also warranted.Since the leson on your nose is also discharging yellowish fluid and had crusted lesions therefore likely it has developed secondary bacterial infection. In view of that I would also suggest a week of an oral antibacterial for a week e.g either flucloxacillin Or cephalexin.I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist in your region for a confirmatory diagnosis as well as appropriate treatment.Regards"},{"Patient":"Respected Sir/Mam,i was applyed some home made treatment in my head ach.now head ach problem solved,but i put some medicines in that places ,now that places wil be very very black,today i took melacare cream and now applyed,now night 11pm so only.this is good or bad,then this is good means how many days wil be take to remove that very dark black marks in my face.please tell me my question sir / mam...thank you...","Doctor":"HIWell come to HCMThis could be chemical injury or say burn, just do nothing till some time because this would come around to normal one for sure, no need to treat the black skin with any of skin cream or ointment, hope this information helps, have a nice day."},{"Patient":"hi i'm jovy 23 yrs old, 44kgs,5'2\\" in height. i had rashes at my back,chest and abdominal area. the rashes were somewhat elevated but no blister,reddish,very itchy. when i went for check up the dr. said it was chicken pox..its already for 5 days today yet no blister formation and no eruption occurred on the rashes. is this consider chicken pox?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicIt is unlikely that the rash is chicken Pox because as you rightly pointed it out there are no fluid filled lesions since the rash appeared.Chicken pox classically presents as fluid filled lesions distributed mainly over the trunk and face and extending on to the extremities. The lesions are initially red but usually turn into blisters within 24 hours. Scalp and oral mucosa may also be involved.These is usually no itching in chicken pox except when the lesions have dried up to form scabs.I will suggest that you visit a specialist in your region.

Seborrheic dermatitis is an itchy, scaly condition and can present as patches on the scalp as well as on face. The areas affected on the face are classically sides of nose, glabella, eyebrows, chin and moustache area.Seborrheic dermatitis is a steroids responsive condition. I usually ask my patients to use a moderately potent topical steroid e.g fluticasone propionate 0.05%cream, twice daily.Topical steroids usually bring about remarkable improvement in seborrheic dermatitis in about 2 weeks when they can be substituted with topical immunomodulator e.g tacrolimus Or Pimecrolimus.Topical immmunomodulators may be used as maintenance therapy in seborrheic dermatitis since it is a recurrent condition.I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist in your region for a confirmatory diagnosis as well as appropriate prescription.Regards"},{"Patient":"I have this white, flaky scab like thing on my knee.I don't recall getting any cuts there and I don't know what cause it.I usually don't put on lotion and I thought it was because my skin is dry..But it's just that part.What is it and how do I get rid of it?","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to healthcare magic,From your description I feel it could be psoriasis as it is a very common site.

But if you want to try 1 or 2 cycles of IUI, you can go for that. Your wife will take some medicines like clomiphene for the growth of the follicles and track the follicles growth by repeated ultrasound.  When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, injection will be given to rupture the follicles.  IUI will be done the next day.  Progesterone will be given for 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  If it doesn't work, then you can go for IVF. Your wife can take DHEA for increasing the number of follicles.  Discuss with your doctor.

Its proper management requires thorough history, clinical and laboratory work-up.You may have to go for specific tests like patch test, food prick test, IgE antibody levels etc. As for treatment part, best would be the avoidance of allergen as far as possible. Try to eliminate possible triggering foods from diet. I would also advise you various anti-histaminics for long duration( atleast 3 months) with or without oral corticosteroids. For non- responding cases there are many other drugs like dapsone, cyclosporine, montelukast, omalizumab etc which can be used in certain selected cases.

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicYour description of the rash and associated pain does seems to suggest a possibility of Shingles; more so if the rash is arranged in a stripe like pattern across one half of the body, with a sharp mid line cut off.Shingles may initially start either as rash or as raised patches and subsequently may develop fluid filled lesions. Therefore absence of fluid filled lesions from the start does'nt rule out shingles. Pain is more of a feature of herpes Zoster; irritation to the muscle rub would have been associated with a burning sensation rather than pain.I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis. A dermatologist would be better able to confirm it or rule it out.There is usually associated pain which may be shooting or stabbing in quality.If Shingles is confirmed to be shingles on visual inspection, treatment would be with an oral antiviral e.g acyclovir or valacyclovir.Associated pain also need to be managed appropriately with NSAID'sFirst step would be to visit a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosisRegards"},{"Patient":"I am a 27 year old woman that has recently in the past week developed a rash on my chest.

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicI totally agree with your dermatologist; potent steroids such as mometasone furoate should not be used for more than 2 weeks.Side effects associated with long term use of potent topical steroids include sun sensitivity, acne, skin thinning and atrophy, facial hair growth (specially troublesome in females) etcIf I was the treating dermatologist I would have asked you to use a gentle moisturizer,twice or thrice daily.Use a gentle cleanser rather than a soap or a face wash.Since the skin would be sensitive to sun; a broad spectrum sunscreen throughout the day, is also advisable.Your skin would take time to get back to normal. Once the skin gets back to normal your dermatologist may choose to prescribe you a different skin lightening cream e.g kojic acid based skin lightening cream. It is safe even when used for longer period because it is steroid free.My advice in general would be to always consult a dermatologist before using a cream and use it for the recommended duration onlyRegards"},{"Patient":"My six year old daughter has a rash in the front bend of her arm, that comes and goes over a couple of months now.

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicLichen planus (LP) has an autoimmune etiology.It presents as itchy, polygonal, violacoeus or purple coloured, flat lesions.Itching is a prominent feature in lichen planus.Sites commonly affected are wrists, abdomen (flanks), shins, flexor arms.The disease may be localized or generalized.Oral mucosa as well as nail involvement may also be seen in LP. Oral lesions may cause eating and swallowing difficult.The diagnosis of LP is mostly clinical however a skin biopsy may be ordered to confirm the clinical diagnosis.Skin biopsy in LP is performed under local anaesthesia. You would be awake but you wont feel the pain.Topical treatment of lichen planus is with prescription topical superpotent steroids e,g clobetasol propionate cream OR Halobetasol propionate cream. These alone are sufficient for limited disease.In addition to topical steroids, oral steroids and hydroxychloroquin are also used in treatment of Lichen planus, specially when it is widespread.Lichen Planus has a good prognosis, the lesions ultimately subside but there may be a few recurrences before it finally subsides.Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation may persist for months of years after LP has resolved.Regards"},{"Patient":"hi Doc!i have this rash between my thighs, very itchy and not sure what it is caused by. am told it could be heat rash but i am not considered big in any way. then i am told by family that it could be high protein allergy but i have not eaten anythig different lately. what coild be my issue and how can i treat it","Doctor":"Hello.

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicYour description of the rash and its distribution does seems to suggest that it is Shingles; it is arranged in a stripe like pattern across one half of the body, with a sharp mid line cut off.I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis. A dermatologist would be better able to confirm it or rule it out.Shingles may initially start either as red raised bumps or as raised patches and subsequently may develop fluid filled lesions. Therefore absence of fluid filled lesions from the start does'nt rule out shingles.

Try to eliminate possible triggering foods from diet. I would also advise you various anti-histaminics for long duration( atleast 3 months) with or without oral corticosteroids.

Firstly, i would suggest treatment of your secondary infection (if any) with oral and topical antibiotics.The key to successful treatment of scabies lies in treating everyone simultaneously in the family and others who are in close physical contact. Your doctor would prescribe oral drugs like ivermectin which will kill the parasite. You might also be advised application of permethrin 5% cream and a corticosteroid with fusidic acid cream. Apply the medicated creams exactly as advised by your doctor. Take antihistaminics as advised to relieve itching and irritation. Avoid sharing of clothing and toiletries and launder all you bedding and clothes in warm water.Hope this will take care of your issue.Wish you best of health.Thank youDr Hardik Pitroda"},{"Patient":"Sir, this is for my 2.4yr old daughter.

Itching is usually present.Acute Urticaria OR hives can occur due to various causes; common causes that can cause urticaria are Infections(bacterial, viral, fungal); Drugs(Pain killers/ antibiotics etc); Certain foods and food additives/preservatives, alcohol intake.An OTC oral antihistamine e.g cetrizine 10 mg once or twice daily would provide relief.It is long acting as compared to benadryl which has a short action period.A short course of an oral steroids e.g prednisolone Or a shot of injectable steroids (e.g dexamethasone) may be necessary to bring rapid control.Thereafter oral antihistamines may be continued for a week.Oral as well as injectable steroids are prescription drugs and therefore you need to visit a doctor.A doctor would  normally prescribe them if the hives are too severe and not adequately controlled on oral antihistamines.A topical soothing lotion like calamine would also help him symptomatically. take care regards"},{"Patient":"i am 41 and have recently had vulva itching which i have been treating with vaginal itch cream. about 2 weeks into this i noticed the vulva area had white peeling skin and i have a small area on my lip area that is a bit sore and was irritated after sex. i am married and have had only 1 partner in the last 25yrs. i was diagnosed with HPV as a teenager but haven't had any abnormal pap tests since then.","Doctor":"Hi,You seem to have pruritus vulvae. There may be some cause. In your case most probable cause may be candidal infection. It may be called candidal vulvovaginitis.  It is caused by candida albicans. There may be erythema, erosions,burning and itching on the vulval skin. There may be whitish discharge from vagina.You consult dermatologist or gynaecologist for firm diagnosis and treatment.You may take antifungal like ketoconazole or itraconazole. Antihistaminic like levocetirizine may be taken to relieve itch.Clotrimazole cream may be applied. You may take Sitz bath in dettol containing water.

So, you need to take some other medicines like clomiphene or some injections for growth of your follicles. Track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles. You can attempt IUI FOR 4 more months. Take progesterone for next 2 weeks after IUI. Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  Discuss with your doctor regarding this.  Hope I have answered your question.Regards Dr khushboo"},{"Patient":"Hi Dr., My son has some rash / infection near the groin.

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicYou seem to have an eczematous dermatitis on legs to the suspected plant. I could also judge this from the prescription ( Methylprednisolone Tablet ) and since you say that it scabs and when it peels off, clear fluid seeps out.Weight gain issues could be because you have been on oral steroids (Methylprednisolone) and if it has been quite some time since you started steroids then this is most likely the cause for weight gain.Steroids retain water which can manifest as pedal edema/swollen ankle and feet.My opinion is that since you have a localized eczema, therefore rather than giving oral steroids, you can be asked to just apply topical steroids, and thus avoiding the systemic side effects of oral steroids like weight gain, raised blood sugar, osteoporosis, hypertension etc.I would suggest that you seek an appointment with your dermatologist, and I am sure he would take you off oral steroids and prescribe topical steroids, instead.Regards"},{"Patient":"hi, my son 2 and half years old weight 12 kg was suffering from fever since last 2-3 days... crocin was not affecting much thus our doctor replaced the same with 6ml combiflam every 4-6hrs... now fever has subside but he has developed some skin rashes all over body. please advise","Doctor":"Hello.

Fever is high grade. The rash in Exanthema subitum subsides in another 2 -3 days, without any complications.If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to apply a topical soothing lotion e.g calamine lotion, twice daily.You may add an OTC oral antihistamine e.g cetrizine syp once daily.Regards"},{"Patient":"I practice hot yoga 3 or 4 times a week and just recently broke out with a rash. Small red raised bumps two look circular but no ring around and don't really resemble a ringworm. So I try topical like cortisone and neosporane. After a couple of days my boss suggested I try lotrimin and right away the rash is dissapearing and is not raised. The rash was on my chest and shoulder and one on my back. My question can lotrimin clear up other types of rashes or am I to assume it was in fact a ringworm, since the treatment is working.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicFungal infection can begin as small bumps which may later spread on to the surrounding skin. Ring formation is a later feature and may not be obvious when the infection is just starting and limited to a small area. Itching is a feature of fungal infection.Lotrimin is an antifungal, clotrimazole 1% cream and it would be useful for superficial fungal infections. It won't be effective for rashes of other etiology.Since your rash seems to have responded to topical clotrimazole 1% cream, therefore most likely it was a fungal infection. You must continue it for the required duration i.e 2-4 weeks for a complete cure, so that there is no relapse due to inadequate treatment.Regards"},{"Patient":"Painful skin rash on the arm.

What do you think it may be?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicSeems like it is bacterial infection of the skin, since it is sore and probably has a central pus point. Spider bites are different, burning is a prominent feature in spider bite, and they usually do have some itching, as well.If you were one of my patients I would have treated you empirically with an oral antibiotic; one from penicillin group of drugs (cloxacillin or flucloxacillin). That would be good enough. It is a prescription drug, therefore, you must ask for a prescription of these from your physician.Topically you may use an OTC topical antibacterial e.g 2% mupirocin cream, twice daily.An OTC pain killer would provide you symptomatic relief from pain and swelling.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi my husband has had a blisery rash for a while now - the doctor gave him cream and it cleared up and then re apeared on his head - it has now appeared on his chest.  they are dark red patches which blister.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicFluid filled lesions on the body, that are persisting as well as new ones reappearing at places like head and chest, needs to be clinically examined and if required biopsied as well.It could be an immunobullous disorder e.g pemphigus vulgaris or bullous pemphigoid. In each of these disorders, there are well formed bullae. While pemphigus vulgaris presents with fragile bullae that rupture easily and leave behind painful erosions, bullous pemphigoid on the other hand presents with tense bullae along with itching and urticaria.Therefore a thorough clinical examination, supported by appropriate investigations like skin biopsy, is a must to arrive at a diagnosis.I would suggest him to visit to a nearby dermatologist for the same.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi my partner has had An itchy red rash appear on his arms and stomach.

If negative, then you will get your periods in few days.  If so, you should get yourself evaluated first.  Do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels and a ultrasound for your uterus and ovaries.  If everything is fine, you can take some medicines like clomiphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound.  When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles. Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.

Apply the medicated creams exactly as advised by your doctor. Take antihistaminics as advised to relieve itching and irritation.

Firstly, i would suggest treatment of your secondary infection (if any) with oral and topical antibiotics.The key to successful treatment of scabies lies in treating everyone simultaneously in the family and others who are in close physical contact. Your doctor would prescribe oral drugs like ivermectin which will kill the parasite. You might also be advised application of permethrin 5% cream and a corticosteroid with fusidic acid cream. Apply the medicated creams exactly as advised by your doctor. Take antihistaminics as advised to relieve itching and irritation.

However, it is also important to rule out other rashes which occur in the diaper area like contact dermatitis to diaper itself and an entity called acrodermatitis enteropathica.Candidiasis is a fungal infection commonly occuring in babies in the diaper area.It can be treated with an antifungal like 2% ketoconazole cream applied twice a day. It is very important to keep the area as dry as possible as moisture favours the growth of this fungus.Contact dermatitis to diaper is an allergy to the diaper material. It is mainly confined to the round (convex) areas of the groin where diaper is in close contact with the skin. Use a barrier cream containing zinc oxide every time you change the diaper. Apply generously on the areas where diaper touches the skin.Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a condition which is seen at the period of weaning and is due to zinc deficiency. Zinc levels should be checked in the blood for confirmation.The alternate option is to ask me a direct query by clicking on this short url   , where you have an option of uploading a picture of the lesion which will help a great deal in diagnosing the condition.

Sweating and humidity together with friction and rubbing provide a portal of entry into the skin, through the hair follicles, thus giving rise to Folliculitis.For the folliculitis, I would suggest an empirical course of an oral antibiotic for a week.My choice of oral antibiotic would have been either:Amoxycillin 500mg in combination with clavulanic acid 125 mg, thrice daily for a weekORCephalexin 500 mg thrice daily for a weekORCefadroxil 500 mg twice daily for a week.An OTC topical antibacterial e.g 2% Mupirocin, is to be applied over folliculitis lesions, twice daily.Bathing twice daily, wearing loose fitting cotton clothes, weight control and using an antifungal dusting powder regularly to make the area unfavourable for fungal growth are few general measures that would help in preventing recurrence.Regards"},{"Patient":"My sister has rashes on her abdomen and beltline. She is fifteen, and weighs 62 kilos. She has a PCO resemblant condition, if this is relevant. The rashes subside when she uses Gentamycin and Loratidine, but reappear when she stops using these. Her doctor said she'd have to take the anti-allergy for life, which seems to me as a rather odd treatment regime. What would you say?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to healthcaremagicI would think of a possibility of fungal infection OR Tinea. Tinea is fairly common in the belt area and lower abdomen. She being overweight does'nt help her either. Clinically Tinea presents as red, scaly, itchy plaques with raised margins and central clearing. The patches extend peripherally.I would suggest a KOH wet mount from the scale for a confirmatory diagnosis.Treatment for a fungal infection is with topical and oral antifungals. Topically she could use an OTC antifungal e.g clotrimazole cream, twice daily for 2-4 weeks.Oral antifungals e.g fluconazole can also be started for a confirmed fungal infection. The dosage would be 150 mg once every week for 4-6 weeks.An OTC antihistamine e.g cetrizine 10 mg once daily would provide symptomatic relief from itching.Hope this helpsRegards"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, i have one problem that is i can't wear tight inner wears because after doing these for long time ,there develop red rashes and torn skin with bad odour.Once i have consult the doctor he preffered me tab teczcine but it doestnt get well.pls reply","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to healthcaremagicYou seem to have fungal infection in the groin folds, presenting as redness, discomfort and bad odour.

Thanks for posting your concern at HealthcaremagicAfter going through your query I would keep a possibility of either condyloma acuminata(genital warts) OR Molluscum contagiosum considering that the lesions are painless and probably are sexually acquired.I would certainly advice that you see a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis. Warts in the genital area presents as asymptomatic, fleshy, cauliflower shaped growths. They are caused by HPV virus.Whereas molluscum lesions are pearly white asymptomatic papules and they are characterised by a central dent/umblication. They are caused by molluscum contagiosum virus.Treatment of both is the same. Destruction of individual lesion with either cautery or CO2 Laser. Both can also be treated by topical imiquimod applications.regards"},{"Patient":"I had ringworm last year and my doctor advised me to use Candiva cream.

Sweating, humidity, obesity are factors that encourage fungal growth.Regarding pigmentation in the groins, it is most likely post-inflammatory hyper-pigmentation secondary to recurrent fungal infections which you experienced in the past. Pigmentation would lighten by itself gradually if the fungal infections are not allowed to recur.Since fungal infections can recur again due to favorable condition for fungal growth, therefore you need to use an anti-fungal dusting powder in the folds regularly which will not only keep the area dry and moisture free but in addition to it being an anti-fungal it will help prevent recurrence of fungal infections.-I would normally advice my patients an oral anti-fungal (fluconazole 150mg once every week for 6 weeks).-I also advice in my patients, a topical steroid+antifungal combination cream (clotrimazole+Beclomethasone) twice daily for 4-6 weeks.-An OTC antihistamine like cetrizine once daily in the evening will help you with the itch part-Once my patients are cured(usually 4-6 weeks) i ask them to use an anti-fungal dusting powder (clotrimazole dusting powder) in the folds, so as to prevent recurrence.Regards"},{"Patient":"I have had a rash on my chin for at least three weeks.

If you have taken naturogest, it supports the implantation.  So, if you are pregnant it will support this. If you are not pregnant, it will induce the periods.  So, you will get your periods within 1 to 2 weeks if you are not pregnant.  Aspirin also helps in implantation and prevents abortions.  You can try 2 more cycles of IUI.  The chance of pregnancy in one cycle of IUI is 10 to 15 percent only. Take some medicines like clomiphene and some injections also for the growth of your follicles so that 2 or 3 dominant follicles are there in 1 cycle. Talk to your doctor regarding this.  Hope I have answered your question.
