I will try my best to answer your queryYou see, I have observed something very similar in my practice. I have some data on the same. I have not been able to find a very suitable reason for these observations. The possibilities that suit one subset of patients fails the second subset absolutelyHowever i feel, and many colleagues agree that the possibility is that people who develop fall, especially the elderly have a component of dementia left behind. Now when there is a level of dementia left back, the person always has more falls. Besides, many of these patients are old and have issues with other aspects of health too like bone health, joint health. These secondary health issues may also make them unstable on their feet and lead to them loosing their balance. And of course, elderly when they fall, often develop fractures and the bed rest that they are prescribed only further adds to the dementia and taxes their cognitive functions.A study of functional MRI may probably help us in getting to a hypothesis, but the costs are an issueI hope this helps you.

I am Dr Saumya Mittal, MD.Read your query. That is a very significant question and i appreciate your problem. I will try my best to answer your queryThe concept of brain death needs some very specific features.The problem with brain death is that almost every feature that is supposed to be in favor of brain death can also be caused by another cause. So no one single sign can be confirmatory of brain death.besides, seizures also happen due to more than one cause. There may be a structural brain lesion, there may be a severe infection (sepsis), there may be sevre metabolic derangements (again of many types). And once a seizure happens, the patient may become unresponsive for a long period of time, say even upto 72 hours. The physical signs can infact mimic brain damage.I will always suggest at least an EEG if I was to declare a patient as possibly having brain death, I will suggest the same to you.Besides with heavy sedation, it is difficult to say whether there is brain death, or is it a part of the injections.I hope this helps you.

I've been in the practice of medicine for over 25 years and the practice of Neurology for over 15 of them. In our geographic area we have the Cleveland Clinic and Case Western Reserve University's Academic Teaching Hospital. There is also MetroHealth Medical Center in our area which is the only Level I Trauma Center in the State of Ohio.  I am personally acquainted with the Chief of the Spinal Cord Rehabilitation Center at that hospital. He is a very compassionate, extremely knowledgeable, and well respected physician.  We have many international travelers who come as patients to these institutions on a regular basis. I am convinced that you would easily obtain care of a world class degree by visiting Cleveland.  HOWEVER, this is not the same necessarily as a CURE for your injury and I don't mean to be negative in any way but you must realize that people with spinal cord injuries of the neck represent special challenges.  Such injuries can be extraordinarily complex and unfortunately no matter the level of technology, the academic prowess, or the intense desires of the medical and nursing staffs, CURES do not always happen.  Having said that, as I said I think you'll agree that in terms of medical facilities at our disposal in Cleveland we are really in a fertile area of the country for high level attention when it comes to your type of problem.

That is a very significant question and i appreciate your problem. I will try my best to answer your queryI think what she may be developing are episodes called TIA- transient ischemic effect. these are minor short duration episodes where the symptoms like stroke usually happen and improve very quickly- usually within the hour. This condition usually is a factor that suggests that a stroke may happen very soon. She needs to be evaluated as soon as possible by a neurologist. If on examination, the neurologist is of the same opinion, we may consider further testing like1. lipid profile2. fasting blood sugar3. blood pressure4. carotid doppler 5. echocardiography6. ecg7. MRI with MRA brainthese are the basic test suggested.I hope this helps you. Inform the reports mentioned above/if any other so I can be of help further. I have given you the answer to the maximum considering the information provided. The results of the tests could further enhance my answer to you.Please do understand that some details could be extracted from a detailed history and examination.Please feel free to ask another query.

The father of my friend has had a very bad accident and he can't breathe and is on the ventilator in a hospital. He is in the construction business and was at the site when a wooden shutter fell on him, damaging his spine, which the doctors call c2 and c3. They say his spine came forward and hit his windpipe and went back. He is unable to breathe. The doctors in attendence say they need to operate on him, but can't because he is on the ventilator. Please guide me, it is very urgent, and my friend's father has been in the ICU for the last 12 days. The patient is 53 years old, and has always had a high blood pressure. He has never had any injury ever before. He is a well-built, lean man, with a height of 6'2.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Damage to C 2 and C 3 is critical spine injury and I think the doctors attending on him should take a very careful decision. Since he is still on ventilator, it is difficult to operate unless the vital parameters are stable. It may take time to make him vital and then the risk involved in such a surgery can be minimized. They may also try and do a tracheostomy but then it is not clear the extent of damage to his windpipe and vertebra."},{"Patient":"Am a 41 year old female.Severe swelling and pain that started in the area where my appendix is (4 or 5 days ago) so thought it was that perhaps, but now pain and swelling is on the other side as well ( In the ovary areas, but very severe.)

I can certainly tell that you are not the nervous type if you are willing to write your question out and submit it the way you have. That takes a little bit of courage.There are a couple of things to come to my mind when you describe your situation. One is called orthostatic hypotension or also orthostatic tremors. this condition is one where a person can start shaking in their hands and their knees and their arms and their legs after they have been up on their feet for a few seconds or a few minutes. Usually, when this starts to happen and they sit down the shaking goes away.The other thing is called benign essential tremor or or benign essential familial tremor if the condition runs in one of your family members. however, in this case I would go preferentially with the first one since it seems as if your trimmers get worse when you are standing and writing something.at any rate, you should see a doctor who can take your blood pressure is in different positions such as lying, sitting, and standing and make a determination as to whether not you may have such an entity.would you please rate this answer with a star rating if it meets your approval for what you were looking for.

Neighbouring to the disc lies the spinal cord. So many nerves arises from the spinal cord.

Since my fall I have had speech stutering and sluring of words. My CT scans have been clear. My MRI shows I have Maxillary Sinutitus can that be caused from the concussion and be causing the dizziness and numbness in face?","Doctor":"Sinusitis is commonly diagnosed on MRI scans in ALL FOLKS and has no relation to the concussion.  Numbness of the face can have several causes.  If this numbness in the face did not begin until very recently then, there is no relationship to the concussion.  If it happened at the time of or very shortly after the brain injury then, POSSIBLY there could be a relationship if it can be shown that the brainstem itself was sufficiently jarred to cause the symptom.  The problem is there aren't any other symptoms in accompaniment that you've mentioned that would be consistent with a brainstem exaggerated force which then, should've caused other cranial nerves to malfunction, not just the one controlling sensation to the face.  In all, I would say the concussion is an unlikely causative factor for numbness of the face.  I can certainly make an argument for the stuttering problem being related to the fall as well as the dizziness component of your symptoms (again if they are time locked or synchronized to having appeared at the time of or shortly after the incident).

There are quite a few causes for such Unconscious spells . I will tell about few common cause . 1. Seizure Disorder :    A condition which causes convulsions ( fits )2. Stroke               :    Inadequate Blood Supply  or Bleeding inside the Brain .     Cause for Seizure is Electrolyte Imbalance ( Low / HIgh Blood Sodium, Calcium Magnesium levels , Low / HIgh Blood Sugars ), Infection spreading to Brain , Some Mass in the Brain , Epilepsy , Liver Failure , Kidney Failure .   Cause for Stroke are Uncontrolled Hypertension , Uncontrolled Diabetes , Elevated Cholesterol , Smoking , Alcoholism , Disorders in Blood Coagulation .

An MRI with contrast for example would likely be the test of choice in order to further characterize that lesion.  If it turns out just to be a calcified granuloma then, unfortunately, again you have to find out what caused that inflammatory reaction in the first place in order to know how or if there is some type of treatment.

Pls give me answer,  thank you Dr, By Rouf from sharjah.","Doctor":"Mr. Rouf. First...stop worrying. There IS a solution for your problem.  The MRI findings that you have described are not very serious. U seem to have cervical degenerative disc disease(DDD) with a disc herniation at C5-6. The DDD will cause you neck pain which can be usually managed by neck exercises and proper posture of your neck especially while sleeping. This pain may take some time to come down. The disc herniation can cause pain in your upper limb. Usually the pain will be radiating from neck to shoulder then to arm, forearm and then fingers, in your case ( C6 root) the thumb and index finger. If you have this typical pain, then your C6  root may compressed. If you have pain just in your hand without any numbness, then it is unlikely. For a compressed root...you can try with a cervical collar and the same drugs what you have been taking for 4-8 weeks. If pain is not coming down or increasing  then you may have to see a spine surgeon who may advise you to undergo a discectomy."},{"Patient":"I had my first colonoscopy in June of 2013 at age 60.  The doctor removed 2 polyps - one as a whole at 3mm in size and the other in a piecemeal fashion 8 mm in size.  Both of these polyps were located in the cecum.   About 8 hours later I developed pain in the lower right abdomen (by my right hip).  The pain did not go away and was worse with activity.  I called in and they sent me to Urgent Care where the diagnosis was transmural burn sydrome.  I was sent home with antibiotics and pain medication and told that if it did not get better to go to ER.  It did get better. The lab reported both type of polyps (good and not so good) and I was instructed to return for another colonoscopy in 5 years. Ever since this colonoscopy, I get very brief periods of pain that come on quickly and stop quickly in the same place - lower right.  I have had a complete hysterectomy so I know it is not coming from female organs as I do not have any.  My question is, do I need to be concerned about the next colonoscopy in 5 years.  I get nervous thinking about it as I don't want a repeat of the first one.  Thank you for any information you may provide.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in HCM.If the histological disgnosis of the removed polps does not show any evidence of premalignant or malignant changes then you need not worry at all.The symptoms which you developed after the first colonoscopy were due to the procedure itself.

The question you need to answer for yourself is are you ready to suffer the pain until then. Discectomy is a very simple surgery in the hands of a right surgeon. At L5S1 level, the incidence of complications is also very low.

She is 18 years old","Doctor":"That's a terrible tragic thing that happened.  Hopefully, things will be fine and they'll get the barbarians that did that.  Your best source of information will be right there in the hospital. The doctors that are attending to her will be doing careful neurological monitoring round the clock....especially, if she's unconscious (hopefully not). Often times when the amount of bleeding into the brain is minimal recovery can be virtually complete.  However, obviously, I can't give any sort of guarantee on this....everything hinges on the severity of the trauma, whether she is unconscious or not, and what her actual neurological examination is like as time goes on. Treatment will likely depend on how much blood is in the brain.  Sometimes if it causes a lot of pressure then, surgeons will go right away and relieve that pressure by extracting the blood.  Results are entirely variable due to obvious things that I can't know but all I can say is the younger the injured person in something like this the better the chances for a good recovery.  Also, the sooner she wakes up...or if she already is awake and breathing on her own for example the better the prognosis.

I get very spaced out and almost disconnected. It tends to worsen with exercise or running, it gets to a point where I think I might faint, like I almost do not know where I am.

Could this be a heart/circulation problem?

The dopa medicines help alleviate the symptoms of slowness of movement but do not change the course of the disease itself.  it sounds like the drowsiness may be from medication if she is taking it in the morning.  the most common culprit is the blood pressure medication.

If this is what happened then, you suffered what we call a TIA (transient ischemic attack).  Others refer to this as a \\"mini-stroke\\".  Of course, there are other possibilities for what happened.  I only give you this one to think about as it is the most important reason for you to get checked by either your doctor or better yet, a neurologist who will find out more information from you and decide whether in fact, this is what happened or something else was to blame.  You should do this soon.  TIA's usually don't happen a 2nd or 3rd time before an actual stroke sets in.

It is certainly possible for someone to choke on something without making a noise but usually a witness can describe other things happening such as a sudden flushing in the face and the person themselves usually becomes desperate and may even thrash about trying to dislodge whatever they are choking on.

In my opinion it does not benefit. it is just marketing and commercialization of procedure.Various new strategies are being explored using stem cells, but it is unlikely that any of them will offer a full cure. Instead, they aim to limit the damage to cells in the brain and reduce the symptoms. Cerebral palsy is so difficult to treat because it can involve damage to many different types of cells in the brain. Severely damaged cells can be lost completely. Scientists expect that future treatments will aim to protect and repair damaged brain cells before they are entirely lost. This means it is likely that any new treatment will have to be applied within a small window of time, between the initial injury that has caused damage and the onset of permanent cell loss.dr anurag aggarwal"},{"Patient":"Surgery on jul 15 this year to repair 3 compressed disc in lower back causing pain in right calf.

It was 4x4, we were told to just wait to see what happens. Lately she has been experiencing headaches, dizzy spells, heart palpations, and arm numbness. it has not been checked in 3 years because she was not symptomatic","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for posting your concern in the HCM. Pineal gland cysts are often incidental finding and smaller ones often do not require any intervention. However, as you haven't gone for a follow up and your daughter is symptomatic now, she needs immediate clinical examination and imaging (CT scan or MRI) to rule out any enlargement or development of pineocytoma or germinoma. An obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to enlargement of the cyst may also be ruled out. CSF examination may also be required to rule out a neoplasm.Hence, my opinion is-1. Please consult your local neurosurgeon at the earliest.2. Please do a CT scan or MRI of brain (depending upon your doctor's advice) if neurosurgeon is not available for immediate consultation.In case no change is detected in that area, clinical examination of the cervical spine may be required along with imaging (X-ray, MRI) to rule out any abnormality.For any further information, please write back to me @  you are satisfied with the above answer, please mark it as helpful.Regards,Dr. Kaushik"},{"Patient":"I have tummy ache and nausia..

My problem started at the beginning of 2009 when suddenly I lost all vision in my right eye. There was no pain and no warning signs this was going to happen as I had no previous health problems. This lasted for about 3 mins until the vision returned as quickly as it went.I had a number of similar episodes over the next few months including what I can only describe as a curtain dropping down in my eye (always the right eye). I was examined by various specialists and was diagnosed with Amaurosis Fugax and placed on medication (aspirin and ezetimibe). Afterwards I felt that my physical strength had diminished a little but still felt relatively fit.I was free of any further symptoms for 3 years until a similar episode of loss of vision in September 2012 and after further examinations my medication was changed ( chlopidigrel and rusovostatin). I felt that I was getting tired very easily and was finding it hard to concentrate at times. Again I was symptom free for about a year until I suffered a further loss of sight in my right eye (October 2013). Not only did I lose my sight, I also lost coordination in my legs, I had 'tingling' in my right fingers and leg. I was admitted to hospital where I was told I was having a stroke. At this point I felt completely drained of all energy, I was sleeping most of the day, I had no strength in my arms or legs and was extremely 'moody'. Over the next few weeks I underwent further examinations including a transoesophogal echocardiogram and it was discovered I had a Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO) which it was explained is a 'hole in the heart' and was probably where small blood clots are forming. I underwent an MRI scan recently and it was found I had a 'white spot' on the left side of my brain which was explained May be a restriction in the blood flow. I have been referred to a cardiologist and a neurologist for further consultation but I have to wait a significant time before my appointments. I am extremely worried as I have never had anything like this before, I am not allowed to work (I am a police officer of 23 years with minimal sickness) and do not know what is likely to happen.Any advice would be welcome.Kind regards,Eamonn","Doctor":"Hai it is nice that your narration of symptoms is so clear.Initially your symptoms were due to amaurosis fugax ie a trasient loss of vision.you were advised aspirin, clopidogrel to prevent clotting of blood by their antiplatelet action and also rosuvastatin for cholesterol lowering effect.your symptoms of defective right eye vision weakness and paresthesias in right upper and lower limb weaness suggests a lesion in the left brain.the whitedot in mri may be due to infarct of the brain,or a granuloma or a tumor.dont worry about that white lesion.just follow doctors advise.please do regular physiotherapy and use medication regularly.avoid smoking alcohol and fatty diet.dont worry about patent foramen ovale.please consult  cardiologist and he may advise devise closure procedure if required."},{"Patient":"iam a 33 yr male who got seizures 3 times from in a span of 2 weeks, doctors have advised me to take 2 eptoins and 1 levipill at night and also said that it needs to be continued atleast for a span of 2 to 5 yrs depending on the progress of cure, they also have diagonized that the reason for the seizure is because of Neumocephalus injury which happened 2 yrs ago.","Doctor":"HIThank for asking to HCMI really appreciate your concern and looking to the history given here I could say that as long as the seizure is concern the given medicine is okay but the diagnosis can be  questioned, in my opinion this could be grand mal seizure, take care and have a nice day."},{"Patient":"i have recently been told i have spondylotic changes at the mid - lower cervical spine with osteophytic spurring and mild disc space narrowing at c5/c6.

Simply speaking, cervical spondylosis refers to a condition in which there is mechanical wearing of the intervertebral disc cushions due to lose of hydration and elasticity.  The surrounding ligaments also lose their elasticity. There is biomechanical incompetence.  The joint space narrows down, annulus bulges forward and facets override.There may be abnormal growths or spurs on the bones of the spine.Gradually one or more nerve roots are compressed resulting in radicular pain, tingling, numbness in the distribution of the affected nerve.For rehabilitation and conservative management, immobilisation of the cervical spine is the mainstay of treatment.  Traction may be applied although it has no proven benefit in cervical pain. Superficial and deep heat therapy to the local tissue may help. Analgesics and muscle relaxants may also be taken. In case of progressive neurodeficit, intractable pain or documented compression of nerve root(s) surgical intervention may be needed. For any further questions, please write back to us.

He may need another sleep study if it's been a while. Central sleep apnea results from some form of damage to the central control mechanism for sleep following stroke, traumatic brain injury, intracranial brain bleeds, infections, hydrocephalus, etc. Obstructive sleep apnea refers to anything within the physical airway that blocks the natural and unimpeded flow of air into or out of the system.

Your symptoms are more consistent with what could be referred to as a transient ischemic attack or TIA.

I think that you should make an appointment to either see your primary doctor or a neurologist as soon as possible and discuss what happened. It will be to their discretion as to how you should proceed but a warning like this (if it was a TIA) should not be ignored. It's a heads up to something more dramatic which could be avoided if you could know more information. Immediately stop smoking cigarettes or engaging in lifestyle habits of risk, keep yourself well hydrated at all times, if you are diabetic make sure your control is optimum and don't be lax about following the strictest instructions by your doctor regarding fingersticks, sliding scale insulin injections, diet, and exercise.

It sounds as if you are having at the very least nightmares and terrible insomnia or difficulty sleeping because of the PTSD and potentially nightmares. I will tell you that there is a more specific medication that has a good success in treating nightmares. It is called Prazosin. your doctors may already have you on this medication but if not you can ask about it. this medication was shown to be very effective to control nightmares and follows what is referred to as the Raskind protocol.

Is this true? So a grand mal seizure is technically referred to as a tonic clonic seizure because of the rhythmic jerking of the limbs. I don't know what the other type of seizure is that you refer to. However, I can tell you that if you have actually suffered a stroke and it was an embolic one. in other words, a blood clot provoked the stroke and a portion of the cortex was damaged then, the risk for seizures and seizure recurrence as a result is definitely higher than in people who have not had strokes. you should see your doctor who treated you for the stroke and ask to be sent to a neurologist if you are already not hooked up with one."},{"Patient":"I HAVE BEEN HAVING ALOT OF ABNORMAL BLEEDING FOR ALMOST THREE WEEKS NOW AND THE CLOTS ARE GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER, AS LONG AS I AM SITTING NOT DOING ANY TYPE OF ACTIVITY I AM OK BUT THE MINUTE I DO ANYTHING EVEN TRYING TO PREPARE DINNER THE CLOTS BEGIN TO COME OUT AND THEN THE HEAVY BLEEDING FOLLOWS.","Doctor":"Your question is rather wide-open in terms of an answer.

She simply walks over abundantly and does not take the time off to get her feet up. there are specific medications for Alzheimer's disease (non-tremendously affective I might add) but all the same you may check with your doctor to see if any of them may be of some benefit to her in terms of getting her to be a little more settled so that she can take appropriate breaks and help the swelling of the feet down."},{"Patient":"My Grandsons bone marrow has a very low red blood cell production.  the size of the cells are.6.

He used to be ok with oral tablets, specially Gabantin / Gabapin 300 - 3 tablets per day, along with a host of other medicines, for about 6 months, after which again the medicines would be changed.

Good tissue can be lost in the process and not only that the treatments are temporary at best.

I would say that the hospital and doctors there who repeated the studies and got even an MRI which is highly sensitive for mass lesions are correct when they say there is no mass.

Based on this he prescribed me citistar. I would like to know the diagnosis of this condition.","Doctor":"You didn't ask the doctor? Is he a neurologist? I don't quite understand his choice for your tremor since Citistar is simply citicholine which is a nutritional element. It is not what I would consider anything of a standard or definitive nature to treat either an essential tremor or a parkinsonian tremor if he is thinking along one of those lines. To my knowledge the evidence for medical use of citicholine revolves around memory and mental issues.

I ve been researching Axona and was curious if it would have any effect on someone without a diagnosis of Alzheimer s or if it could even be prescribed in his case.","Doctor":"None of the medications we use for Alzheimer's is preventative.  They were not researched in that way nor are they indicated for prophylactic use. Axona is actually a medical food supplement and should not be used in people with metabolic issues such as diabetes as it can cause ketonic shock and coma in extreme cases. I would not recommend the use of Axona in anybody without a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia and only under the direction of an experienced physician due to its side effects which in some cases can be severe enough for people to go the ER.  Good luck."},{"Patient":"Back in 1972, after having pneumonia for about a month, I came down with Guillian Barre Syndrome. I am really blessed though. I m now able to walk, talk, and even live on my own. I ve had alot of mental and physical prob- lems over the years, but I guess that s expected. I m just curious if any findings have been found over the years of what exactly causes it, and if doctors are any closer to curing it yet.","Doctor":"Guillain Barre Syndrome occurs as the result of a person's immune system over-reacting to a protein found on a bacterial organism known as campylobacter jejuni which is found in the gut. The immune system identifies the protein of this bacteria as foreign and correctly targets it for destruction.  However, it just so happens that the protein contained in the coverings of nerves (myelin) which control skeletal muscles is very similar to this foreign protein of the bacteria.  The immune system then, MISTAKENLY begins attacking the myelin sheaths because of this error in recognizing the body as itself vs. a foreign invader. That is how GBS is initiated. There have been other advances in treatment since 1972, most notably the introduction and use of something known as IVIG. This makes treatment much easier compared to plasmapheresis which is what you may have gotten in 1972 although it is not known to be a significantly BETTER treatment. Nor is it cheaper. If anything it is probably more expensive. Glad you're better and recovered. Just avoid that C.jejuni critter if you can!  All the best!"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have pulsating vein/ nerve on left side of my skull with a feeling of rushing of blood. I have no pain but this happens when I get angry or stressed out..This has started since 2 months or so and my Job is very stressful as well, which makes me angry or stressed easily many times.","Doctor":"Allow me to clarify for you one detail and that is nerves do not and cannot \\"pulsate\\" and for that matter veins can't either. Arteries can pulsate to the beat of the heart but not veins. Your symptoms seem to be precipitated by feelings of anger and stress. I do not detect anything in your symptomatology that would suggest a primary NEUROLOGICAL problem here and it sounds to me that the most likely explanation to what is going on revolves around issues of stress management. Please speak to your primary doctor who can direct you to the appropriate specialists or services for help."},{"Patient":"ok it seems when i get mad my body tempature drops dramaticly why does it do that Also sometimes its like im gettin like brain shocks when something is loud or i move my head i have ct scans and xrays all come back clear but nobody can answer these question","Doctor":"I don't get any sense of a true neurological problem with the symptoms that you are relaying.  I can tell you that the temperature control in your body would not be something that could drop that quickly that you'd be able to tell in an instant that it were changing so that is a perception...it's not really happening within the brain or body. As far as the symptom of anger having something intimate to do with the onset of the other symptoms you mention tells me that again, what you are saying is not of a neurological origin but rather psychological which is causing you to perceive and feel certain things but the brain itself is wholly intact.  This is supported by the scans and other studies you have said coming back as negative.  Good luck to you."},{"Patient":"Hey I m 20 years of age,I feel like my brain is moving and I always feel dizzy and very weak. I feel like my Hand and feet palms are burning. I m feel nervous and i feel like getting away from everyone.

There isn't (well, there shouldn't be) a whole lot of room up there under normal circumstances for such movement so that's one point. Although I am firmly grounded in the belief that a good neurological examination should always be done on someone with your symptoms I can also say with some degree of confidence that speaking to your physician about these issues may help them direct you to other specialists as well who may be able to help. I detect anxiousness and nervousness as well as an element of isolation that may have a lot to do with at least some of your symptoms. Bottom line, get a good neurological workup and see what the neurologist thinks of your case and then, be sure to talk things through with your primary doctor to see if other consultations may not help get some answers as well.

NCC gets fully cured in a few months, however, it may take a few years in some cases.So, in your husband's case, the NCC infection would have got cured by now.In some people, after healing, NCC leaves a scar or calcification.

The outcome after brain haemorrhage depends on the size and location of bleeding in the brain.If you can upload her CT scan of brain report here, it would help us answer your questions better regarding the chances of recovery.The condition you have described suggests that she is semi-conscious and is not able to communicate. However, she is able to recognise people and has emotional responses in the form of crying.Many people partially recover after brain haemorrhage. However, most are left with disabilities in the form of speech impairment, weakness of arm or leg, inability to take care of self, etc.You should continue supportive care, nursing care, feeding through the naso-gastric tube, and control of blood pressure.I hope my answer helps.

Findings: Mild disc desiccation consistent with degenerative disc disease is noted within the lumbar spine. At L1-L2 and L2-L3 no neurocompressive changes are identified. At L3-L4 there is annular disc bulging with flattening along the ventral margin of the thecal sac. No resultant central or foraminal stenosis is seen. At L4-L5 there is annular disk bulge with impression on the thecal sac. Disk material causes encroachment within the inferior left neural foramen. At L5-S1 there is central and left paracentral disc herniation with impingement and displacement on the left S1 nerve root in its lateral recess. More diffuse disc bulging also cause encroachment within the bilateral neural foramina. Degenerative endplate changes are seen at the L5-S1 level. The vertebral bodies demonstrate normal height and narrow signal characteristics. The conus medullaris is at the L1 level and displays normal morphology.

Degenerative endplate changes at this level is also noted. Annular disc bulging at L4-L5 with impression on the thecal sac. Annular disc bulging is also noted L3-L4.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM,The intervertebral discs are cartilaginous structures present between vertebrae.The disc acts as lubricant for smooth motion of the vertebral bodies during movement of the spine.At times the disc starts bulging out from its normal position.The bulging disc starts impinging nerve roots which emanate from the spinal cord.The nerve emanate through small foramina in the vertebral bodies. These foramina are intact in your case.In your case, discs are bulging at the level of L4-L5 and L5-S1.Due to the compression, the area supplied by these nerves are affected.This is responsible for the pain and numbness in the foot region.The S1 nerve does not supply the genital region.The treatment for this condition is complete bed rest.If the condition does not improve on bed rest, surgical measures may be required.Thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"Two weeks ago I woke up with a stiff neck and shoulders, not able to move my head in certain directions.

I m not exactly sure if a real doctor will answer this- let alone the fact it will be answered. I have a world of questions to ask... but I guess I ll ask this one, well maybe two. Is it possible for an individual s intelligence to fluctuate? When I was younger it appeared that I was simply average, IQ wise... in my family it was just an unspoken truth that I was the least intelligent. But as I got older, around 17 I began paying attention more in school and trying more and found that I achieved top marks. Not just slightly above average but far exceeding that of my peers. In most classes I had the highest mark. It led me to wonder whether I became smarter with age? I don t know, is this possible? And if so, is it possible for me to become less smart? They say the brain is like a muscle and it needs to be used but I ve also heard that no one can actually alter their natural intelligence?

You're right... it's not a strictly medical question, it's more like one for a psychology expert. But I can give you a direction. I'll start with some examples.Some people can be very good at interacting with others in social gatherings but may be the worst students.Others can be great students but can experience trouble when socializing. Some have great talent in sports, others can't even run without stumbling. All of them can get better with practice. You've seen it in yourself. Trying hard got you better marks. You probably can't really alter you natural intelligence but you can get better results with trial and experience. Use a step-by-step approach to achieve more and more. Getting the best marks proves you've got potential!

Firstly Parkin (Trihexphenidyl...abbreviated THP) is a drug which is given to control trembling of hands (also known as extra-pyrimidal side effect or EPS) caused by serenace (haloperidol). Haloperidol/Serenace is the antipsychotic or main drug which is being used to treat Psychosis by your fathers doctors. Since he is also suffering from epilepsy; giving Haloperidol/serenace might not be a very good idea as certain antipsychotics increase the risk of having a seizure episode. Hence antipsychotic agent Quetiapine (brand names Quel, Quetipin, Quetan etc.) might be a better option for your father as this drug has a very low propensity of causing seizures. Lastly, all antipsychotic drugs including Quetiapine, Haloperidol do cause some worsening of Blood cholesterol & sugar levels. Hence strict dietary management, physical exercise along with regular monitoring of blood sugar, cholesterol & appropriate medications for diabetes & hypertension should keep your father fine.

As you might have already searched & know; multiple sclerosis (MS) has plethora of signs & symptoms. But it can present in various ways including tingling numbness, urinary incontinence or even frank Psychiatric problems like depressive symptoms, manic states etc. Usually the common ones like tingling numbness, gait imbalance, urinary incontinence are screened for by doctors.

Or the surgical pain (May 15,2012) or the psuedo?? I am so scared its another leak but don t want to go to ER again if its just needs time...","Doctor":"Hello, I'd be happy to help if I can. If you continue to have symptoms suggestive of a recurrent CSF leak, then it needs to be evaluated by a health professional.While neck pain may have a number causes ranging from musculoskeletal pain to arthritis, your history of prior brain surgery and recent leak with repair significantly raises suspicion that this could be another leak. I'm not entirely convinced that you need to rush off to the ER, but it would make sense to call/page your neurosurgeon and ask to see him/her as soon as possible.Of course, if you are having nausea/vomiting or fevers, I would get to the ER to rule out meningitis.I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hi! my ? is my brother had a horrible accident thrown from a charoit been in a coma for 5 weeks no change his brain activity is at 3. no movement twitches once in awhile his eyes open but no movement in the eye balls at all he has a trachia in his neck for breathing is the twitching a good thing and his eyes opening is this a good thing he has severe brain trauma fractured skull , fractured nose fractured jaw IS THERE A CHANCE FOR HIM TO AWAKEN?","Doctor":"Hello, I'm very sorry to hear about your brother's accident. Brain injuries are devastating, especially when they leave a loved one in a coma. I'm a bit confused by your saying his brain activity is at \\"3\\". Sometimes people mean that the Glasgow Coma Score is a 3, which means that there is no movement, no eye movement, and no attempt to speak. It represents very severe brain injury. Random eye opening and muscle twitching in the setting of massive brain injury are never good. They can mean anything from seizures to random discharges of a permenantly damaged brain. While 5 weeks is not a \\"long\\" time in terms of brain injury (especially in young patients), what you describe does not sound good. While there may be a chance for your brother to \\"awaken\\" it is likely very very small. If you are asking the possibility that he will ever be \\"normal\\", that I'm sorry to say is not a possibility. It is not my intention to remove your hope of a miracle, but I want you to know where your brother stands in relation to others with similar injuries. My prayers are with you and your family."},{"Patient":"I have an issue of getting faintly dizzy to completely blacking out and shaking. I am 15 years old and very scared.

Please let me know. She has only BP problem, nothing else,pls clarify.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your query.I have noted your mother's symptoms and diagnosis.For carpal tunnel syndrome, the first line of treatment is always medical. This would include medications such as pregabalin or gabapentin capsules. Resting the hand in a splint may also be useful.Only if the pain does not subside with medical treatment, should we consider surgery. In any case, carpal tunnel decompression surgery is safe and there is no need to worry.I hope my answer helps.

It was short-lived..like 30 seconds..but very severe. Almost felt like something ruptured. Bracing the area supportively with both hands brought a little relief. Haven t moved from the living room chair I was sitting in when it happened, but so far now the pain is completely gone. What could that have been?","Doctor":"It could have been a spasm of the abdominal muscles because of the sudden and explosive sneezing.The sneeze reflex involves contraction of a number of different muscles and muscle groups throughout the body including abdominal muscles which contract suddenly to increase the pressure within the abdomen, which pushes the diaphragm upwards and is one of the actions performed during the sneeze.I wouldn't worry about it if the pain subsided completely within a short time.I hope I have answered your question. Please feel free to get back to me in case you have any more doubts."},{"Patient":"hello, I have been having sever abdominal pain and pelvic pain. I went to the er where they did a ct scan. They said I had fluid in my pelvis but didn't see anything else. The did a pelvic check, std screening, and an ultrasound to check for cysts. This was almost a month ago. I am still having terrible pain.  Also I just had a shunt put in that drains my spinal fluid from my head to my abdomen. Went to Neurosurgeon , they didn't think that the shunt had anything to do with the pain. Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hi. This is true that shunt fluid draining in abdomen is not the cause for pain. But Ct Scan showing fluid in pelvis means pelvic infection or PID ( pelvic inflammatory disease ).Sometimes this fluid can be pus also,which causes severe pain. You can start antibiotics after consulting your dr.along with anti-inflammatory drugs.If still not releived your dr. may take fluid from PID and then start treatment after proper culture sensitivity.

In this condition, the discs located between the vertebral bodies in the spine bulges (slips) out, causing compression of the nerves at that level.

Doctors have adviced me bed rest for few days. Im very confused and want to know what actually slip disc is? is it cured properly? can i live a normal life doing all activities like driving,climbing stairs at home and all normal household affairs? Please help me because im getting very depressed. Thankyou.","Doctor":"The vertebrae in the spine are separated by a spongy tissue which is the disc. If the disc ruptures, the tissue in it can slide out of its normal place. This narrows the space between the vertebrae and may cause pressure on the nerves in the spine. This is called a slipped (\\"herniated\\") disc. This usually heals up on its own without any specific treatment except control of the pain. Some people may need physical therapy or even surgery to fix it. Once it has healed, you can live a normal life and do all your activities as before. I personally had a very bad slipped disc when I was your age. I took some medication for the pain and did not have surgery. The disc healed and I have been able to do all the activities that you mention since then. So there is certainly much hope that this will happen with you too, and no need to get depressed.Hope I have answered your query.

He is now in this state, with a feeding tube , for two weeks. He had a fever of 104 last night and given Tylenol. A spinal tap showed elevated levels of protein. What are possible causes for his symptoms?","Doctor":"Damage to the vocal cords may have occurred if your cousin had a tube placed in his throat for the general anesthesia. Elevated protein in the spinal fluid indicates inflammation that could be caused by an infection affecting his brain. Diabetes lowers the body's ability to fight infection. The dead tissue most likely resulted from an infection, which could have spread from there into the bloodstream and then into the brain. The fever also suggests some kind of infection. If an infection affected the lower part of his brain, it could damage the nerves that go to his vocal cords and cause that paralysis. Hope I have answered your query.

I took 2 pills, one in the morning and one that night and woke up the next day with extreme swelling in my face. My right eye was swollen shut and I looked like the elephant man. It took a shot of Kenelog to reduce the swelling. The Dr. said that Augmentin made me allergic to the HCT component of my BP meds. I stopped taking the BP meds and tried a natural (vitamin supplements) course of treatment. That worked for a while, but I eventually had to go back on Benicar with Amlodipine (20/5). In the meantime, I was put on Dapsone and Prednisone for the rash. Now my problem is loss of hand-eye coordination (I play racquetball) and loss of equilibrium. If I get up in the night to use the restroom, I have to turn on a light in order to not lose my balance. I was taken off of Dapsone/Prednisone after one month because of loss of equilibrium. It has been about a year since using the Dapsone/Prednisone combination. A Chiropractor treated my hand with Nitrogen (cold) thinking that it might be a fungus, and my hand does seem like it is getting better, however the rash historically comes and goes in waves. I went to UCLA Medical Center for the Allergeez test (70 different allergens) and they gave me the results for SOME OTHER GUYS TEST! The other guy took the True test (I did not) and indicated Carba mix. In my test results (I think they were my results) I am apparently allergic to Propylene Glycol. I had a salad one day and the next day the rash on my hand exploded! The salad dressing (Wishbone) had Propylene Glycol in it (WTF???). At this point, a wild-ass-guess would apparently be as good as 8 years of medical education. The thing that bothers me the most right now is the loss of equilibrium. Any ideas?","Doctor":"Stop all medic cation. get complete eye checkup general health checkup for loss of equilibrium ear cochlear and vestibular check up is required.loss of Librium can be liked to hypertension and ear problem.

Right now you must first get an abdominal erect X ray done to see for any significant sub acute or acute obstruction.

I almost fell down a couple times. My head felt spacey, sorta lightheaded. I wasn t confused and no headache. My speech was fine. I was busy running around straightening my kitchen and quite tired when this occurred. I don t drink or take drugs. I am a 61 y.o. female, 5 4 , 218#. I take the following drugs: benicar , nexium , metformin (1500mg), effexor, flonase , and progesterone . The progesterone was recently prescribed and I ve been taking it for 1 week. I take a variety of supplements , but nothing new--I ve taken most of them for years. I do take a very high dose of Benfotiamine for neuropathey in my toes (it s very effective). It does have the side effect of causing muscle spasims, which I understand is a frequent side effect. I just took my blood glucose reading and it was 126, expected for me. I should but don t have a blood pressure cuff, so don t know my reading. I don t think it s high. My last reading was a couple weeks ago and was 126/84.

My symptoms started around 3 years ago and i don t really know where to start. Dizziness , If i close my eyes i feel like im moving or rotating and when im walking it’s a bit like walking on a moving ship. Travel sick, travelling backwards, swings or anything that spins really causes problems. Vision , sometimes tunnel, blurry, when i close my eyes I can see bright lights. Bright patterns on wallpaper or curtains ect catch my attention and sometimes its like im trying to look at everything at once with no real focus on anything.. Out of body ? I don t know if that s a good description, anyway, I can be talking or watching someone doing something and I feel like im on the outside, I know I want to join in but i cant seem to engage with whats going on, Im aware this is happening but cant do anything about it. Confusion, I was sat in a chair and i was convinced if i went outside I would actually be in my old road where I used to live (felt drugged) Busy areas, Ie supermarket, to many colours, to many people crossing in front of me, makes me jumpy and anxious and sometimes a little aggressive, possibly frustration ? the Checkout is a nightmare trying to unload the trolley, looking back and forth, keeping up with the cashier then packing the bags. watching tv, if something moves sideways off the screen it can make me feel quite dizzy and jumpy. Forgetful, sometimes i get the symptoms worse than others, when its bad I can have a very bad memory , spelling and writing gets terrible, it even got that bad once i couldn t remember what finger my wedding ring went on to. Days out and holidays, You know you should be having fun and it’s a treat but its like it means nothing and your just there, hard when you have a 4 year old. I have seen various specialists and they have come up with allsorts or reasons, First of all they blamed my job, Im a miner of 23 years and they said the lack of light (miner nastagnus) with a lack of melatonin so after a struggle I got some melatonin and a holiday to Egypt, No improvement, in fact the melatonin was horrible and made me feel drugged. I have had and MRI, Tilting tables, EEG , eply test and nothing came back with a reason for my problems. The last specialist says its Anxiety, he had me breathing very quickly and i got quite dizzy and he says its a lack of oxygen to the brain but doesn’t that happen to everyone ? Like i mentioned, Im a miner, Im in charge of men, Im a good problem solver, I always stand back and sort it without losing it and kicking things about. My daughter is 4 now and i feel like I have missed out due to the problems, I don’t like to go on about it to the wife, I dont think she understands and its so hard to explain, I just feel like I’m been a wimp and moaning about what’s going on, but i find it so hard sometimes. I believe things have got better over the years but some days are worse than others and sometimes the symptoms can last for a few weeks then subside again, I know when its going to happen as my vision starts to go first. I have got to admit the wife and daughter fight like cat and dog which drives me wild sometimes but I know I have to get out of there way. Any help will be greatly appreciated. .","Doctor":"Its seems weakness of nervous system, for strengthen nervous system and immunomodulator come for cupping therapy points responsible for the above. and zahabi 5 gm twice daily for 3 months for better response.

The spells are usually short but sometimes she is tired after having them. Any ideas what this could be?","Doctor":"Dizziness in children can have a number of different causes. As your child's EKG is normal she is unlikely to have heart problems. She might be suffering from neurological problems like a epilepsy. An electro- encephalogram may be helpful in the diagnosis of epilepsy. Your child will need to take a detailed history such as whether she is suffering from nausea, vomiting and lose consciousness during an episode of dizziness. Dizziness can also be due to simply benign paroxysmal vertigo, a fairly harmless childhood disorder. It may be also due to nervous system diseases like multiple sclerosis. Hence dizziness in child cannot be ignored. Your child needs some more investigations. I suggest that you should consult a neurologist immediately."},{"Patient":"my husbands ct scan report says that there are old, lacunar infarcts in the posterior aspects of the corona radiata bilaterally. and that there is a moderate amount of patchy hypodensity in the periventricular and deep white matter of both cerebral hemispheres. what does this mean?","Doctor":"HIThank for asking to HCMI really appreciate your concern, you have not mentioned your husband's age and the clinical complain for what he has been gone for CT scan here the given report need to be correlate with the clinical complaints, just on the basis of given report it can be said that such findings are seen in old age patients and with the patient whom had history of TIA (Transient ischemic attack) due to hypertension, hope this information helps you, have nice day."},{"Patient":"Hi I m Heather 32, I had an appendectomy 4 weeks ago laproscopic.

I am an epillepsy patient . The first fits stoke I had in 1988. Generally the fits strokes were happening in the month of January and August, only and only during the first stage of sleep. Never ever I had a stroke when I am awake. As per the CT scan repot there is a calcified focus in the left posterior parietal region possibly old healed granuloma . Since 1997 till 2002 I was taking Zen Retard 400 mg 1 tab/day. Then till 2005 I took Zentard 200 mg 1 tab/day. During these days though i was feeling the pre stroke symptom such as blinking of eyes for few seconds, feeling confused, stress , an odd feeling of flying the body in air, feeling of the hands are too long etc, during the months of January and August only, but never had a fits stroke. Then the doctor advised to stop medicine. 1 month after stopping the medicine, i had a fits stroke. Ofcourse it was followed by sleeplessness for 2 days and intese work pressure. Then the doctor advised to continue Zen Retard 200 mg 1 tab/day again. I was frustrated and did not see the doctor after that and continued Zen Retard 200 mg 1tab/day till April 2009. Then stoped taking medicine. But 15 days after stopping the medicine, I had a fits stroke. I saw the doctor. The EEG report was normal. The advised it may be because of extra mental stress and lack of adequate sleep. I was prescibed Lonazep 2mg 1tab/day. Since then I have been taking that medicine. Now I have no pre stroke symptom anytime expect feeling very uneasy sometime when lack of sleep due to stress. But perhaps due to impact of medicine I get severe body pain in the morning.

Please advise.","Doctor":"Hi...Thanks for this query. As a patient of epilepsy you must know that before stopping any antiepileptic drugs (AED) there must be 5 years of seizure free interval as recommended by guidelines. Secondly by nature AED are CNS depressants & hence abruptly stopping any AED without dose reduction & proper taper may cause recurrence of seizure which evidently happened in your case. Third & most important point is Epilepsy either controlled or poorly controlled is an independent risk factor for Psychiatric problems; most common of which is depressive illness. Your current symptom profile of feeling excessively stressed out/overwhelmed, irritability, body pains, fatigue etc. are indicators that you are probably suffering from mild-moderate depression. Hence, you need to consult a Psychiatrist for a full formal evaluation & treatment of your stress related problems followed by evaluation by a MD (medicine) or DM (Neurology) doctor to decide upon whether you need further continued treatment with AED.

Your description is suggestive of a balance disorder called BPPV (benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) Our ear plays a vital role in maintaining the balance. It's done through the change in position of small calcium crystals inside the ear which occurs in accordance with the change in position of head. Sometimes the position of these calcium crystals (called otoliths)  may change following a sudden fall or head trauma and this causes disturbance in balance and vertigo like feeling especially when we use lifts or in flights.

The time between when the stroke occured and when emergency treatment is given greatly impacts the amount of damage done, as well as the number of complications that follow.Complications following a stroke depend not only on treatment, but also where in the brain the stroke occurred. A stroke can damage the brain's ability to communicate with the rest of the body. Because a stroke will typically damage only certain areas of the brain, resulting complications tend to be clustered—whatever part of the body or body function that the damaged part of the brain controls will be affected. This could mean loss of muscle control of one side of the body, a loss of the muscles that control speech, or other muscle groupings. A stroke may also affect the area of the brain that controls a particular cognitive skill, such as memory or mood stability.I will suggest you to take your father to any psychologist to get him motivated to take further treatment.

This is because the muscle fibres in our hands and arms constantly contract and relax at random. It becomes a problem only when shakiness of our hands begins to interfere with writing, holding a cup of coffee or using a spoon. When people notice their hands are shaky, they often start to worry that they have Parkinson’s disease, but this is usually not the case.If you are worried about shakiness, consult your doctor rather than try to work out the cause yourself. There are many varieties of shakiness that are difficult to describe, but doctors can recognize the common types easily from experience. Also, some simple tests, such as a blood test for thyroid overactivity, might be appropriate. Your doctor may use the word ‘tremor’ to describe shakiness that consists of small movements. There are also some exercises which may be prescribed to you by your doctor.Also try not to get nervous or conscious about it and focus on some other task while you use your hands. All the best.

That's why it takes so long to diagnose, it's because of the lack of symptoms,Off center pain in that region is usually muscular in origin. Did she hurt her back? Has she had a fall recently? It also may be that she is developing disc issues in that region as well. A physical exam from a goof spine specialist will help rule that out.All in all. Pain is never something to run from, but it's one of the few symptoms which make a physician think LESS about cancer in the begging stages.If she is scared to go to the doctor, she can have a conversation with me or any of the other Neuro and Ortho Spine guys we have at HealthCareMagic.

I am so sorry to hear about your husbands pain and dizziness. Indeed it is rare to have those symptoms in that mix.

If there is compression of the spinal cord in the region of the neck, the cord might become irritated and cause the dizziness.Therefore I am quite curious as to what the scan from the neurologist showed?

The hemangioma is an incidental finding and shouldn't cause you any trouble unless it is growing.

Another common drug treatment is midodrine. Other  treatments include \\"head-up tilt\\" (elevating the head of the whole bed by about 10 degrees), salt tablets or increasing salt in the diet, generous intake of fluids, and pressure (elastic) stockings.

Is their treatment and what would be his outward symptom. he has traumatic diffuse axonal shear injury with decreased white matter. will he develop demential in later years. What is the prognosis?","Doctor":"Hi. I am so sorry to hear about your sons head injury. Diffuse Axonal Injury is a pretty tough issue to deal with. I hope he is getting his physical therapy and occupational therapy.Now, on to the 'encephalomalacia' and 'gliosis'. The word 'Encephalomalacia' just means that there is a decreased amount of brain tissue in the region where they have noticed the encephalomalacia. Gliosis simply means that the glial cells (the helper cells for the neurons in the brain) have started migrating to the area to try and heal that region of the brain. So all in all you can take gliosis to mean that the brain is trying to fix itself in those regions.All of what you have mentioned here are natural outcomes of a Diffuse Axonal Injury. The symptoms are varied, but they can include things like severe fatigue, memory loss, confusion, movement disorders and emotional issues... It really depends on what part of the brain is affected. Since we are talking about the frontal lobe, i am a little more sanguine, because if only one of them is affected, there is a chance that the OTHER, UNAFFECTED lobe will take over and your son should recover quite well. The frontal lobe has alot of control over emotion, speech, decision making and in general what we call 'executive decision making', so you might expect to see issues there. The main thing you have to look into the prevention of os the development of \\"FrontoTemporal Degeneration\\" (FTD), that eventually leads to dementia.The single most effective intervention beyond initial emergency care is PHYSICAL, OCCUPATIONAL AND SPEECH THERAPY. Under no circumstances should thse things be neglected.I hope this helps.

My question is what can I do to help myself and often forget things and it scares me to death? How do you know the difference between just forgetting and Alzheimers? Thanking you in advance for your assistance.","Doctor":"Hi there, i understand your fears, given your family history. Let me see if I can give you some basic information so that you can do your best to modify your risk factors for Alzheimer's.No by far, AGE and GENETICS play the most important role in the development of the disease. But there's really nothing you can do about that, so lets get to the modifiable risk factors.1) Anything that is bad for your heart is bad for your brain.. specifically the blood vessels in your brain. So things like High Cholesterol, High blood pressure and smoking all damage the brain and increase the risk of Alzheimers. Now there are some claims in certain circles that smoking may have some mitigating effects on the development of the disease. But then again, cutting your foot off would have a mitigating effect in an infection in your toe. So all in all, I don't think it's worth it2) Regular exercise. There have been plenty of twin and cohort studies showing that the development of Alzheimer's is delayed or prevented by people who do regular cardiovascular exercise. Now remember, you must make sure you clear an exercise regime with your doctor BEFORE you start one.3) There have been a few studies which show that maintaining a good close social circle and staying intellectually active helps delay the onset and prevent the onset of the disease. So do yourself a favor, call that old high school friend and discuss that new book that you've been reading. 4) Avoid Head Trauma.... yea.. literally a no-brainer... As far as diagnosis goes (the difference between forgetting and actually having the disease). A complete medical history is your first step. Then your primary doctor will want to do mental status testing, a physical and neurological exam and maybe tests (such as blood tests and brain imaging) to rule out other causes of dementia-like symptoms.The diagnosis is a clinical one, so a neurologist would eventually need to get involved and interpret all the testing. Also, you have to remember, forgetting things is just ONE of the symptoms, and not even a very important one. Problem solving issues, like being unable to think your way through common life challenges, etc is a every important component to the disease.I hope this helps.

There is mild polypoid mucosal disease involving the floor of the maxillary sinuses.. What does it mean.. Am so panic please help..thanks Drss...","Doctor":"Hi, first off DONT PANIC.Let me see if I can give you some basic information that will put you at ease and help you develop you game plan on how to deal with it.Your nose is a pretty amazing organ. It's not only responsible for the obvious stuff like breathing and smell. It also is very important in filtering out the nasty dust particles and infections that are in the air. It also protects the lungs by moistening and warming the air that you breath in.The maxillary sinuses are naturally occurring air spaces that help warm and moisten the air as you breath and they help your voice carry by resonating when you speak. The thing is... those sinuses are lined with layers of what we call 'MUCOSAL TISSUE'. This mucosal tissue is there basically to keep the sinus clean and make sure no gunk builds up inside of it. What the report seems to indicate is that some of the mucosal tissue in the sinuses has started overgrowing a bit and forming into tiny bumps called polyps. Those polyps normally form when you have allergies or when you have alot of sinus infections. When those polyps grow into the nose , they can mess with your sense of smell.Most of the time the polyps can be dealt with by dealing with the underlying cause (if you've got allergies, treat those, if it's infections, antibiotics, etc). Occasionally you need surgery on the polyps that can remove them. The surgery is done on the inside of the nose using endoscopes and is called a Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS). But that's rare.Overall, I think your best plan here is to take this report back to the ENT and see if they can prescribe you a set of medications that will hopefully make the polyps shrink a bit, or at least stop growing. If that doesn't work, the surgery might be whats needed. I hope this helps.

I started feeling discomfort and the pressure on my forehead after I went to bed last night (around midnight.) I woke up feeling the pressure and started feeling nervous and scared. I could not fall asleep right away. I was shaking for awhile too. Right now, I feel better but still feel a little warm on my forehead, with slight pressure at forehead.","Doctor":"Hi there, am so sorry to hear about your fall. From what you have described here. It sounds like you might be suffering from Post Concussion Syndrome (PCS). This is just a fancy way of saying that you might have a bit of bruising and irritation of the brain and surrounding tissues in the region of the injury. This is actually pretty common after most head injuries especially in the young. It almost always resolves in 5-7 days without any issues. I would expect the same to happen for you.If the symptoms last longer than that, then you need to go see your primary care doctor and get a CT scan of the brain to make sure there isn't something else going on in there.As far as the knee goes. If the pain and swelling last much beyond a week after the injury, then you need x-rays of the knee and you will probably need a knee brace. Beyond that, it depends on what they find on the x-rays.All in all, don't worry. Give your brain and knee some time to rest. Use the OTC painkillers to deal with the knee pain. If the symptoms last beyond a week in either issue, make an appointment to go see your primary doctor.I hope this helps.

Her 67 year old mother is also taking care of her and would like to see some form of progress, such as some form of speech and mobility can you give a suggestion.","Doctor":"Hi, Bless you for caring for this woman. I am so sorry to hear about her problems.Let me see if i can help you by giving you some basic information about the rehabilitation process post stroke and post surgical decompression.Medications to prevent another stroke are just one part of the process. The other (and equally important part) is PHYSICAL THERAPY. The patient needs to be in intense Speech and physical therapy so that the brain is encouraged to remap lost neurons to other functional ares of the brain.Studies show that even without PT and ST, the brains remapping window will linger for 6-8 months after the Cerebrovascular event. WITH PT and ST, that remapping process can end up going on for up to 24 months!So in the end, i don't deny that this is a really difficult situation for the patient, you and the family, but i believe intense PT and ST for up to 2 years is the patients best chance for recovery of functions.I hope this helps.

I am 31 years old and have a programmable VP shunt due to congenital hydrocephalus . It was placed in August 2009. I also have slit vents and stiff vents, so CT s are always normal. Over the past year or so I have begun to experience headaches at the shunt site on my head. They range from mildly annoying to almost debilitating. No OTC meds make them go away completely, although asprin and ibuprophin combo seems to work best. The only way to make it truly bearable when it gets bad it to put an ice pack on my head. I had a shunt series and CT done in November and they were both normal. It does not feel like a malfunction, and the is no positional aspect to it other than a great deal of dizziness and vertigo if I bend over and straighten up. Just curious if there is a known problem with shunt aches and if so what is the best course of treatment. Thanks so much for your time.","Doctor":"Hi, I'm sorry to hear about your shunt site pain. I am willing to bet that the most likely cause of these headaches is scarring and overgrowth of the tissue at the site of insertion or at the site of the Omaya reservoir. If there is no omaya, then the programmable valve may be irritating the tissue. Also, very rarely, if any sutures were used to tether the device in place at the insertion site, they may have caused some irritation before they dissolved. The question is. What can you do about it. I hesitate to recommend shunt revision because it's such an onerous thing that i would rather reserve it for an infection or a shunt malfunction.In a few cases, back in residency, we injected a steroid and an anesthetic beneath the tissues of the reservoir and that helped the patient. But steroid have there own complications, not the least of which is an increased tendency to get infected when the injections happen often.I wish I could be more helpful here. My best advice is to head back to your neurosurgeon and discuss if there is any local injection or treatment that could reduce the inflammation in that region of the scalp.I hope this helps.

Patient is administered anti-coagulant and anti -platlet (clexane inj and ecosprin tab) along with strocit inj.

Matter of fact hemiperasis has deteriorated to hemiplegia.

I need your suggestions about this issue.","Doctor":"Hi, I am so sorry to hear about your fathers hemiplegia. The treatment as far as medications seems to be going on as it should. But the most important part of long term recovery for a stroke patient is PHYSICAL THERAPY. He needs the services of a good physical therapist who will start with passive exercises and range of motion exercises and help your father regain his mobility. The physical therapist is not simply strengthening muscle here. What they are doing with these exercises is encouraging the brain to 'remap' the damaged nerve cells on to other undamaged ones. This process is slow and we normally see that the process stops on it's own after 6-8 months without PT. WITH PT we see that the remapping process can last up to 2 years and give many patients a great scope for recovery.So my advice is intensive, daily physical therapy for months and months. Passive and active, both.I hope this helps.

You then have to concider doing a fresh EEG .B ut i suggest u do a EEG now by consulting your doctor who had treated you or a neuro physician for once.You must supplement Vitamin c and vitamin b12. as tablets  in the morning  after breakfast, and two hours later you can take your regular medicines.Your diet must also include iron in the form of  vegetables like Palak ka sag.cooked well.or even grean leafy vegetables.Also fruit like chickoo has sufficent iron this must be for breakfast  because iron and vitamin c and b12 form a good combination at breakfast time to get 75% absorbed by our body."},{"Patient":"I have had three back surgeries, one for stenosis , two fusions.

I like to dance salsa, but I am Pilates instructor, as well. Three years ago, after dancing I have got a neck strain, after a month of no improvements I was suggested that I needed surgery to release the tension caused by the disc compression.

Paracetamol is metabolised by the liver and is hepatotoxic; side effects are multiplied when combined with alcoholic drinks, and very likely in chronic alcoholics or patients with liver damage. Prolonged daily use increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal complications such as stomach bleeding,and may cause kidney or liver damage.Dosages exceeding  325 mg of paracetamol should be avoided  due to risks of  hepatoxicity .Crocin is an antipyretic and analgesic which means it can bring down the body temperature and reduce pains but it is not a treatment for fever .It might be that the general disease is progressing to its next level and you are experiencing the abdominal complications .I recommend visiting your GP and get yourself clinically evaluated for the exact cause of the fever and the GI symptoms .Pantosec -D would help more if you are also experiencing nausea and vomiting and heartburn .I would suggest not to self medicate at this point .Thanks ."},{"Patient":"hello sir good evening i am suffering from back pain since years and months back i done MRI scan also the problem is mild that is disc bulge seen at - mildly narrowing bilateral neural recess. now i am taking antibiotic tab since months but no use, the pain is like that only and i left the job because of this problem. so what i want to do? which medicine i have to take?","Doctor":"Short answer: Stop antibioticsDetail  answer: I read your complaints.Please stop antibiotics first.Start to do back exercises  with the help of a physiotherapist.No bending, lifting heavy objects.Avoid sitting work and standing work  for more than an hour.Take good sleep.. dont sleep late .

I hope you are getting all the Anti-Tubercular Medications for the treatment of the infection. That's the most important because you need to avoid further damage to the spinal column and cord.Now, as to the pain. The main thing causing the pain is the collapse of the vertebral body. When it collapses it will begin pressing against the spinal column. The only non-pharmacological treatments that are effective in this case are Physical therapy (postural therapy in particular) and core strengthening exercises. Now remember you must go to e certified therapist to attempt these exercises as you don't want to make a mistake and injure your spinal coloumn even more.So, in effect, your best avenue for pain relief is Physical Therapy. I would call your primary doctor and get a referral for that as soon as you can.

I'm so sorry to hear about your sweatiness and shakiness. The first thing I would like to know is what your medical history is like. Are you diabetic by any chance? Many people who are diabetic (diagnosed or not) will get that feeling of shakiness when their blood sugar is low. Another possibility is heart issues. Have you had an EKG (Electrocardiogram) recently? Some people with recurrent arrythmias (where the hearts rhythm isn't regular) can have these kind of episodic bouts.There are also some medications that can cause these issues.So all in all, it's important to get some more information before I can try and drill down to a good plan for you to follow to figure this thing out. I hope this helps. If you want a detailed and personalized discussion about this or any aspect of your health try our Ask a Doctor option.

Thanks a lot","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for coming to HealthCareMagic.ComI'm sorry to hear about your mothers difficulties. There could be a few causes to this kind of pain.At this age anyone (but most commonly diabetics) can start developing a disease called Peripheral Neuropathy. This is a problem where the nerves in the leg are damaged. The damage can be caused by diabetes, but sometimes it is idiopathic (which simply means, \\"we don't know\\").Spinal cord issues including a pinched nerve in the lower back can also cause this kind of pain. Does your mother complain of back pain by any chance?The best thing for her to do would be to head to the doctor and have her pain looked at directly. At the office they can examine her legs and general health and maybe even get some testing done. tests like ElectroMyoGraphy (EMG) can be used to test the fucntion of the nerves in the leg. I am not saying that she needs this NOW. But after being examined the doctor may wish to get this done.So all in all.

I HAVE A FRIEND WHOSE DAUGHTER IS DIAGNOSED AS AUTISTIC AND IS HAVING SEIZURES.HER MEDICATION FOR SEIZURES WAS RECENTLY CHANGED AND NOW THEY ARE COMING MORE FREQUENTLY. MY FRIEND IS SEARCHING FOR AN ANSWER CAN YOU HELP HER? I'm GIVING YOU HER EMAIL ADDRESS.Oh! I didn't realize this was a pay per answer thing. sorry to bother you.","Doctor":"Hi. If you would like, you can ask your friend to publish her question to our public forums. Those are free, but unfortunately there is no guarantee that the question will be answered right away. From what you've said here. Let me try and give you some basic information. That you can transmit to your friend.The management of seizures through medication can be quite tricky. Medical science still doesn't know a single one shot cure-all for the problem since there are SO MANY different causes. When it comes to putting someone on a medication regime for epilepsy (seizure disorder), different medications will have different effects and it takes time (and quite alot of patience on the patient and families part) to get the right system down.The other thing is that when you change the medications, the older drugs will start getting washed out of the body while the newer drugs take time to build up to their therapeutic levels. So that might be a cause for the new cluster of seizures. It also may be that these new medications are just not working for the patient as well. I would recommend that your friend call back the Neurologist treating her Daughter and update her on the rebounding seizures. They can see if they want to stay the course for a bit longer and let the new drugs settle in. Or they can change the meds again.I hope that made some sense. Hope things get better for your friends daughter.

This will happen for a while and then it will go away for a few weeks. Any suggestions? I am not overweight and exercise daily.","Doctor":"hello and thank you for asking HCM,I undertsand your concern. You are probably experiencing low blood pressure when you stand up, called orthostatic hypotension. As a result, not enough blood reaches your brain, and you feel lightheaded or dizzy.Here are some advices: move gradually from lying down to sitting to a standing position, wiggle your toes and flex your feet before you stand up. This causes the muscles in your legs to squeeze more blood back up into your heart and to slightly raise blood pressure. Try to sleep with your head higher than your feet keeps blood pressure higher.Drink more fluids and perhaps increase your salt intake. Unless you have high blood pressure already, this is a good idea.Drink coffee in the morning. Caffeine boosts blood pressure.If these advices won't help than visit your GP to make a more detailed examination.I hope this answer was helpful to you."},{"Patient":"hi.kindly pls help with the result of my urinalysis: appearance:yellow,hazy..pH 6.0, sP gravity 1.030biochemical -all negativeWBC - 0-2  RBC 1-3  sqaumous cells 0-1 urothelial cells 0  no organisms seen  no casts seen..amorphous deposits +..pls tell me whats wrong cause i've been experiencing abdominal pain","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.Your urine analysis does not confirm urinary tract infection. However it does not rule it out either. To make sure, urine culture test needs to be done.Abdominal pain can be caused by many issues, not only UTI.

I am having serious problems with neck and back pain due to degenerative disk disease in my C6 and C7.  I am trying to manage the pain and spasm with medications including anti inflammatory, muscle relaxants and some sort of nerve calming drug.  The cocktail makes it impossible for me to function at home or at work.  I have been waiting almost 2 years for an MRI.  I have no private insurance.  my income is low due to my inability to work many hours.  My question is , do I qualify for disability and is there a surgical procedure I could have that could relive some of my symptoms and reduce the pain to a more tolerable level.  How can I make this happen, I have no family doctor.  I am 42 and feel like life is passing by and I do not want to be disabled but it there is no medical solution, I need financial help.  Thank you for your time, Sincerely Suzanne Charlebois","Doctor":"Hi Suzanne. My name is Vinay. I am sorry to here about your disc degeneration. There are many different types of surgeries that can be done to help control the pain that you are suffering from but none of them can be attempted before you get that MRI. The Surgeon needs to know what kind of nerve compression is causing the pain and the stiffness and needs to be able to plan out the surgery using the pictures that are given with the MRI.Now when it comes to insurance. I am no expert on health insurance and I wish I had some easy quick fix place that you could go to. My best advice is to  check in with your local Public clinic (which i'm betting you have already done).The only other thing I could possible suggest is that you look to getting treated in another country. There are companies that can arrange for travel and surgery to other countries to get treatment at a fraction of the cost of the same treatment in the United States. The whole concept is called medical tourism. You could look into it if you want. See if that works out better for you.I hope this helps.

This can be done by checking your blood sugar (with a glucometer) whenever you have these symptoms.In addition, it may be useful to do a sleep study (polysomnography) to exclude a sleep disorder.Seizure is less likely the problem in your case, as the duration of symptoms in seizures is usually a few minutes and not three hours.I hope my answer helps.

I have every three months an MRI, what are the health risk of these if any, MRI s. Also does scar tissue cause headaches. And last. Does scar tissue grow in my case and if so, what medical treatments are used?","Doctor":"Hi there! My name is Vinay. Let me see if I can give you some peace of Mind here.MRI's all depend on Magnets! No radiation and they are pretty harmless. The only thing you have to make sure is that you have no implants that could be attracted by the magnet in the machine. When I was in residency in Colorado, the duty doc room used to be taken up by my cheif and his girlfriend.. so i used to sleep in the MRI machine!! It was the only flat surface other than the gurneys in the ER. So don't worry, the MRI is harmless.Now the scar tissue at the operative site should not be causing any headaches as it's not under pressure and brain tissue can't feel normal sensations like pain. If you are having headaches.. look into any problems with the scalp wound or the bone (Skull) that they had to go through during the surgery.Scar tissue can hypertrophy (grow in size) over time, but its really rare and really really slow. So the MRI's will catch it if it does. Not to worry there.So relax, the scar tissue is harmless and so is the MRI. Make sure you get those scans done just as the doctors tell you too!Congratulations on beating back the GBM! I wish you the best of luck!"},{"Patient":"I m 36 years old female, 55 kg and 163 cm.

The intervertebral discs and facet joints are affected with this degenerative disorder. You are probably having lumbar spondylosis.The symptoms associated with lumbar spondylosis can vary with activity levels and weather influences. Morning stiffness is a common complaint of lumbar spondylosis. Stiffness and pain in the lower back pain that runs into the pelvis area and buttocks (sciatica) may be a major component in lumbar spondylosisIt may become very painful to lift any weight or bend making it sometimes difficult to perform basic daily activities. Sleeping or lying down can get painful (which is happening in your case) as the disease progresses and it can cause spinal deformity.Full clinical assessment is highly recommended to guide most effective management of the problem and ensure the best long term outcome.Due to the degenerative nature of this problem it cannot be ‘cured’. However after proper examination by a Experienced Physiotherapy team, they can help to reduce your pain, restore your range of movement, improve your posture and work on your core strength.Treatment can involve massage, mobilisation, heat/cold, manipulation, postural advice and exercise.They also work pro-actively to assist with weight control, strengthening and increasing your flexibility to allow you to maintain a healthy spineAlso consult a good spine surgeon who after assessment of your condition may take you for surgery.RegardsDr Santosh"},{"Patient":"This is my MRI results and I wanted to know what the meaning of this is.

Is it safe for a person with epilepsy to take benzonatate??The side effects appear to be somewhat dangerous. What about about fluticasone propionate? The side effects on that appear to be somewhat scary.","Doctor":"So both of these drugs are generally safe for use in Epileptics. Benzonatate is going to numb the nerves which are irritated and causing your cough (i assume a cough was the reason for the prescription). It shouldn't be used for a very long time. If your cough persists, please talk to your doctor. Fluticasone is a drug, very similar to a steroid which is generally prescribed for Asthmatics and/or people suffering from a disease called COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). It is usually inhaled since its absorption through the gut is poor.Fluticasone is a drug which should be used very carefully under physician supervision, especially if you have liver problems (because your liver has to break the drug down). Using it may require your doctor to change the dosage of your anti-epileptic medication (or medications)Overall I would say that they are both safe to use under medical supervision and with regular checkups by your doctor."},{"Patient":"My husband recently had a ct scan at ER showed L4-5 degenetive disc disease with moderate diffuse protusion of disc material centrally and bilaterally is this something that needs looked at by a neurosurgeon quickly?

You have to make sure that the 'Physical symptoms' match the problems that are showing up on the scan. The L 4-5 disc will affect nerves that supply sensation to the outer sides of the thighs and the legs. Does your husband have any pain in those parts? Or any weakness in the muscles of the legs? If he does then yes. I'd say you need to get to an Ortho-spine surgeon or Neurosurgeon who deals with the spine as soon as possible.If he doesn't have symptoms. I still want you to get him looked at.

I take Lyrica 250 mg twice a day. The last year the pain seems to be getting worse. The change in the weather the wind blowing, cool air off of the ac kills me. Sometimes the pain can just start with the snap of your fingers. How do I find out whats wrong.","Doctor":"Hi. I'm so sorry to hear about your nerve pain. Let me see if I can point you in the right direction. Nerve pain that seems to 'go all over' is commonly described by the term \\"Fibromyalgia\\". That is probably the diagnosis that your doctor gave you when he/she prescribed the medication Lyrica. We don't have a perfect understanding of WHY these kinds of nerve pains happen and the drug is used basically to tone down the pain from those nerves with the problem.Other drugs like Gabapentin have been used to treat the same issue and it's up to your doctor to see if that is the right solution for you (ie switching the drug). Also there is a good amount of research that shows depression can either cause Fibromyalgia or make it worse. So you might want to talk to your doctor about that if you feel that fits your profile. Lastly, again there is quite a bit of research showing that regular exercise and weightloss can help combat Fibromyalgia. So if you think you might be able to put in a bit more exercise or need to lose a bit of weight, talk to your doctor and see about getting yourself on an exercise regime. That should help the pain as well.I hope this helps.

Sudden onset of numbness of big toe indicates damage to/compression of its nerve supply, due to either, 'pinching' of the nerve locally or at the lower spinal level.

What do you think about me going on methadone?","Doctor":"Methadone is effective drug for pain of peripheral neuropathies but the greatest drawback of this medicine is that it can lead to addiction and tolerance. Tolerance means the efficacy of the drug will diminish gradually when it is used for a long period. There are other drugs such as Amitriptyline , carbamazipine, Gabapentin may be also effective and they can be tried as a substitute for methadone. Further potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as indomethacin have been also successfully used in peripheral neuropathies.

I was treated with an endovascular coiling and they used 2 2mm coils. It was very small but it did rupture and it needed treatment.

I have had a difficult time over the past 8 months dealing with a tremendous amount of stress at the work place and at home.

What the hell is going on with me?","Doctor":"Hello, and thank you for consulting Healthcaremagic. I believe you are suffering chronically from anxiety; the recent episode was quite likely a panic attack. The hemorrhage you suffered 5 years ago may have resulted in some brain changes which contribute to your anxiety.  There is no way to be certain, and it doesn't really matter. What matters is getting the anxiety and panic under control.Obviously you have been excessive with your use of pot recently. Marijuana can assist in the control of anxiety, but, as with all things, moderation is key.Often the dosage and effects of orally ingested pot (as in pot butter), are much greater than when it is smoked.My suggestion is to be consistent with your use of pot, if you intend to continue using it, and avoid excessive amounts. You should ask around for the name of a good therapist who can help you understand and control your anxiety and panic. This is essential. There are very effective techniques out there!If you continue to lose weight unintentionally, discuss this with your physician.Best of Luck.... and hope this has helped.ez"},{"Patient":"I m wondering if I should take Risedronate?

I've been wondering why when I get angry or upset my arm and fingers tingle.  It makes me worry because the tingle kinda hurts and my chest hurts as well. Please can you tell me why I get this tingling sensation?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understand your concern.You have to understand that hyperventilation is one of the least understood anxiety issues.It occurs when you breathe out too much carbon dioxide. While your body does need oxygen and generally breathes out CO2, your body needs a healthy amount of CO2 as well. When you hyperventilate, those balances are thrown off.When you have an anxiety attack/panic attack, you'll often find that you're breathing incredibly fast, and that may cause you to hyperventilate.During an anxiety attack, you may feel like you're not getting enough air, and that may cause you to try to take deeper breaths. Unfortunately, in many cases you did already have enough air and that sensation was misleading, so your response makes your hyperventilation worse.Since tingling hands is most commonly caused by hyperventilation, you should start by gaining control of your breathing.1.Take slower breaths is a start. Also, try not to breathe in through your chest as much. It may feel like you're not getting a full breath, but remember that hyperventilation causes the feeling of needing more air, even though the opposite is true.2. You should also start walking. Make sure that you're getting good blood flow. As the muscles work, your breathing will often become a bit healthier, and your hyperventilation should decrease. Once you've got your tingling hands under control, it's time to work on the anxiety itself.Hope this helps.Please write back for further queries.Wishing you good health."},{"Patient":"Hi there I am on both 300g convulex in the morning & 500g at night as well as Lamitor 150g at night.

High blood pressure could also predispose to these changes on MRI brain.As of now, you could take anti-migraine treatment, and control your BP.I hope it helps.Best wishes,Dr Sudhir kumar MD DM (Neurology)Senior Consultant Neurologist"},{"Patient":"My wife has memory losses that sound like TGA.

Also what is the basal arteries are patent? I also have numbness and weakness on my legs but more on the right side.","Doctor":"Hi ! Good morning . I am Dr Shareef answering your query. The report shows some amount of lack of proper blood supply to the neural cells of some part of the brain. This could be due to any pathology of the blood vessels like arteriosclerosis due to very many regions. Basal arteries are one of the major arteries of brain and cervical region. These arteries are normal as per the report of patency of these vessels.These findings could also be just incidental findings where as your symptoms could be due to cervical spondylitis but there is no mention of that in the report.The significance of these findings could be co related only by physical examination and some other investigations if need be by the treating doctor. If I were your doctor, I would also advise very much against smoking and alcohol if you do consume any of these. Management of your symtoms could either be physiotherapy and some neuro vitamins along with some anti inflammatory drugs if need be. These could be decided by the doctor who treats you after a physical examination and some routine investigations including a blood sugar test.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in solving this problem.

The only way the two- fall with head injury and memory problems- could be related is, if the fall led to head injury with brain damage, and you are now having seizures (post traumatic seizures).

This could show any past brain damage (gliotic changes).Doing an EEG would help to exclude any epilepsy.

When you get out of bed, sit on the side of the bed for a few seconds to gain your orientation and allow your circulatory system to adjust.* When walking, focus on distant objects. Do not look down at your feet. Avoid walking in dark areas or on unstable ground. * Use a cane, walking stick, or walker for support and to give additional pressure and touch (tactile) orientation.* Avoid activities that move the head up and down repetitively.* Try to avoid keeping the head tilted back for long periods of time, for example painting or dusting above your head.* Be cautious when using medications that may cause balance problems as a side effect.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"My 3 year old just had an episode that began with her legs shaking in a way that scared her and made her dad pick her up.

However, I wish to reassure you that it is not due to any serious problem of brain, as both CT and MRI scan of your brain are normal.The most likely cause for your symptoms could be chronic migraine. This would improve with medications such as beta blockers, flunarizine or divalproex, which reduce the frequency and severity of headaches. If medications do not help, then, botox injections would be helpful.For relief of headache, you can take rizatriptan tablets.I hope my answer helps.

My report reads as follows sounds like a lot of things are going on. Made an Appt to see my Doc on the 24th of this month. here is my report a mild upper thoracic levoconvex curvature. There is a mild kyphosis at the T11-12 level. The cord demonstrates normal size and signal characteristics. Mild acute, Modic type I endplate degeneration is seen about the anterosuperior endplate of T12. No suspicious marrow infiltration is seen. There is mild lower thoracic endplate degeneration including small Schmorl's nodes. Multilevel disc desiccation is seen within the thoracic spine with mild loss of height.At T2-3, left greater than right facet arthropathy is seen without spinal canal narrowing. Mild left- sided foraminal stenosis is seen without nerve root impingement.At T6-7, a tiny right central disc protrusion is seen which flattens the right paramedian thecal sac without cord compression or foraminal stenosis.At T7-8, a tiny right central disc protrusion is seen which indents the thecal sac without cord compression. Facet arthropathy is seen without foraminal stenosis.At T9-10, a central disc protrusion is seen with an annular disc fissure. This indents the thecal sac and gently contacts the ventral thoracic cord without compression. Facet arthropathy is seen without foraminal stenosis.T11-12, a tiny disc bulge is seen with flattening of the thecal sac but no lower thoracic cord compression or foraminal stenosis.Review of the remaining levels reveals less prominent discogenic and facet degeneration without significant spinal stenosis, cord compression or nerve root impingement. In comparison to the 2009 study, degeneration has progressed.Evaluation of the paraspinal soft tissues is unremarkable.IMPRESSION:Progressive thoracic endplate, discogenic and facet degeneration including small disc herniations, notable at T9-10 where a central disc herniation and annular disc fissure contacts the ventral cord without compression or nerve root impingement.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your query.I agree that the MRI spine report is long and reports a lot of abnormalities. However, they are minor in nature and there is no need to worry about them.These abnormalities are due to degeneration of vertebral bodies and discs (located in between the bones over back). As a result, there is mild compression or pinching of nerves in the back. This is giving rise to the pain.Treatment would require medications such as pregabalin capsules for pain relief. In addition, physiotherapy with back extension exercises would also help.I hope my answer helps.

I am Dr Saumya Mittal.Read your query. That is a very significant question and i appreciate your problem. I will try my best to answer your queryFirst and foremost my sympathies about your mother's condition.As for them keeping her \\"dry\\", i must explain to you that though that is not the standard protocol, that is entirely up to your doctor to decide. You must understand that bleeding in the brain is not an easy and safe problem. Maybe its a small bleed and possibly your mother seems active.But there is always, the possibility that she may develop seizures or become unconcious, or they may simply need to operate her.In any of these situations, if there is food in her stomach, the chances are high that her stomach comments may regurgitate and enter the lungs thereby making the situation even more complex- something called as aspiration.So I would suggest that you definitely go by the doctors orders.For better opinion I would need to see the MRI/CT that they have done.

It is common reaction in such situations, especially she needle is used.However, to rule out other neurological problems, I suggest to do : - EEG- further consultation with neurologist- blood sugar tests- monitor the blood pressureIf everything is OK, then, it might be   due to oscillation in blood pressure ( hypotension) when doing tattoo.By the way, get screened for hep.C as it is common in people with tattoo.Dr.Albana"},{"Patient":"hello my name is matthew I had a hydrosectimy surgry one year ago.

The surgery you had 1 year ago, may not be related with the present pain. It appears to be the hernia into the surgical incision, or may be independent of it.

You may need to have an M.R.I, for diagnosis.                        If it is hernia, you may need to have one more surgery for correction.

I have had for as long as I can remember..... but in recent weeks I suppose ive become more aware of it. Just wondering what it possibly could be if anything.. or is it just they way of my anatomy.","Doctor":"Hi,The lump you are referring to is most probably the seventh cervical vertebra. The cervical spine is made up of seven vertebrae and extends from the base of the skull to the base of the neck. The seventh cervical vertebra (C7) is also called the vertebra prominens because it is more prominent than other cervical vertebrae.  The spinous process (bones that project off the back of the vertebral body) in C7 stick out farther than the spinous processes of the other cervical vertebrae. In fact, the spinous process of C7 can be seen and felt beneath the skin. It is probably this which you are suspecting to be a lump. There is no need to worry as it is a normal finding.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"i have arachnoiditis from pantopaque dye (a petroleum base iodine contrast ) that was injected in my lumbar spine with two doses and the table was tilted upside down to reach my cervical spine I was instructed to hold my head up so the pantopaque dye dosent go into my brain unfortunately instead of removing the dye within 30 min itwas left in my spine for two and a half months and twenty doctors later, until a neuro-surgeon sent me to a second neuro-surgeon at NYU to corroborate his diagnosis and treatment plan to remove the dye. p.s. the first neuro-surgeon attempted to remove the dye and did it by feel without the aid of fluroscopy and stabbed me in my spinal chord. I screamed - he took out the needle without removing the dye. It is now thirty-five years later. I ve been diagnosed with cancer of the brain, cancer of the spine (incorrect), multiple sclerosis, spinal stenosis, three herniated discs, scoliosis. By the way, the reason I went for a mylogram thirty years ago was for a numbness in my left thigh which disappeared two weeks later. I was in excruciating pain after the procedure and I had l05 degree fever. At the present time, my pain is mainly in my feet and toes. It feels like a thousand needles stabbing and burning. I should also add I have neuropathy and find it impossible to balance and walk due to this and the pain. I was allergic to Lyrica - my tongue started to swell up and had a hard time trying Neurotin. It made me very lethargic. I also was treated with ten 80 miligrams of Oxycontin and 8 thirty miligrams of Oxycodin which I got off of because I told the doctor I lept building up a tolerance for the drug and required higher and higher doses which caused me to develop a paralytic colon or sluggish colon. I am still taking one 30 miligram tablet at night with a ten miligram valium. A neurologist at Cornell is suggesting I take Cymbalta, 30 miligrams once a day. I am trying to stop the Oxycodin and Valium which takes the edge off the pain in my feet. I looked up Cymbalta to see if there would be a problem stopping the drug if I had to. To my dismay, the doctor on the internet said that it is nearly impossible to wean off of because of the doses of 60 miligrams and 30 miligrams, resulting in horrible withdrawal symptoms. What do you suggest? Please help - desperate and broke.","Doctor":"Hi,Cymbalta is certainly a good option for you. It is used very commonly and there are no problems in tapering it off. It is not like opioids and even if it is stopped abruptly, there are only minor discontinuation symptoms. It is not habit forming and one does not develop tolerance to it. If you are still worried and would prefer a medicine that is available in a wider range of dose strengths then you can try amitryptiline (Elavil), which also works well in neuropathic pain.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"Why does it seem so difficult for family members to understand and cope with a veteran with ptsd and brain injury?

It is often difficult for family members to accept people with PTSD, brain damage or other such disorders as most of them do not understand what the patient is going through. Sharing reading material about the disease, symptoms and management amongst the family members can help them become aware of what this is all about.

As you mentioned that her seizures are back with more intensity, and the nature is different now, so , you should preffrably  see a neurologist and take consultation before starting drugs. She should also get an MRI brain to rule out any organicity, get her liver function test and blood counts (prior to starting drugs). I know it is very difficult to take long term medication but it is really important for her to remain seizure free. Every seizure destroys some brain cells, and thereby making her prone to get more of them. Apart from drugs you should see that she dosent drive for some time now, operates machinery under supervision.Please try to cut expenses on other things and ask her to take medicine, she needs them.

In a small minority of patients, the seizures do not get controlled wit medications, and a surgery may be required.In your case, headache is not linked to the cortical dysplasia, and may be due to migraine or tension headache, which can be treated with medications.I also agree that biopsy is not needed, unless the abnormality is getting worse over time (which is not the case with you).I hope my answer helps.

Would it prudent to have it removed before it gets larger?                              3. Could it be removed without destabilizing my back and requiring more fusions which I really want to avoid?         Thank You                                    Jack,","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your query.I have noted your clinical details.It is unlikely that a small intradural schwannoma would cause so much of pain and other symptoms.If the tumor is pressing on the nerve, then, a pain in the distribution of the nerve may occur, but that can not explain the widespread pain that you have.If it is not growing in size, surgery is not needed, as there is a small risk of complications during the surgery.I hope my reply has helped you.I would be pleased to answer, if you have any follow up queries or if you require any further information.     Best wishes,Dr Sudhir Kumar MD (Internal Medicine), DM (Neurology)Senior Consultant NeurologistApollo Hospitals, Hyderabad,For DIRECT QUERY to me:   My blog:"},{"Patient":"I have had a bump on the top of my head for 20+ years, over the past 10 years it has been growing it is now maybe a 1/2\\" wide and 3/8\\" tall, and over the past 3 years another one has been growing rapidly on the side of my head and is now about the size of the other one.

So there is a high possibility that the scab is due to the dried up pus. See, scab is basically a clot that uses up the surrounding cells and substances to form when it solidifies. So if there was pus, it may have got included in the clot and used the colour pigment to become yellow.I hope this helps you.

I have been suffering from a severe twitching in the inside of my right forearm just below the elbow for about 3 weeks now. It seems to be worse when I´m not moving.I´ve had a look online and it appears it could be an ulnar nerve problem. I´ve tried to find some ides for treatment without going to a physio but there is so much info it´s a bit confusing.I´ve never suffered this type of injury before but in the last two years I´ve been susceptible to achilles tendonitus.I´d appreciate some advice if possible.Many thanks, Steve","Doctor":"Hi thereI am Dr Mittal.I will try to help you and explain you the condition.First, there is always a possibility of the ulnar nerve entrapment. There might be a problem like tennis elbow. Here the muscle in the elbow is hurt, and the nerve below it may hurt. So if you are lifting heavy weights, there may be a problem and cause pain and tingling and numbness of the arm.Second there is a possibility that the condition is due to the possibility of a radiculopathy. The radiculopathy is due to a pain in the neck. There may not always be a pain in the neck. But the space between the vertebra may have reduced or calcified causing problem in the nerve, There is increased pressure in the nerve tissue causing tingling and numbnessThird there may be some infection or inflammation in the path of the nerves. This may be irritating the nerve causing the symptoms, especially since you have the symptoms when at rest.I am sorry, but a detailed examination may be needed to deifferentiate between these causesI would suggest the following tests1. NCV of the affected arm2. Complete hemogram3. Vitamin B12 and Folate4. X ray cervical spine (MRI is a better test)5. Sugars6. Thyroid testI hope this helps you.

In fact the sudden onset of loss of conciousness with breathing disorder may point to lung and/or heart problemSecond, the loss of conciousness usually means a brain problem. There may be a stroke, which may bot show up in a ct scan for 6-24 hours. or there may be an infection like meningoencephalitis. An MRI would be a better test.Third, there may be some metabolic derangement. I would suggest checking his electrolytes and ABG (arterial blood gas).There may be a possibility that he has indeed aspirated, which may show a little late on the chest x ray. The abnormal aspiration causes reduced oxygen supply to the brain, causing loss of conciousness.

Often, sitting the patient up and dangling legs over the bedside can reduce blood pressures below dangerous levels and provide partial symptom relief. Tight clothing and stockings should be removed. Straight Catheterization of the bladder every 4 to 6 hrs, or relief of a blocked urinary catheter tube may resolve the problem. The rectum should be cleared of stool impaction, using anaesthetic lubricating jelly. If the noxious precipitating trigger cannot be identified, drug treatment is needed to decrease elevating intracranial pressure until further studies can identify the cause.Drug treatment includes the rapidly acting vasodilators, including sublingual nitrates or oral clonidine. Ganglionic blockers are also used to control sympathetic nervous system outflow. Topical nitropaste is a convenient and safe treatment—an inch or two can be applied to the chest wall, and wiped off when blood pressures begin to normalize.

Please get back if you have any follow up queries or if you require any additional information.Wishing you good health,Dr Sudhir Kumar MD (Internal Medicine), DM (Neurology)Senior Consultant NeurologistApollo Hospitals, Hyderabad, IndiaClick on this link to ask me a DIRECT QUERY:  BLOG:"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor My daughter had siezers first time. Doctir considers it as epilepsy and treated. She went for ct scan. Here is the impression of it. Mild diffuse cerebral edema. She is now under valparin 300mg twice a day. Let me know what does it mean","Doctor":"Mild cerebral edema is swelling of the brain tissue. This can happen from various reasons. In your daughter's case this could be due to Seizures. Most of the time this improves on its own, depending on the cause. As long she is improving with no persistent drowsiness or irritability, I would not worry too much. Make sure she is taking her Valparin regularly and also reviewed by her doctor so her seizures are under control."},{"Patient":"I m sorry this is so long but thought the details important. In January of 2013, I tripped over my laptop cord and went flying into our dining room table that has a sharp edge and broke my nose. It happened so quickly that I don t know how I also managed to hit the back upper side of my head (maybe on one of the chairs?), nearly broke my left knee and suffered bruising on my right arm, hip and thigh. I didn t go to the ER because when I called them, they said I would be waiting for hours and the waiting room was full of flu patients. The cut across my nose was pretty clean, not gaping. My husband helped get the bleeding stopped. I did look as though I had been beaten severely the next day with major black eyes and bruising in the other areas. I was surprised at how sore the back of my head was since there wasn t even a slight bump. I didn t think much about it as I gradually improved. On July 1 of 2013 my husband and I flew to Wisconsin from Texas and then back again after 6 days. Upon arriving in WI, I started having terrible headaches and confusion. Within 4 days of returning to Texas, my husband had to take me to the ER because the headache pain was unbearable and sudden very high blood pressure. The ER got me stable with BP meds, fluids and 3 doses of morphine. I don t remember any of that. My husband said I kept trying to pull the IV s out. I saw my PCP the next day and he sent me for an MRI which showed I had a subdural hematoma with a thin layer of blood covering my entire brain. I had been taking lots of advil and aspirin for the pain.The neurosurgeon I was referred to said DO NOT take either because of the bleed. He decided not to do surgery but put me on Keppra to reduce the chances of seizures and have follow up CT scans and visits to see him. My PCP put me on Lisinipril for the BP before I saw the NS. I ve had 2 catscans since the MRI and they show improvement. But I m still having periods of confusion, occasional but not constant high BP (I have always had low BP) and mild headaches. I am now off of the Keppra but am taking 1/2 of a 2.5 Lisiniprol when the BP goes up. I am also more depressed than usual (I have fibromylagia, hypothyroidism, and IBS). I am 62, female and concerned that I might never be normal again because of the continuing confusion and memory problems that I didn t have before all of this happened. The neurosurgeon said I may or may not improve further.","Doctor":"hi therei am Dr Saumya MittalI have read your detailed query And I need to say the information is quite aptly putI will start by first stating that the symptoms are probably due to the hematoma. understand that the skull is a closed space in which the brain is placed. So any added matter in a closed space will increase the pressure. that is a basic law of physics. As long as the blood remains inside, the pressure will be high. This therefore causes pain and discomfort. headache is due to this.As for improvement, I cannot surely say, because i have not seen the mri. However you may talk to your neurosurgeon about elective surgery and drainage of bloodi am hoping your thyroid and bp is under control."},{"Patient":"hi sir, DILO BM is suggested to my dad by a dotor, he has slight block in his brain and has been taking medication for that and has undergone engeo plastry. can he take DILO BM? he has been given SAFECET and Asthlin with DILO BM Waiting for your response... Regards Hema","Doctor":"hi HemaI am not sure exactly what you mean by \\"slight block\\" in brain. i am assuming you mean he has had a stroke. and an ischemic stroke at that. So you might want to confirm that assumption when reading the further suggestionHe is on safecet, asthalin and dilo bm has ambroxol, so i am assuming he ahs an associated respiratory condition like asthma, copd etcI will therefore suggest that you can give it to him,However do talk to your neurologist, because i am unaware from your query as to the stage of block. occasionally ambroxol has a sedative action or may cause vertigohence neurologist may avoid this medicineBest of luckDr Saumya Mittal"},{"Patient":"My son is 3 years old. He had feburile seizure 2 times in a day due to high fever, just a month back. Doctor has suggested me to give valparin syrup for one year. Please let me know the side effects of it. I am observing restlessness in him. Whether it will effect his studies. I had taken admission in ICSE board. Whether he will be able to manage the studies. Also want to know whether the feburile seizure will have life long effect on my child. After stopping the medicine whether the side effect will remain or he will become normal as earlier.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for asking question on health care magic.Febrile seizures usually subside by the time the child crosses 6 years of ageOnly reducing temperature by giving paracetamol and tepid sponging and treating the cause of fever is sufficient in febrile seizures.You may try Friesium orally for 2-3 days during fever to prevent seizures.Year long treatment with an anticonvulsant medicine like valparin may be avoided as it is hepato toxic.Hope this answer will serve your purposePlease feel free to ask any more queries if requiredTake careDr.M.V.Subrahmanyam MD;DCHAssociate professor of pediatrics"},{"Patient":"Hi, so I'm 13 and when I stand up after sitting down I become dizzy and my vision becomes blurry then black. With in a couple seconds it comes back but occasionally i have to sit down. I already checked my blood pressure and I was fine. I get headaches and i get light headed. I've been doing research and I'm still not sure why this is happening. Also, sometimes my eyes seem to hurt or i see objects moving when they're not. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","Doctor":"Dear Friend.Hi , I am Dr Anshul Varshney , I have read your query in detail , I understand your concern.I suppose you should get yourself checked by a doctor for Postural Drop, that is BP measurement in lying down and then 3 minutes after standing up.This can be due to Postural Drop in blood pressure.Also , you can get an ECG just to check for any cardiac rhythm disturbances.This is my personal opinion based on details available here.  If you want to discuss your issues further, you may please ask usStay Healthy.
