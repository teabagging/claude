If the infection is frequent then it raises more often. So it is a indicator of underlying pathology. It should get back to normal after treatment of cause.

For edema, in lying down position, limb elevation to above heart level is necessary (use multiple pillows below legs), avoid standing or sitting for few days as it can cause edema.

Although young patients like you are good candidate for transplant the decision entirety depends on individual situation. Recently various research have shown chromosomal structure(telomere) also has an impact on outcome of the therapy chosen.  So it is complex decision.  If iwere your treating physician I would have suggested you to consult a haematologist for best judgment.  Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"I am a diabetic on an insulan pump.

Now your triglycerides are high, so do the vldl. TMT shows exercise intolerance signifying you have a heart problem. The best way to combat all these problem is to modify your dietary habit and increase daily exercise.  Avoid junk food, fried foods. Eat green leafy vegetables,  one fruit per day. Resttict calories to 1800 kcal/day. Avoid ghee, dalda, butter. Alcohol not more than 40gm per day. Daily exercise of 25 min like jogging and running can help.

It is better to restrict those product for those having excessive risk of blood clotting. Thouh operation like hysterectomy is a risk for blood clotting, it is not often required to restrict those food product for the same except when there is evidence of repeated episodes of clotting and/or you are on anticoagulant(warfarin) therapy.

Your doc has prescribed you a good combination of medicine and I think this time it will control your bp. If not you van increase the dose of benitec to 40 and take nebicard 5 at evening.  Try to avoid excess salt in diet. Daily salt preferred to be 5-6 gm. Use regular moderate exercise approximately 25min a day. You can take on fruit rich in potassium like lemon.

I had numbness and tingling and cold foot below the knee. I was sent to a nuerologist but got no answers expect it was the raynauds. Til this day I have no answers but still the same problem. The weather has been very cold and even though I stay active and try to be healthy it still is bad and still mostly on the same leg.

As you have raynods phenomenon since a very long time, which sometimes indicates  that you may have some underlying rheumatological diseases. Though some times no cause becomes evident and we clinicians call it primary raynods which is mostly harmless except some distressing pain on cold exposure. In your case I would suggest to consult a rheumatologist for better analysis of your situation. As a physician I would suggest you to avoid extreme cold exposure.

Clay, Ice is called PICA and is cosidered sometimes a sign of iron deficiency anemia, though there are controversy regarding this. This may be associated with some other psychological disorders.If I were your treating physician I would have suggested you to undergo some blood tests including complete hemogram, ESR, reticulocyte count.

As your blood work up shows decreased platelets it can be ITP, a disease of immunological destruction of your platelets. Generally after an attack of flu you feel fatigued.

You would make more money to help and get more referrals through PR. sorry. Cannot move","Doctor":"Hematomas generally clear away on their own. It is essential to rest the affected leg, as this will allow the muscles to heal faster. One can use an ice pack to get relief from the pain. Put ice chips in a plastic bag, wrap the bag in a towel and place it over the affected area of the leg for 20 minutes. Repeat this procedure 3 to 4 times a day. One way to accelerate the healing process is to increase blood circulation in the portion of the leg. Hot baths can definitely promote healing in the injured area. Applying a heat ointment can do wonders in healing the injury. One can also place a heating pad to increase the blood flow in the injured area. Heat lamps, compresses and whirlpools are used to reduce the hematoma.For minor pain  painkillers such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Topical ointments and liniments are also useful in this regard.

Hemorrhoid symptoms can occur with the passage of hard stool and constipation, as well as diarrhea and frequent bowel movements. For patients with constipation, high fiber diet, adequate hydration and stool softeners may be required. For those with too frequent bowel movements, antidiarrheal medications and diet adjustments may be required. These preventive measures decrease the amount of straining that is required to have a bowel movement, thus decreasing the pressure within the blood vessels to prevent swelling.RegardsDR De"},{"Patient":"I am a young female 25 years of age, healthy and physically active.

Normally this can be found in fair complexion person. If the fat layer below skin is lost it can be well visible, mostly found in your dominant hand(the hand you use most).

Dear patient as you wrote that the pain you felt in chest was found to be due to high blood pressure, so it is pretty clear that pain was not due to broken rib and that the high blood pressure is not due to pain instead it is other way around, the high blood pressure is causing chest pain. You have also not mentioned how is that you are in great shape. Also blood pressure is a multifactorial disease, so even if you are working out and physically fit but your life style and eating habits are not health you can get high blood pressure.

Please get your BP checked with a mercury BP instrument as they are more accurate. Also a BP of 135/87 is not very high.

Dear patient you have not mentioned the cause of low haemoglobin, because if the cause is not treated iron supplements can't work, its like trying to fill a can with water with hole at bottom, whatever you pour in gets out of the hole.

Dear patient please understand that both these tablets have different functions. Loprin is low dose aspirin( a blood thinner) and should be taken at bed time. Co-eziday contains two antihypertensive medicines to control your B.P, one is losartan and other is  hydrochlorothiazide. Ideally antihypertensive if taken once a day should be taken at bed time but hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic and will disturb your sleep due to frequent urination,so you should take it in morning as soon as you get so that diuresis gets over by the time you are ready for office.

Your nurse is right, for you a hypertensive this is the normal response to exercise as weight training leads to rise in blood pressure,  although cardio workout lowers it.

Three years ago, I was hospitalized for a DVT.  I found out it was caused by Factor V Leiden and my birth control pills.  Since then, I have been diagnosed with peripheral vascular disease and post thrombotic syndrome.  I have since experienced chronic pain and swelling.  However, 2 weeks ago, I was started on prozac for acute depression.  About a week after beginning the prozac, I began to experience significant pain and swelling in my calf.  I went to the ER and was told by 4 doctors that they believed I had a DVT.  They got ready to admit me and then my ultrasound came back negative.  I was told that it was likely that I had a blood clot that had not propagated enough to show up in the ultrasound.  I was sent home with a script to get another ultrasound in 5-7 days.  Since then, the pain and swelling have increased dramatically and is starting to move up towards my thigh.  I'm afraid to go back to the ER because I am afraid that they will send me home again since it is before my follow up ultrasound.

You have not mentioned the blood pressure, which you say is consistently high. However, I would like to inform you that sudden arousal of the sympathetic system you blood pressure will be high in mornings compared to other times. It will be higher at around 10 am and peak till the noon and then drop. This is normal diurnal variation in all individuals.Avoid taking unregulated treatment. Your dosage might be low, but other added factors might lead to hypo-tension and accidental injuries.If you still have doubts, you can take ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, which helps in checking your 24 hr circadian blood pressure variation. If you think you have sleep apnea, meet the doctor and try to get it treated as it increases the risk of stroke, vascular diseases and congestive cardiac failure.If you have further doubts, you can get back with the exact high blood pressure in mornings and I will try to further help you.Hope i have answered your query."},{"Patient":"I am 10 days post op tonsillectomy.

I'm scared to fall asleep because I just notice this blood clot.  what should I do?","Doctor":"hello,Mild bleeding after a surgery is common. The bleeding is usually stopped by formation of a soft clot (platelet plug) initially followed by a hard clot (clotting factors). As it is a wet area and your oral cavity is constantly mobile, healing takes a longer time considered to other places.  Clot formation is natural and it will dissolve by itself. You must be already on antibiotic cover, so secondary bacterial infection chances are low.Blot clot are usual and it is nothing to worry. It is just like a superficial skin wound, where clot formation occurs, which becomes brown, then black and the crusts fall off. It might be taking a bit longer to heal as i explained above.I do not know your age. If you are middle aged, Diabetes if present could slow healing.Hope i answered your query.

If you are talking about a thrombus (blood clot) formation inside the blood vessel which has moved to the lungs (embolism), then the chances are very rare. Usually thrombus occurs in surgeries in long post operative immobilization or prolonged bed rest. Even if it has occurred it usually dissolves over days. If the thrombus were to have been big, it would have caused obstruction symptoms resulting in difficulty in breathing.Your complaint of blood clot to the cardiologist must have made them to suggest and echo and MRI. However, if you want to get it done, it is done by a radiologist in most of developed scan centers. You can make an appointment and meet. I would usually suggest to wait and watch as the possibility of blood clot in lungs is low, if you do not have any breathlessness. Hope I have answered your query.

Anemia and bleeding from the bowels are also indications to get a colonoscopy. Diverticulosis is also a cause of colon bleeding.

I am taking 4.5mg at the moment per night. Do you have any suggestions as to why my blood forms clots. Thank you, Margaret James, Mrs.","Doctor":"Certain type of proteins in the blood help it to clot. If any of these proteins are abnormal, then you can have repeated episodes of blood clots. Some of these conditions are inherited. There are now many tests available to test for these abnormal proteins. Ask your doctor to have you get a coagulation blood panel. A particular abnormality may respond better to another drug besides warfarin. You will probably need to be on some kind of blood thinner the rest of your life, but there are other drugs now available that might be effective. Ask your doctor.Hope this answers your query.

Or do you mean your WBC were low because of the drugs, and now are coming back to normal? 20,000 is quite high, and I would want to know why it is increasing.

Some types of irregular beats can be dangerous. 108 is also too fast- not dangerous by itself, but could indicate an underlying problem that needs investigation. It is possible the increased blood pressure medicine is causing the problem. You need to talk your doctor right away and have a heart tracing (EKG) done.

This could be from poor circulation or something like carpal tunnel syndrome, which is from pressure on the nerve. It could even be due to arthritis in your neck irritating the nerves. If it is getting worse, you should see your doctor. He or she can test your circulation and strength to figure out the cause. These are treatable conditions.

He had a paratonsillar abscess 1 year ago and we looked in his mouth for a reason why he would be spitting up blood. My husband says that the area where the abscess was there is something going on which could cause my son spitting up the blood. I made an appointment with the ENT that took care of the abscess. The doctor did a thorough exam ans stated that there is no abscess or any indication of why my son would be spitting up blood. During his exam, the doctor noticed my son s nodules are enlarged. He sent my son for a chest X-ray as he said that we need to take this serious, which I do. The doctor stated that he may refer my son to a pulmonary doctor and may need to biopsy the lymph nodes. The X-ray shows prominent perihilar markings and hyperexpansion. What does this all mean?","Doctor":"Spitting up blood, swollen glands, and an abnormal chest x-ray indicate a serious process in the lungs. It could be infection (tuberculosis is a big concern), some kind of inflammatory process (similar to lupus), or even cancer. Prominent hilar markings could be swollen lymph glands in the chest near where the lungs start from the major bronchial tubes. The peritonsillar abscess a year ago is not likely related. He could, however, have an abscess deeper down in the lung passages. Seeing a pulmonary doctor promptly and getting the lymph nodes biopsied is exactly what he should do.Hope this answers your query.

Presently, your BP recording is around 142/90 mm of Hg and Pulse rate is 60/min. Nebivolol is a cardioselective β blocker (β1 receptor blocker) with some vasodilatory property. The intake of this drug may explain your Heart rate of 60/min. At this stage I would advise you to strictly monitor the intake of salt in your diet (salt restricted diet is preferred), avoid smoking and opt for physical exercise. If you are overweight, then gradual weight reduction is advised.In case your BP is still not controlled, I would advise you to consult your physician/cardiologist, regarding addition of a second drug in the regimen like Calcium channel blockers (eg Cilnidipine) or ACEI/ARB. I dont think the dose of Nebicard can be increased further since your HR is 60/min.(As per the new JNC 8 guidelines it is preferable to maintain a BP <140/90 in a subject <60 yrs of age)"},{"Patient":"My 86 year old father has very high blood pressure  (last doctors visit yesterday was at 218) and has been prescribed 10mg Ramopril per day.

For example, symptoms of a blood clot in the heart or lungs may include chest pain, shortness of breath, and upper body discomfort in the arms, back, neck, or jaw. These symptoms may suggest a heart attack or pulmonary embolism (PE).Signs and symptoms of a blood clot in the deep veins of the leg may include pain, redness, warmth, and swelling in the lower leg.

I would like to know diet regarding Hepatosplenomegaly.Thanks,Clive","Doctor":"Diet for hepatosplenomegalyA tea made from apple tree bark can cleanse the lymphatic system and shrink an enlarged spleen. Also, apple cider that has been boiled down to syrup, taken by the tablespoon as a tonic, can ease an enlarged spleen. A milk thistle supplement, in the form of a capsule or tablet that you can purchase at your local health food store, supports liver and spleen function. The two organs work closely together, and an enlarged spleen is often caused by an overworked liver. A diet high in fruit, along with plenty of water, will help keep the lymphatic system clean. Increase intake of high-fiber fruits such as apples, bananas and blueberries. Foods to Eliminate : When suffering from an enlarged spleen, avoid fatty and processed foods. These foods are difficult to digest and put significant strain on the liver and spleen, Alcohol : The spleen and liver are dependent on each other for proper function. An overtaxed liver can lead to an enlarged spleen. Cut out alcohol and increase water intake to shrink a spleen.

Thanks in advance Sir.","Doctor":"Polycythemia vera is a chronic condition that can't be cured. Treatment focuses on reducing your amount of blood cells. In many cases, treatment can prevent complications from polycythemia vera and decrease or eliminate the disease's signs and symptoms.Treatment may include:Taking blood out of your veins. Drawing a certain amount of blood out of your veins in a procedure called phlebotomy is usually the first treatment option for people with polycythemia vera. This reduces the number of blood cells and decreases your blood volume, making it easier for your blood to function properly. How often you need phlebotomy depends on the severity of your condition. Low-dose aspirin may also help reduce burning pain in your feet or hands.Medication to decrease blood cells. For people with polycythemia vera who aren't helped by phlebotomy alone, medications, such as hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea), to suppress your bone marrow's ability to produce blood cells may be used. Interferon alpha may be used to stimulate your immune system to fight the overproduction of red blood cells.Therapy to reduce itching such as antihistamines, or recommend ultraviolet light treatment to relieve your discomfort. Medications that are normally used to treat depression, called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may be helpful in relieving itching. Examples of SSRIs include paroxetine (Paxil) or fluoxetine (Prozac).RegardsDr De"},{"Patient":"Hi - I have high MVC and MCH by 1 point above normal. I do not drink alcohol and have a healthy diet, take vitamin supplements.  I am a 50 year old woman.  My doctor is not concerned.  Should I get my thyroid checked. I have had thyroid supplement before - Nature Thyroid given?  Thanks","Doctor":"First of all MCV is a way to measure the average size or volume of the individual blood cells in femtoliters, which normally has to be in the range between eighty and one hundred.MCH is the way to measure the amount of hemoglobin in the average red blood cell, which should be twenty-seven to thirty-one picogram per cell.If the MCV is not within the normal range, this means that the red blood cells are either larger or smaller than they normally should be. With a high MVC, this means that a person may be suffering from pernicious or hemolyctic anemia. Some of the causes of a high MCV can include alcohol abuse, nutritional deficiencies, or a deficiency in folic acid or vitamin B12. If the MCV is low a person could have thalassemia, gastrointestinal blood loss, or iron deficiency anemia. Most of the time, an abnormal MCV just means that you have some form of anemia.  When they consider the MCH in the complete blood count test, it is a measurement of what the approximate amount of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin is in the red blood cell. It the red blood cells are large they are referred to as macrocytic and will usually have a higher MCH. If the red blood cells are smaller they are referred to as microcytic and has a lower MCH,If the complete blood count test comes back showing that you have high MCH this can indicate that you have macrocytic anemia. This type of anemia is caused by not having enough vitamin B12 or folic acid. How to treat a MCH that is high depends on the cause of it being this way. Treatment also depends on any other medication they may be taking or medical conditions the patient might have. If macrocytic anemia is the cause,adding vitamin B12 and folic acid supplements will help.RegardsDr De"},{"Patient":"hi  i have a problem my esr is so high its 94 and i did my all test like vdrl hiv1,2 hsv1,2 ca 125 uric acid ra factor   whole blood count thyroid  blood sugar random x-ray full abdoumen scan but nobody knows what's the reason.my e-mail is  YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"The Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) is a blood test that measures inflammation or abnormal proteins in the body.  While the ESR is not an indication of any one disease, it commonly increases with any condition that causes inflammation, such as infection, arthritis, or cancer.  However, up to 10% of normal, healthy people have a mildly elevated ESR and it tends to increase with age.  The higher the level of ESR, the more likely the person is to have a condition known to be associated with it .Of the arthritic diseases, an elevated ESR is most closely associated with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and giant cell arteritis (GCA). If disease is active, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitic disease and almost any other inflammatory condition may be associated with an elevated ESR.  Other well-established causes included subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE), myeloma, abscess, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and osteomyelitis.  However, almost any condition that causes sudden or significant inflammation in the body can be associated with an elevated ESR.An elevated ESR cannot establish any diagnosis by itself.  Similarly, a normal ESR does not rule out an arthritic condition since many people with arthritis have a normal or only mildly elevated ESR.  A normal ESR does reduce the likelihood of GCA, PMR and SBE.  Thus, the ability of this test to predict presence or absence of disease is far from perfect.RegardsDr De"},{"Patient":"Have an issue with flatuating.

Chew your food thoroughly before you swallow. •For a few days, avoid the foods that most commonly cause flatulence, such as beans, high-fiber foods, cruciferous vegetables, carbonated beverages and sugar-free products containing sorbitol. Then gradually add them to your diet again, one by one, while keeping track of your symptoms. This should let you determine which foods trigger flatulence for you. Then you can avoid them. •If you need to add more fiber to your diet, increase your fiber slowly over a period of days or weeks. A sudden increase in dietary fiber often triggers flatulence, but a gradual increase may not. •If you eat beans, try a nonprescription product, such as Beano, containing enzymes that break up the poorly digested sugars found in beans.

It can necessitate a delay in treatment or a reduction in the dose. White blood cells are necessary for the body to fight infection, so when they are low, a person is more susceptible to infections. Patients with low white blood cell counts should avoid people with colds or crowded areas, wash their hands frequently, and be sure all food is clean and cooked.There are several medications, called colony-stimulating factors, which can prevent the white blood cell count from dropping or help it recover faster. These medications (filgrastin, sargramostim) are given by an injection subcutaneously.

Regards Barbara Australia","Doctor":"Depressed iron level  occurs when your body doesn't have enough iron.Iron is important because it helps you get enough oxygen throughout your body. Your body uses iron to make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a part of your red blood cells. Hemoglobin carries oxygen through your body. If you do not have enough iron, your body makes fewer and smaller red blood cells  Then your body has less hemoglobin, and you cannot get enough oxygen.Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia.Iron deficiency anemia is caused by low levels of iron in the body. You might have low iron levels because you:    Have heavy menstrual bleeding.    Are not getting enough iron in food. This can happen in people who need a lot of iron, such as small children, teens, and pregnant women.    Have bleeding inside your body. This bleeding may be caused by problems such as ulcers, hemorrhoids, or cancer. This bleeding can also happen with regular aspirin use. Bleeding inside the body is the most common cause of iron deficiency anemia in men and in women after menopause.    Cannot absorb iron well in your body.

I have an aunt who is addicted of eating raw rice and she also has other health problems like anemia, hair loss and losing blood. Is all these related? What can be the realm of the health problem? Thanks","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to health care magic. There is no relation with eating raw rice causing anemia. It's actually the other way round. If you have mild anemia, you may have a peculiar craving to eat certain strange things like raw rice and soil!!  This strange craving seen in anemic people is called pica. May be that's what have given you the wrong impression. My advice is to visit a physician and get your hemoglobin checked. If it's low he will give you iron tablets for 1 month. Make sure to eat more iron rich foods like pomegranate, jagger and ragi. Hope this discussion will be helpful to you. Thank you."},{"Patient":"any links ... my husband has a confirmed case of the skin.blood disorder porphyria .. and was rearranging furniture in our living room....

I would advise you to get admitted and urgent investigations and treatment. Nil orally means stop taking anything orally til your Doctor orders you to take. Intravenous fluids and antibiotics. You need : X-ray of the abdomen in standing position to see for gas under diaphragm on air-fluid levels in the intestine.

Does this show an improvement of her condition, leading to hopes of cure ?","Doctor":"hi..WBC count dropping to zero is a good sign of response to treatment. but it doesnt mean that the patient is cured. chemotherapy has to be continued until the bone marrow shows complete response to treatment, also after that maintenance course has to be taken to prevent relapse. if there is no relapse within 2 yrs after stopping the treatment, then you can have hope of cure. meanwhile you should take good care while on chemotherapy, as they are more prone for infections. all the best."},{"Patient":"I was 44 last november.

I know that when we get older, our physical and medical conditions deteriate. I suspect that the past scarring of my stomach from my ulcer , plus my age(63) is a direct cause of my enability to absorb B12 through my stomach. Can you give me any confirmation on this matter?

Greene, 4/17/2012","Doctor":"1. since you are giving a long history of ulcer, thus apart from scarring 'pyloric stenosis' is also possible, thus analysis of gastric aspiration and Barium meal X-ray of stomach and duodenum is essential.2. since Pernicious Anemia [PA]  is an AUTOimmune disorder i.e. the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the stomach’s mucosal cells: as a result Intrinsic Factor [IF]  can no longer be made, and vitamin B-12 cannot be absorbed, so scarring at most will cause gastric outlet obstruction  [which can narrow or close the intestinal opening and can prevent food from leaving the stomach and entering the small intestine,resulting in vomiting the contents of the stomach]3. In old age [63], as there is atrophy of the glandular mucosa of the fundus of the stomach which is same etiology of pernicious anemia, thus AGE is a contributory factor for the progress of the disease.4. .Take: bland diet,rice with plain dal,boiled vegetables,sweet biscuits,sweet fruits,plain idli..avoid sour fruits like citrus fruits,imli,grapes,instead take sweet/dry fruits. .avoid all chillies..avoid period of starvation:take small meals every 2 hrs.  .do not keep the stomach empty,also don’t take heavy meals.  .avoid tea and coffee.milk is good (cold).for breakfast and snacks:bread/toast jam,cheese or butter,cornflakes.avoid deep fried and hot foods..eat food which are low in fats..eat at a leisurely pace.chew your food well..avoid eating 3 hrs prior to retiring to bed.may cause secretion of gastric acid if meals taken during bed time..include protein in each meal and snacks..antacids are the drug of choice.

However, in my opinion, it could be a bleeding disorder related to structural or functional abnormality of platelets or a vasculitis disease.  simple and inexpensive tests like bleeding time, clotting time, platelet counts can throw some light into the diagnosis.

However, mild hemolysis can happen in the bone marrow itself in B12 defeciency (ineffective erythropoisis) and can elevate your bilirubin.  As your liver function tests are not done (or not posted), we can not rule out liver disease like Gilberts syndrome or Crigler Najar syndrome (normal SGOT/SGPT raises the possibility). you may undergo bone marrow aspiration to look for the presence of large precursor cells which will add to the possibility of B12 defeciency.

Celiac disease is one of the conditions which could be associated with increased eosinophils.

I do not eat my greens nor meat..have even cut out chicken over the past 4 months. Generally survive on mini snacks, frozen food, or junk food. I went for blood tests in October, and I was told I have iron deficient anemia. I was at level 7 or 9 with my iron stores, should be at 12 minimum.

In young women, iron deficiency anemia can result from heavy menstrual bleeding. Non-menstruating women or men who develop iron deficiency need to have a colon exam to help identify the source of chronic bleeding.With iron deficiency anemia, your doctor will probably recommend iron supplements that contain the ferrous form of iron, which your body can absorb easily. If you use iron supplements, remember the following cautions:Always consult with your doctor before taking iron supplements.Iron supplements -- like all supplements and any medication -- should be kept out of the reach of children.Taking iron supplements with food can help prevent common side effects, which may include nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and stomach pain.Watch for drug interactions. The body absorbs iron best when taken in a mildly acidic medium, so taking iron with a half-glass of orange juice or with vitamin C is helpful.I do hope that you have found something helpful and I will be glad to answer any further query.Take care"},{"Patient":"Hi, I've recently been diagnosed with anemia ... would this help to explain why I am constantly ravenous?

Hematoma is collection of blood outside the blood vessels, clot usually refers to blood clot inside vine or artery. Symptoms of hematomas depend upon their location and whether adjacent structures are affected by the inflammation and swelling associated with the bleeding. You may be having traumatic hematoma. Hematomas of the skin and soft tissues are often treated with RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation). The pain of a hematoma is usually due to the inflammation surrounding the blood and may be treated with over-the-counter pain medications (Tab hifenac 1-0-1 or Tab dolo 650 1-0-1).

If I were your family physician, I would refer either to your original surgeon, or would not hesitate to take a second opinion for a judgmental decision by the doctor.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your son's problem.

My question is why would I have an elevated ASO titer for over 6 months. It s only slightly elevated 232 - 220 - 238. But I have had penicillin shot, rocephin, amoxicillin, and Augmentin. It all began because I had significant bilateral joint pain, blood in my urine, unexplained weight loss, continuous mouth sores. All of it occurred after having my first child. Before that I had no medical issues. Was thought to have RA at first because my brother has Felty Syndrome. Went to rheumatologist. Thought I could have lupus bc my monocytes were high and my WBC were low. But all labs for lupus were negative. Now told I have viral arthritis. Still have bilateral joint pain but feel much better. I did have elevated CRP of 14. RA factor was 8.4. Now both are lowered but my aso was 238 and the highest it has been after all those antibiotics. Also I am 37 and had a baby 13 months ago. I had to do invitro related unexplained infertility but later revealed I had high FSH. Still had a successful implantation and pregnancy.","Doctor":"Thank you for asking!  ASO titre  greater than 166 Todd units (or >200 IU) is considered a positive test. This upper limit of normal may vary from lab to lab and by age, with it being higher in school-aged children.  A positive test can indicate recent or current group A, C, and G streptococcal infection (eg, upper airway infections, scarlet fever, toxic shock syndrome) and may support the diagnosis of post-streptococcal infection complication (eg, glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever).  As you already had too much multifactorial issues so a complete clinical correlation is necessary to connect the dots here.Take care"},{"Patient":"my latest blood test said that my potassium.

His kidneys were removed last January 28, 2013 at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. They weighed an astonishing 49 pounds. He was in JH for 77 days post-op; 16 days in the ICU. He is on dialysis at a facility close to our home -- and was doing well. However, a week ago he passed out during dialysis -- and felt sick and dizzy yesterday when I picked him up (I have never allowed him to drive after dialysis). He also says he experiences a burning sensation at intervals all around his waist. His nephrologist (who visits him weekly at the dialysis facility) does not have an explanation for the burning sensation or the more recent difficulties he is experiencing. He is now on the Active list for a transplant at JH. My concern is what could be causing him to experience such difficulty recently during and after dialysis. Any suggestions -- I have asked that he be given some water 15-20 minutes prior to the end of his session (total of 3 1/2 hours Monday, Wednesday and Friday.) Thanks.","Doctor":"hi, I am incharge and head of dialysis wing in our hospital for the past few years (though i am a physician), hope you don't mind me answering.  Many patients on long term dialysis develop postural hypotension due to salt wasting and uremic neuropathy. That explains occasional dizziness in them. A tip is, not to allow him to stand right away from lying down position; make him sit for 2-3 min and them allow him to stand. Burning sensation around waist (if you are sure it is coming from skin rather than from deep) can also because of neuropathy, if local causes like skin infections, are excluded.  hope this helped."},{"Patient":"hi dr.

I usually have a 28 day cycle which never goes beyond 32 days.  I'm currently on day 34, still no period, and had 2 negative pregnancy tests.  Other than pressure in my lower abdomen and heartburn, I have no other pregnancy symptoms.  I keep track of ovulation by monitoring my physical signs which occurred around the 14th of January.  We practice the withdrawal method (and I know he does not slip-up) and sessions are not consecutive so there is no sperm left in the urethra to be picked up by pre-ejaculate.  On day 27, I allowed him to ejaculate inside me because ovulation occurred about 2 weeks prior and thought the chance of conception was extremely low.  I had the flu for 2 weeks that started the same day as my period and also started taking supplements (Oxyelite Pro, Magnesium, and Calcium) and cough/cold/flu medicine that contained acetaminophen, dextromethorphan, phenylephrine HCl, and doxylamine succinate.  Due to being sick and then going away for a week, we barely had intercourse in January (only about 4 or 5 times total).  Is it more likely I'm pregnant or more likely the combination of supplements and illness is just throwing my cycle off?","Doctor":"HI.Your are NOT likely to be pregnant. All the symptoms can be related to the flu you have. The pressure sensation in the abdomen can be due to stomach flu and indigestion associated with stomach flu. Heartburn may be due Acid Peptic disease. Take PPI and Antacids also.Take / Continue symptomatic treatment and bed-rest, you will be fine. On a safer side re-check the pregnancy test after 7 days."},{"Patient":"Hi! I was recently diagnosed with proliferative disordered endometrial lining and was prescribed Provera.

Please bare in mind that testosterone replacement therapy is often associated with high hemoglobin levels as it might stimulate erythropoiesis. Erythropoiesis itself leads to polycythemia with increased red blood cell count, hemoglobin and hematocrit as final manifestations.At the end, as long as you are under testosterone therapy, your hemoglobin will keep high. So, you need to avoid dehydration as much as you can. You can discuss such side effect with your doctor for further evaluation.All the best!Dr.Bardha"},{"Patient":"Hi, what can high white blood cell count, high blood pressure and high red cell distribution mean? My albion gap and chloride is a little elevated too. My levels are just a little elevated and my blood pressure is 142/100. I am really dizzy, light headed, really bad headache and pain on my right side??","Doctor":"Hi, Feeling dizzy, light headed and headache is related to increased blood pressure you are experiencing. I suggest to consult with your cardiologist and to run cardiac tests to get properly treated.High white blood cell count are indicative for a possible infection in your body. I'd suggest to consult with your physician to find out the source of the infection and get it treated properly. A slight elevation in anion gap and chloride you are reporting could be related to damages of the kidney (most probably due to infection). Therefore, I suggest to get properly treated if any kidney/urinary tract infection/problem is concluded.You are also reporting to have high red cell distribution, which means that your red blood cells have a great size variations. Studies have concluded that the higher the red cells distribution, the higher the risks for cardiovascular events and atherosclerotic plaques.You can discuss this further with your cardiologist to get the ways of improving your lab results. All the best!Dr.Bardha"},{"Patient":"Hello. In 2010, during a CT scan of the Abdomen, I was diagnosed with an INcidential adrenal mass 3 centimers wide on my right adrenal gland.

In the United States, both internal medicine & infectious disease physicians complete a three-year residency in internal medicine after having obtained their medical degree. Infectious disease medicine physicians then do further specialty training for three years. Internal medicne physicians deal mostly with adult patients and their scope of practice includes all systems of the body. Infectious disease medicine physicians focus primarily on treating infectious disease complications in adults. Pediatricians also have a subspecialty in infectious disease and they deal with me on a 10 children."},{"Patient":"i had to have blood drawn from me because i have to many red blood cells per u c davis doctors i need to know what to do to avoid this procedure to transpire in the future what foods should avoid . is there any foods i should avoid ? or is there any other suggescions you have.","Doctor":"hello and thank you for submitting your question.If you have too many red blood cells, you may have a condition called Polycythemia Vera. If so, this is due to a genetic mutation and diet plays a minimal contribution. Regardless, it is best to eat a well-balanced diet full of fruits and vegetables, low in saturated fats and sodium, and moderate in redmeat. It is important to maintain adequate hydration. If you have to much iron, you may have a condition called Hemochromatosis. If this is the case, it is important to maintain a well-balanced diet but to limit your intake of iron. It is important to note that neither polycythemia vera nor hemochromatosis can be cured by diet & future phlebotomy may be necessary, as determined by your doctor."},{"Patient":"Had hemmroid surgery about 4 weeks ago.

I understand how disturbing it is to deal with something new. If this is the first and not increasing in size, I will not strongly recommend that you go in to see a doctor for his. It should slowly get resolved without the need of any specific treatment.  The truth is that minor traumas totally unaware to us can cause this.

He had open heart surgery 7 years ago that included a triple by-pass and a new aortic valve. He had an excellent recovery. Last year he was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and he takes metformin and glyberide. His sugar levels are always good and very consistent. Three months ago his doctor noticed that his red blood count was low (120) and the level continued to fall down to 100. He has had an endoscopy, colonoscopy, echocardiogram, and a Trans Esophosegial Echocardiogram - all with excellent results.

Would your recommend other diagnostic tests that might solve this mystery? Thank you! Rosemary","Doctor":"hi, this is Dr Vaddadi. I suggest a workup for serum ferritin, TIBC and transferrin saturation. Those tests tell us whether iron stores are normal-low or high. some patients have normal to high iron stores but still may have low RBC counts like in anemia of chronic disease. I may also recommend serum B12 levels, as patients on metformin are known to develop B12 defeciency which is another cause of anemia. we may review after the results.

Why is this changing?","Doctor":"Hi, metabolism of warfarin is dependent on how liver is dealing with it. The enzymes required for its metabolism are frequently interfered by many processes that are not yet totally unveiled.It might be a drug, spinach or a small clove or onion piece. so, even when nothing apparently changes, INR can yet change. the point is you need to adjust the dose accordingly to keep the target INR. hope this helped."},{"Patient":"Hi, I,m Charmaine Bartolo and suffer from Chrohns disease.

My sister is 23 years old and is suffering from very low HB that is 3.5. Two years back she had severe bleeding due to fibroids and after that she s on medication. Her bleeding has become better but her HB has fallen down a lot. I am really worried what to do. Should we go for a blood transfusion.","Doctor":"Dear patient.Greetings from health care magic!!!  I am Dr Thakker and shall be answering your question.I can understand your reservations about blood transfusion and when it should be done. I will try my best to answer your question and guide you through the problem.Your sister has a HB of 3.5gm/dl. The normal HB for her is 12gm/dl. Her anemia can be multifactorial, blood loss due to fibroids, nutritional, menstrual loss. HB of 3.5gm/dl is a very low haemoglobin. The body goes into a state of high output cardiac failure and blood is not able to deliver enough oxygen to the tissues. Oxygen is a basic requirement of the cells. Hypoxia leads to accumulation of acids in the blood and the patient feels tired and breathless. Hence I would recommend your sister be transfused with a total of 3 to 4 packed cells to get the HB till 7gm/dl. She can then be treated for the cause. she can then be given hematinics, intravenous iron  and treated for fibroids if any.Current day transfusions are safe and the risk of acquiring diseases is minimal. Hence you shouldn't worry about that,.I hope this helps you out.

In medical field we have something called Autoimmune disorder, means your body's own immune system is targeting and destroying your platelets. The treatment option in such conditions is giving immunosuppresant, that is what i guess your doctor is doing. This low platelet count is the reason y u r getting gum bleeding also. By taking wysolone (it contains a steroid prednisolone) usually u will be symptom free.

There is swelling of vein and formation of lump on chronic standing or due to more pressure in the veins. The vein can swell up and gives a lumpy appearance.Do not pinch, pop or scratch or even touch the area unnecessarily as it can cause aggravation of the rash.

I was wondering if it would make sense to surgically remove the clot or try to dissolve it so there is no blood constriction. I am worried it will get worse as I get older.","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicA DVT is a clot that occurs in the deep veins. In the veins in the legs there are two sets of veins, the superficial veins  (closer to the surface) and the deep veins.Normally blood goes in one direction towards the heart and there are valves that prevent blood from going backwards or staying in the legs.When a deep vein thrombosis occurs , the back up of blood can cause damage to these valves and dilatation of the superficial veins.Because blood is no longer efficiently flowing in one direction, there are permanent issues with swelling in the leg.This also contributes to the change in colour.What you are seeing is due to the damage caused by the clot that was there previously and does not indicate that a clot is currently present.There is not likely anything to dissolve.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Yes, my husband who is 50 years old has moderate stomach pains, bloating (a feeling of being full of food or air/gas), he feels pressure in his pubic area when trying to sit up.

Also showed moderate dysplastic changes in the red cell line and mild dysplastic changes in my white blood cell line consistant with possible early mds. As doctors in both New York and Boston attempted to determin what was taking place Each specialist agreed I had their disease to an extent Myeloma or MDS but they felt that it was not their disease causing the anemia because the extent of each disease was minimal. Decided to try treatment with levoquin with no improvement and then prednisone with no improvement. Symptoms progressed developing bone and muscle pain, weight loss, migratory joint pain with numbness and intense pain to my hands and feet. At this point I developed Pure Red Blood Cell Aplasia and became transfusion dependent needing transfusions every 10 days for apx 3 months. The doctors at both institutions thought possible infection. Complete infectious disease work up done all of which was negative. Tests for Lupus also negative Labs showed : a monoclonal protein of .67gdl at its highest (decreased over time with trial of levoquin and low dose prednisone ). Elevated lambda light chains of 115 mg/dl (decreased with levoquin and prednisone) Bone marrow involvement was continuing to increase moving from a showing of 7% plasma cells to 30%. Even as all my serum marker numbers were decreasing% of bone marrow involvement was increasing. Out of lack of knowing what else to do and now having developing the Pure Red Blood Cell Aplasia and needing frequent transfusions they started treatment with bortizimed. which improved my hct and fevers and brought my myeloma numbers down some . I then went on to have an auto transplant which did not seem to make much of a difference. M spike prior was 0.17g/dl and 90 days post is .31 g/ dl. Told the marrow shows a 5% population of plasma cells which seem to have not responded to treatment. At this point I feel I have fully recovered from the transplant. Unfortunatly over the past few weeks my fevers and pain have returned as well as the bone pain, numbness,muscle pain,cramps and twiching as well as a slight tingle sensation to my face and tongue .I am not anemic at this point but it feels like it is starting all over again. I am being told not to worry and we may never know what the exact cause is but should just cont with the various treatments for myeloma for however long they will work and then possibly an allo transplant down the line. At this point we have started bortizimed again only. Concern has been expressed with use of lenalidomide due to developing Secondary Primary Cancers. My question is has anyone out there seen a patient with a similar presentation and if further diagnostic evaluation is indicated since it has been stated they are not really sure what we are treating. I do fear we have muddied the waters with the treatments already given Had genetic studies done which may help in determining what is taking place and have not had if fully explained to me: Normal karyotype. Fish evaluation done in NewYork showed various abnormalities. Detecting four copies of the FGFR3 and IgH genes in 2.4% of the cells studied. The MLL gene in 3% of the cells.four copies of chromosomes1,5,7 and 8 in 3% and 4 copies of chromosome 17and 20 in 2.4% of the interphase cells examined .

This is the main blood vessel from the heart which takes the blood to the abdomen and the lower limbs.

I will do my best to help youI have tried to understand your query to my best.Venous Thrombosis is not condition to be neglected.If diagnosed as in your case as mentioned ,do take complete treatment as advised by the treating Consultant.Venous Thrombosis is a condition in which a blood clot (thrombus) forms in one or more of the deep veins in your body, usually in your legs.The blood clot that has formed in your vein can break loose, travel through your bloodstream and lodge in your lungs, blocking blood flow (pulmonary embolism).Hence ,to prevent this complication which is serious , you will need to take a medicine called an anticoagulant which was prescribed to you as per Information provided (Injection Grefac) under medical supervision .Role of ANTICOAGULANT :-Anticoagulant medicines prevent a blood clot from getting bigger- help to stop part of the blood clot from breaking off and becoming lodged in another part of your bloodstream (prevents embolism)-Two different types of anticoagulants are used - (1) Heparin –Available in two forms –Standard (unfractioned)Heparin and Low molecular weight Heparin (LMWH) (2) Warfarin-Heparin is usually prescribed first, because it works immediately to prevent further clotting-After this initial treatment you may also need to take warfarin to prevent another blood clot forming ( as per Medical consultant advise if required)) -Standard (unfractioned) heparin can be given as an  intravenous injection -(this must be done in hospital under supervision)-LMWH is usually given as a subcutaneous injection-Warfarin is taken as a tablet. You may need to take it after an initial heparin treatment to prevent further blood clots occurringDiscontinuing treatment for the diagnosed illness -Venous thrombosis is not advised .My sincere advise to you is to consult the Treating Physician immediately or at earliest without neglecting .Prevention is better than cure.Thanks for trusting Healthcaremagic and posting your query.

The treatment goal is blood pressure below 140/90 and lower for people with other conditions, such as diabetes and kidney disease.  These actions of blood pressure medications and lifestyle changes are not effective in keeping your pressure controlled, it may be necessary to ask your doctor adjust your dose of medicines. In general, at first metoprolol is 25 to 100 mg once a day (you on 25mg/day). However, the dose is usually not more than 400 mg per day. While the starting dose of lisinopril for treating high blood pressure is 10 mg daily. The usual dose range is 20-40 mg daily (you on 10mg/day). Also lisinopril should not be taken with potassium supplements or diuretics that conserve potassium, for example, hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene (Dyazide), since blood potassium levels may rise to dangerous levels.Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"Yesterday I fell off our porch and have a golfball size hematoma in the middle of my shin.

I have already taken all my medication and followed doctors orders, but i don't think i shd be in this much pain still. Should I?","Doctor":"HI.Thanks for an elucidated history. The probable reason for your problems are 1 > Swelling and pain in the left foot can be due to deep vein thrombosis , a known complication of laparoscopic surgery. Get color Doppler Examination done to ascertain the cause and get treated accordingly. Till then keep the left foot and leg elevated above the heart level in lying down position. 2 > The pain in abdomen after appendectomy can be due to development of an abscess, mass or peritonitis. This can be best diagnosed a by a preliminary CT scan to find the cause and be treated either by medicines or surgery if indicated."},{"Patient":"Hi madam , I am taking thyronorm 25 mcg  from yesterday  , because my Tsh is 5.47.

Anytime I'd touch that place or accidentally bumb it, it would start bleeding again and wouldn't stop. It did the same thing when I cut my leg. I've been getting bruised really easily lately also. If someone just pokes me or I barely hit my hand in the table then it will bruise. I'm really faired skin I'm a red head, but having really light skin shouldn't be doing that. I cheer and I go down on my knee a lot in it, my whole knee Is bruised and swelled up. Nobody else's knees are and they do the something thing as me. Also when I get up in the mornings and first stand up I almost pass out, I did once. It weird because my eyes go blurry my hearing goes almost out. My legs stiff up and start shaking and my tongue start tingling and getting stiff. I went to the doctor over it once and they said to keep a Gatorade next to my bed, so I could drink some before I stood up, but that didn't help. One more thing is when I stand in one place for long my legs turn purple and peachy colored dots start coming and my legs itch really bad.? Is all of this normal?","Doctor":"hello dear.bleeding even for minor trauma , and bleeding not stopping for two days is really concerning compliant. My recommendation would be that you visit doctor immediately get blood coagulation tests like clotting time, bleeding time, PT, APTT, INR, and complete blood picture with platelet count will help in diagnosis.dizziness after sudden raise from lying down position is common in people. if it is really limiting your activities further investigation might be necessary.Regards."},{"Patient":"I have high cholesterol (225) and have started taking Atorvastatin for about a week.

It does appear that you have a significant anemia.  I am not sure that your doctors can conclude that you have actual bleeding going on.  It is possible that your body is somehow destroying the red blood cells.  This can sometimes happen through an autoimmune process.  I am, sure you're hematologist has considered this.  He may have requested some special laboratory studies to rule this out.It is important that you continue to receive your iron supplementation.  As long as the other blood cells in your body, including platelets and white blood cells are within normal limits.  It is most likely, your bone marrow is functioning normally and that some type of processes going on whether it is some type of bleeding that has yet to be discovered or whether your body is actively breaking red blood cells apart somehow through this immune process.Thanks again for sending your question.

Thank you for being there.","Doctor":"Hi! welcome to HCM! It is important to note that, even though, the platelet numbers are decreased in thrombocytopenia, their function usually remains completely intact. The treatment of thrombocytopenia is largely dependent upon the cause and the severity of the condition. In general, platelet transfusion is not necessary, unless an individual with low platelets (less than 50,000) has an active bleeding or hemorrhage, Sometimes, transfusion may be recommended without any bleeding if the platelet count is less than 10,000. If a drug is thought to be the cause of low platelet count, then it may be discontinued . In auto-immune thrombocytopenia or ITP, steroids can be used to weaken the immune system in order to impair the attack on platelets. Take healthy well balanced diet with plenty of fluids and wait for the B.M result. Hope this helps you! Take care!"},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with ITP last month. My platelet count at that time was only 4000.

Every investigation shows together a proper diagnosis and then er can plan a proper course of management.

The reason for me asking a question is that my blood results just came back and my Gamma G.T is 127 U/L which my GP told me is quite high and possibly caused by the medicines I am on.I am currently taking Avanza 60mg, Effexor 150mg, Pariet, Stemetil, Serequel, Panadene Forte throughout each day and now on Targin 10/5mg. In the past 4 weeks I formed an addiction to Endone 5mg (got to the point of taking 30mg daily for a while) and when I was getting off that, I started taking Targin 20/10 and then 15/7.5 but now on 10/5. For a recent few months I was also taking Hypnodorm (Fluintrapazem 1mg) and Naproxen - now off those both.My alcohol intake is on average 1 standard drink a week, IF THAT - rarely drink for the last 9months. The blood screening also covered Serum Chemistry and my Sodium, Creatine, Protein, ALT, LD, Calcium etc all came back as normal levels. HIV 1/2 negative and Hep A, B and C all negative. Cholesterol is 5.7mmol/L which is the only other somewhat high amount. I feel nauseous throughout the day so don't consume anything until late at night and during the day I tend to get sick and throw up quite a bit, even if it is only water that was consumed. Cannot seem to shake off the anxiety and nauseous feeling for the last 15 months! I also take a daily multivitamin and Krill Oil. Would the medicine I have been and am taking be the cause of my rather high Gamma G.T?? Considering that all other levels are normal?? and MAIN two important questions are, Is there anything I could do to lower it?? And should I be concerned of the high number?? Thank you in advance Dr!","Doctor":"Hi,Your elevated Gamma GT levels are due to your opioid intake, especially morphine (Avinza). Opioids cause constriction of bile ducts and spasm of Sphincter of Oddi, which prevents the flow of bile into the duodenum. As a result, bile gets accumulated in the biliary canaliculi of the liver. When the amount of accumulated bile increases, some bile oozes out and damages the liver cells causing elevated Gamma GT. In later stages, when this worsens, other liver enzymes and serum bilirubin also gets elevated.Yes, you need to be concerned about it as it can end up causing jaundice later. You can try to control it by cutting down on your opioid intake, specifically morphine. Also avoid fatty foods which will be difficult to digest for you right now.Hope this helps you.

I was diagnosed with reactive hypoglycemia about a year ago and it scared me badly. I was driving to see my lady all alone about 10.00 P.M. and I just started feeling weird. I felt short of breath I suddenly got hot and sweaty my vision was getting a little unclear. then ofcourse came the rapid heart rate. see I had no idea it could have been the hypo because none of that runs in my family not diabetes or hypo. So I'm wondering how I came to get it when I'm the only one who has it? Also today I went to class and ofcourse I had to walk up a huge hill then into the college then up a flight of stairs before I could sit down. my heart was racing out of control. I tried to take some deep breaths to slow it down. after a few minutes it did slow down but a few minutes after it slowed down and my heart rate was back to normal it out of nowhere just started beating fast for no reason. I hate this its annoying. It doesn't really scare me because ive done it before I usually just stay calm and breath slow and itll eventually slow down. could it be a health issue causing it? or maybe anxiety? I don't believe its the hypo everytime it happens because this is normally after I eat breakfast so I know my sugar hasn't gone low.","Doctor":"hello,Thanks for posting to HCM,Rapid heart , blurry vision is due to hypoglycemia.your snack has at least 15 to 20 grams of carbohydrat .a half-cup of juice or regular soda1 tablespoon of honey5 or 6 pieces of hard candy1 tablespoon of sugarRegular check up of your blood sugar.regards"},{"Patient":"Hi.

Only meds she's taking is Zyrtec and Nasonex. She gets sinus colds every 4-6 weeks. Just recently had one two weeks ago and did not need antibiotics. She is now saying her stomach hurts a little bit and her stool is dark green/gray. The last time this happened was right after a sinus cold without taking antibiotics and the colored stool lasted about a week. Her doctors won't test her because it only happened twice and it seems to go away. I'm concerned.","Doctor":"Hi.This is a serious matter in a child who is just 9 years old. The reason for the green stool is obviously an infection. This comes in a child from the infection of the nose, sinuses and throat This infection directly causes enteritis to give symptoms of pain in abdomen and nausea, vomiting, colored stool etc. The best way is to get her on an antibiotic after investigations are sent away. I would advise:CT scan of the sinuses, tests of blood, throat or nasal swabs for gram staining and culture sensitivity. Stool tests: routine, microscopy, culture and sensitivity. These will help you to get a proper diagnosis and plan a proper treatment over a long time and get a cure from both the ailments."},{"Patient":"Hello, hoping for some help....A few months ago my dad was on the operating table to get a routine knee surgery when the doctor came in and said he couldn't perform the surgery because my dad's platelet count was only 18.. They did a splenectomy but it didn't work, a week later the levels dropped again. What other options are there? Thanks:)","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.Platelets are essential because they help in clotting of blood. If platelets are low, your surgeon will not take risk of performing surgery. If spleen was suspected to be causing this then it might have increased the platelet count. There may be many other reasons which can cause low platelets. A temporary option can be in transfusing platelet concentrates and stabilising his platelet count before doing surgery. This should be discussed with your surgeon.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi, I'm in Day 13 of a post tonsillectomy.I bled both on the 2nd and the 4th day.

Forum. Low platelets count is known as thrombocytopenia as in your daughter case and sometimes we don't find any cause of this disorder and we call it as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura , need not to worry . Is such situation occurs plenty of fluid orally helps ,if there are no any other sign or symptoms. If platelets count decreases less then 50000 /c mm then we have to interfere otherwise no need particularly in so young child. If fever occurs then think about serological test for any virus. The drug of choice has given and results were very nice as you noted. But drawback of this regime is that it increases lecocytes ( lymphocytes) , but need not to worry . Once you stop prednisolone patient will recover within 7 days i.e. lymphocytes count will come down without any treatment as I have noted in so many patients. Bruise were due to decrease level of platelets so don't take it otherwise as this is known as petechial hemorrhage. Normal count is 150000-4.50000 /c mm . If platelets decreases once again then consult a hematologist and get his opinion.Good luck for your daughter. Dr. HET"},{"Patient":"My hemoglobin has been fluctuating the last year.

There are several different causes of this from hemorrhoids, intestinal worms, inflammatory bowel disease, etc. My advice is that you should get consulted by a gastroenterologist who would investigate and get the cause of this. From there, personalised and adapted solutions would be proposed to you.Please, spicy food, though less likely to cause bleeding in the digestive tract, would not cause bleeding that manifests with bright coloured blood. It is clearly not related to this. Get consulted by a Gastroenterologist for adequate investigations and management.I wish you well in your pursuit of solutions to this.Dr. Ditah, MD"},{"Patient":"Hi,I have a bulging vein in my armpit.

Some persons are so efficient in the management or regulation of blood pressure during the stress events, by either limiting secretion of the amount of main stress hormones, adrenaline and steroids, or rapid stopping and reversing of the stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system responsible for the secretion of these hormones. It is therefore not very unusual.Kind regards,Bain LE, MD"},{"Patient":"Hi!  I'm a 59 year old clinical psychologist.  I'm very healthy, average weight, eat healthful foods, exercise, don't smoke, rarely drink, etc, etc, i.e., your ideal patient.  EXCEPT that I've suddenly ended up with high blood pressure!  I was at my dentist's office last week, and during a routine PB check, my BP was somewhere around 140/105.  Scary!  Especially for me, who's always in perfect shape.  So I had it checked again today, at a friend's office (he's a surgeon buddy of mine) and it was about the same.  (About 30 minutes later, my BP had calmed down to around 145/85, but that's nothing to brag about, of course...)  So my friend Eric prescribed 10mg of Liinopril (it's what he takes).  And I've just taken my first med, as of an hour ago.  No side effects, but I hate being on a BP med!  I want off ASAP.  So here's my question (sorry for the long intro!):Since I'm already doing so many of the things you would characteristically recommend for naturally reducing BP, what do you suggest?  Also, I'm not sure how to go about reducing the med slowly, as I attempt to change a few lifestyle habits toward the healthier side.  In other words, how do I \\"test\\" whether my BP is coming down in independent relationship to the med?  As of the first high reading of a week ago, I immediately cut, cold turkey, all caffeine, alcohol, and salt, and I started eating more potassium-rich foods.  (I do understand, by the way, that I now need to limit my intake of potassium, so I guess I need to cut down/out bananas, spinach, etc?)  I am practically in a panic, because this is literally the first conventional med I've ever had to take.  And we all know that calmness is key here, so HELP!  Thanks so much, Denise D.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for your query.As you already know that calmness is the key so just follow that. Stress itself can increase your blood pressure more.Start doing meditation. Relax yourself. Do things which you enjoy.Make certain dietary changes which you had already started. Include potassium in your diet. Potassium lessens the effect of sodium & thus help to normalise the blood pressure.Decrease salt intake in diet.Eat more of fruits, leafy vegetables, high fiber diet.If you are overweight. Decrease your weight.Start brisk walking daily for 20-30 minutes after consulting your doctor.Stop smoking & drinks that also help to decrease the blood pressure.Follow all this life style modification. Presently you can continue lisinopril.Regularly check your blood pressure thrice a week at same time & keep a chart of all blood pressure readings. Depending on your blood pressure response, lisinopril dose can be decreased gradually or even stopped.I hope i have answered your query.Take care."},{"Patient":"XARELTO lowers your chance of having a stroke by helping to prevent clots from forming.

Iron deficiency anemia is a very common problem in young females throughout India, and is usually due to menstrual loss and poor iron content in food. So do not worry. Make sure that your cycles are not too prolonged and that you do not pass excessive clots. Mebendazole (Mebex) has been given to take care of any parasite/ worm infection in your intestine. For iron deficiency, dexorange is not a very good option because the amount of iron available for absorption in this preparation is very less. Please take Fersolate 200mg thrice daily, together with Folic acid 5mg once daily (and add Methycobolamine 1500ug once daily if you are a vegetarian). This combination should supply the necessary iron, folic acid and Vit.B12 which are all important in red blood cell production. Take this for a minimum of 3 months and recheck your Hb at the end of every month, to check the response. Drugs are safe, except for some patients who are intolerant to iron tablets and have diarrhoea or constipation. You may get black tarry stools for which you need not worry. Hope I answered your query. Thank you."},{"Patient":"My mother-in-law is suffering from ITP from nearly 5 years and her treatment has been ongoing with suggestions from Dr. Dhama Chaudhary. But inspite of several treatments given by him along with high dosage steroids, the condition is not improving. Infact, it is getting worse day-after-day. Due to high dose medication , the side-effects have also come up which are leading to Severe Stomack Pain, Stomach Swelling , Heavy loose motions, bleeding of blood, Breathing problems, low platlet count which sometimes fall as low as 10 and severqal others. In past 6 months, she had been admitted to hospital 3 times and yesterday only, we have to admit her again to the hospital due to severe stomach pain and swelling and critical breatlessness. She s very critical and I am looking out for the best possible treatment available in India. I request you to please help me on urgent basis if you have any good references that can make her a simple being again with a permanent solution to this problem.","Doctor":"Hi. ITP is a condition which can be refractory to treatment and steroid dependence may result. There are a number of options available which can be tried in refractory cases, and to reduce the dose of steroids and its side effects. Breathlessness is not a common symptom in these patients unless the bleeding due to drop in platelet is so severe that there is a marked drop in hemoglobin with ensuing cardiac failure or there is bleed into the lungs due to decreased platelets.

Vitamin B12 is a very important vitamin which is available only in non-vegetarian sources and is essential for red blood cell production and maturation. Deficiency of this vitamin is common in vegans and would lead to anemia and less commonly nervous system abnormalities. Iron is also important as is folic acid, and these three together are quint essential to prevent anemia. Anemia can result due to deficiency of any of these three substances, and any type of anemia is associated with fatigue/dizziness as the oxygen carrying capacity of blood reduces due to deficient hemoglobin. Other causes of Vitamin B12 deficiency include worms, absorption defects and pernicious anemia. So do not hesitate in treating her with Vit.B12 if it is the cause based on the tests.

So what exactly is the difference between these two medicines and which is one better, in case you help me understand.","Doctor":"Hi. The difference between these two drugs is based on the chemical nature and mechanism of action in lowering the blood glucose levels. There is no comparison between these drugs possible as they belong to different classes. These drugs can be used alone or in combination to control blood glucose levels.

Thank you."},{"Patient":"The crack of my butt -- high almost to where it ends near my lower back is scaly and red and itchy and when I sit on the toilet it leaves a pink blood stain -- not a lot but it s raw enough to slightly bleed but not hurt. In and around my actual anus it is very itchy and has been for years. I try cortisone creams live Walgreens etc but the cream itself makes the condition worse. Prescription strength corticosteroid make it go away and I have even gone so far as to spray the area with flonase nasal spray my mother used for her allergies but I noticed that after I did that I got stretch marks on my lower belly which are now going away. The folds between my buttocks cheeks are now left to right brown/red stained or strangely pigmented mirror images of each other. The texture of the skin is otherwise normal with no skin tags or warts . The area directly around my anus is flaky and itchy and I can peel it off like onion skin. I am a male 46. I have gained a lot of weight slowly over the past 8 years ( about 50 pounds) and I am under psychiatric care for panic and anxiety but in reality I can t climb stairs or walk fast because I get light headed -- this is not panic -- I just assume it is because I am too afraid to let an MD touch me unless its to see a psychiatrist -- I am now taking 4mg alprazoloam per day and mg Inderal. Sometimes the symptoms are better but overall I am severely agoraphobic and my life is awful -- I do not feel like a normal person and it s not mental. I work as a writer and I write very well but my mind is very screwed up. I scare easily and things that would normally just annoy someone, make me get very weak where I have to lie down and sleep -- when I can sleep -- if I am out in the sun or I get hot I feel awful and if my shower is too warm I take hours and hours to cool off. I also have wheezing when I get nervous -- like taking a shower. The wheezing is not that bad but I can feel it. I cannot lift or carry anything -- I get so weak so fast that I have to lie down and rest -- sometimes it takes days to get over this. This atrted in 2006 with a full blown panic attack and some kind of subsequent nervous breakdown but prior to that I was fearful of cold sores which wi Oulw get once every two years -- most of this started after the death of my younger brother which was very bad but I find it hard to believe that everyone else in my family is okay, but I am this big fat, sweaty, out of breath, itchy assed, guy who can no longer work or do anything sociable without having a glass of wine -- if I try to take less xanax I get horrible withdrawal symptoms -- all it does not is keep me from getting withdrawal -- there is really no ther purpose for taking it.. Also, this all started at the same time I developed a lot of discreet keratosis on the backs of my hands and the tops of my feet.","Doctor":"Hi. I realise the feeling you have with all those conditions. Itching and flaking around the anus and in the buttock area, which tend to be moist is likely due to fungal infection. Fungal infections are notorious to get better with steroids, but recur in the same areas causing a vicious cycle with their use. Blood stains occur due to repeated excoriation and itching and the area becomes macerated when moist. So please get a fungal smear of the area, to see for fungal elements which can be then taken care of by keeping the area dry, topical and oral antifungals. Also check your blood glucose profile checked because this may be the harbinger of diabetes, which you are prone to being obese. Steroids would cause skin atrophy and stretch marks on repeated use and needs to be stopped, as also can it cause systemic side effects with repeated use. Hope I have answered your query. Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hello, My name is Denise Gold. I was wondering what could be wrong with me. I am 16 years old, I m 123 pounds, breast cancer and diabetes run in my family, I m mildly active ( I walk about 2-3 miles about 3-4 times a week, medium pace). About 4-5 weeks ago I was 134 pounds, but now I m only 123.. I m not an expert, but I m sure 11 pounds lost in 4-5 weeks isn t okay. I eat the same as I ever did, so it couldn t be change in diet . Also, my gums have been really weak lately. They never would bleed for me when I would brush my teeth , but now when I brush my teeth i can spit out dark blood, and at random times they would just start bleeding . I brush my teeth on a regular bases, my Mom s a health freak. Another thing is I ve been extremely hungry lately, more than I usually ever am, but when I eat I feel sick. I don t think it would be pregnancy because I just got a really heavy period, mind you it was a whole week early and only lasted 2 days (my normal periods are usually ALWAYS the same time or very close to the same time every month, never a week off, and they would always last a minimum of 4 days. Also, my breasts have been getting really sharp pains at least a few times a day, especially in my left one near the midline of my body. Another thing is, I swear I ve been so mean lately, naturally I can be mean sometimes, but never like this. I just feel like it s something I can t control. Another thing, I m in a career tech. school and I m going for allied health. Well, my class was practicing vital signs and my teacher was demonstrating on me with the radial pulse . She pointed out that my pulse was extremely slow for my age. Also, I ve been having a lot of bowel movements for the past couple weeks, more than I usually do.","Doctor":"Hi. From your history i understand that you are quite obese and have been having weight loss, with recent onset of bleeding gums and a low pulse rate. Im not sure on how low did you mean your pulse rate is, though i guess if you do not have any fainting attacks or chest discomfort due to this, you need not worry. Weight loss despite normal diet, may be an indication of the onset of diabetes, or may be due to thyroid dysfunction which may also have abnormal bowel movements. Bleeding gums can not be tied up with these two conditions, though bleeding gums is a very common problem. It could be that your gums are unhealthy with infection or you have scurvy or you  have some other condition associated with weight loss which can be picked up after a detailed evaluation of you and your blood counts.

Infection can be the first to be considered in view of the fact that you had fluid in the lung, low counts, splenic enlargement and elevated enzymes all suggesting a septic process. Bacterial infections including tuberculosis can cause similar picture. The other possibility is that there is some sort of immunodeficiency due to which you have been having this syndrome.

Drug induced bone marrow suppression usually recovers by itself when the offending agent is withdrawn or dose is reduced. Since your counts are improving, i think you just need to wait and watch your counts. There is no need to panic at present unless you have a spike of fever which could be dangerous.

Low exposure to sunlight. Sunlight converts vitamin D in skin to its active form.2. Deficiency of foods rich in vitamin D - fish, fish liver oil, eggs, milk, cheese are foods rich in vitamin D. Deficiency of these food items lead to low vitamin d levels.3. Liver and/or kidney disease - Liver and kidney are the organs where vitamin d is converted to its active forms. Kidney is the organ where the final activation takes place.Are any of the above mentioned risk factors present in your case?If yes then the low levels have to be recovered and thereafter the cause has to be removed.A family history of prostate cancer is not a risk factor for low vitamin D levels.Thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"hy my name is jared an my wife was wanting to donate plasma but couldnt .they told her her heart rate was 106 . she waited awhile an they checked it again. it was 103 .she has good blood pressure . but could not understand what the big deal is.think the blood pressure would be the only concern.she was under stress though because they told her she didnt eat enough to give.when che ate two bagel halves with peanut butter on them an one of those special k protein full bars . think that wd have been  enough .but no they told her to eat a burger of all things an come back . so she did .and her heart rate went up. sounds stupid to me .an she weighs 227lbs by the way.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query to H.C.M.

My problem is lack of sleep due to night sweats - and I mean real lack of sleep for 2 years.I know this can affect the white cells but would it affect the cholestrol? Thanks Glenda","Doctor":"Hi Glenda, Welcome to HCM.Although sleep deprivation and high lipid levels can coexist in an individual, whether there is any causal relationship between the two is unclear. It can be expected that sleep deprivation causes sympathetic nervous activation that in turn can cause metabolic disturbances such as increase in blood levels of free fatty acids. However, to arrive at this conclusion more research needs to be done.However, I will advise that you consult your physician for your sleep deprivation as it can not only affect your metabolism but also other physiological systems in your body particular cardiovascular.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"i was told by doctors a few years ago that i was severely anemic, and had to have 2 blood transfusions.

It could be an infection, arthritis, cancer related, osteomyelitis, arteritis, anemia etc. A very detailed questioning, clinical and laboratory exams have to be done.

I think you have all the investigations like CBC, Skin Biopsy, PCR, Genetic study etc.. If the Diagnosis of CTCL is confirmed by these investigations, you must need treatment. But in the presence of severe anemia, your body cannot withstand Chemotherapeutic drugs and other immunomodulators. So it is necessary to correct your anemia first to start proper treatment for CTCL.

Should I be concerned about major problems causing the low red blood cell count or is it likely something that can be treated with diet. And supplements?","Doctor":"At 48 years.the cause for your anemia needs to be evaluated. Anemia may be either due to excessive blood loss or faulty production.If no obvious blood loss is visible,the tests need to be  done to find occult causes.For example microscopic blood loss from the GI tract may be found by testing for stool occult blood.If this does not yield any positive result then a search for deficiencies of raw materials including iron ,vitamins need to be done.The manufacturing apparatus that is the bone marrow need to be examined.Peripheral blood smear will help.Once the cause of anemia is established and treated,management of anemia becomes simple.Taking only supplements for correction of anemia may not help much in the long run.So,its advisable that you consult your physician,do a thorough evaluation and then decide with the physician regarding the best future course of action, whether supplements or whatever."},{"Patient":"Hi.

My doctor says I should check with my GI for possible small bowel study or EGD to evaluate melena and anemia . I am 50 years old and just had a colonoscopy that was normal with the exception of diverticulosis? Should I be concerned and start spending a lot of money on these additional tests?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for sending your question.You are a very young person and the degree of anemia that you are experiencing is such that appropriate medical examination consultation and diagnostic testing is warranted. This includes endoscopy which you have already completed. You have indicated that the endoscopy has not showed any obvious signs of bleeding but that you do have a diverticulosis. It is possible that diverticulosis can contribute to anemia if one of the diverticuli becomes inflamed and bleeds. This might not cause obvious changes in your stool but could contribute to mild anemia.Since nothing obvious has been found it would be reasonable to consider additional work up with the gastroenterologist Including upper endoscopy and possible capsule endoscopy if the upper endoscopy is negative.If the gastroenterology workup is negative the next step would be to review your blood test results with a hematologist. The hematologist will help to make sure that there is no problem with production of red blood cells or abnormal destruction of red blood cells in your body.I think it is worth The investment of time and money to have this worked up completely.Thanks again for sending your question.Dr. Galamaga"},{"Patient":"hey i had several bloodclots in my left upper arm after 9 monthes they took me off warfrian at the time the clots were gone i was off warfrian 30 days and they come back now i think there gone again i have been on blood thinner for 2 years they say my blood is ok this week it is 2.7 but my arm is killing me can you still get clots if your blood is that thin?m","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for sending your question.You have indicated that despite the fact you are on anticoagulation you have significant pain in your arms. The pain could possibly be related to some musculoskeletal problems such as a pinched nerve but in light of your history it is important that your doctor rule out additional blood clots.It is theoretically possible to have a blood clot even if the blood is thinned with Coumadin.

What are the chances of it being a fluke in the blood test?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for sending your question.We use the d-dimer Test as a guide if we have clinical suspicion for a possible blood clot. In your case there must have been some reason which caused your doctor to order this blood test. I imagine your doctor has considered other testing for blood clots such as ultrasound of the legs or possibly a CT scan of the chest. It is extremely difficult to predict the probability of a blood clot with a mildly elevated test results which you have reported. What needs to be done is clinical correlation which means your doctor needs to consider the test results and the possibility of additional testing to rule out possible blood clots.This blood test has no validity in diagnosis of cancer so this result cannot be correlated to any cancer diagnosis.i would encourage you to discuss this test result with your doctor and review your current symptoms to see if your doctor thinks additional diagnostic testing is needed.Thanks again for sending your question.Dr. Galamaga"},{"Patient":"Hello Doctors, I recently had my left thyroid removed due to a large nodule which was causing me breathing issues.

I first noticed the red irregular bumps on my buttocks about 4 years ago in the summer after returning from the beach/ pool. I continued to get it every summer since after sunbathing; it lasts for 2 to 3 weeks and then it goes away. This year however, I got it in February (I was pregnant at the time) and it's been coming back on and off in small bumps since then. I finally saw a dermatologist who did a biopsy; the diagnosis- papular urticaria. In hope for an answer, I saw an allergist as well - turns out i'm allergic to dust mites and cockroach (not known to cause hives). Yesterday I went to a hot yoga class; the room was warmer than usual and i sweated profusely. I got home and my right thigh was covered in red bumps of different sizes, some even expended into a massive red area overnight - they are somewhat itchy and my skin feels as sensitive as when I get sunburn. My left thigh is not as affected - just a few red bumps. I take Allegra on a regular basis and I used anti - itch lotion  for the first time today (Itch Fix,  i believe). I do not have any other medical condition aside from Thalassemia minor. The rash seems to have gotten worse since it first started 4 years ago, it really worries me. What else should i look into? What steps should i take?","Doctor":"Hello friend,I am a Homoeopath and so my answer will be different from what you have already heard about allergy.Yes you are allergic to several things like heat of summer, dust, mites, cockroach etc.This hypersensitivity is inborn or genetic. But the time of developing hypersensitivity is related usually to a psychological conflict you had at the time of onset of the problem. If you started getting it 4 years back, exactly before that you must have had some shocking conflict which remain unresolved. But your brain associated the urticarea to the external environments like heat of sun, dust etc. instead of associating with the conflict. Now your brain has made a programme associated with these factors and whenever you get exposed to such environments you get the symptoms of urticarea . First of all if you can recollect the conflict, then you can resolve it at the mental level. How you reacted to that is important because that is your genetic, constitutional individuality that made you to react in that manner. This will help the Homoeopathic physician to select the constitutional remedy for you. Therefore my advice to you is to approach an expert Homoeopath at the earliest. You should stop taking any anti- drugs because the purpose of the Homoeopathic treatment is not to suppress the skin reaction but is to cure you. Once you are cured, then your urticarea will go away.

A CA 15-3 was also done a week ago & was 33, & is supposed to be less than 31.  How scared should I be???  My main question is whether or not, especially in light of the low Vit. D dx, the added stress of bony fusion (which the spinal docs say will take a year to \\"finish\\" healing) , COULD BE EFFECTING MY TUMOR MARKERS?   Thanks, AAAAA","Doctor":"HI Thank for asking to HCM,, No it does not affects to any of your body system even if you had breast surgery for 'CA' just do not be panic, Vit.D is little complex element, having certain controversies, and it turns low among the female nowadays, with the changing of life style and diet, but it does not cause any harm to a person, you are really doing fine just keep it up, forget the vit.

Antacids help, but don't take it away.  It also happens a lot after meals, within 10 minutes after eating.  And now it has been constant for 24 hours.  It happeneds a couple months ago too, lasted a couple weeks then went away.  Now it is back.  I have a Dr. appt next week, but I am afraid they won't be able to find anything wrong, and I am in a fair amount of pain.  Does it sound like an ulcer?","Doctor":"Thank you for consulting in HealthCareMagic. You are probably suffering from gastritis which could also give rise to an ulcer. Whether you have an ulcer can be confirmed only after a upper GI endoscopy. The gastric acids are meant to digest the food that we take. If the stomach is empty, this acid rather does harm.Take small but frequent meals. Take omeprazole capsule in the morning in empty stomach reguarly for one and a half months. I hope you would get relief.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Health care magic are welcome.

Liver disease causes inability of the hepatocytes to conjugate unconjugated bilirubin.Thirdly, any obstruction in flow of bilirubin from the liver to the duodenum causes accumulation of bilirubin and thus jaundice.There are various tests to determine the site of defect in the entire bilirubin metabolism and hence the cause of jaundice.Obstruction of the biliary tract which transmits bilirubin from liver to the duodenum will cause an increase in levels of alkaline phosphatase, gamma Gy and 5-nucleotidase enzymes.So, gamma GT will be raised in disorders of the biliary tree most often alcohol liver disease.Thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"Hi, my name Sophia Tyler ive had p.e twice taking the birth control depo pervera, im only 27 and dealing with a blood disorder and my doc is suggesting this birth controll im having doubts what do u think is  best, when i was 14 i had a still born and after my daughter that i hade in 2003 which is nine i had a miscarraige after her my doc sugesst essure","Doctor":"HiWith the history of pulmonary embolism,especially twice, harmonal contraception, even progesterone is best avoided.

The small intestine absorbs iron from your food, but in your case after the baritic surgery a significant part of your small intestine is being used as part of your stomach now. So there is a smaller area to absorb the iron.Actually, this is quite a common side effect of the baritic surgery, I am surprised your doctor hasnt told you that yet.Anyway a temporary solution to your problem would be a blood transfusion.Has your doctor considered checking whether you are suffering from anemia caused by chronic diseases?It is a condition which most doctors tend to overlook, so ask him to consider it.I hope this helped."},{"Patient":"Hello, I have had a major surgery on my foot May 9 and then 4 days later hospitalized with 3 severe duodum ulcers that I was unaware I had.

These ulcers could also be precipitated by pain killer which you might have used for pain. Even these medicines can cause ulcer its self in patient with APD that is acid peptic disease .Fluctuating blood pressure has nothing to do with the foot surgery .It could be due to age factor, since you’re of 40 years age.

I didn t bump my leg at all it just happened when i was sitting on the sofa.","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for your question.Your history of spider veins and the blue spot on your leg can be from venous congestion caused by varicose veins.A congestion of blood in the leg veins can cause swelling and skin changes in the skin over the legs.This can be treated by treating the varicose veins.An Interventional Radiologist like me can treat this by either an Endovenous Laser Therapy or by Radiofrequency ablation.Both the spider veins and skin patches should disappear after this treatment.

It is visible as a slightly raised area versus the other side.  The exact term from my doctor was R Subcostal fluid buildup.  It appeared suddenly last Sunday evening or  Monday morning, around the time I went for a sonogram to check out what my doctor thought might be a periumblical node or cyst.  That turned out okay - a cyst or fatty tissue,  all of my organs showed clear as much as could be told by a sonogram.  But, the radiologist saw the fluid build-up; he kept asking me if I had injured myself, I didn't think I had although I had been sweeping up leaves the night before and stretched pretty aggressively a couple of times.  I was nervous the morning of the sonogram and was holding myself very rigidly.  I also had to go to the bathroom.","Doctor":"Hi.The built up of fluid in the R-right subcostal area is definitely dangerous as this is never a normal finding. One has to get to the root cause , which can be due to Cholecystitis, can be a cyst, can related to any of the inflammatory process and can be tuberculosis. I would advise to undergo CT scan to confirm , get a Consultation of a General Surgeon for clinical examination and further investigations and treatment ."},{"Patient":"Left foot red with broken capillaries.

My gamma gt score came back at 163 which apparently is high. I am tee total so it s not alcohol related.

How can I reduce the level?","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your questions here, I will try to answer them to the best of my abilities. Usually gamma gt is increased in patients with drinking problems or patients with liver diseases. In some cases even patients with hypertension have been known to have high gamma gt levels.While medication has been known to cause an increase in gamma gt levels, I dont believe that the medication you are currently taking has that effect.So what you can do is to talk to your doctor and have him do a liver function test on you, to see whether your liver is functioning properly or not.Once the cause is found and is treated your gamma gt levels should come back down, so talk to your doctor and have your liver checked.I hope this answered your question."},{"Patient":"my wbc came back the 1st time 11 ...now this time its 19...im having chest .....the dr xrays done...I really don't know whats going on...I don't feel sick...not running a fever...I don't take steroidsis trying to get in touch with another dr to see what else he can do.  he said this one was a mystery to him...what do u think...do u have any suggestions","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for using HCM.Hi whats your age and why you got the investigation done?

I also had a foot wound in which I was diagnosed with Cellulitis , Strep infection and Scarlett Fever, 1 year ago. I flew a long distance 6 months later and both of my feet, ankles and legs swelled up again. My family doctor told me it was just the long flight and that I should get stockings and get up during the flight.

He is currently in England and the doctors tell him there is nothing wrong. How can that be when he has changed his diet and still is doubled over in pain and barely able to live a normal life?","Doctor":"Hello, As what I understand from the history, the symptoms of breathing difficulty is due to stomach problem. May be he is not able to digest the food and the gastric issue is leading to pain. Nausea is a symptoms to feel in acidity. I will advice to consume slow sips of water with sugar in it. As fold water will ease the acid effect of the HCL produced in the stomach and sugar is a base which will help reduce the acidity. Having warm water post food and avoiding high protein food should help. In my clinical practice of over 12 years most cases of breathing issues are due to gastric issue. Once the gastric issue is resolved then the pain will come down and so does the breathing issue. Handling this kind of properly have always produced excellent results.

Thank.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM,A wide platelet distribution width suggests that there is variation in sizes of the platelets.In health the platelet size lies between 1-3 microns.In some conditions, there is marked variation in sizes of the platelets, ie some are smaller than 1 microns and some are above 3 microns.This is commonly seen in conditions wherein there is rapid turn over of the platelets.Since, all other platelet parameters are within normal limits, it is not of any serious consequence.Thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"iacuired MRSA in 2005-2007 during an outpatient surgery....l became septic(In my bloodstream)was given the wrong antiboitics for 8 months(amocillion)before l was told by a friend to have a culture and sysitivity test...which showed that l actually did have MRSA...almost died...had a hickman catherer placed in my chest/heart and had to take Vancomicyn for 6 hrs aday for almost 3 months....bedridden for about 16 months before getting any better...My question is ////ln the past month l have had MRSA sores come up on me...1 on my leg and3 on my chest...surgically drained one 3 weeks ago on my chest...l now have 2 more within a couple of inches ofeach other....What should l do to prevent anymore and is it possible to ever get rid of MRSA..","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM,MRSA is a very resistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus.This bacteria is normally present on the skin.This infection is hospital acquired and is common in patients who are on instruments like catheters, iv lines, gastrostomy, enterostomy, etc.The strain rapidly acquires resistance against commonly used antibiotics.In your case, it is advisable to get a culture and sensitivity done each time you get any infection on the body.Since, you have used vancomycin in past, there is a possibility that the bacteria may have acquired resistance against the antibiotic.MRSA is an infectious agent so definitely it is possible to get rid of it but it resistant or in lay mans words, it is stubborn so a culture sensitivity is required each time you acquire the infection.Thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with DVT & PE 2 weeks ago.

I am 32 years old and since 12 years ago i was diagnosed with Anemia aplastic , during 2 years i was treat with inmunosupresants and eritropoyetina , but the efects were toxicity . During the next years I was taking care of my nutrition, and it works i count my platels in 60 and hb 9, and were able to job and attend my other job at home with my kids, But this last two years, ive been feeling tired, headache and my platels are counting in 20 my hb in 5.5 I have to leave my job, and, i attend my doctor and he said that the only option is marrow osseus transplantation , and to tell the true I am scared to think about that I do not have mother no father neither brothers nor sisters who can be donnors and I am alone in this world with my two kids, and Iam afraid to leave them alone. Actually I am trying with papaya leaves, i drink it for three days but nothing is happen. Any adviced?","Doctor":"Hi Iris,Thank you for posting your question here, I will try to answer it to the best of my abilities.While you are looking for a potential donor, you can take some blood transfusions. This is not a permanent solution but at least it can buy you some time. You should ask your doctor to prescribe you with some antibiotics and antivirals as right now you are prone to infections.You can also talk to your doctor and ask him options in bone marrow stimulating medication e.g epotein. If this works you wont need a bone marrow transplant.But if it doesnt then you have no choice but to consider going for a bone marrow transplant, how old are your children? They can act as donors for you. I hope this answered your question."},{"Patient":"So my husbad had a venous doppler done and we were told that he has bad veins basically and she was telling me about a procedure over the phone that she can do but I wasn t able to fully understand what she called the procedure I thought it was something along the lines of a flarectomy (I know that is not the spelling) something about taking out the bad veins, do you have any idea of what this procedure may be called so we can do some looking into. Thanks","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your question here, I will try to answer it to the best of my abilities.The term you are looking for is called phlebectomy. It is a procedure in which cuts are made above the bad veins, or as near them as possible. From these cuts the bad veins are removed. Local anesthesia is used for the procedure so your husband wont feel any pain.It is a relatively minor procedure and can be carried out at a hospital or an out patient department.Complications from his procedure are very rare, so I recommend you get it done.I hope this answered your question."},{"Patient":"Hello, just over a week ago I had a pretty bad fall from my horse where I was bucked into the air and landed on my back! I was knocked unconscious for a few seconds but had sever pain in my lower back and butt especially to the left. I went to A&E, they gave me morphine for the pain and took a urine sample as they were worried about bruising to the kidney, there was no blood in my urine and they told me it was more than likely muscle bruising and should ease in a week! I took a week off work as the pain of walking and sitting was just too bad! However since the accident it doesn t seem to feel any better at all, I have now started to get low pains in the front of my tummy as well as still sharp burning pains in my lower back. It is very painful to walk and sit! I am also noticing abdominal pain when I go to the toilet. There has been no visible bruising since the accident and the area with the most pain (left lower back, around kidney area) is slightly numb to touch. I am taking inflammatory tablets and pain killers which do help slightly but I am in pain again as soon as they wear off! What would you suggest? No scans were done while at the hospital. Thank you for you help Jodie","Doctor":"Hi.With a history of a fall from the horse SCANs are certainly indicated to prove or to rule out any internal injury. Consult a General Surgeon for a clinical examination to determine which scans you need to undergo to confirm or to rule out internal injury of any sort. The further treatment will depend upon the findings."},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with idiopathic cardiomyopathy . Last year my ejection fraction was 25. My last echo cardiogram showed it be 51%.

I am a 47 year old female.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for posting your question here, I will try to answer it to the best of my abilities.It can be that you are in the early stages of anemia when symptoms havent sent in, thats why you havent noticed.There are many reasons for anemia, the most simple would be your diet. Not eating enough iron or vitamin B12. There are other causes as well, but usually these two are the more common ones.Now the job of your doctor is to find the cause of your anemia, this will require a couple of tests. Once he is done with that, you can be treated accordingly.I hope this answered your question."},{"Patient":"Ankylosing spondylitis diagnosis for past 3 years and taking humira / methotrexate and some other drugs which keep things under control, but today have experienced hand and even body tremors that range from mild to large-- uncontrollable and then I relax more and they subside.

This is especially seen in females who have a predisposition to allergies, which in your case is asthma.

Approx. 2 weeks following a 600 mg per day dose, (my ferritin level was at 9)  I started having severe heartburn.  I went back to my doctor who sent me to a gastroentologist, who prescribed tecta, 40 mg per day.  He asked me to stay on this regimen for 3 months.  In the meantime I continued taking the ferrous sulfate as my doctor said other iron meds can cause worse side effects.  She appeared to dismiss the idea that the iron was the problem.  The tecta helped, however I felt uneasy taking it, especially when I have heard concerns regarding hip fractures.  The gastroentologist suggested I take the tecta for another 6 months and then return.  I started suffering anxiety and began taking lorazepan.  I then decided to wean myself off the tecta and lorazepan.  I only take them occasionally now.  I have discontinued the iron altogether, am taking a natural remedy called Easy Iron.  I have yet to get my blood tested to see if this is bringing up my levels as my last test showed they were 13.  So, I am still having stomach issues.  My stomach feels hot, makes alot of gurgling noises and then I get acid reflux.  It appears to occur on an empty stomach, mainly in the wee hours of the night.  I am thinking this isn't a heartburn issue but stomach problems, maybe anxiety related.  I have had a scope done, ultrasound for my gallbladder, pancreas checked and all looks good.  The only thing on my report from the scope said some bile was insufflated from, I think it was the intestine.   I am worried about getting Barret's, sleep upright.  drink small amounts of aloe vera juice in the morning and before bed.   I am feeling unsure about my own doctor's recommendations now as I think the iron was what started all these problems in the first place.  She has no regard for holistic therapies so I hope you can shed some light.  I am a 46 yr. old female, ideal weight, work out regularly, a non smoker.   Lastly, I haven't had a colonoscopy, the specialist felt I didn't need one and said just ,\\"Pop another Tecta, if I need it.\\"  I have gotten a bone density test recently as I was worried about bone loss due to taking tecta, and the results were really good. Thank-you for any advice.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for using healthcaremagic for the solution of your queries. Following are the points which I can narrate for the satisfaction of your queries. (1) For the management of anemia one has to continue oral iron therapy till normalization of blood hemoglobin and serum ferritin levels and 6 months after it to replenish body iron stores to prevent further development of anemia provided that you take enough iron in your daily food. So, please go for blood hemoglobin and serum ferritin level check. This will clear out whether you need further Iron supplementation or not. If it is within the expected range normal for your age than you only have to continue therapy for another 6 months for the replenishment of body iron stores and then stop every medicine which will solve all your problems. (2) Coming to your second problem, heartburn, I would like to know which formulation you are taking? how (with food/water/milk or anything else) in what dose (total daily dose and number of tablets/capsules)) and when (timings, before / after food, on empty stomach) you are taking it? as this will affect the development of heartburn. Ideally you should take total daily dose of Iron divided in two doses on empty stomach (2 hrs before or after meal) preferably with home made lemon juice which will further increase absorption of iron from tablet/capsule and will increase effect of therapy.(3) Regarding your concern of increased risk of hip fracture, I would like to tell you that with your duration of therapy (around 1.5 years) there are no clear evidences that Tecta (pantoprazole) increases bone loss and hence hip fracture. Although risk appears over longer time. So what you can do is make sure you take enough of calcium in your daily food. Plus point for you is that you are having ideal weight, working out regularly and a non smoker.  So, please stop worrying and just take precautions only :) . Hope this will help you. Take care."},{"Patient":"yes  I have ccleuk and I have a thrombosis for both I have been taking wayfarin.

There has been no blood in his stool and had a normal colonoscopy 10 years ago and also has had no stomach problems. I have ideas but looking for input.","Doctor":"Hello and thanks for the query,It is possible that somewhere in the gastrointestinal tract that he is having a slow and gradual loss of blood.  This can come from ulcers, diverticuli, inflammed blood vessels, or possibly from a cancer.  This is why the endoscopy is indicated.If the endoscopy is normal - a workup for hemolysis is indicated - this is where the body is somehow breaking down blood cells causing a drop in hemoglobin.  This can sometimes be an autoimmune process.Lastly, if all else appears normal an examination of the bone marrow may be indicated.  This would require a referral to a hematologist.  For now - proceed with the endoscopy and then the doctors can determine the next logical step in helping to improve the hemoglobin.One other thing - diet - can affect hemoglobin. In cases of low iron the hemoglobin will be low.  All of this can be assessed with simple blood tests at the discretion of your doctor.Sincerely,Dr. Galamaga"},{"Patient":"My wife has her doctor tell her her protein counts is too high.

Bone marrow has not been considered an option owing to her age.

She is presently taking anti-tuberculosis medication (Rifampicin and one other drug that escapes from my mind at the moment). Just the other night, she was wheeled to the ICU to monitor her rapid heart rate--she stayed for 24 hours and was transferred back to her regular room to avoid possible infection from the other ICU patients.

I was at a University graduation for my grandson and sitting outside in the sun.  When I got home I took my blood pressure and it was 83/41. It happened already twice this month. Normally I have been at 140/84 .  Should I be worried?Ihave head bp problems since 1985(genetic) and never had any trouble.","Doctor":"Hi! Our blood pressure is strictly and efficiently regulated by our body's circulatory and Renin-Angiontensin-Aldosterone systems. But as one ages, our blood vessels become stiffer, our kidneys lose a bit of their efficiency in conserving or removing salts, and the function of our \\"blood pressure sensors\\" also decline. Aside from this, external factors such as the ambient temperature that you are exposed to (just like when you were sitting in the sun), can also affect the balance of the systems and make your blood pressure drop or rise. These can really affect our body's mechanism to maintain the ideal blood pressure, no matter what our genetic profile is. I wouldn't be worried too much but I would really suggest that you undergo a basic physical and diagnostic examination to be sure that there are no other problems. In the meantime, drink plenty of fluids and don't stay out in the sun for too long. Take care!"},{"Patient":"Thank you. My husband had a CHF with ejection fraction of 10 to 15%.

I am very concerned that I may have heart problems . What do you suggest I do. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Madge","Doctor":"Hello! After carefully reviewing your problems, there appear some significant aspects, 1) Family history of deaths of first degree relatives & 2) Constant rise of the blood pressure 3) A continuous, intermittent state of symptoms with tendency to increase during night hours All these symptoms point towards an intra-cardiac conduction defect like SVT (Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias) or a congenital prolonged QT interval. You must have an immediate ECG & consultation with an eminent cardiologist, as all these diseases are very much treatable, especially if SVT, then you will be cured completely with RFCA (Radiofrequency intracardiac catheter ablation), or if it is found to be a long QT syndrome, an implant of ICD (Implantable cardioverter defibrillator) Thanks & take care of yourselves!

Many Thanks  !","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for using this forum for your health concerns.I am so sorry to hear about what you are going through. Not all cases of primary syphilis really stand out clear that you may suspect having the infection. You may not have ever noticed you had the infection though you have suffered from it. These are cases of asymptomatic primary infection.For this test to be positive consistently,and FTA which is specific to Syphilis being positive deserve to be treated. I will strongly advise you get treated and so like syphilis which has lasted more than a year because we don't really know when this happened.The side effects of the commonly used drug are very rare and not life threatening. Treating now is the best way to go. If you don't have any infection, the side effects are still the same and not any more dangerous than with having the disease.Hope this helps...Welcome to ask more questions and wish you good health."},{"Patient":"I am asking for my daughter- she has constipation/ diarrhea and low Hgb 8.3Got gastroscopy, colonoscopy, Celiac Bx- everything negative.

Nice to know to you. This is Vinod Kumar .T, I am from Mahabubnagar,Andhra Pradesh. I am suffering from Hemophilia from childhood .  My deficiency is FACTOR-8. And I am the member of Hemophilia Society (Hyderabad Branch)also. I have gone through all the medicine (alopathy,homeo,ayurved..etc) but no use. So Could you please tell me any way to cure this problem completely.?Thanks,Vinod,+91-0000","Doctor":"Hello,Factor 8 deficiency hemophilia is called as hemophilia A.Hemophilia A is the most common type of hemophilia. It is largely an inherited disorder in which one of the proteins needed to form blood clots is missing or reduced. In about 30% of cases, there is no family history of the disorder and the condition is the result of a spontaneous gene mutation. Normal plasma levels of FVIII range from 50% to 150%. There are different levels of hemophilia: mild, moderate, and severe, depending on the amount of clotting factor in the blood.Sadly there is no permanent cure for hemophilia,at the moment.Since  hemophilia is a genetic disease, it means that the problem can't usually be fixed unless your genes are changed. scientists currently are unable to change someone's genes, but in the future there is some hope that genetic diseases might be cured by inserting new genes into people's DNA. there are scientific studies about this right now, but there's no specific treatment yet.Treatment at the moment is regular infusion of clotting factor 8 ,which can be either isolated from blood or recombinant or both.Thanks"},{"Patient":"I am 18yrs old, 60kg and 5ft 3in.

Reports for HIV and HCV are non reactive. However, Antibodies test results have not come yet.Please suggest or atleast help me out with your opinion, as to what disease the doctor is actually suspecting and do we need to really worry or not. Thanks a ton for your help...!!","Doctor":"Hello friend,Thank you for choosing Health care magic. I am a Homoeopath and so will be answering your question in the view point of Homoeopathy. The lab investigations of your blood give value of platelets as below normal. Any biochemical change occurring  in your body is not the disease. It is the result of disease or the self defence mechanisms body takes up to keep you healthy. By administering chemical drugs we should not try to bring about changes in the blood picture also.Here you have not mentioned what made you to do a routine blood study. What symptoms were there that prompted you to do so? Or since how long you are suffering from that particular symptom? Then you will give a particular event in your life that made you sick. It can be one psychological conflict that made you sick in the organ level. It can also be like this that you had a comparatively innocent symptom in a less serious organ and that was treated by suppressive chemical drugs and thus affected the contents of the blood. It can either be an affection in the ectodermal layer which constitutes skin or an affection in the endodermal layer which constitute mucus membranes of Upper Respiratory tract , Gastro intestinal tract or Urogenital tract. The changes in the blood content is an affection more severe than the other two layers because the blood is a connective tissue developing from mesoderm. This usually happens in the treatment of simple fevers by suppressive chemical drugs. Conventional medicine has no understanding about this hierarchy of different organs or systems and so not agreeing with suppression. As a Homoeopath, I have to suspect such things also as causative factors.A detailed case taking will reveal the course of the disease and will give light to the exciting cause. The fundamental causes are MIASMS, which is the genetic understanding of disease production according to Homoeopathy.Therefore my advise is to consult an expert Homoeopath at the earliest. There is no mistake in doing all possible investigations to make the disease diagnosis. But do not take any medication only to bring back your altered blood picture. There should be radical correction of your constitution which Homoeopathy can do for you. Homoeopathy is the best holistic medicine which takes into consideration your body and mind at the same time.My best wishes for a speedy recovery through Homoeopathy.Dr. C. J.

Thank you, Pat M","Doctor":"Your Vit D levels are in the insufficiency range and not really in the severe deficiency range. Anyways, the dose advised by your doctor is fine. Some doctors advise 60000 IU once a week for 12 weeks. The dose prescribed to you should normalise your Vit D levels. You can repeat your levels after 3 months to check on that. Post normalisation of the levels, it is advisable that you expose yourself to early morning sunlight before 9am, like take a  simple walk for half an hour. Alternatively you can take Vit D 1000 IU daily."},{"Patient":"I'm a 26 year old female with high blood pressure and no other medical issues. The last couple days my heart rate has been between 110 and 119 after walking from a resting position to the restroom or after changing clothes. It stays elevated for at least an hour at a time and I get light headed and nauseous. Should I fgo to the er to be seen or just wait and relax it away.","Doctor":"Hello,thanks for using health care magicIt would have been interesting to know your BP measurements. However, normal BP is less than 120/80 for optimal and less than 140/90 is still considered normal. Normal pulse rate is less than 100 but ideal is between 60 to 80 beats per minute.Your values of 110 and 119 are not normal and are called in medicine tachycardia ( fast heart).Tachycardia could be functional  ( due to intense physical activity or anxiety ) which is not the case with you. More so, high BP is uncommon in young people and whenever there is, an underlying cause is definitely present.Increase BP and tachycardia could be due to diverse causes incluing the heart itself, tumors similar to adrenal glands etc.You should see an  internist or cardiologist for better evaluation.Best regardsDr Achuo"},{"Patient":"I just had my blood hormone levels checked and the results came back that I had low vitamin D levels.

Are the levels really normal?","Doctor":"Hi friend, Welcome to Health Care Magic 'They' need not ask before doing the blood tests... The doctor interprets the level in relation to the period...and even then they may not ask, if the result is in range.

My blood group is O+ve and my marriage has been arranged with a girl having the same blood group O+ve . can you please tell me in detail if our baby may have some disability after some years. Actually i have seen a few O+ve cases before where, when the child is around 10 years these defects and disabilities come out and then there is nothing but to watch a child die. So kindly please help me out if i should say \\"yes\\" for the marriage or \\"no\\". thank you .","Doctor":"Hello Sidhart, GO ahead with the proposed marriage, if you like her. Blood groups do not determine possibility of disability for your future child. If you marry a girl with any negative( A-ve. B-ve,AB-ve or O-ve ) blood group and your first child is positive blood group, then there is possibility of disease to your second child. But this can be prevented by proper treatment after first pregnancy. About the '  cases before where, when the child is around 10 years these defects and disabilities come out'  that you mention , did this occur in your relatives? In that case some genetic disease is a possibility ( unrelated to blood group ) and you may get an opinion from a clinical geneticist.

Nevertheless your friend should continue regular follow-ups with her Physician and repeat blood tests as requested by her doctor. Many a times the platelet count might be low and still there may be no signs externally (such as bruises).She should also take some precautions to prevent injuries, since these can lead to serious bleeding if her platelet count is very low.

I just had my 11 month old daughter get a CBC to check if there is even a slight possibility that she has leukemia.  I am very concerned about leukemia happening again in our family because my baby sister died of it more than 20 years.  We sent to the hospital because I saw 3 small \\"bruises\\" on her leg a week ago. They were pale brown, not the red-bluish bruise you get from a you get hit hard by something. My daughter started to walk a month ago and does not seem to mind falling and hurting herself just to reach what she wants grab. The bruises could have just been from her walking or crawling. She has no fever. Her appetite is good; no weight loss; no signs of weakness. But we were still worried.From her CBC: RBC was normal (4.86 x 10^12/L), platelet was \\"adequate\\", but WBC elevated (14 x 10^9/L). I believe that should be about 14,000/ cubic mm.  Blood morphology said \\"Smear shows slightly hypochromic, microcytic red blood cells. Platelets are adequate\\".Should I be worried? I do not want to subject my daughter to a battery of tests for a witch hunt for leukemia. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCm. It is good to be caotious about childs health but hypochondria wont be helpful for you and her either. Blood work is normal,slightly raised WBC means nothing or some healed respratory infection. These bruises would be rlated to trombocytes and clooting factors and these are normal so she probbaly just got hit and you didnt notice. Leukemia is rare,you should visit doctor if you find something suspicous but spare your child of unnecessary blood testing everytime you notice fever, bruise or cough.

I am a regular blood donor. Today when I went to donate blood I was diagnosed that my HB level is 11.9.I was advised iron supplements.  Which medicine I should take to have normal HB value. Further is it also necessary for me to take calcium supplements as I am already more than 40 years old.Thanks","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for using health care magic. An HB of 11.9 is not that alarming nor bad though its at border line of lowest limit in normal range. It is important to know why the Hb is going down. You say you are a blood donor and if that is the reason why your Hb went down then not a big deal. However other possible causes of reduced Hb could be poor nutritional supply of Iron and vitamin B12 which are needed for Red blood cell formation. Calcium is not required in the synthesis of red blood cells, however its an important element in the body and helps in blood clotting. Iron supplement of an average of 50mg per day for a month would do you good together with vitamin b12. Hope this helps you.

Your time and input will both be greatly appreciated.  Thank You","Doctor":"Hi, How did you assess that your blood is dark. Usually when injury occurs the blood will be red in color because it is arterial blood which contains more of O2. Suppose you are giving blood samples for investigation it will be dark in color because it is venous blood which contains more of CO2. Those who have bronchial asthma or a smoker may have dark colored blood because of less % of O2 absorption in the bronchial passage. Where as you say in all aspect you are normal. even though O2 & CO2 monitoring machines are available better you check up your O2 saturation in the Pulse oxi meter within a mt. you will find out your O2 saturation which should be 90 and above.

This is an important clinical distinction from patients with vasculitis, such as Henoch-Schönlein purpura or drug hypersensitivity. In vasculitic purpura, the patient experiences a prodrome of stinging or burning. On examination, vasculitic purpura has a palpable, papular character. Thrombocytopenic purpura and vasculitic purpura also have a different pattern of distribution. Thrombocytopenic purpura is consistently localized to dependent portions of the body. As a result, petechiae are most dense on the feet and ankles, fewer are present on the legs, and only scattered petechiae occur elsewhere on the body. Areas with firm subcutaneous tissue, such as the soles of the feet, are protected from petechiae, while areas with minimal subcutaneous support, such as the oral mucosa and conjunctivae, may have large bullous appearing hemorrhages. In contrast, vasculitic purpura may occur in symmetrical patches without regard for a dependent distribution"},{"Patient":"yes please, my husband has been in the military for 18 years urine sample always came out clean never had any problems with any kind of drug usage, now he has steroid shot in his neck about 1 time per month, he is on gabapention, lisinopril, hydrocodone, and nortriptyline, we get a letter on Friday certified that my pain management doctor can no longer treat him due to his last urine test showed positive for oxycodone, and moraphine, we have neither of those but did not show positive for the hydrocodone that they prescribed for him, My question is how could something show up like that and what should we do?","Doctor":"Hi,Based on the information it seems like a \\"FALSE POSITIVE\\" test for CODINE/ MORPHINE.There are two different possibilities if the information provided is 100% correct.1) There are cases where a patient had eaten to many donuts with \\"POPPY SEED\\" which has as same content as codine/ morphine in very trace amount but eating a lot will turn the table around and make their urine positive for such drugs.2)URINE sample may have accidentally changed with some one else.Hope it helps.Dr. JAY PATEL."},{"Patient":"My daughter is on warfarin but her inr count keeps dropping.

They have referred me to obgyn oncologist which my appt is monday. I have cramps my back and leg hurt every time I stand and my ca 125 level was 300. Is there a good chance this is cancer. I want a hysterectomy because for the past year I have dealt with my periods being so heavy I have to sit on toilet","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for using health care magic. Ca 125 as you already know is a marker for cancer. It increases in cancers of the digestive system and those of the reproductive system including the ovaries, fallopian tubes, endometrium of uterus etc. It is highly used in the diagnosis and follow-up of ovarian cancer. Ca 125 is not specific to a particular disease and does not necessarily indicate a malignant disease. It could be elevated in benign conditions such as uterine fibroids as well. From your history; heavy menses, anemia, enlarged uterus etc, there is a good chance that what you have is a uterine fibroid. The only problem is that the ca 125 level is far above the normal which is 35 (300 in your case). The appearance of uterine fibroid on ultrasound is particular and you should see your ultrasonographer to say if the mass was not well round and with borders and characteristic of fibroid. If its a fibroid or none metastasized cancer, hysterectomy will be just fine. Best regards and hope this helps. Dr Achuo"},{"Patient":"I had a P.E last year, which there was no cause found.

I would suggest that in addition to the CT which was already done that your doctors check an ultrasound of your lower extremities to make sure there is no DVT. There are other things which may elevate the D-dimer including inflammation.  If you have any underlying inflammatory disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis or chronic kidney disease or lupus. If your doctor decides to stop the warfarin you should be followed closely for recurrence of the thrombosis. Thanks again for sending the query.  Pleae let us know if you have any additional concerns. Dr. Galamaga"},{"Patient":"Hi, I had blood work done and it showed that I was anemic, my ferritin level was at 8. This was back in early february and I have been taking iron pills since. For the first month I was taking 65mg and I had another blood work done and my ferritin had only risen to 12. I am a college distance runner, and for training needed my iron levels to get up much more quickly, so for the past month I have been taking 130mg of elemental iron in the form of ferreous sulfate but my performance has not improved at all. I do not take my iron with any calcium or meals. Is my body just not absorbing it? Why am I not seeing any improvements?","Doctor":"Thanks for submitting your question . You are surely suffering from iron deficiency anemia. Your ferritin level is low which suggest iron deficiency anemia. I think oral iron therapy in the form of ferrous sulphate is sufficient, which contains 60 mg of elemental iron. What is your hemoglobin level?. 60 mg of elemental iron if taken for 4to 6 weeks rises hemoglobin by only 1 %. So it takes time for ferritin level to rise. If you want quick results then iron injections are available but in your case it is not required. Beside you should also go for iron profile to know the cause of anemia. But from your current history it is evident that ferritin level is not rising ,so one should find the cause for blood loss from the body. Next step is to undergo upper and lower GI scopy to rule out anemia due to blood loss. Have patience oral therapy requires time for ferritin level to rise .

Has something new been found out about the treatment of pernisios anemia as I don t think I would be able to absorb tablets ?","Doctor":"Hi, Let me try to address your concern by starting to give some more information about \\"PERNICIOUS ANEMIA\\" in simple terms. PERNICIOUS ANEMIA - its a anemia which occurs due to deficiency of \\"INTRINSIC FACTOR\\" - which is kind of chemical released by stomach, which in turn increases the absorption of vitamin B12. B12  plays very important role in process of formation of normal size and shape of RED BLOOD cell. In pernicious anemia the cell size increases due to lack of vitamin B12, which is why this kind on anemia is know as \\"LARGE- red blood cell anemia\\" (megaloblastic anemia). 1) As far as the treatment is concern  replacement of the store of B12 can be done rapidly by VITAMIN B12 INJECTION which you already have taken . 2) A number of studies have shown long-term vitamin replacement treatment may be maintained with high-dose oral B12 supplements, since sufficient B12 is absorbed from these by a normal intestine, even without any intrinsic factor. So to answer your question, YES, you will able to take \\"VITAMIN B12 TABLETS\\" once your stored B12 level comes to normal and you need to replace the loss/ used B12 by high dose B12 ORAL TABLETS.

The free radical are those which makes our skin wrinkle as we age  and the exposure to such atmospheric and food free radical makes us look old, in case of the RED BLOOD cells they rupture them if their is G6PD deficiency cause the detoxification chemical is not formed due to absence of \\" G6PD Enzyme\\"  and the rupture on these cell in known as hemolysis (hemo=blood , lysis=destruction) NOW I think it will make more sense to talk about the OXIDATIVE STRESS/ OXIDATIVE FOOD FAVA BEANS has a largest amount of oxidation content hence eating it will release huge amount of oxidization molecules making it harder for RBC with our G6PD to form the required neutralization/detoxification chemical and forces RBC TO rupture. * following is the list of things having high oxidative power and needs to be avoided. 1) Too much animal protein in your diet. 2) Oils that have been heated to very high temperatures. 3) Preservatives in your food. 4) Drugs (over the counter and prescription as far as possible avoid it e.g. pain killer) 5) Alcohol. 6) Chlorinated water that you drink, shower in or swim in 7) Artificial food colorings and flavorings 8) Smoking / passive inhale of cigarette smoke. Follow are the list of antioxidant that will help to protect the oxidative crises 1) Fresh Fruits and vegetables ,eggs ( contains vitamin -C & Carotenoids ) 2) Vegetable oils (contains Vitamin - E) 3) Tea, soy, fruit, olive oil, chocolate, cinnamon, oregano (contains  flavonoids).

It also goes up in infections, and when the hemoglobin is low (i.e., anaemia). Raised ESR (persistent) result suggests you need to exclude the above conditions mentioned. Follow up blood tests: Complete hemogram (Hb, TC DC) CRP Liver function tests Urea, creatinine Serum protein electrophoresis Chest X Ray Antinuclear antibody Now all of the above tests would exclude common serious pathologies, so please get them done after discussing with your doctor as soon as possible.

The Doppler s effect for carotid arteries, and MRA reports are normal. The Echo-cardio gram reports are also normal. Please suggest what care should be taken in this regard. If he leads a healthy lifestyle which includes restictions in diet and exercise, will everything return to normalcy.","Doctor":"Hello ! Its pleasure to answer your query. As per the MRI report,he has an acute stroke episode.There are many risk factors for stroke including hypertension,atherosclerosis,vasculitic disorders,central nervous system infections,embolic phenomenon and many more. As ECHO Cardiogram is normal for your patient hence it seems to be acute thrombotic episode involving right middle cerebral artery. For treatment he needs urgent admission in specialized hospital or stroke unit.Along with nursing care,physiotherapy he needs oral antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin,clopidogrel,ticlopidine,dipyridamol and oral statins such as rosuvastatin/atorvastatin. If he could have presented within 3 hrs from symptom onset there could have been a option of thrombolysis depending upon size of infarct,age of patient,blood pressure at the time of presentation and other major medical illness or past history of major surgery.This decision of thrombolysis is physician dependent as there is a major risk of bleeding during thrombosis. As carotids are normal on MRA and Carotid doppler is normal there is no need of any interventions for this. Adequate control of blood pressure,blood sugar,lipids could help to prevent further episodes of stroke. Improvement in this episode depends upon the level of conciousness of your patient,degree of weakness in limbs and size of the infarct on MRI. NIHS scale can help in assessment of prognosis and management of your patient.You can take help of treating physician regarding this. Healthy lifestyle,exercise,diet monitoring of blood pressure and sugar,physiotherapy long term antiplatelet agents and statins can definitely help in improvement.It may take one to two months for maximum improvement.

SLE is an autoimmune disease in which one's own antibodies react against one's body, affecting many body organs, including the bone marrow. This may cause several blood cell types to be depleted, and it explains the \\"nil\\" WBC and platelets. Having said that, it's curious that the RBCs are relatively spared this severe depletion. A bone marrow test is indicated, to determine the extent of bone marrow affectation. Unfortunately, transfusion of blood does not usually help, as the new blood cells are usually destroyed. This is why most experts would rather try to \\"mop-up\\" the abnormal antibodies, using plasmapheresis, steroids, and other immunosuppressive (agents that act against the immune system) drugs. From what you have said, it appears things are being done to keep the disease in check. Some patients with severe disease may benefit from Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT). If you want to consider a second opinion, I would suggest you seek out an Hematologist, Clinical Immunologist or HSCT Physician. I wish your wife quick recovery."},{"Patient":"Hello, At the end of lacrosse practice about a week ago i recieved a nasty cross check to my deltoid. The check hit wierd, as it went under my pad.

Should he still be running until this is figured out? Last night he had 3 episodes of blackouts lasting for 3 to 8 seconds.","Doctor":"Dear CRJackson97, Thanks for your question. The doctor's report of hypoglycemia (low glucose) may explain blackouts, and may suggest that your lad may not be getting enough glucose from his food; or that his metabolism of food needs further scrutiny. Low alkaline phosphatase levels is uncommon, and most times benign. High CO2, may well suggest that samples were taken soon after a workout; and in combination with the low glucose, may indicate muscle fatigue at the time of blood collection for the test. Having said that, may I suggest that your boy stay off further exercise until all other test results are in, especially since he has recently had several blackouts.

I was born in 1957 - the second of six children. I know sometime in the 60 s any possible problems were eliminated. So I m wondering what types of health problems / risks may I expect in this regard? Is there a known gene mutation that I should know about, so I can share that with a doctor? Thank you. Clara","Doctor":"Hello Clara, Thanks for posting, If you and your siblings did not develop any complications at birth due to mother and fetus incompatibility then you have nothing to worry about now.  Hemolytic disease of the newborn (the condition is known medically as erythroblastosis fetalis) occurs when there is an incompatibility between the blood types of the mother and the fetus/baby. There is also potential incompatibility if the mother is Rh negative and the father is positive. Now since you are lady, what you need to know now is your own blood type so as to be able to determine if you will require additional medical care when you are pregnant to protect the fetus (from incompatibility). The Rh factor genetic information is also inherited from our parents, but it is inherited independently of the ABO blood type alleles. There are 2 different alleles for the Rh factor known as Rh+ and Rh-. Now, if your father is Rh+ and mother Rh- it means you will likely inherit an Rh+ antigen (your genotype will be Rh+/Rh-= the two alleles but the Rh+ will be the dominant). So I do suggest, you quit being worried and know for sure that you will have no major health risk when it comes to your blood type. Do how ever get tested (blood groups) just to be sure. hope this helps Dr. Bernard"},{"Patient":"My white blood cell count 12/24/12 was 13.7, however I was experiencing an upper respiratory infection at that time.

My question is would Hemochromotosis cause an elevated WBC count? Obviously I m concerned with Leukemia?","Doctor":"Hi and thanks or your query, Hemochromatosis could be suspected although the clinical evidence in your case is very much lacking. Its a normal reaction for the white blood cell count to rise with a respiratory tract infection. Hemochromatosis has nothing and is not related to the white blood cell count. Leukemia would require an excessive rise in white blood cell, usually accompanied by anemia, pain, an infectious syndrome too. I think its really too early to think of a leukemia n this case. Doing blood haptoglobin levels could help. Diagnosis of leukemia usually warrants a complete blood count and a bone marrow aspirate, but really do not think you need it.

This slide should be examined by the pathologist for platelet count. This is the most reliable test that must be done in a patient with low platelet count. So, consult with your treating doctor about it.

In 80 year old some amount of anaemia is expected but you have to first rule out any pathological cause of aneamia that is bleeding some where from gastro intestinal tract or occult malignancy malignancy some wher in body .If any pathological cause of anaemia is ruled out then some amount of anaemia could be due to poor absorption of iron contained in  food from intestine due to decreased blood supply which is normal process with age.Second reason coud be decreased erytropoitin production from kidney (due to decreased blood supply) which stimulates the bone marrow to produce red blood cell (RBC) containing haemoglobin.Third and final physilogical cause could be decreased RBC production by bone marrow.again due to decrease blood supply to bone marrow.If iron is not absorbed from ,increasing its dose will not improve haemoglobin.

Is this a a sympton of Wysolene? Also she feels heaviness in her body,Also are there any food intake that would reduce the tablet effects?Thanks in advance","Doctor":"Hello Sukumar, ITP is an autoimmune disorder. And Wysolone (which belongs to the class of corticosteroids) is given to suppress the immune system. However, once the platelet count improves, the dose of corticosteroid is gradually reduced and the possibility of relapse is monitored. Long-term steroids usage is associated with certain side-effects like: 1. Increased susceptibility to infections 2. Abnormal fat distribution 3. Osteoporosis 4. Diabetes 5. Hypertension 6. Cataract, etc Symptoms aggravate if medication is stopped abruptly. Make sure while discontinuing the medication, its dose should be tapered gradually instead of stopping it abruptly.

In your case especially, the association with increased ESR, fatigue and petechiae suggest exclusion of a bone marrow malignancy, especially a leukeamia. A bone marrow biopsy might be compelling. Secondly, I would to suggest to carry out Anti nuclear antibodies, HLA27 and antiSm antibodies for your symptoms are also very compatible with systemic lupus erythematosus, which is an autoimmune disease. the symptoms as I said are very suggestive of a leukemia. An appropriate diagnosis is critical, for the setting up of an appropriate treatment plan. Delayed diagnoses my make the prognosis more faint.

Could he be suspecting something or is this a normal request on a biopsy from the procedure.","Doctor":"hi there, being anemic and low ferritin levels suggests that either the patient is taking less of iron rich food , losing more iron from the body than that which is being replaced like having occult bleeding as may be the case from her GIT or could be due to decreased uptake or absorption of normally ingested iron in food. As your history suggests that she is undergoing upper GI endoscopy and the doctor suspects malignancy or cancer I would deduct that she is losing blood from her upper gastrointestinal tract which is causing her anemia and low ferritin levels. Let the biopsy report come and you will be more in the clear about the cause. In the meanwhile she may require Iron suppliments either oral or in injectable form depending on the severity of her anemia.

Several antibiotics (penicillins and cephalosporins) and even certain vegetables have been known to interfere with its metabolism and consequently its actions. I would suggest that you interact with your physician, with a view to re-evaluate all your medications (and possibly, meals), to determine which, if any, interact with warfarin. Having said that, I would also mention that you keep to a fixed time of warfarin intake, preferably well after the last meal of the day (i.e. just before bed). Avoid, as much as possible, any food or medication that may interfere with it. All PT tests should be done in certified labs, and all values converted to INR. I hope these measures will help.

After 1 mweek from discharge I went to another Neurologist in a reputable hospital and undergone CerebroAngiogram. Findings: Left Transverse Sinus thrombosis . For 3 weeks now I am experiencing heaviness at the top of head with scake 3 pain. Moreso,my right eye seem blurred and sometimes I feel shooting pain both left and right part of my head. Could this mean, I am having thrombosis again?","Doctor":"Dear Mysoulrock, Thanks for your question. The facts presented are previous \\"diffuse subarachnoid\\" (hemorrhage or thrombosis?), left transverse sinus thrombosis, and your recent symptoms. From these, I can deduce that you may have a tendency towards clot formation (though the reason for this is not quite apparent, from your story); and it is advisable to see a Hematologist (with interest in Coagulation disorders) and he should be able to place you on blood thinners (anticoagulants), while he investigates the actual underlying cause(s) of the clotting tendency. However, if the \\"diffuse subarachnoid\\" happens to be hemorrhage, he is likely to be much more cautious, and may not readily prescribe anticoagulants, because of the significant risk of a repeat bleed. As concerning your recent symptoms, they may be related to a new clot, or an extension of the previous one. Whichever way, its still good to see a doctor, have some coagulation tests (INR, aPTT, etc), possibly cranial CT/MRI and have a definitive diagnosis.

A few fairly uncommon platelet disorders may cause a \\"fainting\\" spell, but these cannot be so easily detected without specialized tests.

Pernicious anemia is a type of anemia that results from a deficiency in nutritional supply of vitamin B12 or from an auto-immune disease that leads to destruction of a factor in the stomach that aids in absorption of vit B12. Auto-immune causes could be hereditary and in this case could occur in other members of the family. Diphyllobothrium latum a fish tape worm is also known to cause Vit B12 deficiency. Vit B12 deficiency usually presents with large red blood cells. However, Vit B12 deficiency is not the only cause of large red blood cells. Deficiency in folic acid also is a cause and if your diagnosis of pernicious anemia was made based upon your full blood count or blood smear results, then it is likely you have a folic acid deficiency. Folic acid is richly found in leafy vegetables, liver, kidney, egg yolk etc and is also found as a supplement. You need to see a hematologist for a better evaluation and for further tests like bone marrow smear and auto antibodies if necessary. If you have more questions, please do not hesitate.

Hypo chromic  anemia is a generic term for any type of anemia in which the red blood cells (erythrocytes) are paler than normal. (Hypo- refers to less, and chromic means color.) A normal red blood cell will have an area of pallor in the center of it; in hypochromic cells, this area of central pallor is increased. This decrease in redness is due to a disproportionate reduction of red cell hemoglobin (the pigment that imparts the red color) in proportion to the volume of the cell. anisocytosis refers to difference in cell size. meaning that not all your red cells are the same size and can be caused by anemia, recent blood transfusion (due to having your own cells and transfused cells in the same population) and several other conditions. poikilocytosis refers to difference in cell shape. Meaning that not all your cells are round, some maybe be oval or elliptical shaped  or may have irregular borders. Give your daughter iron supplements as advised by your doctor.

I presume your disease must be in control as far as ESR is concerned please do not worry it is a marker of inflammatory state and has prognostic value that means if it shows continuous declining readings the disease is improving. Your Fasting blood sugar may be due to steroids as they are known to increase blood sugar but keep a watch as your dose is reduced,In the mean time take diabetic diet and walk regularly if you can. Once your steroids are tapered off recheck FBS and PPBS  after 15 days to make sure you are not diabetic,may also get HBA1c to know status of blood sugar in past.

The test results you have sent also show the same thing. Since your wife is already in the last trimester, oral treatment with haematinics is not going to be of much help in improving her condition before delivery. Also, the treatment mode depends on the amount of anemia, the symptoms it is causing and the general condition of your wife. If it is so severe so as to cause severe symptoms, she may need a blood transfusion followed by injections of iron. You should discuss further management with her doctor. Take care."},{"Patient":"lat year I had 3 bleeding ulcers and had 4 unit of blood given to me, my HGB was 6 at the time. Now this year I am anemic on iron pills.
