Case (n geq 4):   For (n geq 4), we can use the result from the thread mentioned in the problem. We can add the term (x_n x_1) and still get the maximum being (frac{p^2}{4}). This is because the sum (sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i x_{i+1}) (with (x_n x_1) included) can be maximized by setting all (x_i) equal, i.e., (x_i = frac{p}{n}). However, since (n geq 4), the maximum value of the sum (sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_i x_{i+1}) without the term (x_n x_1) is still (frac{p^2}{4}).Conclusion:For (n = 2) and (n = 3), the maximum value of (sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_i x_{i+1}) is (frac{p^2}{4}).

The sum of the absolute values will change at this point because the absolute value function removes the sign of negative terms.We find the smallest n such that a_n geq 0:begin{align*}-20 + (n-1)times2 &geq 0 (n-1)times2 &geq 20 n - 1 &geq 10 n &geq 11.end{align*}Thus, the term a_{11} is the first non-negative term in the sequence.Now we calculate the sum of the absolute values up to a_{10}:sum_{i = 1}^{10} |a_i|.Since all a_i for i leq 10 are negative, we have |a_i| = -a_i, and we can rewrite the sum as:sum_{i = 1}^{10} (-a_i) = -sum_{i = 1}^{10} a_i.We calculate the sum of the terms a_1 to a_{10} using the arithmetic series sum formula S_n = frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n):S_{10} = frac{10}{2}(-20 + a_{10}).We first find a_{10}:a_{10} = -20 + (10-1)times2 = -20 + 18 = -2.Now we find S_{10}:S_{10} = frac{10}{2}(-20 - 2) = 5 times (-22) = -110.However, we want the sum of the absolute values, which is the negative of S_{10}:sum_{i = 1}^{10} |a_i| = -S_{10} = 110.For n > 10, the terms are all non-negative, so the absolute values are the terms themselves. Therefore, we calculate the sum from a_{11} to a_{20} directly.We find a_{20} to use in our sum for a_{11} to a_{20}:a_{20} = -20 + (20-1)times2 = -20 + 38 = 18.Now, let's find the sum S_{10} to S_{20}:S_{10}^{20} = frac{10}{2}(a_{11} + a_{20}).We have already a_{20} = 18, and we find a_{11}:a_{11} = -20 + (11-1)times2 = -20 + 20 = 0.Thus, we can find S_{10}^{20}:S_{10}^{20} = frac{10}{2}(0 + 18) = 5 times 18 = 90.Finally, we add the sums from the two different parts of the sequence to find the total:|a_1| + |a_2| + ldots + |a_{20}| = sum_{i = 1}^{10} |a_i| + sum_{i = 11}^{20} a_i = 110 + 90 = 200.Therefore, the value of |a_1| + |a_2| + ldots + |a_{19}| + |a_{20}| is boxed{200}."},{"problem":"P.M.In the country, there are 15 cities, some of which are connected by air routes belonging to three airlines.

Identify the Pythagorean triple:   Since ( d_7^2 + d_{15}^2 = d_{16}^2 ), ( (d_7, d_{15}, d_{16}) ) forms a Pythagorean triple. One common Pythagorean triple is ( (10, 24, 26) ). Therefore, we can assume:   [ d_7 = 10, quad d_{15} = 24, quad d_{16} = 26 ]2. Check the divisors of ( n ):   Since ( d_7 = 10 ), ( n ) must be divisible by 10. Similarly, since ( d_{15} = 24 ), ( n ) must be divisible by 24. Therefore, ( n ) must be divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of 10 and 24:   [ text{LCM}(10, 24) = 120 ]   Thus, ( n ) must be a multiple of 120.3. List the divisors of 120:   The divisors of 120 are:   [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120 ]   We need to find the 17th divisor, but 120 has only 16 divisors. Therefore, ( n ) must be a multiple of 120 with additional divisors.4. Identify additional divisors:   Since ( d_7 = 10 ) and ( d_{15} = 24 ), we need to find additional divisors between 10 and 24. The possible additional divisors could be 12, 13, 15, 20, etc. We need to ensure that there are exactly 3 new divisors in this interval to make ( d_{17} ) the 17th divisor.5. Check for contradictions:   If ( d_7 = 10 ) and ( d_{15} = 24 ), then ( n ) must be divisible by both 10 and 24. However, if ( d_6 = 6 ) and ( d_7 = 10 ), there is a contradiction because 6 and 10 do not have a common multiple that fits the sequence.6. Re-evaluate the possible values:   Given the contradiction, we need to re-evaluate the possible values of ( d_{17} ). The correct value must fit the sequence without contradictions. The only value that fits without contradiction is:   [ d_{17} = 28 ]Therefore, the only possible value for ( d_{17} ) is ( 28 ).The final answer is ( boxed{28} )"},{"problem":"8.

Analyze the properties of the perpendicular bisectors:   - The perpendicular bisector of (AB) intersects (AC) at (N). This implies that (N) is equidistant from (A) and (B).   - The perpendicular bisector of (AC) intersects (AB) at (M). This implies that (M) is equidistant from (A) and (C).3. Prove that (triangle ABN) and (triangle AMC) are equilateral:   - Since (N) is on the perpendicular bisector of (AB), (N) is equidistant from (A) and (B). Therefore, (AN = BN).   - Given (angle A = 60^circ), (angle BAN = 30^circ) and (angle ABN = 30^circ). Thus, (triangle ABN) has angles (30^circ, 30^circ, 120^circ).   - However, since (N) is equidistant from (A) and (B), (triangle ABN) must be equilateral with (angle ANB = 60^circ).   - Similarly, since (M) is on the perpendicular bisector of (AC), (M) is equidistant from (A) and (C).

This event has a probability of frac{1}{8} times frac{6}{8}, which is the probability of drawing exactly the ball that initially bore the number 8left(frac{1}{8}right), multiplied by the probability that this ball was not among the first two drawn ( frac{6}{8}, since the balls not drawn are 6 out of a total of 8 );- the ball initially bore the number 4, and was drawn on the first draw: with a similar reasoning to the previous one, we find that this event has a probability of frac{1}{8} times frac{1}{8};- the ball initially bore the number 2, and was drawn on the second draw: this event again has a probability of frac{1}{8} times frac{1}{8}.In total, the probability that the ball drawn by Federica bears the number 8 is frac{1}{8}left(frac{6}{8}+frac{1}{8}+frac{1}{8}right)=frac{1}{8}."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)=2^{x}-2^{-x}, the solution set of the inequality f(2x+1)+f(1)geqslant 0 is __________.","solution":"According to the problem, for the function f(x)=2^{x}-2^{-x}, we have f(-x)=2^{-x}-2^{x}=-(2^{x}-2^{-x})=-f(x), which means the function f(x) is an odd function.

Considering all such sequences A, find the greatest value of m.","solution":"1. Define the problem and variables:   Let ( A = (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2001}) ) be a sequence of positive integers. We need to find the maximum number ( m ) of 3-element subsequences ((a_i, a_j, a_k)) with (1 leq i < j < k leq 2001) such that (a_j = a_i + 1) and (a_k = a_j + 1).2. Initial claim and construction:   We claim that the maximum value of ( m ) is ( boxed{667^3} ). This is achieved by setting ( a_i = leftlceil frac{i}{667} rightrceil ) for all ( 1 le i le 2001 ).3. Proof of the claim:   For every integer ( i ), let ( b_i ) be the number of indices ( 1 le j le 2001 ) such that ( a_j = i ). Let ( M ) be the largest positive integer such that ( b_M ) is nonzero.4. Reduction to decent sequences:   We need to show that it suffices to consider sequences where ( b_i ) is nonzero for all ( 1 le i le M ). Suppose we have a non-decent sequence. Let ( Z ) be the least positive integer such that ( b_Z = 0 ). By definition, ( Z < M ).5. Operation to make sequence decent:   Consider the operation: for all ( i ) such that ( a_i > Z ), change ( a_i ) to ( a_i - 1 ). This operation does not decrease ( m ) because if the subsequence ( (a_i, a_j, a_k) ) worked before, it still works after the operation. Repeatedly applying this operation will eventually make the sequence decent without decreasing ( m ).6. Reduction to sequences with ( M le 4 ):   Next, we show that it suffices to consider sequences where only ( b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4 ) are nonzero. Suppose we have a decent sequence with ( M ge 5 ). Since the sequence is decent, ( b_{M-4}, b_{M-3}, b_{M-2}, b_{M-1}, b_M ) are all positive.7. Operation to reduce ( M ):   Consider the operation: for all ( i ) such that ( a_i = M ), change ( a_i ) to ( M-3 ). This changes ( b_M ) to 0 and ( b_{M-3} ) to ( b_M + b_{M-3} ). The value of ( m ) decreases by ( b_{M-2} b_{M-1} b_M ) and increases by at least ( b_{M-4} b_M b_{M-2} + b_M b_{M-2} b_{M-1} ), resulting in a net positive change. Repeatedly applying this operation yields a sequence with ( M = 4 ) that has an increased ( m )-value from the original decent arrangement.8. Maximizing ( m ) for sequences with ( M = 4 ):   Now we have ( b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4 ) such that ( b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 = 2001 ). We want to maximize ( b_1 b_2 b_3 + b_2 b_3 b_4 = (b_1 + b_4) b_3 b_2 ).9. Using AM-GM inequality:   By the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality, we have:   [   frac{b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4}{4} geq sqrt[4]{b_1 b_2 b_3 b_4}   ]   Given ( b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4 = 2001 ), the maximum product ( b_1 b_2 b_3 b_4 ) is achieved when ( b_1 = b_2 = b_3 = b_4 = 667 ).

Evaluate the absolute value and the negative sign in front of it: |-2sqrt{5}| means taking the absolute value of -2sqrt{5}, which removes the negative sign, leaving 2sqrt{5}. Since there is a minus sign in front of the absolute value, we subtract 2sqrt{5}:   [   -|-2sqrt{5}| = -2sqrt{5}.   ]3. Evaluate the power of zero: Any expression (except for zero) to the power of zero is 1. Thus, (sqrt{2023}-sqrt{2022})^0 = 1.4. Evaluate the square root: sqrt{20} can be simplified to sqrt{4 cdot 5} = sqrt{4}sqrt{5} = 2sqrt{5}.Putting it all together, we have:[(frac{1}{5})^{-2} - |-2sqrt{5}| + (sqrt{2023}-sqrt{2022})^0 + sqrt{20} = 25 - 2sqrt{5} + 1 + 2sqrt{5}.]Since -2sqrt{5} and +2sqrt{5} cancel each other out, we are left with:[25 + 1 = 26.]Therefore, the final answer is boxed{26}."},{"problem":"In right triangle ABC, angle B=90^{circ}, BC=1, AC=2, then the length of AB is ( )A: 1B: sqrt{3}C: 2D: sqrt{5}","solution":"In right triangle ABC, where angle B=90^{circ}, we have the sides BC=1 and AC=2.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the minimum number ( k ) such that any subset of ( k ) elements in an ( n times n ) table contains an even subset. An even subset is defined as a subset that contains an even number of elements in each row and each column.2. Initial Assumption:   The problem states that the answer is ( 2n - 1 ). We need to prove this by showing that ( 2n - 2 ) elements are not sufficient and that ( 2n - 1 ) elements are sufficient.3. Proving ( 2n - 2 ) Elements are Not Sufficient:   - Consider an ( n times n ) table.   - Place ( n - 1 ) elements in the first column, leaving the last element of the column empty.   - Place the remaining ( n - 1 ) elements in the last column, leaving the first element of the column empty.   - This configuration uses ( 2n - 2 ) elements.   - In this setup, each row and each column has exactly one element, which means there is no even subset (since an even subset requires an even number of elements in each row and column).4. Proving ( 2n - 1 ) Elements are Sufficient:   - We need to show that any subset of ( 2n - 1 ) elements in an ( n times n ) table contains an even subset.   - Consider the Pigeonhole Principle: If we have ( 2n - 1 ) elements, at least one row or one column must contain at least 2 elements (since ( 2n - 1 ) elements cannot be distributed such that each row and each column has at most 1 element).   - Without loss of generality, assume that there is a row with at least 2 elements. Let these elements be ((i, x_1)) and ((i, x_2)).   - Now, consider the columns ( x_1 ) and ( x_2 ). Since we have ( 2n - 1 ) elements, and we have already used 2 elements in row ( i ), there are ( 2n - 3 ) elements left.   - By the Pigeonhole Principle again, at least one of the columns ( x_1 ) or ( x_2 ) must contain another element (since ( 2n - 3 ) elements cannot be distributed such that each column has at most 1 element).   - This ensures that there is at least one column with 2 elements, forming an even subset.5. Conclusion:   - We have shown that ( 2n - 2 ) elements are not sufficient to guarantee an even subset.   - We have also shown that ( 2n - 1 ) elements are sufficient to guarantee an even subset.The final answer is ( boxed{ 2n - 1 } )"},{"problem":"19.

The highest and lowest temperatures of the day were 5^{circ}mathrm{C} and -2^{circ}mathrm{C}, respectively. We are asked to find the range of temperature change in the city on that day.To find the range of temperature change, we consider the highest and lowest temperatures recorded. The highest temperature represents the upper limit of the temperature range, and the lowest temperature represents the lower limit of the temperature range. Therefore, the range of temperature change can be represented as the interval from the lowest temperature to the highest temperature.Given that the highest temperature was 5^{circ}mathrm{C}, this means that the temperature did not exceed 5^{circ}mathrm{C}. Similarly, given that the lowest temperature was -2^{circ}mathrm{C}, this means that the temperature was not below -2^{circ}mathrm{C}. Therefore, the temperature t must satisfy the condition that it is greater than or equal to -2^{circ}mathrm{C} and less than or equal to 5^{circ}mathrm{C}. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:[-2leqslant tleqslant 5]This inequality represents the range of temperature change in Suzhou City on that day, indicating that the temperature was within the interval from -2^{circ}mathrm{C} to 5^{circ}mathrm{C}.Therefore, the correct answer, which matches the range of temperature change described, is option D: -2leqslant tleqslant 5.

Since the plane A A_{1} B_{1} B perp plane A B C D, the feet of the perpendiculars from points C and D to the plane, C^{prime} and D^{prime}, must lie on the line A B. The projections of A_{1} C and B_{1} D on the plane A A_{1} B_{1} B are A_{1} C^{prime} and B_{1} D^{prime}, respectively.(Problem 7)The figure on the plane A A_{1} B_{1} B is shown in Figure (2). Since C^{prime} D^{prime} parallel A_{1} B_{1} and C^{prime} D^{prime} = C D = C_{1} D_{1} = A_{1} B_{1}, A_{1} B_{1} C^{prime} D^{prime} is a parallelogram, and the intersection of its diagonals is point Q. By the theorem of three perpendiculars, A_{1} C^{prime} perp A B_{1} and B_{1} D^{prime} perp A_{1} B. Therefore, angle A_{1} Q B_{1} + angle A_{1} P B_{1} = pi.The distance from point Q to A_{1} B_{1} is equal to the distance from point P to A_{1} B_{1}, which is frac{1}{2} A A_{1}. Here, point P is the intersection of A B_{1} and A_{1} B, so S_{triangle A_{1} P B_{1}} = S_{triangle A_{1} Q B_{1}}.Since point Q is the intersection of the altitudes from the two equal sides of the isosceles triangle A_{1} P B_{1}, triangle A_{1} Q B_{1} is also an isosceles triangle, thusleft|A_{1} Pright|^{2} sin angle A_{1} P B_{1} = left|A_{1} Qright|^{2} sin angle A_{1} Q B_{1}.This implies A_{1} P = A_{1} Q. Therefore, point Q coincides with point P. And angle A_{1} P B_{1} = angle A_{1} Q B_{1} = frac{pi}{2}, so the side face A A_{1} B_{1} B is a square. Similarly, it can be shown that the other side faces are also squares.

Therefore, the equation of this circle is:left(x - frac{p}{2}right)^{2} + left(y - frac{k-p}{2}right)^{2} = frac{p^{2}}{4} + left(frac{k-p}{2}right)^{2}orx^{2} + y^{2} - p x - (k-p) y = 0The equation of line A B is:frac{x}{p} + frac{y}{k-p} = 1ory = frac{p-k}{p} x + 1Thus, the equation of the line O M parallel to A B and passing through the origin of the coordinate system is:y = frac{p-k}{p} xFrom this equation:p = frac{k x}{x - y}Substituting (2) into (1):x^{2} + y^{2} - frac{k x^{2}}{x - y} - left(k - frac{k x}{x - y}right) y = 0orx^{2} + y^{2} - k x - k y = 0or finallyleft(x - frac{k}{2}right)^{2} + left(y - frac{k}{2}right)^{2} = frac{k^{2}}{2}We see that the geometric place of point M is a circle with radius frac{k}{2} sqrt{2}, which passes through point O. The coordinates of its center are frac{k}{2} and frac{k}{2}. It intersects the axes at points L and N, whose coordinates are k and k.The problem was also solved by: Détshy K., Kertész L., Kornis Ö., Krausz B., Krisztián Gy., Roth M., Sasvári G., Spitzer Ö., Szabó I., Szabó K."},{"problem":"5.

Understanding the Problem:   - We have an 8-by-8 grid, divided into 64 unit squares.   - Each square is either black or white.   - The number of black squares is even.   - We can flip the colors of two adjacent squares (1-by-2 or 2-by-1 rectangle) in one step.   - We need to find the maximum number of steps required to make all squares black, starting from any initial configuration.2. Initial Configuration:   - Let's denote the initial configuration as ( C ).   - We need to find ( S(C) ), the minimum number of steps to turn all squares black.3. Labeling the Squares:   - Consider a closed loop that visits each of the 64 squares exactly once, such that the last square is adjacent to the first. This is possible using a snake-like configuration.   - Label the squares from 1 to 64 in the order of this loop, so square 64 is adjacent to square 1.4.

Claim:   - If ( w_i ) and ( w_{i+1} ) are both white, we can make them and all squares between them black within ( w_{i+1} - w_i ) moves.6. Proof of the Claim:   - Draw an arrow between ( w_i ) and ( w_{i+1} ) within the closed loop.   - We can move the white square at ( w_i ) to ( w_i + 1 ), ( w_i + 1 ) to ( w_i + 2 ), and so on, until it becomes adjacent to ( w_{i+1} ).   - When ( w_i ) and ( w_{i+1} ) are adjacent, we can flip both to black in one move.   - Thus, all squares on the arrow will become black in ( w_{i+1} - w_i ) moves.7. Calculating the Steps:   - We can make all squares black in ( s_1 = (w_2 - w_1) + (w_4 - w_3) + cdots + (w_{2k} - w_{2k-1}) ) moves.   - Alternatively, we can make all squares black in ( s_2 = (w_3 - w_2) + (w_5 - w_4) + cdots + (w_1 - w_{2k}) ) moves.   - Since ( s_1 + s_2 = 64 ), at least one of ( s_1 ) or ( s_2 ) is less than or equal to 32.8.

The efficiency of a heat engine is the ratio of useful work to the amount of heat received by the gas per cycle. To find the useful work, it is necessary to find the difference between the work done by the gas (A_{+}) and the work done on it (A_{-}). Each of these quantities can be found by integrating the power over time or by finding the area of the figure enclosed between the graph of the power dependence on time and the time axis. Similarly, the amount of heat received by the gas (Q_{+}) is found.Note that the function P_{2}(t)=a P_{1}(b t), therefore, since the figure formed by the graph of P_{2} is obtained from the figure corresponding to the function P_{1} by stretching along the vertical axis by a factor of a and compressing along the horizontal axis by a factor of b, then A_{+}=Q_{+} cdot frac{a}{b}. According to the problem, A_{-}=beta A_{+}. Finally, eta=frac{a}{b}(1-beta).Given in the problem a=3, b=2, beta=frac{2}{3}: quad eta=frac{1}{2}.Note that the integral of the function P_{1}(t) cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. On the other hand, the integrand is significantly simplified if the second term in the denominator is neglected. This does not result in a significant loss of accuracy, as the second term is limited and two orders of magnitude smaller than the first.

For which N geqslant 2 does there exist an arrangement that is k-successful for all natural k? (In leapfrog, on a move, one of the grasshoppers jumps to the point symmetric to it relative to another grasshopper.)M. Svyatlovsky","solution":"Answer: for N geqslant 3.First solution. For N=2, no matter how the grasshoppers jump, the distance between them does not change.Let N geqslant 3. Place the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grasshoppers on a line at points with coordinates 0,1, sqrt{2}, and call these grasshoppers V, Q, R. The others are seated arbitrarily at other distinct points. We will show that for any k, the grasshoppers can jump in such a way that the sum of pairwise distances decreases by at least a factor of k (denote the initial sum by P).Lemma. Suppose three grasshoppers sit on a line at distinct points, and the ratio of the distances from one of them to the other two is irrational. Then, no matter how many jumps they make over each other, they will always remain at distinct points, and the ratio of the distances from one of them to the other two will remain irrational.Proof of the lemma. We will show that these conditions are preserved during a jump. Suppose, for some grasshopper, the ratio of the distances to the other two is rational, then these distances are of the form a and a q, where q is rational. Then the distance between the other two grasshoppers is non-zero and has the form |a pm a q|, so the ratio of any two distances between the grasshoppers is rational, which is a contradiction. Suppose some grasshopper jumps over grasshopper A, then the distances from A to both grasshoppers do not change, and thus the ratio of these distances remains irrational, in particular, the distances are different, and therefore the grasshoppers remain in distinct points.Now, let's move on to the problem. Suppose the first few moves are made only by grasshoppers V, Q, R and only over each other, according to the lemma, they will always remain in distinct points. We will show that after any number of such moves, they can further jump in such a way that the current minimum of pairwise distances between them decreases by at least a factor of two.Suppose, without loss of generality, that at the current moment the minimum distance is between grasshoppers V, Q with coordinates a and b, and R has coordinate c. Mark on the line all points with coordinates differing from a by a multiple of (a-b). Clearly, by jumping over each other, grasshoppers V, Q can occupy any two adjacent marked points, then R is not in a marked point (by the lemma, jumping only over each other, V, Q, R remain in distinct points), then V, Q can occupy two adjacent marked points between which c lies, and the distance from R to one of the grasshoppers will be no more than |a-b| / 2, that is, the smallest distance has decreased by at least a factor of 2.Then, in several moves, grasshoppers V, Q, R can decrease the smallest distance between them by at least a factor of 2, then in several moves again by at least a factor of 2, and so on, they can, in several moves, achieve that the distance between some two of them is some number t less than P /(2 N(N-1) cdot k) - let them do just that. Call any two grasshoppers, between which the distance is t, good, and one of them call D, further these grasshoppers do not jump.Next, any grasshopper not from the pair of good ones can, by jumping over the pair of good ones (in the appropriate order), move by 2 t in any direction on the line, and then can, in several jumps over them, end up at a distance less than 2 t from D, let all grasshoppers except the good ones make jumps in this way. Then the distance from any grasshopper to D will be less than 2 t, and thus all pairwise distances will be less than 4 t, and thus their sum will be less than 4 t cdot N(N-1) / 22 we will explicitly provide the initial arrangement, which is k-successful for any natural number k.First, for a given N>2, construct a finite geometric progression 1, q, ldots, q^{N-1}, with common ratio q in(0,1), for which the condition1=q+q^{2}+ldots+q^{N-1}is satisfied. The required set exists for any integer N>2, since the equationq+q^{2}+ldots+q^{N-1}-1=0has a solution on the interval (0,1), as the left side changes sign at its ends.Now place N grasshoppers at the following initial points:0,1,(1+q),left(1+q+q^{2}right), ldots,left(1+q+ldots+q^{N-3}right),left(1+q+ldots+q^{N-2}right)Consider the jump of the first grasshopper over the second; then its new coordinate will be 2=1+1=1+q+q^{2}+ldots+q^{N-1}. It turns out that the jumping grasshopper has become the rightmost, and all the grasshoppers are now located at the points1,(1+q),left(1+q+q^{2}right), ldots,left(1+q+ldots+q^{N-2}right),left(1+q+ldots+q^{N-1}right)By shifting the origin of coordinates to the right by 1, we get the coordinates of the grasshoppers0, q,left(q+q^{2}right), ldots,left(q+ldots+q^{N-2}right),left(q+ldots+q^{N-1}right)Thus, the grasshoppers have reduced their coordinates by exactly a factor of q.

If n = 1, then m must be even, in other words, we have the solution (m, n) = (2k, 1). So assume n > 1. Put h = m 2 /(2mn 2 - n 3 + 1). Then we have a quadratic equation for m, namely m 2 - 2hn 2 m + (n 3 - 1)h = 0. This has solutions hn 2 +- N, where N is the positive square root of h 2 n 4 - hn 3 + h. Since n > 1, h ≥ 1, N is certainly real. But the sum and product of the roots are both positive, so both roots must be positive. The sum is an integer, so if one root is a positive integer, then so is the other. The larger root hn 2 + N is greater than hn 2 , so the smaller root  0, then since h > 0, we must have the denominator (2m - n)n 2 + 1 smaller than the numerator and hence m > n. So for the smaller root we cannot have 2m - n > 0. But 2m - n must be non-negative (since h is positive), so 2m - n = 0 for the smaller root. Hence hn 2 - N = n/2. Now N 2 = (hn 2 - n/2) 2 = h 2 n 4 - hn 3 + h, so h = n 2 /4. Thus n must be even. Put n = 2k and we get the solutions (m, n) = (k, 2k) and (8k 4 - k, 2k).

The solution can simply consist of checking that the numbers a=1, b=5, c=6 indeed satisfy the condition. Let's try to explain how such numbers can be found. First, let's try to simplify our task. Notice, first of all, that the roots of equations differing only in the sign of b x are opposite, so it is sufficient to ensure that the roots of the equations a x^{2}+b x+c=0 and a x^{2}+b x-c=0 are integers. Then the roots of the equations a x^{2}-b x+c=0 and a x^{2}-b x-c=0 will automatically be integers.Furthermore, if x_{1} and x_{2} are integer roots of the equation a x^{2} + b x + c, then by Vieta's theorem b=-left(x_{1}+x_{2}right) a, c=x_{1} x_{2} a, i.e., all coefficients of the equation can be reduced by a, and again we will get an equation with natural coefficients and the same roots. Therefore, without loss of generality, we can assume that a=1.If x_{1} and x_{2} are the roots of the first equation, then by Vieta's theorem x_{1} x_{2}=c, x_{1}+x_{2}=-b. Similarly, if y_{1} and y_{2} are the roots of the second equation, then by Vieta's theorem y_{1} y_{2}=-c, y_{1}+y_{2}=-b. It remains to find such x_{1}, x_{2}, y_{1}, y_{2} thatx_{1}+x_{2}=y_{1}+y_{2}, quad x_{1} x_{2}=-y_{1} y_{2}For example, x_{1}=-2, x_{2}=-3, y_{1}=1, y_{2}=-6 work.In the arithmetic solution. For the roots of the equations x^{2}+b x+c=0 and x^{2}+b x-c=0 to be integers, it is necessary that the discriminants of these equations be perfect squares: b^{2}-4 c=m^{2}, b^{2}+4 c=n^{2}. This condition turns out to be sufficient as well - since b^{2}-4 c has the same parity as b, and thus sqrt{b^{2}-4 c} (if this root is an integer) has the same parity (see fact 23). Thus, x_{1,2}=frac{-b pm sqrt{b^{2}-4 c}}{2} (the roots of the equation x^{2}+b x+c=0) are integers. A similar argument is valid for the second equation.In fact, there are infinitely many such b, c, m, n such that b^{2}-4 c=m^{2}, b^{2}+4 c=n^{2}. To solve the problem, it is sufficient to provide one example of such b, c, m, n. Let's show how such an example could be found. By eliminating c, we get n^{2}-b^{2}=b^{2}-m^{2}, and to ensure that c is an integer, it is necessary that b, m, and n have the same parity. By trying the squares of odd numbers from 1 to 9, we find one solution: 7^{2}-5^{2}=5^{2}-1=24; c=24 / 4=6. We have found b and c such that the discriminants of both equations are perfect squares.Comment.

Initial Setup: The ball is hidden in one of the n boxes placed at the vertices of a regular n-gon. Player A hides the ball, and Player B tries to find it. At each step, Player B chooses a box, and Player A reveals the distance of the ball to the chosen box and then moves the ball to an adjacent box.2. Understanding the Distance: When Player B chooses a box, Player A reveals the distance of the ball to that box. This distance is the minimum number of steps along the edges of the n-gon to reach the ball from the chosen box.3. Movement of the Ball: After revealing the distance, Player A moves the ball to an adjacent box. This means that the ball can only move to one of the two neighboring boxes.4. Strategy for Player B: To guarantee finding the ball, Player B needs to systematically reduce the possible locations of the ball. The key is to use the information about the distance and the movement pattern of the ball.5. Step-by-Step Strategy:   - Step 1: Player B chooses any box, say box 1. Let the distance revealed be d_1.   - Step 2: Player A moves the ball to an adjacent box. Now, the ball can be in one of the two boxes adjacent to the original box where it was.   - Step 3: Player B chooses one of the two possible boxes where the ball could have moved. Let the new distance be d_2.   - Step 4: Player A moves the ball again to an adjacent box. Now, Player B has two possible locations for the ball again.   - Step 5: Player B continues this process, each time narrowing down the possible locations of the ball based on the distances revealed and the movement pattern.6.

Therefore, a_4 = -a_1 holds true.Inductive step: Assume that for some k in mathbb{N}^*, a_{k+3} = -a_k.

Suppose that binom{n}{i} equiv i+1 bmod 2 for all i, then binom{n}{i}+binom{n}{j} equiv i+1+j+1 equiv i+j bmod 2 for all i and j. Thus, n satisfies the condition in the problem. Conversely, suppose that n satisfies the condition. Since binom{n}{0}=1, it follows that i equiv 1+binom{n}{i} bmod 2 for all i, so binom{n}{i} equiv i-1 equiv i+1 bmod 2 for all i.Write n as n=2^{k}+m with 0 leq m<2^{k}.

Considerbinom{n}{2^{k}-2}=binom{2^{k}+m}{2^{k}-2}=frac{left(2^{k}+mright)left(2^{k}+m-1right) cdots(m+4)(m+3)}{left(2^{k}-2right)left(2^{k}-3right) cdots 2 cdot 1} .The product in the denominator contains leftlfloorfrac{2^{k}-2}{2}rightrfloor factors divisible by 2, leftlfloorfrac{2^{k}-2}{4}rightrfloor factors divisible by 4, ..., leftlfloorfrac{2^{k}-2}{2^{k-1}}rightrfloor factors divisible by 2^{k-1}, and no factors divisible by 2^{k}. The product in the numerator consists of 2^{k}-2 consecutive factors and therefore contains at least leftlfloorfrac{2^{k}-2}{2}rightrfloor factors divisible by 2, at least leftlfloorfrac{2^{k}-2}{4}rightrfloor factors divisible by 4, ..., at least leftlfloorfrac{2^{k}-2}{2^{k-1}}rightrfloor factors divisible by 2^{k-1}. Thus, the product in the numerator contains at least as many factors of 2 as the product in the denominator. The product in the numerator certainly has more factors of 2 than the product in the denominator if 2^{k} appears as a factor in the numerator. This is the case if m+3 leq 2^{k}, or equivalently if m leq 2^{k}-3. Therefore, if m leq 2^{k}-3, then binom{n}{2^{k}-2} is even, while 2^{k}-2 is also even. Thus, n=2^{k}+m does not satisfy the condition.Therefore, n can only satisfy the condition if there is a k geq 2 such that 2^{k}-2 leq n leq 2^{k}-1. If n is odd, then binom{n}{0}+binom{n}{1}=1+n equiv 0 bmod 2, so n does not satisfy the condition. Therefore, n can only satisfy the condition if it is of the form n=2^{k}-2 with k geq 2. Now suppose that n is indeed of this form. We will show that n satisfies the condition. We havebinom{2^{k}-2}{c}=frac{left(2^{k}-2right)left(2^{k}-3right) cdotsleft(2^{k}-cright)left(2^{k}-c-1right)}{c cdot(c-1) cdots 2 cdot 1} .The number of factors of 2 in 2^{k}-i is equal to the number of factors of 2 in i for 1 leq i leq 2^{k}-1.

Thus, binom{2^{k}-2}{c} is even if and only if c is odd. This means that n=2^{k}-2 satisfies the condition.We conclude that n satisfies the condition if and only if n=2^{k}-2 with k geq 2."},{"problem":"Let's simplify the following fractions:a) frac{(a+b)^{2}left(a^{3}-b^{3}right)}{left(a^{2}-b^{2}right)^{2}},b) frac{6 a^{2} b^{2}-3 a^{3} b-3 a b^{3}}{a b^{3}-a^{3} b}.","solution":"a) frac{a^{2}+a b+b^{2}}{a-b}.b) 3 frac{a-b}{a+b}.Number of solutions: 25."},{"problem":"Given (1+x)^{10} = a_0 + a_1 (1-x) + a_2 (1-x)^2 + ldots + a_{10} (1-x)^{10}, find the value of a_8.","solution":"Since (1+x)^{10} = [2-(1-x)]^{10},  the general term of its expansion is T_{r+1} = (-1)^r 2^{10-r} binom{10}{r} (1-x)^r.

Then, the focus is F(0, frac{p}{2}) and the directrix equation is y = -frac{p}{2}. Draw a vertical line from point Q to the directrix, intersecting it at point Q_1. By the definition of a parabola, we have |QF| = |QQ_1|. Thus, 2 - (-frac{p}{2}) = 3, which implies p = 2. Therefore, the equation of the parabola is x^2 = 4y.(2) Let the equation of line AB be y = kx + m. By solving the system of equations:[begin{cases}x^2 = 4y y = kx + mend{cases}]we obtain the simplified equation x^2 - 4kx - 4m = 0. Thus, x_1 + x_2 = 4k and x_1 x_2 = -4m. Since AB is the diameter of a circle passing through the origin, overrightarrow{OA} perp overrightarrow{OB} and overrightarrow{OA} cdot overrightarrow{OB} = 0. This implies that (1 + k^2)x_1 x_2 + km(x_1 + x_2) + m^2 = 0. Thus, (1 + k^2)(-4m) + km(4k) + m^2 = 0, which simplifies to m^2 - 4m = 0. Solving for m, we get m = 4 or m = 0.

Solving for x_1, we get x_1 = frac{k^2 - 1}{k} = k - frac{1}{k}.Now, |AB| = 2sqrt{1 + k^2}(k + frac{1}{k}) and |AD| = 2sqrt{1 + frac{1}{k^2}}(k + frac{1}{k}).

What is the greatest possible sum of these 10 integers?","solution":"1. We start by noting that the product of 10 integers is 1024. We need to find the greatest possible sum of these 10 integers.2. Since 1024 is a power of 2, we can express it as (1024 = 2^{10}).3. To maximize the sum of the integers, we should use the smallest possible integers that multiply to 1024. The smallest integers that multiply to 1024 are all 2's, because (2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 = 2^{10} = 1024).4. However, using all 2's would give us a sum of (2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 20), which is not the greatest possible sum.5. To increase the sum, we can replace some of the 2's with larger integers, while ensuring the product remains 1024. For example, if we replace one of the 2's with a 4, we need to adjust another integer to maintain the product:   - Replacing one 2 with a 4: (4 times 2^8 = 1024). The sum is (4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 20).6. We can continue this process by replacing more 2's with larger integers. For instance, replacing two 2's with an 8:   - Replacing two 2's with an 8: (8 times 2^7 = 1024). The sum is (8 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 22).7. We can further optimize by replacing three 2's with a 16:   - Replacing three 2's with a 16: (16 times 2^6 = 1024). The sum is (16 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 28).8. Continuing this process, we find that the optimal configuration is to use one 1024 and nine 1's:   - (1024 times 1^9 = 1024). The sum is (1024 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 1033).The final answer is (boxed{1033})."},{"problem":"Problem 4. A segment is divided by three points into four unequal parts.

The sum of the fourth powers of the two numbers can be written in several ways using their sum and product, for example,begin{aligned}(x+y)^{4} & =x^{4}+y^{4}+4 x^{3} y+4 x y^{3}+6 x^{2} y^{2}=x^{4}+y^{4}+4 x yleft(x^{2}+y^{2}right)+ & +6(x y)^{2}=x^{4}+y^{4}+4 x yleft((x+y)^{2}-2 x yright)+6(x y)^{2}end{aligned}From this, expressing x^{4}+y^{4} and rearranging, we again obtain the above expression.2. The polynomial x^{4}+y^{4} does not change if x and y are swapped, the same holds for the polynomials x+y and x y. Generally, a polynomial in the variables x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n} is called a symmetric polynomial if the polynomial does not change (except possibly for the order of the terms) when the variables are replaced by the same variables in any order. If k leq n, the sum of all k-factor products that can be formed from the variables x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n} is called the ( k-th degree) elementary symmetric polynomial of the variables. According to a famous theorem of algebra, every symmetric polynomial can be expressed as a polynomial in the elementary symmetric polynomials of its variables. This expression (in condensed form) is unique up to the order of the terms.This is the expression we produced in the II. solution, and it is not coincidental that the transformation in the 1st remark also leads to the same result."},{"problem":"Solve the equations:(1) 3left(x-1right)^{2}=27.(2) frac{{x}^{3}}{8}+2=3.","solution":"To solve the given equations step by step, we proceed as follows:For equation (1) 3left(x-1right)^{2}=27:1.

Solve for x in both cases:   - When x-1=3, we get x=3+1 which simplifies to x=4.   - When x-1=-3, we get x=-3+1 which simplifies to x=-2.7.

What is the radius of the smallest circle that can contain all these circles?","solution":"Let the center of the tangent circle be O, and the centers of the tangent circles be O_{1}, O_{2}, O_{3}, O_{4}. We will use the additional notations from the diagram. It is obvious that a circle with radius 3r centered at O contains all five circles, but a circle with a radius smaller than 3r centered at O does not suffice. We will show that a circle with a radius smaller than 3r and a different center also does not work. Consider, for example, the sector O_{1} O O_{2}. This angle is at least 60^{circ}, and since there are three more such sectors, it is not greater than 180^{circ}. Suppose there exists a point O^{prime} such that a circle with a radius smaller than 3r can be drawn around it, containing all five circles. Since O neq O^{prime}, there is a sector O_{i} O O_{i+1} (where i=1, ldots, 4, O_{5}=O_{1}) that contains a point different from O. Let this sector be mathrm{O}_{2} mathrm{OO}_{3} varangle. Suppose for now that O^{prime} is an interior point of this sector. This sector is not adjacent to the sector F_{1} O F_{4} varangle, which, according to the previous, is not greater than 180^{circ}. Therefore, F_{4} O O^{prime} varangle + F_{1} O O^{prime} varangle geq 180^{circ}, so one of these two angles is at least a right angle. Suppose F_{1} O O^{prime} geq 90^{circ}. Then in the triangle F_{1} O O^{prime}, F_{1} O^{prime} is the largest side, and since F_{1} O = 3r, F_{1} O^{prime} > 3r. This is a contradiction.Now consider the case where O^{prime} lies on one of the sides of the sector it contains. Without loss of generality, we can assume that O^{prime} in O F_{2}. If F_{4} O F_{2} varangle = 180^{circ}, then O^{prime} F_{4} > O F_{4} = 3r. If F_{4} O F_{2} varangle neq 180^{circ}, then in the triangle F_{4} O O^{prime}, the angle F_{4} O O^{prime} varangle is at least 120^{circ}, so the side F_{4} O^{prime} is the largest, and again F_{4} O^{prime} > F_{4} O = 3r. This also leads to a contradiction, showing that there is no point O^{prime} such that a circle with a radius smaller than 3r can be drawn around it, containing all five circles. Therefore, the radius of the smallest circle is 3r.Siket István (Szeged, Ságvári E. Gimn., IV. o.t.)Remarks. 1. Szobonya László (Fazekas M. Főv. Gyak. Gimn., IV. o.t.) proved the following: if a circle with radius r and center O is circumscribed by frac{pi}{2 cdot operatorname{arc} sin (R /(r+R))} + 1 (the upper integer part) tangent circles with radius R and no common interior point, then the center of the smallest circle containing all circles is O, and its radius is r + 2R. This also implies the statement of our problem.2. The problem can be extended to spheres: it can be proven that if a sphere with radius r is tangent to at least nine spheres with radius r and no common interior point, then the radius of the smallest sphere containing all spheres is 3r.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_acb8ffee2cdc257fed0dg-1.jpg?height=501&width=507&top_left_y=1121&top_left_x=793)"},{"problem":"5.

Therefore, P is divisible by 2880 if and only if it is separately divisible by 2^{6}, 3^{2}, and 5.In the divisibility test by 2^{6}, we write P as the product of two expressions:P=Q cdot R, quad text{where} quad Q=(n+2)(n-2), quad R=(n+1)(n-1)left(n^{2}+3right)Focusing on even n, both factors of Q are even, and all three factors of R are odd, so P is divisible by 2^{6} if and only if Q is. The difference between the factors of Q is 4, so either neither is divisible by 4, i.e., 2^{2}, or both are, and the divisibility in question can only hold in the latter case. Then one of them is an odd multiple of 2^{2}, and thus not divisible by 2^{3}, so Q can only be divisible by 2^{6} if the other factor is divisible by 2^{4}. Therefore, 2^{6} mid Q (read 2^{6} is a divisor of Q) if n+2 and n-2 are of the form 16k, i.e., n itself is16t-2 quad text{or} quad 16t+2For odd n, Q is odd because both of its factors are, while the factors of R are even. Thus, we need to find which n satisfy 2^{6} mid R. The factor n^{2}+3 is divisible by 4 but not by 8, because with n=2k+1, n^{2}+3=4k(k+1)+4, and the first term is divisible by 8 because one of k and k+1 is even. Therefore, we seek the condition for 2^{4} mid (n+1)(n-1). The difference between n+1 and n-1 is 2, and one of them is not divisible by a higher power of 2, so the other must be divisible by 2^{3}, meaning n must be of the form:8u-1 quad text{or} quad 8u+1For the divisibility test by 3^{2} and 5, we write P as follows:P=(n-2)(n-1)n cdot n(n+1)(n+2)+3(n-2)(n-1)(n+1)(n+2)The first term is divisible by both 3^{2} and 5 because among its factors, there is a triplet of consecutive integers, one of which is divisible by 3, and a quintuplet of consecutive integers. The second term is only divisible by the first power of 3 if n is divisible by 3, and in all other cases, two of the bracketed factors are divisible by 3, so the desired divisibility holds. Thus, the necessary and sufficient condition for 3^{2} mid P is: n neq 3v, and similarly, the condition for 5 mid P is n neq 5w.According to all of this, P is divisible by 2880 if and only if n is not divisible by 3 or 5, and can be written in one of the following forms: 16t pm 2, 8u pm 1.Robert Freud (Budapest, Bolyai J.

First, we need to determine the reading rates of Alice, Bob, and Chandra in pages per second:   - Alice reads a page in 20 seconds, so her rate is ( frac{1}{20} ) pages per second.   - Bob reads a page in 45 seconds, so his rate is ( frac{1}{45} ) pages per second.   - Chandra reads a page in 30 seconds, so her rate is ( frac{1}{30} ) pages per second.2.

When the steamboat travels from B to A, it arrives at the destination just before the fourth engine stop, meaning it travels 12 hours at a speed of U-V towards A, and then 3 hours back at a speed of V towards B. Therefore, the distance between the cities is S=12(U-V)-3 V=12 U-15 V(1).When the steamboat travels from A to B, it manages to break down twice and then continue for another two hours on its own. So, it travels 8 hours at a speed of U+V towards B and 2 hours at a speed of V with the current towards B. Thus, the distance is S=8(U+V)+2 V=8 U+10 V (2). Equating the two, we get 12 U-15 V=8 U+10 V or 4 U=25 V or (U / V)=(25 / 4).

Since the roots form an arithmetic sequence, their sum can be calculated using Vieta's formulas. The sum of the roots is given by:   [   (m-2n) + (m-n) + m + (m+n) + (m+2n) = 5m   ]   According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is equal to the coefficient of ( x^4 ) (with a sign change), which is 20. Therefore:   [   5m = 20 implies m = 4   ]2. Identify the product of the roots:   The product of the roots is given by Vieta's formulas as well. For a polynomial ( x^5 + cdots + 24 ), the product of the roots taken one at a time (with a sign change) is equal to (-24). Therefore:   [   (4-2n)(4-n)(4)(4+n)(4+2n) = -24   ]3.

Since 2016_{x}=2 x^{3}+x+6, we can write the following equation:begin{aligned}2 x^{3}+x+6 & =x^{3}+2 x+342 x^{3}-x-336 & =0end{aligned}Let's examine the solutions of the equation in the set of natural numbers; these can be chosen from the divisors of the constant term. The positive divisors of -336 in sequence: 1,2,3,4,6,7, ldots. It is enough to examine from 7, because x>6. The x=7 satisfies the equation. Therefore, (x-7) can be factored out from the expression on the left side of the equation:x^{3}-x-336=(x-7)left(x^{2}+7 x+48right)=0Since a product is zero if and only if one of its factors is zero, we still need to check when the quadratic expression is zero. But the discriminant of the quadratic equation x^{2}+7 x+48=0 is D=7^{2}-4 cdot 48<0, so it has no real roots.Thus, the only solution is x=7.Rearranging the equation x^{3}-x-336=0:336=x^{3}-x=xleft(x^{2}-1right)=x(x+1)(x-1)=(x-1) x(x+1)Zoárd Csóka (Győri Műszaki Szakképzési Centrum Jedlik Ányos Gépipari és Informatikai Szakgimn., Szki. és Koll., 10th grade)Using this, the solution could also be reached in another way.

In the smallest possible case of x=7, the equality indeed holds (6 cdot 7 cdot 8=336), so this is the only solution.Dávid Apagyi (Kecskeméti Katona J. Gimn., 9th grade)III. solution. Since x is a positive integer, x(x-1)(x+1) is the product of three consecutive positive integers.The prime factorization of 336: 2^{4} cdot 3 cdot 7. From this, it follows that 6 cdot 7 cdot 8=336, so x=7 and no other solution is possible.Gergő Demeter (Szegedi Radnóti M. Kísérleti Gimn., 11th grade)IV. solution. From the last equation, we get that the product of three consecutive positive integers is 336. Since the number system allows the digit 6, x geq 7.sqrt[3]{(x-1) x(x+1)}=sqrt[3]{336} approx 6.95The geometric mean of the three numbers is 6.95 ldots, and the geometric mean cannot be smaller than all three numbers, so the smallest number is at most 6, thus x leq 7.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the limit of the ratio of the number of \\"no marmalade\\" permutations to the total number of permutations as ( n ) approaches infinity. A \\"no marmalade\\" permutation is one where no element maps to itself and no two elements map to each other.2. Reformulating the Problem:   We need to find the probability that a random permutation of ( n ) elements has no cycles of length less than 3. This means that all cycles in the permutation must have a length of at least 3.3. Recurrence Relation:   Let's denote ( f(n) ) as the number of \\"no marmalade\\" permutations of ( n ) elements. We can derive a recurrence relation for ( f(n) ).   - Consider a permutation ( sigma ) of ( n ) elements where ( sigma(1) = i ) and ( sigma(i) = j ) with ( i neq j ) and ( i, j neq 1 ).   - There are two cases:     1. ( sigma(j) = 1 ): This forms a cycle of length 3, and the remaining ( n-3 ) elements must form a \\"no marmalade\\" permutation.     2. ( sigma(j) neq 1 ): This forms a cycle of length at least 4. We can map this to a cycle of length at least 3 in the remaining ( n-1 ) elements.   Therefore, the recurrence relation is:   [   f(n) = (n-1)(n-2)f(n-3) + (n-1)f(n-1)   ]4. Probability Expression:   Let ( p_n = frac{f(n)}{n!} ).

Asymptotic Behavior:   To find the limit as ( n to infty ), we use the known result from the theory of permutations. The probability that a random permutation has no cycles of length less than 3 is given by:   [   expleft(-sum_{i=1}^{2} frac{1}{i}right) = expleft(-1 - frac{1}{2}right) = expleft(-frac{3}{2}right)   ]6.

Since the remainder must be 1000, we find 3 k+1=1000 and thus k=333. This gives the solution n=2 cdot 333=666.Now, assume that n is odd. We can then write n=2 k+1 with k an integer. We then get: n^{2}=4 k^{2}+4 k+1 and 2 n+1=4 k+3. When we divide 4 k^{2}+4 k+1 by 4 k+3, the result is k and the remainder is 4 k^{2}+4 k+1-k(4 k+3)=k+1.

Consider the function ( h_n(x) = f(x) - x^n ). Since ( f ) is continuous and strictly decreasing, and ( x^n ) is continuous and strictly increasing, ( h_n ) is continuous on ([0, 1]).

Since ( f ) is strictly decreasing, ( f(a_n) > f(b_n) ). However, since ( x^n ) is strictly increasing, ( a_n^n < b_n^n ). This leads to a contradiction, hence ( a_n ) is unique.2.

Then (B) is at ((1,0)) and (D) is at ((0,1)). Furthermore, let (0 < a leq 1) be a real number and the point (X) have coordinates ((a,0)). Then (X) lies on the segment (A B), but is different from (A).The line (X D) can be described by the function equation (f(x) = frac{0-1}{a-0} cdot x + 1 = -frac{1}{a} cdot x + 1) and the line (A C) by (g(x) = x). For the intersection point (S) of both lines and the coordinates (left(x_{S}, y_{S}right)), it holds that (fleft(x_{S}right) = gleft(x_{S}right)), i.e., (-frac{1}{a} x_{S} + 1 = x_{S}) or (1 = left(1 + frac{1}{a}right) cdot x_{S} = frac{a+1}{a} cdot x_{S}), thus (y_{S} = x_{S} = frac{a}{a+1}).Therefore, the height (h_{a}) from (S) to (A B) has the length (h_{a} = y_{s} = frac{a}{a+1}) and the height (h_{d}) from (S) to (A D) has the length (h_{d} = x_{s} = frac{a}{a+1}).

Define Variables:   - Let m represent the kilograms of fruit A purchased by the supermarket.   - Consequently, the kilograms of fruit B purchased will be (200 - m), since the total purchase is 200 kilograms.2. Profit Calculation:   - The profit from fruit A per kilogram is the selling price minus the purchase price, which is (20 - 16) = 4 yuan.   - Similarly, the profit from fruit B per kilogram is (25 - 20) = 5 yuan.   - Therefore, the total profit y in yuan can be calculated as:     [     y = 4m + 5(200 - m) = 4m + 1000 - 5m = -m + 1000     ]3. Constraint on Weight:   - The problem states that the weight of fruit A should not be less than three times the weight of fruit B, which translates to:     [     m geqslant 3(200 - m)     ]   - Simplifying this inequality:     [     m geqslant 600 - 3m     ]     [     4m geqslant 600     ]     [     m geqslant 150     ]   - This means m should be in the range 150 leqslant m < 200.4. Maximizing Profit:   - Given the profit equation y = -m + 1000, we observe that the profit decreases as m increases because the coefficient of m is negative.   - To maximize profit, we need to minimize m within the allowed range, which is at m = 150.5. Calculation of Maximum Profit:   - Substituting m = 150 into the profit equation:     [     y = -150 + 1000 = 850     ]6. Conclusion:   - The supermarket should purchase 150 kilograms of fruit A and (200 - 150) = 50 kilograms of fruit B to maximize profit.   - The maximum profit achievable under these conditions is 850 yuan.Therefore, the final answer, encapsulated as requested, is boxed{850 text{ yuan}}."},{"problem":"## Task 8 / 79Determine all prime numbers a, b, c, d for which the following equations hold: a+b=c and 2a+b=d.","solution":"Since d=2a+b>2a>2, d must be odd.

For z geq 2 we have (modulo 4) that y is even. Let y=2 k. Then 2^{z+1}=left(3^{k}-1right)left(3^{k}+1right) which is possible only when 3^{k}-1=2, i.e. k=1, y=2, which implies that t=5. So the pair (4,2) is a solution to our problem. Case 2. If y is even, then there exists a positive integer w such that y=2 w, andleft(t-3^{w}right)left(t+3^{w}right)=2^{x}Since t+3^{w}-left(t-3^{w}right)=2 cdot 3^{w}, we have operatorname{gcd}left(t-2^{z}, t+2^{z}right) mid 2 cdot 3^{w}, which means that g c d(t- left.3^{w}, t+3^{w}right)=2. Hence t-3^{w}=2 and t+3^{w}=2^{x-1}. So we have2 cdot 3^{w}+2=2^{x-1} Rightarrow 3^{w}+1=2^{x-2}Here we see modulo 3 that x-2 is even. Let x-2=2 m, then 3^{w}=left(2^{m}-1right)left(2^{m}+1right), whence m=1 since operatorname{gcd}left(2^{m}-1,2^{m}+1right)=1. So we arrive again to the solution (4,2).Case 3. Let x and y be odd. For x geq 3 we have 2^{x}+3^{y} equiv 3(bmod 4) while t^{2} equiv 0,1(bmod 4), a contradiction. For x=1 we have 2+3^{y}=t^{2}. For y geq 2 we have 2+3^{y} equiv 2(bmod 9) while t^{2} equiv 0,1,4,7(bmod 9). For y=1 we have 5=2+3=t^{2} clearly this doesn't have solution. Note.

Prove that it is really the smallest.","solution":"1. Understanding the problem: We need to find the smallest positive value of the expression (36^k - 5^ell) where (k) and (ell) are natural numbers. 2. Analyzing modulo 10:    - For any natural number (k), (36^k equiv 6^k equiv 6 pmod{10}).   - For any natural number (ell), (5^ell equiv 5 pmod{10}).   - Therefore, (36^k - 5^ell equiv 6 - 5 equiv 1 pmod{10}).3. Form of the expression: From the above, we conclude that (36^k - 5^ell) must be of the form (10n + 1) for some integer (n).4. Finding the smallest positive value:   - For the smallest positive value, we start with (n = 0). This gives us the equation (36^k - 5^ell = 1).   - Rearranging, we get (36^k - 1 = 5^ell).   - Using the difference of squares, we can write (36^k - 1 = (6^k + 1)(6^k - 1) = 5^ell).5. Analyzing the factors:   - Let (6^k + 1 = 5^a) and (6^k - 1 = 5^b) where (a) and (b) are natural numbers such that (a > b) and (a + b = ell).   - Subtracting these two equations, we get (5^a - 5^b = 2).6. Contradiction:   - The equation (5^a - 5^b = 2) has no solutions in natural numbers because the left-hand side is always a multiple of 5, while the right-hand side is 2, which is not a multiple of 5.   - Therefore, there are no solutions for (n = 0).7. Next smallest value:   - We try (n = 1). This gives us the equation (36^k - 5^ell = 11).   - Testing small values, we find that (k = 1) and (ell = 2) satisfy the equation: (36^1 - 5^2 = 36 - 25 = 11).8. Verification:   - We need to verify that there are no smaller positive values.    - Since (36^k - 5^ell equiv 1 pmod{10}), the next possible value would be (21), (31), etc., but these do not satisfy the form (36^k - 5^ell) for small values of (k) and (ell).Thus, the smallest positive value of (36^k - 5^ell) is indeed (11).The final answer is (boxed{11})."},{"problem":"6.

Let's analyze the given options:- Option A: The Average of x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n}  - The average, or mean, is calculated as frac{x_{1} + x_{2} + ldots + x_{n}}{n}. It represents the central tendency of the dataset, indicating a general trend rather than the variability or stability of the data. Therefore, while useful for understanding the overall performance, it does not directly assess stability.- Option B: The Standard Deviation of x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n}  - The standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range. This directly assesses the stability of the yield, as it quantifies how much the yields vary from the average yield.- Option C: The Maximum Value of x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n}  - The maximum value simply identifies the highest yield among the plots. While it provides information about the potential of the crop, it does not offer insight into the stability or consistency of yields across the plots.- Option D: The Median of x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{n}  - The median is the middle value in a list of numbers. It divides the dataset into two halves. Like the average, the median is a measure of central tendency, not variability or stability. It indicates a central value but does not reflect how much the individual yields vary.Given the need to assess stability, which is essentially about understanding the variability or consistency of the yields, the most appropriate measure is the standard deviation. The standard deviation provides direct insight into how dispersed the yields are around the average yield, making it the best choice for assessing the stability of the yield per mu of this crop.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{text{B}}."},{"problem":"In the Cartesian coordinate system xOy, the equation of circle C is x^{2}+y^{2}-4x=0.

Having log_{2}(a + 3) = 2 implies that 2^{2} = a + 3.2. Therefore 4 = a + 3.3. By subtracting 3 from both sides, we find that a = 1.With a determined, we can now examine the elements of sets A and B:- For set A, we substitute the value of a into the logarithm to find that log_{2}(1 + 3) = log_{2}(4) = 2. So now A is {5, 2}.- For set B, since a = 1, and we know that A cap B = {2}, it must also be the case b = 2.

Point E is inside the square, at the same distances from points D and C, and such that angle D E C=150^{circ}. What is the perimeter of triangle A B E equal to? Prove your answer is correct.","solution":"D/2 Solution 1: Since the area of square A B C D is 196=14^{2}left(mathrm{~cm}^{2}right), then the side of square A B C D is 14 mathrm{~cm}.We claim that triangle A B E is equilateral. To prove this, we make a reverse construction, starting from an equilateral triangle A B E^{prime}, building up to square A B C D, and eventually showing that points E and E^{prime} coincide. Thus,Step 1. Let E^{prime} be a point inside square A B C D such that triangle A B E^{prime} is equilateral. Hence, in particular, angle A B E^{prime}=60^{circ}.Step 2. Then angle E^{prime} B C=90^{circ}-60^{circ}=30^{circ}.Step 3. Since B E^{prime}=A B=B C ( triangle A B E^{prime} is equilateral and A B C D is a square), we conclude that triangle C E^{prime} B is isosceles with B E^{prime}=B C and angle E^{prime} B C=30^{circ}.Step 4. This in turn implies that both base angles of triangle C E^{prime} B are frac{1}{2}left(180^{circ}-30^{circ}right)=75^{circ}. In particular, angle B C E^{prime}=75^{circ}. (Note: Since angle B C E^{prime}0) .Now back to our problem. Drop a perpendicular from point E to side B C of the square and mark by H the foot of this perpendicular. Since E is at the same distances from C and D, it easily follows that E is half-way between parallel lines A D and B C; i.e., E H=frac{1}{2} A B=7 mathrm{~cm}.Just as above, from isosceles triangle D E C we know that angle E C D=15^{circ}. This means that angle C E H=15^{circ} (EH|DC,CE is a transversal, and angle E C D and angle C E H are alternating interior angles). Thus, from right triangle E H C we can calculate C H=7 tan 15^{circ}. This implies that B H=B C-C H=14-7 tan 15^{circ}.We are ready to calculate cot angle E B C from right triangle E H B :cot angle E B C=cot angle E B H=frac{B H}{E H}=frac{14-7 tan 15^{circ}}{7}=2-tan 15^{circ}=2-(2-sqrt{3})=sqrt{3} .But cot 30^{circ}=sqrt{3}, so the acute angle E B C must be 30^{circ}. We proved what we aimed for!To finish off the problem, note that angle A B E=90^{circ}-angle E B C=90^{circ}-30^{circ}=60^{circ}. By symmetry, angle A B E=60^{circ} and triangle A B E is equilateral. Thus, its perimeter is 3 A B=42 mathrm{~cm}.Solution 3: It is not hard to compute the ratios of a 15-75-90 right triangle without any trig, provided one knows the ratios of the 30-60-90 triangle.

Find the Intersection Point: The intersection point of the lines 2x+3y-7=0 and 7x+15y+1=0 can be found by solving these equations simultaneously. However, since we are looking for a line parallel to x+2y-3=0 and passing through the intersection point, the exact coordinates of the intersection point are not necessary for the final equation of the desired line.2. Determine the Slope of the Parallel Line: The line parallel to x+2y-3=0 will have the same slope. The slope-intercept form of a line is y=mx+b, where m is the slope. For the line x+2y-3=0, we can rewrite it as 2y=-x+3, or y=-frac{1}{2}x+frac{3}{2}. Thus, the slope (m) is -frac{1}{2}.3. Formulate the Equation of the Parallel Line: Since the desired line is parallel to x+2y-3=0, it will have the form x+2y+c=0, where c is a constant that we need to determine. Given that the line must pass through the intersection of the first two lines, we can use the property that two lines are parallel if their coefficients of x and y are proportional. The line x+2y-3=0 can be rewritten to match the form of the coefficients in the given solution, which is 3x+6y-9=0. To make it parallel and not identical, we adjust the constant term while keeping the coefficients of x and y the same, leading to the equation 3x+6y-2=0.Therefore, the equation of the line that passes through the intersection point of the lines 2x+3y-7=0 and 7x+15y+1=0, and is parallel to the line x+2y-3=0, is boxed{3x+6y-2=0}."},{"problem":"1 cdot 25 Given real numbers m, n, p, M satisfy:M=frac{m}{n+p}=frac{n}{p+m}=frac{p}{m+n},then the value of M is(A) -1 .(B) frac{1}{2}.(C) 1 .(D) frac{1}{2} or -1 .(China Beijing Junior High School Mathematics Competition, 1983;2nd \\"Hope Cup\\" National Mathematics Invitational Competition, 1991)","solution":"［Solution 1］From the given conditions, we havem=(n+p) M, quad n=(p+m) M, quad p=(m+n) M,Adding the above three equations gives (m+n+p)=2(m+n+p) M,therefore When m+n+p neq 0, M=frac{1}{2}.Also, from frac{m}{n+p}=frac{n}{p+m}, we get frac{m}{n}=frac{n+p}{p+m},Thus,begin{aligned}& frac{m-n}{n}=frac{(m+p)-(p+m)}{p+m}=frac{n-m}{p+m}, therefore quad & frac{n}{p+m}=frac{m-n}{n-m}=-1,end{aligned}which means M=-1 (at this time, m+n+p=0).In summary, the answer is (D).[Solution 2] From the given conditions and the properties of proportional segments, we have M=frac{m+n+p}{2(m+n+p)}, i.e., square(2 M-1)(m+n+p)=0 .If m+n+p neq 0, then 2 M-1=0, i.e., M=frac{1}{2}; if m+n+p=0, substituting m=-(n+p) into the original equation gives M=-1.

If point C does not lie on the line formed by A and B, then the three points do not lie on the same line, and according to the principle, they can determine a circle.Therefore, the answer to whether these three points determine a circle is based on the outcome of substituting point C into the line's equation.

Solution. I. Let the digits of the desired number N be j_{0}, j_{1}, j_{2}, ldots, j_{9}, so the digit k appears j_{k} times. No other digit can be present in a number written in the decimal system, so the total number of digits is both the sum of the digits and, according to the requirement, ten, thusj_{0}+j_{1}+ldots+j_{9}=s=10We will show that neither 7 nor any larger digit can appear in N. Assuming there is such a digit, let's denote it by h, that is, h geq 7. Then it can only take the role of j_{0}, because even in the role of h=j_{1}, it would represent at least one h digit and h ones, which is not less than 14. If, however, the digit h is given the role of j_{0}, then the number of digits greater than zero is 10-h, and this is at most 3. Among them, one is h itself, another is j_{h}, whose value is exactly 1, and because of this, j_{1} is also positive. There is no room for more positive digits when h=7, so j_{k}=0 if k>1 and k neq h. However, the value of j_{1} must be at least 2, because j_{1}=1 is a contradiction when the value of j_{h} is also 1; on the other hand, j_{1} leq s-left(j_{0}+j_{h}right) leq 2, so j_{1}=2, and thus j_{2} is also positive, although zero is in its place. This proves our statement.Essentially the same reasoning provides a suitable N number if we reduce the value of h to 6. In this case, we need to write a non-zero digit in 4 places, and these are: j_{0}=6, j_{6}=1, and the contradiction from before is resolved if we write 2 as j_{1}, as if in advance, thinking that the 2 written in this way will take the role of j_{2} for the second 1. According to this, N=6210001000 is a suitable number in base 10, and with this we have met the part of the problem concerning the decimal system.II. Since in the base n number system we use n types of digits:0,1,2, ldots,(n-1), the number can only indicate the occurrence of each type of digit if it has at least n digits. On the other hand, there cannot be more than n digits, so the generalized problem is: \\"Find an n-digit number in the base n number system in which the j-th digit (j leq n) indicates how many times the (j-1)-th digit appears in the number.\\"It is easy to verify that the following number always works:N_{n}=(n-4) 21 underbrace{00 ldots 0}_{n-7 text{ digits}} 1000(which for n=10 gives the above N), provided that the number of zeros in the middle satisfies n-7 geq 0, i.e., n geq 7, in which case (n-4)=j_{0} geq 3, and this digit does not change the value of j_{1} and j_{2}.For n=6, in N_{n}, (n-4)=2, so the digit j_{n-4}=1 would end up in the same place where j_{2}=1 stands, making the previous j_{1}=2 invalid, and then j_{2} as well, which is a contradiction. Similarly to the first part of the solution, it can be shown that there is no solution to the problem in the base 6 number system. (Indeed, j_{0}+j_{1}+ldots+j_{n-1}=n and no digit h=n-3 or larger can appear.)Similarly, we find that for n=5, N_{5}=21200 is the only solution, for n=4, two solutions easily arise, 1210 and 2020, and for n=3 and n=2, there is no solution.Juhari Katalin (Budapest, Berzsenyi D. Gymnasium, 1st year) Rövid Kálmán (Szombathely, Nagy Lajos Gymnasium, 2nd year)Note. It can be easily shown by continuing the first part of the solution that there is no other solution for N in the decimal system.II. Solution. I. Let the first digit of the desired number be denoted by x_{0}, the second by x_{1}, and so on, up to the tenth digit by x_{9}. The sum of these digits is the total number of digits, sox_{0}+x_{1}+x_{2}+ldots+x_{9}=10We can also calculate the sum of the digits in another way: the sum of the digits equal to k is k cdot x_{k}(k=0,1,2, ldots, 9), so0 cdot x_{0}+1 cdot x_{1}+2 cdot x_{2}+ldots+9 cdot x_{9}=10From these,x_{0}=x_{2}+2 x_{3}+ldots+8 x_{9}Let x_{0}=k for short, then the number of digits equal to k is at least 1, i.e., x_{k} geq 1. Thus, k=0 leads to a contradiction, so k>0. Let S denote the sum of the terms on the right side of (3) other than (k-1) x_{k}, then (3) is equivalent to the equationk=S+(k-1) x_{k}Rearranging and factoring,S+(k-1)left(x_{k}-1right)=1and both terms on the left side are non-negative integers; so one of them is 1 and the other is 0.a) IfS=1, quad text{and thus} quad(k-1)left(x_{k}-1right)=0then from the right side of (3) without the (k-1) x_{k} term, the sum of the remaining terms is 1. This can only happen ifx_{2}=1,and because of this, k neq 2, and the other terms are 0. (6) implies that there is at least one 1, and with x_{1}=1, another 1 would be present, which is a contradiction, sox_{1} geq 2From this, with k=1 (i.e., x_{0}=1), we would get the number 12100 ldots 0, which does"},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)= begin{cases} -x+a,x < frac {1}{2}  log _{2}x,xgeqslant frac {1}{2}end{cases}, if its minimum value is (-1), then the range of the real number a is _____ .","solution":"When x  - frac {1}{2}+aAnd the minimum value of the function f(x)= begin{cases} -x+a,x < frac {1}{2}  log _{2}x,xgeqslant frac {1}{2}end{cases} is (-1)therefore- frac {1}{2}+ageqslant -1, solve it to get ageqslant - frac {1}{2}Hence, the answer is: boxed{ageqslant - frac {1}{2}}The solution involves finding the extreme value of the function using its monotonicity on the interval (-infty, frac {1}{2}), setting up an inequality according to the problem, and solving it.

If M-N=240, determine the coefficient of the {x}^{3} term in the expansion.","solution":"First, let's analyze the problem and break it down into simpler steps.1. We know that the sum of the coefficients of all terms (M) in an expanded binomial expression is found by setting x=1. Thus, we have:M = (5-sqrt{1})^n = 4^n2. The sum of binomial coefficients (N) in any binomial expansion is always 2^n, which can be derived from the Binomial Theorem or by setting x=1 and y=1 in the binomial expansion of (x+y)^n.3. According to the given condition, M-N=240. Therefore, we have 4^n-2^n=240.4. To find the coefficient of the {x}^{3} term, we need to consider the possible combinations of 5x and sqrt{x} that can produce {x}^{3}. The possible exponents for 5x and sqrt{x} are:(5x)^a cdot (sqrt{x})^b, quad text{where } a+b=n text{ and } 5a+frac{b}{2}=35. Solving these simultaneous equations, we find a=frac{1}{5} and b=frac{14}{5}, which is not possible since a and b must be integers. Hence, there must be another approach.6. Notice that the term {x}^{3} can also come from the squared term (5x - sqrt{x})^2 in the expansion when multiplied with other terms. In fact, it comes from multiplying the {x}^{2} term in one bracket with the x term in another bracket: (5x - sqrt{x})^{n-2} cdot (5x cdot -sqrt{x}) cdot (5x cdot -sqrt{x}).7. The coefficient of the {x}^{2} term in (5x - sqrt{x})^{n-2} is given by the binomial coefficient binom{n-2}{1} cdot 5^{n-3} cdot (-1)^{1}, and the coefficient of the x term from squaring (5x - sqrt{x}) is -5.8. Therefore, the coefficient of the {x}^{3} term is given by binom{n-2}{1} cdot 5^{n-3} cdot (-1)^{1} cdot (-5) = -5 cdot (n-2) cdot 5^{n-3}.9. Since 4^n-2^n=240, we can simplify this equation as (2^n)^2 - 2^n - 240 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation for 2^n gives us 2^n=16. Thus, n=4.10.

Given point P(-1,0),The coordinates of the center of the required circle are left( frac{1-1}{2}, frac{2+0}{2} right), which is (0,1).The radius of the circle r= sqrt {(1-0)^{2}+(0-1)^{2}}= sqrt {2}.Hence, the equation of the circle passing through points A, B, and C is: x^{2}+(y-1)^{2}=2.Thus, the answer is boxed{A}.According to the properties of tangents, PA is perpendicular to CA, and PB is perpendicular to CB. Therefore, the circle passing through points A, B, and C is the circumcircle of the quadrilateral PACB. Moreover, segment AC is the diameter of the circumcircle. So, we can find the center of the circumcircle using the midpoint formula and calculate the radius using the distance formula. Finally, we can write the standard equation of the circle using the obtained center and radius.This problem tests the student's understanding of the properties of tangents and circles, the ability to use the midpoint formula and distance formula to simplify and find values, and the skill to write the standard equation of a circle given its center and radius.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to determine how many positive integers ( n ) in the range ( 1 leq n leq 2008 ) allow the set ({1, 2, 3, ldots, 4n}) to be divided into ( n ) disjoint 4-element subsets such that each subset contains an element which is the arithmetic mean of all the elements in that subset.2. Arithmetic Mean Condition:   If ( a, b, c, d ) are four numbers in a subset and ( a ) is the arithmetic mean, then:   [   frac{a + b + c + d}{4} = a implies a + b + c + d = 4a   ]   This implies that the sum ( a + b + c + d ) must be divisible by 4.3. Sum of the Entire Set:   The sum of all elements in the set ({1, 2, 3, ldots, 4n}) is:   [   sum_{k=1}^{4n} k = frac{4n(4n + 1)}{2} = 2n(4n + 1)   ]   For the set to be divided into ( n ) subsets each with a sum divisible by 4, the total sum ( 2n(4n + 1) ) must be divisible by 4.4. Divisibility Condition:   [   2n(4n + 1) equiv 0 pmod{4}   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   2n(4n + 1) equiv 0 pmod{4} implies n(4n + 1) equiv 0 pmod{2}   ]   Since ( 4n + 1 ) is always odd, ( n ) must be even for the product ( n(4n + 1) ) to be even.5. Counting Valid ( n ):   We need to count the even integers ( n ) in the range ( 1 leq n leq 2008 ). The even numbers in this range are ( 2, 4, 6, ldots, 2008 ). This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term ( a = 2 ) and common difference ( d = 2 ).6.

Solving this equation yields a_1=2.Hence, the sequence {a_n} is a geometric sequence with the first term 2 and common ratio 2,The general term formula is a_n=2^n.(Ⅱ) From (Ⅰ), we know that na_n=ncdot 2^n.Thus, T_n=sum_{k=1}^{n}kcdot 2^k = 1cdot 2^1+2cdot 2^2+3cdot 2^3+ldots+(n-1)cdot2^{n-1}+ncdot 2^n.Now consider 2T_n= 0cdot2^1+1cdot2^2+2cdot 2^3+ldots+(n-1)cdot2^n+ncdot2^{n+1}.Subtracting T_n from 2T_n gives us -T_n=2(1+2+2^2+2^3+ldots+2^{n-1})-ncdot2^{n+1}.This is a geometric series, so we can use the sum formula frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}.Now we have -T_n= frac{2(1-2^n)}{1-2}-ncdot2^{n+1}=2^{n+1}-2-ncdot2^{n+1}.Therefore, T_n= boxed{ncdot 2^{n+1}+2-2^{n+1}}."},{"problem":"The derivative of the function y=cos 2x is (　　)A: -sin 2xB: sin 2xC: -2sin 2xD: 2sin 2x","solution":"According to the problem, let t=2x, then y=cos t,  its derivative y'=(2x)'(cos t)'=-2sin 2x;  Therefore, the answer is: boxed{C}.

If the remaining two exponents were positive, the number in the parentheses would be odd, which would mean that 2^{2 c} is divisible by an odd number greater than 1. Therefore, at least two of the exponents are zero, so in the triplet (a+2 b+1,2 a, 4 b), there are two identical numbers, which are at most equal to the third one.If a+2 b+1=2 a, we would get a=2 b+1, which contradicts the assumed inequality 2 a leqq 4 b. Similarly, from the equality a+2 b+1=4 b we get a=2 b-1, which contradicts the inequality 4 b leqq 2 a. Therefore, it must be that 2 a=4 b, i.e., a=2 b.The left side of the given equation thus has the form2^{a+2 b+1}+2^{2 a}+2^{4 b}=2^{4 b+1}+2^{4 b}+2^{4 b}=4 cdot 2^{4 b}=2^{4 b+2} .Therefore, the equation is satisfied if and only if 2 c=4 b+2 or c=2 b+1.For any natural number b, the triplet (a, b, c)=(2 b, b, 2 b+1) is a solution to the given equation, and no other solutions exist.Another solution.

Determine the maximum repulsion degree can have a circular function.[b]Note:[/b] Here lfloor{x}rfloor is the integer part of x.","solution":"1. Base Case Analysis:   - For ( p = 1 ), since ( f ) is circular, ( f(1) = 1 ).   - Assume ( k geq frac{1}{2} ). For ( p = 2 ), ( lfloor 2k rfloor = 1 ), so ( f(2) neq 2 ). By circularity, there exists ( m > 2 ) such that ( f(2) = m ) and ( f(m) = 2 ). If ( m geq 4 ), then ( lfloor km rfloor geq 2 ), contradicting ( f(f(m)) = f(2) = m ). Hence, ( m = 3 ).2. Defining Sets ( C_q ):   - For any positive integer ( q ), define ( C_q ) as the set of different numbers ( p ) such that ( f^i(2^q) = p ) for some ( i ). By circularity, ( C_q ) is also the set of integers ( p ) such that ( f^i(p) = 2^q ) for some ( i ). The cardinality ( n_q ) of ( C_q ) is the smallest number such that ( f^{n_q}(p) = p ) for all ( p in C_q ), and obviously ( 2^q geq n_q ).3. Bounding Elements in ( C_q ):   - Assume ( p in C_q ) exists such that ( p geq 2^{q+1} ). Then, ( lfloor kp rfloor geq 2^q ), implying ( f^i(2^q) neq 2^q ) for all ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 2^q ), which is absurd due to circularity. Therefore, all ( p in C_q ) are at most ( 2^{q+1} - 1 ). In particular, ( 2^q ) cannot belong to ( C_{q'} ) for any ( q' < q ), so all ( C_q ) are disjoint.4. Inductive Step:   - We will show by induction that ( C_q = {2^q, 2^q + 1, 2^q + 2, ldots, 2^{q+1} - 1} ).   - Base case: ( q = 1 ). Assume the result is true for ( 1, 2, ldots, q-1 ). Then, any element in ( C_q ) is not lower than ( 2^q ), since all positive integers less than ( 2^q ) are either 1 or belong to some ( C_{q'} ) with ( q' < q ). The largest element in ( C_q ) is then at least ( 2^q + n_q - 1 ), or ( n_q - 1 geq lfloor frac{2^q + n_q - 1}{2} rfloor geq 2^{q-1} + frac{n_q}{2} - 1 ). We can conclude that ( n_q geq 2^q ), yielding ( n_q = 2^q ). Since no element of ( C_q ) may be smaller than ( 2^q ) or larger than ( 2^{q+1} - 1 ), then ( C_q = {2^q, 2^q + 1, 2^q + 2, ldots, 2^{q+1} - 1} ).5. Bounding ( k ):   - Since the largest element of ( C_q ) is ( 2^{q+1} - 1 ), and ( i = n_q = 2^q ) is the smallest ( i ) such that ( f^i(p) = p ) for any ( p in C_q ), then ( 2^q - 1 geq lfloor k(2^{q+1} - 1) rfloor > k(2^{q+1} - 1) - 1 ), or ( k < frac{2^q}{2^{q+1} - 1} = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2(2^{q+1} - 1)} ). As ( q ) increases, the second term tends to zero, so ( k ) cannot be larger than ( frac{1}{2} ).6. Constructing a Circular Function with ( k = frac{1}{2} ):   - A circular function with ( k = frac{1}{2} ) can be constructed by setting ( f(p) = p + 1 ) if ( p + 1 ) is not an integral power of 2, and ( f(p) = frac{p + 1}{2} ) if ( p + 1 ) is an integral power of 2.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ frac{1}{2} } )"},{"problem":"A multiple choice examination consists of 20 questions.

Considering modulo 4:   [ 1009^x equiv 1 pmod{4} ]   [ 959^x equiv (-1)^x pmod{4} ]   Since ( x ) is odd:   [ 1009^x equiv 1 pmod{4} ]   [ 959^x equiv -1 pmod{4} ]   This implies ( x ) is even, a contradiction. Thus, ( 2y - x = 1 ).6.

Thus, four positive a_{nu} have already been verified; their sum is a_{0}+a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{k}=k+(8-k)+1+1=10.Because of (1), the remaining six a_{nu} must be 0; thus, the count of zeros a_{0}=6 is determined, and in total it has been found: n must be the number 6210001000.Indeed, the decimal representation of this number has exactly 6 zeros, 2 ones, one two, one six, and none of the digits three, four, five, seven, eight, nine. Therefore, this number exactly satisfies the conditions of the problem.## Adapted from [5]"},{"problem":"A7. On a bicycle lock, we can set a 3-digit code.

First, note that if ( p ) is a prime divisor of ( x ), then ( p ) must also divide ( y ) and ( z ). This is because ( x mid y^3 ) implies ( p mid y ), ( y mid z^3 ) implies ( p mid z ), and ( z mid x^3 ) implies ( p mid x ).3.

Therefore, the probability that ( S_i equiv 0 pmod{6} ) is (frac{1}{6}).6. Thus, ( mathbb{E}[I_i] = frac{1}{6} ).7. By the Linearity of Expectation, the expected number of ( S_i ) that are multiples of 6 is:   [   mathbb{E}left[sum_{i=1}^{100} I_iright] = sum_{i=1}^{100} mathbb{E}[I_i] = 100 cdot frac{1}{6} = frac{100}{6} = frac{50}{3}   ]8. Therefore, the expected number of integers in the set ( {x_1, x_1 + x_2, ldots, x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_{100}} ) that are multiples of 6 is (frac{50}{3}).The final answer is (boxed{frac{50}{3}})."},{"problem":"Given vectors overrightarrow {a} = (1, -2), overrightarrow {b} = (2, 1), overrightarrow {c} = (-4, -2), which of the following statements is incorrect?A: overrightarrow {a} perp overrightarrow {b}B: The angle between vector overrightarrow {a} and vector overrightarrow {c} is 90°C: overrightarrow {b} parallel overrightarrow {c}D: For any vector overrightarrow {d} in the same plane, there exist two real numbers k_1, k_2 such that overrightarrow {d} = k_1 overrightarrow {b} + k_2 overrightarrow {c}","solution":"Step 1: Check the orthogonality between overrightarrow {a} and overrightarrow {b} using their dot product: overrightarrow {a} cdot overrightarrow {b} = 1 cdot 2 + (-2) cdot 1 = 2 - 2 = 0.

How many natural numbers n exist for which 4^{n}-15 is a square of an integer?","solution":"Answer. Two.Solution. Let 4^{n}-15=x^{2}, where x is an integer. It is obvious that x neq 0. If x is negative, then (-x)^{2} is also equal to 4^{n}-15; therefore, we will assume that 4^{n}-15=x^{2}, where x is a natural number. From the equation 2^{2 n}-15=x^{2}, we get: 2^{2 n}-x^{2}=15, and using the formula for factoring the difference of squares: left(2^{n}-xright)left(2^{n}+xright)=15. Since x is a natural number, the second factor on the left in the last equation is positive, and therefore the first factor must also be positive. The number 15 can be factored into natural numbers in two ways: 15=3 cdot 5=1 cdot 15. Since x>0, we have 2^{n}+x>2^{n}-x. Thus, there are only two possible cases:left{begin{array}{l}2^{n}-x=1,  2^{n}+x=15end{array}right. or left{begin{array}{l}2^{n}-x=3,  2^{n}+x=5 .end{array}right.Solving the first system of equations (it is most convenient to simply add the equations), we get that 2 cdot 2^{n}=16, i.e., n=3.

Since the point (n, frac{S_n}{n}) lies on the line y= frac{1}{2}x+ frac{11}{2},   we have frac{S_n}{n} = frac{1}{2}n+ frac{11}{2},   which means S_n = frac{1}{2}n^2+ frac{11}{2}n.   Therefore, a_1 = 6,   and for ngeq2, a_n = S_n - S_{n-1} = n+5.   Since a_1 = 6 also fits,   we have a_n = n+5.   Since b_{n+2} - 2b_{n+1} + b_n = 0 (ninmathbb{N}^*),   we have b_{n+2} - b_{n+1} = b_{n+1} - b_n = ldots = b_2 - b_1.   Therefore, {b_n} is an arithmetic sequence.   Given b_3 = 11 and the sum of its first 9 terms is 153,   let the common difference be d, then b_1 + 2d = 11, and 9b_1 + frac{9times8}{2}times d = 153,   solving these gives b_1 = 5, d = 3.

Let point B (a,b) be the coordinates of the center of the circle symmetrical to circle C across the line x-y+1=0. The symmetry across the line means that the line connecting points A and B is perpendicular to the line x-y+1=0 and that it bisects the segment AB at its midpoint. Hence, the slope of the line connecting A and B is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the line x-y+1=0 (which has a slope of 1). The slope of AB is thus -1. Also, the midpoint of AB, which lies on the line x-y+1=0, satisfies the equation x-y+1=0. If we let (frac{a+1}{2},frac{b+1}{2}) be the midpoint of AB, it must satisfy the line equation. Hence, we have two equations:1. The slope condition: frac{b-1}{a-1}=-12. The midpoint lies on the line: frac{a+1}{2} - frac{b+1}{2} + 1 = 0Solving these equations simultaneously:From the first equation, we have b-1=-(a-1) Rightarrow b = 2 - a.Substituting b in the second equation gives us a-1=0 Rightarrow a=1. Plugging a back into the first equation, we get b=2 - a = 2 - 1 = 1. But since we also have from the substitution of b, that a should equal 0, it looks like we've made a mistake.Let's correct the substitution here. Substituting b in the midpoint equation, we get:frac{a+1}{2} - frac{(2 - a)+1}{2} + 1 = 0which simplifies to frac{a+1}{2} - frac{3 - a}{2} + 1 = 0Further simplification gives:a + 1 - 3 + a + 2 = 02a = 0a = 0Now we can correctly find b:b = 2 - a = 2 - 0 = 2The center B of the symmetrical circle is thus at (0, 2), and since the radius of the circle is unchanged by symmetry and is equal to 1 (as given by the equation of the symmetrical circle), the equation of circle C is boxed{x^2 + (y-2)^2 = 1} Therefore, the correct option is C."},{"problem":"Let M be a set consisting of n points in the plane, satisfying:i) there exist 7 points in M which constitute the vertices of a convex heptagon; ii) if for any 5 points in M which constitute the vertices of a convex pentagon, then there is a point in M which lies in the interior of the pentagon.Find the minimum value of n.[i]Leng Gangsong[/i]","solution":"To find the minimum value of ( n ) for the set ( M ) of points in the plane, we need to satisfy the given conditions:1.

For any 5 points in ( M ) which constitute the vertices of a convex pentagon, there is a point in ( M ) which lies in the interior of the pentagon.Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:1. Existence of Convex Heptagon:   Let ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_7 ) be the vertices of a convex heptagon ( H ). According to the problem, these 7 points are part of the set ( M ).2. Interior Point for Convex Pentagons:   For any 5 points in ( M ) that form a convex pentagon, there must be a point in ( M ) inside this pentagon. This implies that there must be additional points in ( M ) that are not vertices of the heptagon but lie inside any convex pentagon formed by any 5 of the 7 heptagon vertices.3. Finding Interior Points:   Consider the convex heptagon ( H ) with vertices ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_7 ). We need to find the minimum number of additional points inside ( H ) such that any convex pentagon formed by any 5 of the 7 vertices has at least one interior point.4. Constructing Interior Points:   Let's place a point ( p_1 ) inside the heptagon ( H ). Draw a line through ( x_1 ) and ( p_1 ). One side of this line will contain at least 3 vertices of ( H ). These 3 vertices, along with ( x_1 ) and ( p_1 ), form a convex pentagon. According to the problem, there must be another point ( p_2 ) inside this pentagon.5. Iterating the Process:   Draw a line through ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ). One side of this line will again contain at least 3 vertices of ( H ). These 3 vertices, along with ( p_1 ) and ( p_2 ), form another convex pentagon, which must contain another point ( p_3 ).6. Generalizing the Process:   Let ( P_i ) be the half-plane defined by the line through ( p_j ) and ( p_k ) and not containing ( p_i ), for all permutations ( (i, j, k) = sigma(1, 2, 3) ). It is clear that one of ( P_1, P_2, P_3 ) contains 3 vertices of ( H ). These 3 vertices, along with ( p_2 ) and ( p_3 ), form a new pentagon which must contain a new point ( p_4 ).7. Counting the Points:   We started with 7 vertices of the heptagon and added 4 interior points ( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 ).

Suppose that the line connecting any two of the points A, B, C, D, E touches the sphere g. Tangents drawn from an external point to a sphere form a cone that touches the sphere in a circle. Thus, to each of the points A, B, C, D, E, a circle a, b, c, d, e can be associated on g. We will show that these circles touch each other pairwise.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_ae9a36517bac5902e057g-1.jpg?height=488&width=548&top_left_y=1041&top_left_x=775)For example, if the line AB touches g at point P, then P lies on both circles a and b (Figure 2). If there were another point Q different from P on both circles, then AQ and BQ would also be tangents, and AP = AQ and BP = BQ would hold, which contradicts the triangle inequality AP + BP = AB < AQ + QB. Therefore, any two of the circles a, b, c, d, e on the sphere g touch each other. Since the points of tangency of the circles lie on the line connecting the corresponding points, and any three of the points A, B, C, D, E are not collinear, the points of tangency of the circles are all distinct.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_ae9a36517bac5902e057g-1.jpg?height=426&width=420&top_left_y=1874&top_left_x=836)Let the points of tangency of circle a with the other four circles be denoted by E_b, E_c, E_d, and E_e.

Two of the circles b, c, d, and e can only touch if they lie in the same half-space determined by the plane of circle a. Therefore, all four circles lie in the same half-space.

First, all the elements in the set of all odd numbers {1,3, cdots, 99}, which are 50 in total, can be the numbers of the team members. Now we prove: it is impossible to increase further.

(1) Calculate the differences a_{51}-a_{1}, a_{51}- a_{2}, cdots, a_{51}-a_{50}, (2) which gives us 51+50=101 numbers. Since the numbers in (1) and (2) do not exceed the range of 1 sim 100, by the pigeonhole principle, there must be two numbers that are equal. However, the numbers in (1) are all distinct, and the numbers in (2) are also all distinct, so it can only be that a number a_{i} in (1) equals a number a_{51}-a_{j} in (2), giving a_{i}=a_{51}-a_{j}, which means a_{i}+a_{j}=a_{51}.

This is a quadratic function in terms of n, and its minimum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The vertex formula for a quadratic function ax^2 + bx + c is -frac{b}{2a}. Applying this to our function, we get n = -frac{16500}{2 times 1500} = -frac{16500}{3000} = -5.5.Since the number of years cannot be negative or a fraction, and considering the context of the problem, we need to find the closest integer value to -5.5, which would be either 5 or 6. However, since we are looking for the minimum average annual cost over the years, and the question implies finding the best year to scrap the car, we need to evaluate which of these years results in a lower average annual cost.

Assumption: Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists some ( n in mathbb{N} ) such that ( f(n) > n ).3. Induction: We will use induction to show that ( f^k(n) > f^{k-1}(n) ) for all ( k in mathbb{N} ).    - Base case: For ( k = 1 ), we have ( f^1(n) = f(n) ) and ( f^0(n) = n ). By assumption, ( f(n) > n ).   - Inductive step: Assume ( f^k(n) > f^{k-1}(n) ) for some ( k ). Then, ( f^{k+1}(n) = f(f^k(n)) ). By the given condition:     [     f(f^k(n)) leq frac{f^k(n) + f(f^k(n))}{2}     ]     Since ( f ) is injective and ( f^k(n) > f^{k-1}(n) ), it follows that ( f(f^k(n)) > f(f^{k-1}(n)) ).

By the induction step, ( a_k ) is strictly increasing.5. Boundedness and Discreteness: Since ( f ) maps ( mathbb{N} ) to ( mathbb{N} ), the sequence ( (a_k) ) is bounded and discrete. Therefore, there must exist ( k, l in mathbb{N} ) such that ( a_k = a_l ) with ( k neq l ).6. Injectivity Contradiction: By the injectivity of ( f ), if ( a_k = a_l ), then ( f^{k-l}(n) = n ). This implies that ( a_{k-l-1} = a_1 ), which contradicts the strict monotonicity of the sequence ( (a_k) ).7. Conclusion: Therefore, our assumption that ( f(n) > n ) must be false.

Solution by Laurent Lessard Put b n = a n + 2 nC1 a n-1 + 3 nC2 a n-2 + ... + n nC(n-1) a 1 . We calculate the first few terms: n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 a n 0 1 2 9 44 265 1854 14833 b n 0 1 8 43 234 1433 10072 80631 We notice that a n = n a n-1 + (-1) n . This is an almost trivial induction, once noticed. We next show that b n = n b n-1 + n 2 - n - 1. We have b n - n b n-1 = ∑ 0 n-2 (k+1) nCk a n-k - n(k+1) (n-1)C k a n- k-1 = ∑ (k+1) nCk (a n-k - (n-k) a n-k-1 ) = ∑ (k+1) nCk (-1) n-k . We have nC0 - nC1 x + nC2 x 2 - ... + (-1) n nCn x n = (1 - x) n , so nC0 x - nC1 x 2 + nC2 x 3 - ... + (-1) n nCn x n+1 = x(1 - x) n . Differentiating and setting x = 1 gives: nC0 - 2 nC1 + 3 nC2 - ... + (-1) n-2 (n-1) nC(n-2) + (-1) n-1 n nC(n-1) + (-1) n (n+1) nCn = 0. Hence nC0 - 2 nC1 + 3 nC2 - ... + (-1) n-2 (n-1) nC(n-2) = (-1) n (n 2 - n - 1). So, finally, b n - n b n-1 = n 2 - n - 1, as promised. If we put c n = b n + n + 1, then c 0 = 2 and c n = n c n . So by a trivial induction c n = 2 n! and hence b n = 2 n! - (n+1). Differentiation is outside the syllabus, but we can use k nCk = n (n-1)C(k-1) for k > 0. Thus we start with (n-1)C0 - (n-1)C1 + (n-1)C2 - ... (-1) n-1 (n-1)C(n-1) = 0. Multiplying by n gives nC1 - 2 nC2 + 3 nC3 - ... + (-1) n n nCn = 0. Subtracting from nC0 - nC1 + nC2 - ... = 0 gives nC0 - 2 nC1 + 3 nC2 - ... + (-1) n (n+1) nCn = 0, as required. Rob Pratt noticed that a n is the number of derangements of 1, 2, ... , n, in other words, the number of permutations of 1, 2, ... , n with no fixed points. That leads to an alternative solution based on calculating the average number of fixed points over all permutations. 15th Chinese 2000 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 5 June 2002"},{"problem":"2.

Therefore, we have:[-2k + 1 > 0 implies -2k > -1 implies k < frac{1}{2}.]Additionally, the term under the square root, 2k+1, must be non-negative to ensure that b=-sqrt{2k+1} is a real number. This gives us the inequality:[2k+1 geqslant 0 implies k geqslant -frac{1}{2}.]Combining these two conditions, we find that the range of k for which the equation has two distinct real roots is:[-frac{1}{2} leqslant k < frac{1}{2}.]However, we are also given that k neq 0 to avoid the trivial case where the equation degenerates and does not remain quadratic. Therefore, the final range of k that satisfies all conditions is:[-frac{1}{2} leqslant k < frac{1}{2}, text{ and } k neq 0.]Thus, the correct option is boxed{D}."},{"problem":"Given that R is the universal set, and A={x|(1-x)(x+2) leq 0}, then C_{R}A= ( )A: {x|x  1}B: {x|x leq -2 text{ or } x geq 1}C: {x|-2 < x < 1}D: {x|-2 leq x leq 1}","solution":"(1-x)(x+2) leq 0 Rightarrow (x-1)(x+2) geq 0 Rightarrow x geq 1 text{ or } x leq -2,Therefore, C_{R}A={x|-2 < x < 1}Hence, the correct option is boxed{C}."},{"problem":"5.
