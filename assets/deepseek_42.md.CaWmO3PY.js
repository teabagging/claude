Being compressed against hard ground caused it to get inflamed and thats why you feel it squishy. Treatment is rest, ice, and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (over the counter Ibuprofen 800 mg three times daily- always take these medicines with or after food). Do not take Ibuprofen if you have a history of kidney problems or have had bleeding from your gut or have severe reflux. In that case you can take Acetaminophen (Tylenol) 325-650 mg every 4-6 hours. No more than 3,000 mg of Tylenol should be taken in a 24 hour period.

My name is Toni and I was wondering if a referral to a rheumatologist would be the best thing for me. I take Cymbalta for unknown nerve pain causes in hands arms legs feet, back and neck pain, and I would say tendon problems. also depression which I think was cause from the pain being untreated and facing the unknown future of my heath. after about 6 weeks of being on this I started to mostly feel like my self again so I start doing more housework like I used to be able to do over 5 months ago. little to be known I star having hip and shoulder pain and I would say is a 4 or 5 on the pain scale. I was told by one doctor I have RLS and was put on 50mg ?tramazone? for this originally. then had to be uped to 100mg because it was not affective. new doctor says that not even what that is for and now I have recently just started on Requip for that. my vitamin d level was 15.8 a few months ago and the norm is about 30 from what I hear so I take 5000 iu a day for that. I have only had blood test done. Also emg came back great. although no x-rays no cat scans, no MRI have been done. I don t know what all auto immune disorders I have been tested for but those came back fine. normal blood work ok along with vitamin d, Iron test are in the process. I m pretty frustrated at this point and really want some answers. my new doctor is really nice and seems to care. I just feel its time to see a specialist and want to know what you think about that, what kind of specialist, how to approach my doctor with this? Please help :-(","Doctor":"Hi, from what you have said it appears that you have tried at least 3 different medicines (Cymbalta, Trazodone and Requip) but still have pain in multiple joints. Normal tests are reassuring. The one thing I did not see in there was physical therapy- if you have not done that I would recommend discussing with your primary doctor about that. Its also possible that you may have an underlying depression contributing to your symptoms (since they improved with Cymbalta, an antidepressant). So, it might be worth discussing with your doctor about behavioral therapy or seeing a psychiatrist to determine if depression is contributing to your physical symptoms. Pool therapy (swimming/water exercises) are often very helpful too. I do not feel strongly about seeing a specialist, I would suggest discussing your frustrations with your primary doctor and the things I discussed above and work with him/her. But if you feel your concerns are not being addressed, you can always seek a second opinion from a different primary care physician."},{"Patient":"I am very concerned.

The pain radiates into my ribs and down into my hip. I have scoliosis which was detected recently. Did not have it as a child or at all until now. My rib is protruding and obvious to the sight. I had a rotator cuff surgery two years ago which included a major surgery with five anchors. My tail bone hurts now from a fall I took a month ago. The x-ray showed in my spine at that time of the fall that I had two compression fractures that were old. I did not know I had them. I can t sleep and the pain is horrible .","Doctor":"Your lower back pain could be related to the compression fractures or from local inflammation that developed late. There are a few options for managing this pain1. I would recommend a repeat Xray of the spine to exclude any changes in the bones since the original fall (since the last Xray was one month back its possible things have changed since then)2. Physical therapy is often very helpful and can be tried3. In terms of medications, you could try Acetaminophen (Tylenol) 325-650 mg every 4-6 hours as needed. Do not take more than 3,000 mg of Acetaminophen over a 24 hour period. You can also try Ibuprofen (400-800 mg three times a day with food)- it has an anti inflammatory effect. Do not take Ibuprofen if you have a history of chronic kidney disease, bleeding from your gut or severe reflux.Since the Xray will need to be ordered and interpreted by a physician, I recommend you see your primary care doctor too."},{"Patient":"For a few years, I have experienced increasing numbness in my toes and legs, meaning the numbness is creeping upward.

Here are my recommendations1. Diabetes is a cause of peripheral neuropathy. Since you do not have diabetes, other possibilities need to be examined including deficiency of other vitamins like vitamin B12. Other less common conditions include rheumatologic (i.e. immune system related) conditions. The diagnosis of B12 deficiency can be made with a blood test while that of rheumatologic conditions requires examination by a doctor and blood tests and Xrays. 2. Sometimes specialized tests like \\"nerve conduction studies\\" and \\"electromyograms\\" may be needed to determine the cause of these symptoms. These tests are usually ordered and interpreted by a Neurologist3. I would recommend that you see a neurologist as these tests are specialized tests that would need to be ordered and interpreted by a physician. Please let me know if that was helpful.

Maybe its just muscular pain but I would like to be sure its not a clot- this can be easily excluded by an ultrasound of the veins in the leg.

The probable causes of pain can be inflammation of the calf-muscle-tendon, contusion/spasm of the calf muscle, underlying incompetent veins or, Vitamin B12 deficiency. Get a Doppler study to assess blood flow in the calf muscles veins. An X-ray of the heel bone will show if there is a partial detachment of the tendon.

I asked why this was and the plastic surgeon told me that if they were to have tried to remove the excess tissue they would have had to have made a large incision. The only reason I wanted this surgery done was because of the size of my nipples, the circumference was not necessarily big, but they were reasonably puffy.

I can now bend it, but it is still tender to touch & it is blindingly painful if I kneel. I have no problem at all putting weight on it though. The fall was a week ago. My husband is pestering me to get it checked, but I'm not sure I need to. Should I see a doctor?  There is no heat, numbness, change in sensation or colour (apart from bruising), I don't know if my knee feels any different as it is too painful to palpate. I'm guessing it's just bruising that is causing the pain on kneeling, as anything more would mean pain on weight bearing.","Doctor":"Hi there, Thanks for your query. You have apparently sustained sprain of the ligaments (which provide stability to the joint). However, you should certainly get an X-ray done to rule out any injury to the joint capsule or, fracture of the knee-bone (called Patella). A 5-7 days' course of anti-inflammatory pain-killers, such as a combination of ibuprofen + Paracetamol; cold compresses and use of a crepe bandage will aid in healing the ligaments.

I iced it and the blood clot seems to be hard now and still bruised and raised.  My thumb is also swelling and numb.  I took ibuprofen for the pain.","Doctor":"Hi there, Thanks for your query. Injury to the blood has caused bleeding and collection of blood (called Hematoma) under the skin. Pain and numbness of the hand is due to compression over the nerves by the Hematoma, while swelling of the thumb is due to compression over the thumb vein. No treatment is required for the hematoma, which will take at least 2-3 weeks to disappear, once the entire clotted blood is re-absorbed. However, continue with warm compresses and, ibuprofen- an anti-inflammatory drug- thrice a day for 3-5 days, which will reduce swelling to some extent and also curb the pain.

Although the most severe pain down my right leg has gone I seem to be left with varying symptoms that I would like to control without pain killers. Lifting anything like shopping from the car or bending to vacuum seems to trigger an ache in my lower back about the syatic area. This rapidly turns into weakness and I have to sit down to relieve it. Also walking any distance leads to weakness in my legs and they start to shake. I also have a general fatigue a lot of the time .. some days I need to go back to bed because I can t stay awake. I am walking about 500mtrs to and from work three times a week and feel this is building up my leg and back mussels again. I am also having a remedial massage once a week to loosen any knots. Most days my back becomes weaker towards the end of the day and I can t stand for more than a few minutes at a time. Sometimes I get a heaviness in my legs.

The possible causes of persisting and aggravated pain following surgery are- potential injury to the nerves during surgery, persisting 'pinching' of the nerves and, inflammatory reaction of the nerves due to surgery.

I ow take 1 or 2 Oxycodone to manage pain from these incidents.","Doctor":"Oxycodone is only meant to be used for a few weeks at a time; using it for longer periods of time can cause serious health problems such as:    High levels of drug tolerance. Oxycodone is physically addicting, which means that your body needs higher amounts of the drug over time in order to experience the same effects. Thus, if you use Oxycodone for a long period of time, you’ll need higher doses of it, which puts you at greater risk for respiratory failure. Respiratory distress. Since Oxycodone works by slowing down the respiratory and central nervous systems, you may experience respiratory distress if you take it for a long period of time or take higher doses of the drug. Symptoms of respiratory distress include difficulty breathing, lightheadedness and dizziness from lack of oxygen.    Physical dependence. After taking Oxycodone for a long period of time, users develop a physical need for the drug in order to function appropriately. Long-term Oxycodone users may feel physically ill if they don’t take the drug.The long-term effects of Oxycodone use are increased physical illness and risk of death."},{"Patient":"Yes hello, i was recently discarded from my pain clinic due to them going thru so many doctors in such a short time approximately 6 or 7 in 5 months time and of course with that many theres going to be many characteristics and personalities of doctors and well the truth of what happened is, they were leaving at noon on my appointment day, i was weighed, an which if i have a urine analysis im always given it after im weighed, that day i wasnt because i wsnt due for another 2 months as i get one every 3 months.

I wasn't able to schedule an appointment to get a physical from my primary care physician on such short notice, and I have something that I'm a little nervous about. I had completely forgotten about it until a little over a week ago, but I have two small warts on my penis which I've had for maybe a couple years. I'm pretty certain that they are not genital warts because I haven't had any sexual relations/contact with another person since 2003, and the person I had sex with didn't have any sexual relations prior to our intercourse -- the other things that make me think that they are genital warts (in the strict sense) is because I used to have warts on my fingers in probably about 10 places, and as far as I can tell they were just Verruca Vulgaris warts, and they eventually went away after a couple years, but during the time that I had them on my hands, I used to masturbate a lot. The other indication that I get that these are just common warts that got transmitted to my penis from my hands are that the location of these two warts on my penis are from where my left hand would make contact and rub my penis -- the reason that I think that they got transmitted from that are because a couple years ago, I went through a phase where I was masturbating so much, it actually made my penis sore and started to irritate and sort of break the skin. So I'm not surprised that this has happened. They haven't gone away yet, so I'm trying to wait it out and be patient, but my real question is this: With my getting married this weekend (my fiance and I have been waiting until we're married to actually have intercourse), I don't know what my stance on this should be, and I haven't talked to her about it yet. I'm hoping that if need be, we'll just have to use condoms until these go away -- but for all I know, maybe there's no real risk of things like cancer or contamination if we choose to have intercourse without a condom...but I don't want my own impatience with having to use a condom for a time to cause my soon-to-be-wife to get a wart infection from me, and possible health complications from it. To also give you a couple other details, I have been trying to treat the warts by first taking 200 mg of CoQ10 capsules every day for almost a week now (along with my other vitamins, which are a multivitamin, ginseng, gingko biloba, 2x1000 mg fish oil capsules, and a hair, skin & nails supplemental vitamin), and I've been applying a topical acne treatment containing 2% salicylic acid and T36-C5 Melaleuca tea tree oil about 3 times a day. Anyway, to restate my question in another way, are there any short term and/or long term risks if we have sex without a condom with these two small common warts on my penis (also, to clarify where they are, the one is on the left side of the penis on the edge/rim of the bottom of the head, before where the shaft starts, and the other is on the left side of the underside of the shaft, not too far away from the other wart)? I was wondering if there would be any general risks if I were to insert a finger into my wife's vagina if I had a wart on it as well -- I can't imagine there would be any difference between if it was a finger or a penis being inserted if it has a common wart on it...but I just want to know what risks there are and what we should do. Needless to say, I'll be going to my doctor ASAP to have them take care of this.","Doctor":"Hello, Consult a dermatologist and get evaluated. You can opt for cauterisation or cryosurgery.

No rash or discharge, just terrible skin burning. Since then, it has come and gone, but always been slightly present. Sometimes, however, it becomes intolerable. I have been tested for all STDs several times, prostatitis and herpes four times - always with negative results. In fact, the most recent herpes blood test was done in December 2010, with negative results for both HSV1 and HSV2. I have also visited a urologist who did no tests and told me it was probably not a urology problem. A neurologist did some minor tests but found nothing. There are no marks, no lesions, no spots, no discharge, no bumps or anything other than an incredibly painful penis and testicles. Occasionally it \\"feels\\" like there are cuts or tears, but there has never actually been any. Sometimes, when I am standing it feels a little less painful.

If sperms from a recent ejaculate are on some toys or other objects & these are inserted into the vagina, pregnancy can occur if the sperms are still alive.

Placenta is anterior (It is attached to front wall of uterus & it is not low lying( It is in safe place- so no risk of placenta previa- causing risk in delivery )   3.

Your OB doctor is right to want you to repeat the ultra-sound scan sooner than the original due date. To wait longer would decrease the ability of the placenta to supply adequate nutrients to the fetus. Your description of the baby sounds like he/she is doing fine in your womb.

It’s normal for the placenta to be low in the uterus in early pregnancy.As the pregnancy continues and the uterus stretches, the placenta typically moves to the top of the uterus.

My blood test are normal, and my doctor is not sending me for more testing, however I am very worried. Do I need to do more ultrasound or Amniotic test?","Doctor":"Hello,Suggestive of choroid plexus cysts of the fetal brain. Advised further evaluation. The brain contains pockets or spaces called ventricles with a spongy layer of cells and blood vessels called the choroid plexus. It is in the middle of the fetal brain.Choroid plexus cysts are present in one to two percent of normal fetuses. In the vast majority of cases, the cysts resolve or disappear and have no consequences. However, in a very small percentage of fetuses with choroid plexus cysts, there is an associated chromosome disorder called trisomy 18. Fetuses with trisomy 18 have an extra copy of chromosome, 18 and most of the time they are stillborn. So, in view of the above, I advise you to consult your doctor for further evaluation and to undergo certain tests such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test, Targeted Imaging for Fetal Anomalies (TIFFA) scan or amniocentesis to be done to rule out the chance of trisomy 18 or Down syndrome.Hope I have answered your query.

Your ultrasound report says that your baby's weight is 3 kgs which is a normal healthy weight. A grade 3 placenta at 39 week of pregnancy is normal. The only problem that I see in this ultrasound is that there are two loops of cord around baby's neck. Since the baby keeps on moving inside the uterus, it's more likely that the problem will resolve on itself but it can even get complicated. So I would advice you to be on bed rest and notice the baby movements inside your uterus. If you sense any decrease in movements you immediately go see your gynecologist. In such a case you would have to go through a C-section. Wish you all the good luck. Hope my answer was helpful.

I had been training all summer and had previously run 2 marathons and four 1/2 marathons.  One day, I could only run 3 miles due to lower abdominal pain.  I thought I had a strained hip flexor from weight room work and received physical therapy for it.  It had been tight.  I did manage to survive the 1/2 marathon but it was painful- both the hip flexor and the lower ab pain.  I waited a week and tried jogging 3-4 miles and still the lower ab pain- mostly on the left side.  3 weeks later I was in the hospital with a 3mm. kidney stone on the left side.  They said I also had 3 small ones on the right side.  This was after a CT Scan.    After 36 hours the pain went away and I was dismissed.  I waited 2 weeks and tried running.  I finished 3 miles, but again lower ab pain (just above or beside groin) on the left and middle.  I had testicular cancer 11 years ago (left testicle removed plus 6 weeks of radiation).  I am 60 years old, am 5' 11\\" tall, weigh 165 and run 4-5 miles daily or did until the past 2 months.  Blood tests 3 days after getting out of the hospital were normal and the urine showed just 1-2 red cells.  I was in the hospital 1:30 A.M. on a Sat. morning until noon on Sunday.  I went back to work on the following Monday and feel fine, except for running.  I do not know if there is still a stone that hasn't passed causing the lower left ab pain when running or some inflammation??  I have taken some antiinflammatory meds but that doesn't seem to help much.    I can run through it for 3-4 miles so it's not extreme.  I'd like to get back to my regular training, but it's been 2 months with the lower ab just above the grouin pain in the middle and on the left.

I reviewed your query and here is advise.I think you are suffering from reflux.  During pregnancy, hormone changes can allow the muscles in the esophagus, including the LES, to relax more frequently.The following tips may help relieve your heartburn:*Eat smaller meals more frequently and don't drink water when eating. *Eat slowly and chew every bite thoroughly.*Avoid eating a few hours before bed.*Avoid foods and beverages that trigger your heartburn. Typical culprits include chocolate, fatty foods, spicy foods, acidic foods like citrus fruits and tomato-based items, carbonated beverages, and caffeine.*Stay upright for at least one hour after a meal. A leisurely walk may also encourage digestion.*Wear comfortable rather than tight-fitting clothing.*Maintain a healthy weight.*Use pillows or wedges to elevate your upper body while sleeping.*Sleep on your left side. Lying on your right side will position your stomach higher than your esophagus, which may lead to heartburn.*Chew a piece of sugarless gum after meals. The increased saliva may neutralize any acid coming back up into the esophagus.*Eat yogurt or drink a glass of milk to quell symptoms once they start.*Drink some honey in chamomile tea or a glass of warm milk.Hope I have answered the question.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.You didn't mention the date when you got positive urine pregnancy test.In case of regular 28 to 30 days menstrual cycles, urine pregnancy test can give positive result in around one week after missed period. But as your test gave negative result even after one month 21 days, the possibility of last menstrual date being March 4th is somewhat less. But sometimes urine pregnancy test kits can give false negative results. So, now the better option is going for ultrasound. First trimester ultrasound can help not only in confirmation of pregnancy and also in estimation of gestational age accurately.Hope I have answered your query, and I will be happy to answer any further follow ups.Take care."},{"Patient":"pregnant woman 34 weeks pregnant, she is not feeling any movement from the fetus in approximately 2 hours.

Usually absence  of menstrual periods for around 12 months without any medical or iatrogrnic causes can be considered as menopause. Though your fsh levels are elevated that alone cannot be taken as conformative evidence of Menopause,  as sometimes in perimenopausal stage also fsh levels can be elevated and also hormonal supplements can alter the levels.So, better to recheck the levels of FSH before the due date of Mirena, if levels are persistently high and endometrial thickness in ultrasound is less than or equal to 4mm, there is possibility of of nearing menopause.In that case you can wait and observe your menstrual cycles for two to three months , if you are not getting menstrual periods, no need of Mirena.But till that better to use barrier contraception like condoms to be on safe side.Hope I have answered your query and I will be happy to answer any further queries.Take care."},{"Patient":"Had an ultrasound on 11 may 2018.

Dermoid cysts are usually called as ovarian teratomas. According to studies, around 98% of dermoid cysts are benign. But your gynecologist may not want leave any chance of risk. As ovary containing dermoid cyst is being removed, that side fallopian tube may also need to be removed as that will be very near and sometimes attached to ovary. Omentectomy is removing some part of omentum near the affected ovary. So that by doing histopathological examination(HPE)  of all these tissues the possibility of malignancy is ruled out.

I'm just wondering if it was implantation bleeding on the 25th would I b taking the test to early?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. In case of regular 33 days cycle you can expect ovulation around 19th day,  so if conception occurred around that day you can expect implantation bleeding from one week to 10 days after.  According to this if implantation bleeding occurred it might have occurred around ending of December or beginning of January. If your periods are irregular we can't rule out the possibility of implantation bleeding on 25th January as you mentioned.  But as both times urine pregnancy tests gave  negative results the possibility of pregnancy is appearing less. If you are still having symptoms,  better to get evaluated to rule out the possibility of pregnancy. For that you can go for either ultrasound which will help in ruling the out the possibility of pregnancy and also in finding the other possible causes for delay in periods,  or you can go for blood test for pregnancy that is estimation of Beta HCG levels.  If  the level is less than 5 Milli International units per ml the possibility of pregnancy is almost ruled out. Hope I have answered your query I will be happy to answer any further follow queries.

I'm really scared I'm pregnant please help","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. According to your description if there is spermatozoa on his finger  the possibility of pregnancy cannot be ruled out.But only the symptoms of pregnancy start around one week after intercourse that is around the time of implantation. So, the dizziness you had on next day could be due to anxiety or some other causes.As you took emergency contraceptive pill within 12 hours can expect around 95% of protection rate.The thick vaginal discharge,  sore nipples etc you are having could be due to the side effects of high dose of hormone in emergency contraceptive pill.Usually after taking emergency contraceptive pill you will get withdrawal bleeding in 7 to 10 days.  If you do not get withdrawal bleeding and also  if you miss your expected date of periods better to go for urine pregnancy test once  to rule out the possibility. Hope I have answered your query and I will be happy to answer any further follow queries.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. As long as implanon is in place it will give full protection so as your implanon had expiry date till 16th you might have got protection till the date.

The symptoms you are having could be side effects of Nuvaring and it may take some time for them to subside even after removal.As urine pregnancy test can give false results sometimes as your clinic people told, if you want to be sure better to go for blood test for pregnancy that is estimation of Beta HCG levels in blood. If  the test gives beta HCG levels less than 5 Milli International units per ml the possibility of pregnancy is almost ruled out.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Usually normal amniotic fluid levels are considered  between 10 to 15. With gradual progression of gestational age some  reduction of amniotic fluid can be seen. But usually amniotic fluid level should be at upper normal level in around 28 weeks. The possible causes of decreased amniotic fluid are uteroplacental insufficiency rarely fetal anomalies etc. So, you can follow your doctor's advice. Once your amniotic fluid levels increases above 10, you can continue with oral amnioacid acid supplementation.

So, your nurse might have told that your progesterone levels are increased but not up to the mark for pregnancy and your pregnancy test is negative.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Weak positive line can be seen in case of early pregnancy, but sometimes Urine Pregnancy Test kit can also give false positive results. Serum beta hCG levels about 25 mIU/mL is confirmative of pregnancy whereas between 5 and 25 mIU/mL, is inclusive. So, now what you can do is you please repeat beta hCG levels because usually in case of normal pregnancy the beta hCG levels will double in 2 days during early pregnancy period. In repeat test if the beta hCG levels are not rising as expected the possibility of the pregnancy is less and miscarriage should be ruled out by ultrasound.

I never have been. On January 1st, I had unprotected sex with a guy named Josh, who I have no relations with at all. It was a mistake on my part that I wish I could take back. About 14 hours later after the unprotected sex, I took the morning after pill. A few days later on January 4th, I had unprotected sex with Rich, who I am actually involved with. I did not take plan b again because I was okay with getting pregnant with him if it did happen. Then on the days January 11th, 18th, 24th, and 25th we had unprotected sex again. My period was supposed to be due on January 24th, so I took a pregnancy test on January 25th and it came out negative. So I assumed my period was just late. However, I started experiencing increased appetite, sore breasts, and a lot of fatigue. 10 days later on February 3rd, I took another pregnancy test and it came out positive, however the line was very faint. I took two more tests in the next couple days and they came out positive as well. I guess my concern is, I m worried who the father is. Obviously I would like it to be Rich s, because we are actually involved and I do not know Josh hardly at all. What are the chances it could be Josh s or Rich s?

Plus you practiced intercourse with Josh only once and you took your morning pill and it’s far from your ovulation time and life span of sperms usually 7 days only AND yes you can check by test the paternity it’s called CFF-DNA which is a blood test.

Regarding the discharge its probably not related to pregnancy, it is rather nonspecific it can be normal (specially if clear and without other symptoms), or can be an infection specially if curdy and if associated with itching or burning.

I'm circumcised and generally in good health. I weigh 10stone (65kg). Recently I had a little scare that perhaps I was developing penile thrush after a \\"near miss\\" of unprotected sex. I then bought thrush cream over the counter and loaded it heavily on myself. After more than 2wks I noticed that what I thought was ?developing thrush is something that has ever been there as it doesn't seem to change with time. I've been keeping a very close eye on it and its now over 2months since the incident but still the suspect part of my penis is looking the same. But now my concern is that I have recently noticed flaking on my glans. It’s just a small area, about 30% of the whole glans. On closer examination it appears like the area is keratinised. I'm not sure whether it’s because of my conditioned of circumcision, or I overused thrush cream more than a month ago, or it’s something needing urgent medical care. Otherwise all other things are normal. I've not developed any sores, or pain when passing urine. All is normal except for this flaking. If it wasn't for the near miss experience I will dismiss this flaking as keratinized glans. But I've never experienced flaking before. I've been circumcised for 10yrs now.

It would easily be evaluated with a blood test to measure HCG levels (which should be rising in a predictable manner) and with an ultrasound (to make sure the pregnancy is normal, and in the uterus). The least likely cause of bleeding in early pregnancy is an ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy in the tube). It is important to rule out in this process. Please call your doctor to be evaluated.Hope I have answered your query.

You are right in thinking that ovaries are important in future childbearing. As your girlfriend had to get her one-sided ovary removed, her remaining ovary needs close attention.She needs to know what kinds of cysts are getting formed on her remaining ovary. If it is some functional cysts or pathological cysts, future treatment should be directed with the aim of preserving the ovary. Instead of removing the ovary cystectomy should be done if the pathology permits.Removal of the remaining ovary will not only affect her fertility but also will lead to surgical menopause and it's subsequent effects on the female body.With both the ovaries removed the chance of her getting pregnant naturally is totally nil.

In fact around 13-14 days after 29th july, i.e. around mid august, fertilization and conception would have occurred.Your 30th sept scan shows 7 wks 6 days i.e. around 2 months, which means lmp is around 2nd august and your due date accordingly would be around 9th may next year.Again your 31st october scan also corresponds ,showing 12 wks 3 day preg i.e around 3 months.(lmp around 4th aug).So you can be pretty sure that you have conceived in mid august and will be due around 9th may next year."},{"Patient":"hello sir i m rishi wardhan ,male ,age 22 , india, persuing engineering  sir in 2005 i come in practice with mastribution which result in weight lose , my face had changed , i look very bad, eyes goes into socket ,i had contact a physician and i had use his medicine but yet no change i had found today i m also so hapty my weight is 45kg ,height 5.2feet my sperm is fade no dense now i had leave such practice from 2008 sir every body tease me please sir help me so that till 2011 by face become good with charming plz contact me on my e-mail  YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hello, You may be suffering from malnutrition with anxiety disorder.

Your treating doctor has rightly suggested you to take Folic acid supplementation. It's useful for the growth and development of the early pregnancy.It helps to prevent neural development defects and promotes healthy new cell development.As such there is no harm if you have missed out on Folic acid supplementation. In my opinion you can very well start it again. Any folic acid supplementation containing 5 mg of the vitamin can be continued during pregnancy.In later part of pregnancy it helps in red blood cells and hemoglobin formation. It is also known to decrease various complications during pregnancy and delivery.Please also opt for a healthy diet and regular exercise regimen.

Your concern about detection of heroin in urine and subsequent consequences about baby's care taking are absolutely right.In my opinion, once you stop taking heroin  actively, it takes 3 to 5 days to clear it from urine. After 10 days it is definitely out of your body systems and is not detected in the urine. So if you continue with the abstinence and your current line of treatment, it shouldn't be a problem.Please seek support from your counsellor regularly.

Thank you","Doctor":"Hi there, I have understood your concern and I will suggest you the best possible treatment options.First of all do not panic.As you might be aware that, for pregnancy to occur, spillage of semen in and around the vagina must be there. As per your history, there was no spillage of semen, hence chances of pregnancy are almost nil.If you are having doubt about pregnancy then I will suggest you to get pregnancy test gone at least 20 days after your last sexual activity. You can confirm the pregnancy by checking for beta HCG hormone levels in the morning's first sample of urine or in the blood test.  Still you have any doubt  then USG will be of help.Secondly, as you might be knowing that in a woman with regular cycle, day 10 to 20 of the cycle is the most fertile period of the cycle. If you happen to have unprotected sex activity in this period, then only there is chance to get pregnant.I will suggest you to get proper sex counseling done, about safe and protected sex activity,  this will help to prevent unwanted pregnancy and STDs.I hope this answer helps you.Thanks.Dr. Purushottam Neurgaonkar"},{"Patient":"I have just completed my first trimester screening test.

After 14 weeks of pregnancy,a simple hanging drop microscopy examination can be done to know about presence of bacterial vaginosis. If present, a week long course of Metronidazole tablets 3 times a day will be good enough.Basic idea of PAP smear during pregnancy is to know if there are any changes at cellular level that can be potentially harmful as far as cervical cancer is concerned. If there is report of mild, moderate or severe dysplasia or SIL- Squamous Intra epithelial Lesion then calposcopy is highly recommended.VIA - Visual examination of cervix with Acetic acid, is one simple OPD bases test that can give idea about suspicious pathology and can be used as screening test to go ahead for calposcopy. Calposcopy  helps to know about changes in the cellular pattern and blood vessels appearance, that can be pre cancerous.

I had to undergo circumcision due to congenital phimosis in june this year. A \\"Shang Ring\\" was placed on the cut line after the surgery and thus stitches were not needed.

Miprogen contains micronized progesterone. It is used when there is a deficiency of natural progesterone. It is needed to sustain the pregnancy until the placenta takes over the function of producing progesterone between 12-14 weeks. It is safe to use during pregnancy as no adverse effects have been reported. 2. Emeset contains Ondansetron. It is a category B drug according to the FDA, which means there are no adequate clinical trials and animal studies have not shown any significant effects. Therefore, the benefits outweigh the risks.

Symptomatic treatment is enough. In your case you have to avoid NSAIDs during pregnancy, hence you can take paracetamol 500 mg 2 tablets every 6 hours as needed for sore throat only. Anticholinergic spray like ipratropium can be taken in your case to help with nasal congestion however you shouldnt take any medication with pseudo-ephedrine because they are associated with malformations in pregnancy especially during the first trimester.2-regarding the feeling that you will stop breathing there are two main factors for it : 1- your tonsils are enlarged making your airway narrow 2- your nasal discharge can go backwards and these secretions can block you airway, taking anticholinergic nasal spary in addition to elevation of the head during sleep will help remarkably in this symtomsI want to reassure you that this is not a serious medical condition and it is most likely self limited.Best regards"},{"Patient":"I am 24 year old male and was taking marijuana regularly for 4 years. now that i have quit completely for over a week and a half, i am having blood in my semen (3 times consecutively with no pain and no blood in urine). is it related to quitting marijuana or hot weather (Climate change) or excessive smoking or any other reason??","Doctor":"Hello, It has got no relation to marijuana.

In the current scenario, your symptoms are more likely to be due to the hormone disturbance associated with the miscarriage and also the progesterone injection administered. If the embryo is not viable or sometimes when there is a threatened abortion, progesterone is better not given. Before you plan for another pregnancy, I suggest that you undergo proper appraisal of your hormone status and correct any deficiencies. You may need another sonogram of the pelvis to clarify. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi.I am 31 weeks pregnant and two days ago, I realised that my vagina started itching and there s this brownish, dirt like things coming out when I wipe.

If she doesnt then a rescue cervical cerclage can be done for prolongation of the pregnancy.3- urine infection must be rule out since it might be the reason for the cramping sensation. urine analysis and culture must be done.4- For the future pregnancies am early cerclage at around the timing for nuchal translucency can be done.

In the current scenario, the chances of conception are very low because you had the intercourse during the safe period.

The fact that you are experiencing altered menstrual pattern suggests hormone imbalance. The thin endometrium supports this. Bowel movement can be felt as fetal movement through a thin abdominal wall. Also, when you wish for a pregnancy very badly, you may develop 'pseudocyesis,' where you tend to experience all symptoms of pregnancy.

There are no reported teratogenic effects of the use of Daflon during pregnancy in animal studies. Thus, you can use the medication if strictly needed for the treatment of hemorrhoids.

I understand your concern  -  Mostly expected date of delivery  is conventinally calculated by adding 9 months & 8days to the 1st day of last menstruation .    Still no body can definately predict about exact date of delivery. .. So it can be  plus or minus 8 days from The calculated date.   -Some people believe it to be  40 weeks from last menstrual date. Here also it stands variation of  1 week more or less .    -babies off pregnancy diabetes women tend to be overweight... that is why the error in calculation.

If negative, take some medicines like meprate or deviry for inducing periods. Also  do some blood tests like thyroid profile and prolactin level and a ultrasound done to see uterus and ovaries. Also do a AMH level to see the number of Antral follicles in ovaries.  If everything is fine, it can happen due to stress factor sometimes. You can try naturally for 6 months. Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  It will increase chance of pregnancy.

If it is normal, she is having hypermedia gravidarrum.  It will resolve by 3 months. She will be on medicines like doxylamine, pyridoxine.  She can take some anti-emetic like ondansteron. If it is excessive, injection will be needed.  Tell her to take fluids in little amount at frequent intervals.

Get a thyroid profile and prolactin levels and a ultrasound for your uterus and ovaries done.  Also track your ovulation by repeated ultrasound or ovulation detection kits.  If ovulation is happening, then you can try naturally.  Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  It will increase chances of your pregnancy.  If it doesn't work, then you can go for ovulation induction with timed intercourse.  Talk to your doctor regarding this."},{"Patient":"Ive been have signs of being pregnant.

Yes it is too early to think of pregnancy. Premenstrual symptoms can mimics early pregnancy symptoms. One sign of pregnancy is a missed period. If you have missed your period, take a home pregnancy test.

Thyroid abnormalities, stress, sudden weight changes, major lifestyle changes, illness, travel across time zones can all cause delayed periods.

Since you could be in the perimenopause stage, irregular periods do happen, more so since you have discontinued the pill.

For a better clarification, you can get the blood test as well as a trans-vaginal sonogram a week after the missed period.

I was scared please help me","Doctor":"in very early pregnancy bleeding is more commonly due to pregnancy itself.now if at 6 weeks no heartbeats than there is chance that this pregnancy will not survive more and ultimately abortion will happen. but sometimes pregnancy survives and go up to full term with absolutely normal delivery. so we don't have choice other than to wait and take best possible support for pregnancy in terms of oral medications and injections and bed rest. which must be prescribed by your doctors. so wait continue medications and strictly follow the instruction of your doctors.in case bleeding is very heavy than you have to consult doctor immediately. or ideally you should get admitted if any bleeding in early pregnancy and complete rest at hospital with all medication. because complete rest is not possible at home practically."},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, My name is gopinath.

Since your wife is pregnant now, if you do not wish to continue the pregnancy, the only option to start her periods, is by terminating the pregnancy.

Before taking these medicines, it is extremely important to confirm that the pregnancy is within the uterus and and your wife does not have contraindications for these medicines.  Therefore you need to consult doctor for the same. If your wife is scared of the pain, she can have a small surgical procedure under anaesthetia to abort the pregnancy. I hope this is helpful.

Your symptoms and the rising enzyme levels suggest that you are experiencing obstetric cholestasis. The exact cause should be detected through proper clinical evaluation and the fetal well being should be carefully monitored because with such high levels, still birth or premature birth can occur. Fatty liver or gall stones can cause such rise. Liver function should be properly assessed through other tests as well. Ursodeoxycholic acid is used to manage. Usually, delivery is advisable at 37 weeks as soon as the baby is mature. If early intervention is planned, steroid injections should be given to enhance fetal lung maturity. Hope this helps.

I didn t take this very seriously until it continued. I then decided to take a pregnancy test where I discovered I was 3-4 weeks pregnant. The next evening I was in bed asleep and woke up with excoriating pains almost biting through my arm unsure of the situation my partner rushed me to hospital. I was in so much pain I thought I was about to die. It was at that moment I was told it may be an ectopic pregnancy and that I would have to be rushed into surgery. 1am surely this could not happen ? Well it didn t I was given all the pain medication and taken to a room where I would sleep and in the morning I would go get checked. By the time morning came I felt almost better I could walk again I was feeling fine - I had the scan and the doctor picked up that I had a 5cm cyst on my right ovary but thought that I wasn t in as much pain to have an ectopic. My pregnancy was still very early and so my readings were very low and unable to show any signs of a baby how ever there was a concern. The next day I went in for what I thought would be a DNC and came out completely shocked that I had double trouble a cyst on my right ovary and a ruptured ectopic pregnancy on my left Fallopian tube. Both removed. it was also very much of a shock that I was 8 weeks pregnant and not 2-3 weeks like everyone had thought. My question is what are my chances of ever having another ectopic pregnancy because I am so nervous to ever try again one day in the fear that I will go through this again. I am so scared that I am not worthy of myself if I cannot have children and I will feel as if I m letting my partner down too.","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. It is very unfortunate that your pregnancy terminated with an ectopic. The risk of another ectopic pregnancy increases 20 times with a history of one ectopic. In other words, 1 out of 10 women can have a recurrence. If there are two or more ectopic pregnancies in the past, this risk becomes 50 %. However, normal pregnancies can happen in about 60 percent. Thus, I would suggest going for another pregnancy after sufficient gap and monitoring the pregnancy very carefully right from the early days. Serial serum beta-hCG titres are recommended and if there is an abnormal increase, an ectopic can be suspected. This, combined with serial sonograms can help in he diagnosis in addition to the detection of the early symptoms as you are already experienced.

Firstly, I would like to suggest that you confirm where from this blood is coming, from the urethra or from the vagina. If it is from the urethra and if this is a fresh bleeding, it is likely to be from the urethral lining, mostly due to some infection. This needs to be treated as it can lead to a miscarriage if left untreated. If the blood is coming out of the vagina, you should inform your health care provider immediately, take absolute bed rest and avoid all strenuous activity. A sonogram should be taken to note the state of the pregnancy. Further management is accordingly planned. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi,I had two miss marriages after 9 years of my first baby.reason un known.Now again conceived ..but dont know..what medicine should I take..except folic acid and duphaston..I dont know if I have issues with thyroid..need to know.which medicine should I take...","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for trusting us with your health concern. I would ask you in the current scenario to see a specialist in high risk pregnancy immediately for a proper assessment and plan further management. Since you had two abortions, without a known cause, it becomes even more necessary that this pregnancy is well taken care of. There is no place for self medication. you should get routine blood counts, urinalysis, a trans-vaginal sonogram, thyroid profile, blood sugar level and TORCH titres. Further management can be planned accordingly.

When you say you had a pregnancy( irrespective of the outcome) it means you stand a very good chance of pregnancy again.

You can wait for another week for the periods. If it occurs , fine. If no periods , just pregnancy test again- if negative meet a gynecologist who will start on hormone pills to have a withdrawal bleeding. Progestrone hormone which is produced from ovary after release of egg, causes symptoms like- mood swings , depression, bloated feel, heavy breast, Air filled feeling in bowels so on. But once you have periods all will disappear. You can also check your Thyroid profile & Serum Prolactin early morning in empty stomach. Just to confirm if no other hormone has lost balance.I can give you a check list to see if all is fine , & anything interfering pregnancy to come.

But as you have left smoking now...baby will get better energy  for rest of weeks (about 5-6 weeks) & will recover to some extent from the damage. -It will also help you in giving birth .. the delivery . To make up the loss you should have nnourishing diet with proteins (milk,pulses,non veg food except for liver)/vitmines&minerals  (plenty of salads,fruits .

Considering that statistic, I would say there is a chance you could be pregnant, especially if you have never been late on a cycle before.But, sexual intercourse itself can sometimes be a trigger to bring on an early period, or even cause a delay in one.

By date calculations, it is very difficult to derive about the probable intercourse responsible for the conception as the prediction of pregnancy dating varies by few days to a week by ultrasonography in early pregnancy. The due date also is derived by ultrasonography which may have such variation. If your due date is considered as April 27 2017, your last menstrual period date would be 20 July 2016 and intercourse in the first week of August would be responsible for the conception; however, this calculation is again not the perfect one. On September 6th, 2016, your ultrasound has calculated the pregnancy to be about 6-7 weeks duration. This infers that the conception would be due to intercourse around middle to third week of July; however, this is not a perfect calculation due to the variation of ultrasound calculations. However, if your menses are regular, you may tentatively guess about the probable intercourse responsible for pregnancy. The egg is released 14 days prior to the next expected period. Calculate which intercourse was on or nearer to this day. However, this also is not a fool proof method. The fool proof answer to your dilemma would be DNA test which will give you the scientific answer. I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"At 8 weeks i had a ultrasound that my doc found a placenta cyst at 12 weeks we had discovered that the cyst has gone down in size at 13 weeks i had light spotting and then it went away for 4 days now i have brown old blood on toilet paper when i wipe.

Firstly, my straight forward answer is that gestational age according to your lmp is more accurate than your ultrasound gestational age. Because gestational age accuracy is changing according to each trimester of pregnancy. And it is more accurate if it is done in first trimester (it is from 1-12 weeks) and it's accuracy will decrease in second trimester (13-28 weeks) and it is lowest in third trimester( 29-40 weeks).So gestational age according to your lmp is most accurate.

Observe for 2 weeks after that if my period will not come what cause? I had a negative pregnancy test twice. Its my first time being delayed in period and i have regular period. Thanks","Doctor":"Hi,I guess your concern is about delay in menses. Right first of all, I want to say is that Relax. It happens in reproductive age group ( its the age group from 15-45 years, in which chances of menses irregularity is common or getting pregnant is high). But you didn't give information about your age, so I can't comment.Secondly let us discuss the drug, prescribed by ur treating doctor. the drug, prescribed to you is a type of progesterone. It is usually given for 5 days for withdrawal bleeding (bleeding occurs after delayed menses). Once the pregnancy is ruled out, it is prescribed. Bleeding usually occurs within 2 weeks of last medication.Lastly I assure you that it usually happened but causes are different. The causes may be due to envornmental changes, hormonal changes or some pathological causes etc. If you are still worried, then discuss freely with your treating doctor. He/she can help you.I hope the above information is useful, informative and helpful for you. Let me know if I can assist you further.

She is type o- blood type. Yesterday when she stood up she had a sharp pain in lower part of her stomach, so intense that she had to sit back down immediately and wait for the pain to stop (about 5 minutes). Just now when she went to the bathroom she had blood when she urinated. More than a spotting. Now she had blood during her last pregnancy but not this heavy. Should we head to the hospital now? Or what do you recommend?","Doctor":"Hi,I guess your concern is spotting and you should go to hospital now. Visit a nearby hospital/ nursing home where obstetricians and gynecologist specialist are available. If you have sufficient time go directly to your treating doctor. Firstly let us focus on your pain in lower part of stomach plus spotting followed by bleeding. These are the warning signs that there might be some problem in placenta ( placenta connect the baby to the womb of the mother). Some problem of the placenta has caused this warning scenario in your daughter. For this you need to see the above said specialist as fast as possible. Secondly I would like to focus on child birth spacing, that is if minimum gap between two babies  is not adequate then this kind of scenario may happen- PRETERM LABOUR ( not a good time to discuss in detail about it). In short I can say that womb of the mother will not be fully ready/ has full strength to grow a new baby if proper spacing between babies or pregnancy is not there.I would like to suggest that you rush to visit a nearby hospital/ nursing home where obstetricians and gynecologist specialist are available. If you have sufficient time go directly to your treating doctor.I hope the information is useful, informative and helpful to solve your daughter's problems.

We have an unprotected sexual intercourse with my bf 3 days after my period last September 4. I don't experience spotting. Last few months we have a vigorous training and I suffer from weight loss. But now, I was wondering why I have clear nipple discharge from both of nipples.","Doctor":"Hello, I hope I can help you today. First of all, any woman having unprotected intercourse is at risk for pregnancy. On addition, missing your period is the most common sign of pregnancy. Weight loss due to exercise can also cause you to miss your period, so there is no way to know if you are pregnant based solely on symptoms. However, nipple discharge can be caused by other hormone abnormalities that can also cause irregular periods. An excess of the hormone Prolactin, which stimulates milk production, can be produced as a side effect of medications or even from a type of benign pituitary tumor. Depending on your age, abnormalities of the breast ducts or even rarely, breast cancer, can cause nipple discharge. So if you have not yet done so, you should perform an over the counter pregnancy test and if the results are negative, I recommend you see your local physician for an evaluation of your hormone levels. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful. Let me know if you have further queries.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hello. I am Dorcas. I have virtually lost sleep as a result of my anxiety. LMP was Oct. 20. Last month, no period, tested on the 13th day after ovulation and got a positive result. Two fays later, tested again and the results were OK.On the 22nd of November, around noon, I started noticing dark brown discharge. Not flow per se. To avoid staining, I padded up. It lasted for 4 days and stopped. I went in for scanning as adviced by a doc but nothing was found. I was 5/1 weeks. Tested with serum , got a positive. Symptoms seemed to have reduced and I tested again yesterday and got a very faint positive. Today , the same thing.Plz I m so worried. Wat do you make of this plz. I need ur help asap. Thanks a million","Doctor":"Hi,Any bleeding during any stage of pregnancy is not a good sign; particularly, brown bleeding indicates the risk to the life of the baby. You had brown bleeding for few days after your pregnancy test was positive. Brown bleeding in such case suggests that the baby is no more viable. This fact was proved by your ultrasonography where products of conception were not visualized. After the demise of the baby, it takes at least a week for the pregnancy test to give negative results. Hence, your immediate pregnancy test was positive. Since, the hCG levels are gradually diminishing, the test first becomes faint and then becomes negative. It seems you have aborted completely in very early stage of the pregnancy. This could have been the result of blighted ovum wherein the gestational sac is present without baby in it. It could be even chromosomal problem also. Please consult your Obstetrician, if possible Foetal Medicine Specialist before you attempt for the next pregnancy. Also, start Folic acid tablets regularly for better eggs and better pregnancy. I hope this helps you.

I'm supposed to start my period in six days. this morning after i had sex with my boyfriend i noticed that there was a time about of brown discharge. I always take the pills on time and have only taken one late during the first week of this pack. He also always pulls out. what is the likelihood that i'm pregnant","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Even if you had some spotting when you are not supposed to have your period, the birth control pill is effective in preventing pregnancy as long as you are taking it daily.  Breakthrough bleeding, which is bleeding while you are taking the active pills, can happen once in a while as a common side effect of any birth control pills. In your case, because you took one late pill during this pack, that may have been the cause of the breakthrough bleeding you experience. In addition, having slight bleeding after sex can also because by chafing in the vagina or on the cervix and also has no connection to effectiveness of the birth control pill.Furthermore, because your boyfriend does not ejaculate inside you,  your chance of pregnancy is still quite low from that alone. Therefore, I do not think you need to be concerned about pregnancy in this situation.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi I have been taking omeprazole 20mg tablets last 5 months of my pregnancy for preventing extreme heart burn.

Because the urine pregnancy test gives accurate results a week after missed period.The doctor usually prescribes Primolut N only after excluding the pregnancy. There are no side effects to pregnancy or fetus with Primolut N.So if you want, you can wait for spontaneous onset of periods as well.

I was actually expecting to get my periods yesterday, but i happened to take just 3 tablets of Promilut N. Im worried that if im pregnant, will it affect my pregnancy??","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Primolut N is a Progesterone preparation. The name Progesterone itself suggests that it is required to stabilize the pregnancy. During pregnancy, the levels of progesterone go on increasing to stabilize the pregnancy. Hence Primolut N will not cause any harm at this stage of your menstrual period. In fact, these pills will help you diagnose the possibility of pregnancy. If you are not pregnant, you will get withdrawal bleeding to these pills about a week later. If you do not get period by that time, you are most likely pregnant. I hope this helps and assures you.Dr. Nishikant"},{"Patient":"Me and my boyfriend want another kid so we waited and checked for my ovulation, when it came , we did, and the next day i started bleeding. i been bleeding for three days and its not heavy its light bright red. can i still end up pregnant though i been bleeding.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,On the day of ovulation and immediately after that some amount of spotting to little bleeding may take place in some women.

I explained to her that I was still experiencing some symptoms like severe fatigue, nausea, problems with low blood pressure, worsening migraines, I will wake up in the middle of the night severly hungry and craving sugar enough to make me get out of bed and eat a cookie or something sweet and drink juice, however, during the day I have strong cravings for salt. I have also recently been having problems with heart palpations that will last anywhere from 30 seconds to one minute. I have other symptoms as well but those are some of the basics. My OB/GYN ran some blood tests and two days after the tests and before i was informed of the results I had an episode of where I passed out while driving my vehicle. just before I passed out I became incredibly disoriented while driving and had no understanding of what I was doing. I was awoken to a man knocking on my vehicle window. when I arrived home and went to exit the vehicle I passed out again. I called my OB/GYN and informed her of what had happend. She then informed me that my test results two days prior had shown a blood glucose level of 50 after eating. She indicated that it was very low and that she thought my blood glucose level had bottomed out causing me to pass out. And that I need to eat protein every two hours and not eat carbs. I am not diabetic nor do I take insulin. Also, a few months prior I had a high tsh test result and was put on synthroid. Is it normal for a pregnant women to have low blood sugar test results or to pass out while driving. Could there be another reason causing my low blood sugar or another reason as to while I passed out while driving. thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You seem to have  serious problem with your blood sugar. If you are not on insulin or any antidiabetic medicines, why should you land in hypoglycaemia? One or all of the following could be the cause:1. You are taking less amount of carbohydrate. I agree that you need to have high protein diet; however, with such episodes of low blood sugar level, you need to take high carbohydrate diet. You should also carry Glucone D tablets with you. Whenever you feel acutely hungry, you should take one of the tablet even before you have your food. Moreover, please consult your Endocrinologist about this issue. May be high secretion of Glucagone (antidiabetogenic hormone) from the Pituitary could be high utilizing your sugar in the blood fast. Please undergo thorough endocrinology work up; till that, support your body with adequate sugar and carbohydrates. You should have rather frequent feeds. 2. During pregnancy, the kidney does throw out more sugar and hence the blood sugar level is at a lower range; however, if it is symptomatic, you have to support the body with adequate amount of sugar and complex carbohydrates also. 3. You are taking Levothyroxin sodium tablets. They are known to increase the body metabolism and thus reduce the blood sugar. Therefore with these tablets, one feels more hungry. Probably the dose of Levothyroxin is rather higher than what your body needs. Please monitor the dose with repeated estimations of blood TSH. During pregnancy, the normal values of TSH are under 3.5 in the middle three months of pregnancy. I would have appreciated had you mentioned the values of TSH. We may continue this discussion further if you ask me Direct question. Please submit yourself for thorough investigations. Till the final diagnosis is clinched, please carry Glucone D tablets with you. Some degree of high sugar level is acceptable than low blood sugar level. Please consult your Diabetologist. I hope this gives you initial message."},{"Patient":"I had GD with my first pregnancy and controlled this strictly with a diet. Currently I am 7 weeks and 3 days pregnant with my second and had GD with my first. I am not a type 2 diabetic but are insulin intolerant.

The average blood sugar test done by the doctor when I was 4 weeks pregnant was 6 which she said was normal.

(iv) 90 min after finishing a meal?","Doctor":"Hi there,,Previous gestational diabetes makes you at a higher risk for gestational diabetes in this pregnancy. You need to do the 75g oral Glucose Tolerance Test to determine if you have it in this pregnancy or not. This will more accurately determine your risk of gestational diabetes than the Accucheck readings or the post prandial 90 minute test.The OGTT value of fasting is 5.6 mmol/L and at 2 hours is 7.8 mmol/L, values above these indicate gestational diabetes.Once gestational diabetes is diagnosed you can monitor your blood sugars daily by accucheck, documenting both fasting and post prandial levels. The fasting values should be less than 5.3mmol/L; the 1 hour post prandial should be less than 7.8 mmol/L; and 2 hour post prandial should be less than 6.4 mmol/L.The 90 minute is not routinely used to monitor the values nowadays.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am 15 weeks pregnant I woke up Tuesday morning with severe pain in my right flank to the point of not being able to walk, sit down or lie down without being uncomfortable.

They gave me an IV and nubane and told me to take Tylenol if the pain persisted and come back if it got unbearable and took me out of work for 3 days. I m a manager in retail so I am on my feet the whole 8 hours I m working. I was fine after that with plenty of rest and staying off my feet. They had said it was swollen kidney with colic. I returned to work Friday and after 4 hours the pain got so intense as bad as it was the first time, I took Tylenol it didn t touch it and I was in tears because it hurt so badly. I finished out my work and returned tothe ER because the OB and my primary both told me there wasn t much they could do to ease the pain and since the ER instructed me to come back if I had pain that s what I have to do. I went in and went through the same things. Took urine sample this time no signs o infection or blood just a small amount of white blood cells. He touched my right flank and it hurt badly. The dr determined that this is pretty much a head scratcher and thinks it may be hydrophenosis not kidney stones.

My girlfriend is pregnant, and when she was around 10 weeks I ingested some mephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone (4-MMC) a synthetic stimulant and entactogen drug of the amphetamine and cathinone classes) by placing the power on my tongue and washing the powder down with a glass of milk. I left the milk by the side of the bed, she woke up with indigestion while I was out of the room and drank the remained of the glass of milk. I am extremely worried that even the tiny amount of mephedrone she presumably injected will have effected the babies development, as the substance is known to be a neurotoxic and I gather in that particular stage of the babies development (around 10 weeks) neurons are developing.

I am currently almost 6 months pregnant, so my trips to different specialists have ceased for the time being. I will try and be as descriptive and brief as possible with what I have been experiencing. Ok, so in or around March/April of 2009, I was told that I had mild PCOS. This was due to increased levels of testosterone and a cyst on my left ovary. I started taking Ortho Tri Cyclen in May of 2009. Around this time, i started to develop chronic hives/welts with intense itching. This was not limited to any part of my body and occured every day. Within a period of a few months, I noticed a significant amount of hair fall-out, and realized after a period of time that I probably had about a 30% decrease in the overall amount of hair on my head. I ceased taking the birth control in August of 2009. I started taking a multivitamin with a biotin supplement. This seemed to stop the high amount of hair fall out. But after giving it time, my hair really never recovered. The hair that grew back has been noticably thinner. It is currently July of 2010. My hair has started to fall out a little more, despite being pregnant. The hives never ceased since last year. They have been partially relieved by 5 mgs of Xyzal daily that my allergist prescribed me. Aside from the allergist, who has found no reason for the chronic urticaria, I have seen a dermatologist, and an endocrinologist. All my thyroid tests come back normal, but I m not sure if they test for thyroid antibodies. My dermatologist suggested by feeling my throat, that my thyroid was slightly larger than normal, but after looking at my thyroid blood labs from other physicians, did not follow up with that. My endocrinologist stated that my histamine levels were abnormally high, and that my testosterone was high, but only wanted to help by prescribing me Metformin, which I chose not to take, due to the fact that my blood sugar tests have always been completely normal. The PCOS has made it difficult to lose weight, but with a healthy diet and exercise, I maintain weight. Even though my testosterone levels were high in blood work from last year, my testosterone levels were always a little elevated, and without the urticaria or hair loss. The only other strange occurence of chronic hives/welt/itching occured in 2005 when I happened to be taking Ortho tri cyclen for a year or so. About a year after starting the BCP, I went through a few months of chronic urticaria accompanied with awful acid reflux. My doctor told me I had chronic stress, but the problem subsided back then. Basically, I have seen 3 specialists and my gyno, and not one person can tell me whats causing the hives, and my hair thinning. I am completely at rock bottom. I am currently pregnant and trying not to stress, but when everyone tells you how great your hair is supposed to be while your pregnant, and when you see yours falling out, it puts a great deal of stress. The only thing that has gotten nice are my nails. My acne has gotten worse, and I have no where else to turn. Please help me with any suggestions. Is it my thyroid? My hormones? This has been going on so long and I can t take one more person just trying to mask it with Metformin or Spironolactone, etc etc. Thank you so much for your time, Jessica","Doctor":"Dear Jessica  I read your whole story and feel that you r really very troubled.but keep all your troubles aside for a while and concentrate o your pregnancy.

There are some things that are clearly bad for you in pregnancy like cigarettes and then most other things are not as clear.  I don't think there are any great studies that say cannabis is safe or dangerous in pregnancy.  The big issue here above all else is that cannabis has not been widely accepted by society so using it during labor or pregnancy can lead to child social service issues.  I am not sure what country you live in but in the US you would end up with a visit from a social worker.  This is a purely legal and social issue but medically/health-wise it's hard to say if it's safe.  I think there are probably things that are a lot worse but I don't think anyone is going to feel comfortable recommending it for pain relief in this setting until more research has been done.Take care,Dr D."},{"Patient":"Hello.

But I had unprotected sex on 3/10/10 and on 3/11/10 which is only 12-13 days so it wasnt quite 2 weeks. Could I be pregnant? Its now about 6 weeks or so later. I am supposed to get my period 4/17/10, but it came a week early and is really, really light. It s light enough that I don t even really have to wear a pad or anything.

Weight 138 and 5 ft 5 in tall. 2 easy non-complicated natural pregnancies and deliveries in 2009 and 2011, got pregnant both times on 1st try.

Any thoughts on why any of this is happening? I even had a hysteroscopy with D&C to rule out complications and give me clean slate , but apparently it didn t help, although on a positive note it showed everything looked good and results came back normal. Any advice and opinions welcome. I really feel like I was meant to be a surrogate and really want to help someone wanting a baby and am so discouraged that this isn t working. Wondering if something could be wrong that hasn t been seen yet? Oh yeah, and it was on 2 mg estradiol for the first week each cycle, then it was upped to 4mg/day for remaining cycle days. Started off the entire process with 1 lupron depot shot only and never went off the estradiol. Thank you!","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,I do appreciate your approach to help someone with surrogacy. After going through your detailed history, the only subnormal finding I could get was your endometrial thickness. Endometrium between 9 and 13 mm thickness is most conducive for implantation of fertilized ovum; while your endometrium is not crossing the figure of 7 mm. To increase the endometrial thickness, you have been put on Estradiol and Lupron. Still it has not given satisfactory results. I would suggest you first to downregulate the Oestrogen and the go for Lupron. We have found very good results by this regime. Of course, before that, please get your Hysteromicroscopy performed to find out whether there is any pathology in the endometrium.

The possibilities are a missed pregnancy or a pseudo pregnancy. A serum beta-hCG titre estimation will help to differentiate.

Thanks","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Placental abruption is premature separation of placenta due to which the oxygen supply and nutrition of the baby gets affected leading to foetal death. Placental abruption is always due to some cause. High blood pressure, Pregnancy induced hypertension, eclampsia, Folic acid deficiency, diabetes, trauma on the abdomen, severe anaemia, severe psychological trauma, too much or too less water around the foetus, Rh incompatibility are some of the commoner conditions which can cause placental abruption. You may get investigated for conditions like diabetes, blood pressure, blood examination, etc. before the next pregnancy. Please start Tab. Folic acid immediately for protecting the future pregnancy and the baby.

This is my second pregnancy (first one was in 2008 and had no complications). Since my first trimester I ve been suffering from PET (patulous eustachian tube). In the beginning I was still able to control my condition because I knew what could trigger it (like fatigue, certain activities, etc), but unfortunately for the past 3 weeks it s changed for the worse and I ve been having PET constantly throughout the day with now relief, unless I lay completely flat on my bed, which I can t always do having a 2-yr old boy jumping around me all day. With my first pregancy I only started having PET around my 8th month and it wasn t constantly, I could easily control it so it didn t control my life like it does this time around. Although I ve read a lot about PET and I know that the tissue around the ET can soften during pregnancy causing it to open up, I was still wondering if low blood pressure could have anything to do with it, too. I ve always had low bp and now that I m pregnant I lack a lot of energy and I m always out of breath. My bp is about 100/50. I know that before, being tired was one of the triggers for my ET to open up. Anyway, even though I can rest assured that this annoying problem will go away in 3 months after I give birth, I still would love to get some relief now, because it s driving me crazy.

Is it possible that OHSS may reoccur 2. I want to reduce chances of OHSS. Please suggest how to go about it.","Doctor":"Hello there, thanks for writing in. I would like to discuss a few things with you.   OHSS of severe degree is considered unacceptable these days with the introduction of antagonist protocol ( agonist protocol as used in your case is more susceptible to develop OHSS), especially in pcos women who are very prone to develop OHSS. So next time when you undergo stimulation the choice should be an antagonist protocol which significantly reduces the chances of OHSS.  Using metformin through ovarian stimulation will also bring down OHSS risks.  Using GnRH agonist as a trigger for final maturation of eggs in place of hcg will aid. At the same time the eggs can be frozen and transferred at a later date in FET.  Using lower dose and gradually increasing the dose to obtain a response ( response is growth of multiple follicles) should be considered. Some physicians administer albumin infusion at the time of egg retrieval to prevent OHSS. Hope the above provided information will assist you to discuss the strategies with your doctor regarding your concern. Take care."},{"Patient":"Dear Sir/Madam !

Have six small meals instead of 3 large meals5. Drink plenty of fluids6. Go for regular brisk walks for 30 to 40 minutes daily.7. Take regular iron & folic acid supplementation as prescribed by her gynecologist.The result of CMV IgG level is positive which indicates past or recent CMV infection.

Bacterial throat infection will have to be treated by some antibiotics. However, during pregnancy, certain antibiotics like Tetracycline are not advised due to their teratogenicity. Hence, take antibiotics only with the advice of Obstetrician. In addition, avoid cold and chilled food or drinks. Hot gargles with salt water or Listerine solution will help you. Half teaspoonful of turmeric powder and 2 tsf of sugar in a glassful of hot water will help bring down the infection. Ignoring the infection may spread in the body through blood.

As I do not have your entire medical history and your test reports it is difficult to answer your question satisfactorily. Sometimes it takes time for your ovaries to come back to its original self after being subjected to stimulation using gonadotropin drugs. Having said that, it is important to evaluate why you didn't get your periods after ivf. The reasons why you didn't ovulate could be many. Excessive stress due to ivf process can have inhibitory effect on ovulation and so is excessive physical exercise and poor nutrition. Other reasons could be thyroid or prolactin hormone abnormalities, polycystic ovaries, poor ovarian reserve, or defects in the endometrium ( adhesions and synechae due to infection) or very very rarely due to malignancies and conditions. Like Cushing syndrome or CAH ( congenital adrenal hyperplasia) and many others which is highly unlikely in your case. You must understand that ovulation , though looks like a simple process , is a very complicated endocrinal orchestra played by hormones, receptors and many other small molecules and a slightest defect anywhere can disrupt the ovulatory process. I have laid down only general causes of ovulatory dysfunction as I don't have complete information and further evaluation has to be carried out by your doctor. Hope this helps. Good luck!"},{"Patient":"i am 8 months pregnant and my blood pressure has been slightly high but my pulse rate is what the doctor is monitoring i had an ecg which was ok waiting for a cardiologist appointment for the 24 hour tape if my pulse rate is constantly high what does this mean is there any treatment safe in pregnancy to take to lower this.","Doctor":"Hi, I can understand your concerns about increased increased BP during pregnancy. As you are 8 months out and only 1 month to go, so I advise you not to worry too much.        Increased blood pressure in pregnancy can lead to various complications, but it probably will not be in your case. You are being monitored for cardiovascular changes which is a very nice thing. So I suggest you continue the treatment you are taking.        Any treatment to lower BP can be taken only after there are specifica symptoms and specifca Blood Pressure levels are breached only. I want to advise you that you follow your normal diet, restrict salt and watch for any alarming signs like dizziness, swelling on legs or on face. If they occur consult with your Gynecologist immediately.        If nothing happens, be under observation and within one month, you will be giving birth to a beautiful baby. Hope I have answered your question. Feel free to contact for any further queries. Best of luck for future.Regards,Dr.Abhijeet"},{"Patient":"hello doctor, i m palvinder kaur bakshi from new delhi. i operated in 2007 AV+MV replacement. i m now 7 week pregnent. it is my first baby. but unfortunately i was taking acitrom of 5mg till today. is it harmful for my baby? i m afraid. my USG today shows that my baby is normal and heart beat is normal. is everything ok withmy baby. thanx. palvinder YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hello palvinder, thanks for the query. While it is very important to be on acitrom for you to prevent thrombotic complications in pregnancy, it is equally important to prevent significant malformations in the baby due to acitrom. Please consider the following facts.1. The fact that you were on acitrom says you must have had mechanical prosthetic valve replacement rather bio prosthetic valve where anti coagulation may not be required at all.2. The use of any anticoagulants in pregnancy is a risk for bleeding at the placental site and subsequent miscarriage, preterm birth and low birth weight in the baby. In such a circumstance, using acitrom ( warfarin) in the first trimester poses further risk of malformations in the baby. And hence once pregnancy is detected, acitrom is usually replaced with either low molecular weight heparin or unfractionated heparin till 12 to 13 weeks to avoid teratogenicity. As acitrom is the best anticoagulant used to prevent thrombotic complications ( the risk for blood clotting in pregnancy is magnified 6 fold), it can be restarted following 12 weeks or continued with heparin depending on physician judgement. However, one must know that the risk for valvular thrombosis increases about 7% if only heparin is used during this period.3. Although it is very hard to determine the effects of acitrom on baby so early, as you have discontinued it in the very early stage and the dose is less 5mg) there may not be any harm on the baby. But I must warn you that you need to see your doctor for a detailed discussion and for anticoagulant replacement with heparin which is of utmost importance till 12 weeks following which you can be on warfarin again. Continued therapy during breast feeding is safe and encouraged. Hope this helped. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi i just went in for my nt ultrasound on the 6th. I had a regularly scheduled ultrasound two weeks ago and the dr says the baby looks fine. Now on the 6th the nt ultrasound Dr tells me the baby has megacystis with a bladder that is 4cm. How accurate could this ultrasound be and how was there no detection of a distended abdomen 2weeks ago? Also on new years day i was admitted to the hosp for food poisoning/dehydration and given 4L of iv fluid. Could this have had any affect on the nt ultrasound or my baby s abdomen?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.It will take a while for your OB to figure out why your baby has an enlarged bladder, but i want to first assure you that it has nothing to do with any fluids you received when you had food poisoning.Fetuses get hydration from drinking amniotic fluid, and do make their own urine.  If there is a blockage of the bladder opening, then the fetus cannot pass urine and that can cause the bladder to look very large and full on an ultrasound scan.  The most common cause of a blocked urinary tract in utero is posterior urethral valves, which are more common in male infants.  Of course, if you do an ultrasound when the bladder of the baby is just full, it can be mistaken for an enlarged bladder.So in summary, the enlarged bladder will need further evaluation by your OB but your fluid intake does not affect the baby's fluid intake or production of urine.I hope I was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Dear Dr. Jain Age is 36 years, female, and i want to discuss regarding my medical problem during the pregncncy specialy during the male child. In 1998 I gave birth to the baby boy in 7th month i.e. premature delivery due high BP and Albumin, then in 2001 I gave birth to the baby girl, BP was high but controlled also and everything went well. Then in 2005 I again gave birth to the baby boy in the beginning of the nineth month, but the baby swalloed the liquor and could not survive more than 4 days. Then in last year 2009, I again gave birth to the baby boy which was aborted in the 7th month as I had an eclimsia attack, but htis time my BP was in control, and suddenly I had a pain in my stomach and BP raised to 226/220. As all the parts had stopped working and only heart was working, According to PGI, Chandigarh doctors I was dead. Now the question is that last year my husband was having some BP problem, then we meet some cardiologist, he asked me that do You (I) have problem during the pregenecy, I said yes My BP is very high and whereas in my family history there is BP patient.Then he said sometimes it happens due to genetic problem and it can be because of my husband also. Is this a genetis problem? If yes, then I wish like to concieve again and then can I go for artificial insemination or is there any other solution. Hope to hear soon from you..... Ashima (India) YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Dear Ashima, its unfortunate you had to go through such a hard time through your pregnancies. Let me help you understand some things.1. High blood pressure during pregnancy with a seizure attack and from what looks like multi organ failure ( according to your description)in your previous pregnancy, puts you under extremely high risk to manage your pregnancy safely. You must understand the consequences of future pregnancy on your own health and well being ( the functioning of all important organs like heart, brain, kidney, liver may be compromised and can be even fatal or life threatening) before attempting one. So you must be fully aware and equipped for any potential consequences of it.2. There could be many reasons why high blood pressure happens in pregnancy. Some women who has a family history of hypertension, and have crossed 35 years are more susceptible to it.And a number of genes are suspected to cause it.Yes, as the baby shares genes of both mother and father, now you can think your body is temporarily handling your husband's genes. Hypertension can develop if your husband's genes are not efficiently handled.( that's what your doctor explained).This can result in altered placental development and reduced blood supply to the baby. The baby may be thus may be growth restricted, and is prone for premature delivery, and its consequences.3. As even donor inseminations may result in similar condition it is extremely hard to predict if that can be free of hypertensive complications.Hence I suggest you to be rational and take a wise decision if you want to conceive again and obtain very good prenatal care when you attempt it.Hope this information helped. Good luck."},{"Patient":"I am 35 weeks pregnant and my age is 26.This is my first pregnancy.My height is 160 cm and weight is 77 kgs now(before prgenancy it was 65 kg).My baby weight at 35 weeks is 2.365 kgs.In my previous scan it was told that my amniotic fluid index was 8 cm at 31 weeks and i was prescribed deodavlin tablet to maintain the fluid content and advised to take lots of fluids and to take bed rest.And i went for a scan at 35 weeks and now my fluid content is 7 cm and the cord is suspected to be around the babys neck in scan in single loop.My doctor has prescribed me now ecospirin 75 (aspirin delayed release )tablets for 20 days.Is it safe to take ecospirin 75 in 35,36,37,38th weeks of pregnancy as prescribed.??I could see the instruction citing that the medicine should not be taken in last three months of pregnancy unless prescribed by physician.Will taking Ecospirin 75 be of any harm to foetus and cause any bleeding or any side effects now..I don t have any Pressure ,sugar,bleeding complaints so far...currently i don t have any weezing problem but i used to get weezing trouble when i catch cough and cold..and i had weezing issue in my 6 th month of pregnancy and have taken treatment for that and got cured then.","Doctor":"H there , thank you for writing in. Aspirin ( ecospirin) 75 mg in pregnancy is considered safe during pregnancy and is indicated in many situations like growth restricted baby, decreased fluid around baby, when mother has hypertension because of which at times blood supply to the baby may be reduced, autoimmune conditions like APLA syndrome, previous 2 or more more miscarriages etc. But as your pregnancy is uncomplicated you may not require aspirin as long as baby is doing well ( growth profiles and Doppler being normal).  Aspirin needs to be discontinued 7 to 10 days prior to expected delivery ( when delivery is planned) or by 36 to 37 weeks of gestation. Such a small dose of aspirin is unlikely to cause bleeding problems during delivery when it is discontinued a week well in advance of delivery.  A single loop of cord around baby s neck is not an indication for starting ecospirin or even caesarean section as long as baby can withstand the stress of labour well and labour proceeds smoothly. ( no baby heart beat pattern abnormalities on cardiotocogram and labour is not unduly prolonged). Hope this information helped.

It is given for 5 days starting any day from day 2 to day 5 of periods and continuing for up to 5 days. Usually clomifene citrate alone helps in ovulation but at times you may require gonadotropin injections along with it for enhancing growth if the egg. When the egg is mature, hcg injection is given for egg to be released.  Progynova is usually given when the uterine lining ( endometrium) becomes thin as a side effect of fertomid. But it is preferred to be given by the end of follicular maturation rather than from the starting of the cycle.  Hope this helped. Good luck."},{"Patient":"Age: 25 Gender: Female.

It can be due to thyroid problems, implantation bleeding, vigorous intercourse, cervical bleeding ( neck of the womb) or even due to impending miscarriage.  I suggest you the following things as the next step.1. Thyroid profile ( serum TSH and Free T4)2. A clinical examination by gynaecologist to ascertain there is nothing on the neck of the womb to cause bleeding. 3. Although evidence suggests bed rest may not help stop bleeding, it helps not to exert yourself.4. You may insert micronised progesterone capsules 200 mg vaginally every night before bed to keep uterus relaxed. ( no evidence progesterone helps stop bleeding).5. You may get an ultrasound scan done to know baby heart (can be done with hand held Doppler device as well). If you are spotting without any reason , rest assured it may settle down in a while. But if you develop pain and bleeding increases, it may be a sign of miscarriage and you need to see your doctor right away. Hope this helped.

I have pretty normal pregnancy symptoms but I have noticed in addition that my stomach feels full and tight and I am very gassy. I have had constipation and some very light occasional cramps. Every now and then I will get a more noticable pain that is short lived in my lower abdomen. Passing gas and changing positions usually helps. My question is should I be concerned about the cramping or is it just gas. Also, is it safe to have intercourse at this time. My first OBGYN appointment is not until a month away. I am 5 2 and 33 as of right now (BD in a month). My first pregnancy was normal aside from a cesarean section.","Doctor":"Hello there, thanks for writing in. 1.  Feeling gassy with tight abdomen and constipation are quite common in pregnancy and can be attributed to loads of progesterone being produced in your body. It is not a concern as long as you can relate your cramps to bloated abdomen and if you feel relieved with passing gas. Do consume lot of fibre and fruits to help you feel better. Warm water helps in intestinal movements and helps constipation. I recommend you to pay close attention if its cramps or if it feels like twisting menstrual like pain in the lower abdomen. If its menstrual like and if you see any spotting or bleeding, then you need to see your doctor early, which I don't think is a likely scenario.2. As your pain can't be reasoned out yet, I suggest you to refrain from intercourse till you see your doctor. There is no harm in indulging in intercourse after first trimester unless its nor vigorous. Few physicians recommend to abstain in the last few weeks of pregnancy out of sheer caution that it may lead to preterm delivery as semen is known to contain prostaglandins which can set off labour.3. As you had very light bleeding (can happen when pregnant) and you are already showing, there is a slight possibility that your pregnancy may be a bit advanced which you will be able to know for sure by early trimester dating scan. It will be useful if you can reschedule your appointment a bit earlier.Hope this was helpful to you.

We initially suspected that she had an allergy to a body cream but it has persisted. It initially began as an oval shapped (almost scratch like) mark on the side of her upper body near the above the love handles and now has burst into a rash all over her abdomen, breasts and a few on the back. We have gone to a dertmatoligist and she has diagnosed Pityriasis Rosea. 2 Questions, I have done research online and only found 1 study showing that it increases the risk of miscarriage and may cause mobility issues or strength issues in the muscles as an infant that can be overcome. Are there any other more concrete studies showing the effects of this and what is your experience with this virus amongst pregnant women? The second question is what are the differences in symptoms of Pityriasis Rosea and PUPPP?","Doctor":"Hello there, thanks for your query. Your efforts in researching for scientific literature is commendable. As you have rightly found out there are not much studies regarding pityriasis rosea in pregnancy. Those reports suggest possible miscarriage, premature delivery, movement issues in the baby. It is very difficult to draw conclusions from a single study which includes a very limited number of patients and hence the inference cannot be generalised. What one can do in such a circumstance is adopt a wait and watch policy and take adequate precautions to prevent miscarriage and preterm delivery. And undergo a detailed genetic sonogram (anomaly scan) to rule out structural defects in the baby. It usually starts as a single oval patch with well demarcated red boundary and central pink region which over 2 weeks spreads to trunk, back, neck and extremities and they are oval raised lesions which would look like Christmas tree. It spares face, feet and palms. Whereas puppp is seen in the last trimester of pregnancy and seen as papules along lines of striae over abdomen and thighs and it gets intensely itchy. It is most likely related to stretching of the skin. I would like to add that i have given gross features  of PR and it should not be used to diagnose the lesion by oneself. Pityriasis rosea should be diagnosed by a trained dermatologist who does job at their best and the management in pregnancy should be a team work comprising of your obstetrician and dermatologist and a good radiologist.Hope this information is helpful to you.

But PUPPP is a self limiting condition , meaning its not harmful And will resolve by itself in four to seven weeks time. However, as your doctor rightly said Allegra , avil and other drugs may not be very efficient in reducing your symptoms. Its fine to use local application of high potency steroids to get some relief. They are safer than oral steroids and when used for short periods of time will not cause much harm to the baby. Meanwhile you can keep applying emollients that can hold moisture and help a bit.

I will be able to comment further if you can elaborate on the blood test performed. If the value of 1.641 indicates serum beta-hCG, this suggests non-pregnant state. In an ectopic pregnancy, usually the gestation sac is located outside the uterine cavity; sometimes an empty sac may be seen in the uterus simultaneously.

So, just remove the wrong thinking from your mind. And it is a myth that long penis gives more joy to female. It is also a myth that the length of penis is increased by medication. Over all, just accept the real facts about penis size and sex. Only lower one third of vagina is sensitive, so. What is a fun in having long penis? Yes hardness of penis is needed for sex. So, just relax and enjoy the life without keeping wrong ideas about penis and sex. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

It also has a faint red rim and is a little bit more risen. Is this common in pregnancy? Could I have aggrivated it considering it s position by sleeping on it more (usually sleep on stomach but now sleep mainly on left side)? It is slightly dry and rough texture wise but I have knocked it / scratched it a few times over the years putting my clothes on...","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.It is very common for pre-existing moles, freckles, or other skin lesions to grow slightly during pregnancy due to hormonal changes. The skin generally gets more sensitive as well, so you may very well have some chafing from your underwear on this lesion if it has gotten more prominent during the pregnancy..Fortunately, moles usually go back to their original size after you have the baby. In the meantime, applying some sort of lubricating lotion, or even plain Vaseline petroleum jelly twice daily to help lubricate the area and prevent the skin from cracking should be enough to care for the area until after the baby is born. If it still bothers you but when you are six weeks postpartum, you may want to have the mole removed by a dermatologist.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ? Please type your query here... Please could u advise me the risks of having hyper mobility disorder in my knees and hip joints and psd during 3rd trimester of pregnancy and the effects of a natural birth as I am 28 weeks pregnant","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Joint laxity actually occurs naturally in pregnancy to some degree due to hormonal changes. This is a natural adaptation for women's pelvis to be able to expand during the third trimester pregnancy as well as facilitate flexibility of the pubic bone during birth.Having hyperflexible joints in your hips and knees does not in any way hinder your ability to be able to have a normal labor and delivery, however, if you have epidural anesthesia during labor you should make sure that your birth supporters and or nurse do not let your legs get into a hyper flexed position while you are pushing to avoid injury.  If you do not have epidural anesthesia, any position in labor that does not excessively bend or straighten your legs is safe.So in summary, there is no reason why you could not have a natural vaginal birth with hyper mobile knees and hips as long as you have good support during birth to help you position your legs without bending or flexing them beyond their natural capabilities.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Is it safe to have an orgasm during pregnancy?

However, before my first pregnancy, I did 3 DNC since the pregnancy was unhealthy and DNC done in the first month (4-weeks). And now, is it safe for me to have an orgasm? Sorry for my poor English.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Sexual activity does not pose a risk to the pregnancy or baby in normal healthy women, and having an orgasm, though it may produce some temporary uterine contractions, is also not harmful.Some women experience spotting from sexual intercourse during pregnancy, which is caused by the tissue on the cervix, the opening to the wound, (because it is very vascular during pregnancy and even minor trauma can cause some temporary bleeding). This bleeding also is not harmful, so if you do have bleeding after sexual activity I would just wait until the bleeding stops or one week, whichever comes first, before attempting to have sex again.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

Please seek for an assistance of a counsellor. Of course you should not right off other organic causes which may lead to such conditions, particularly with the history of post-partum depression.

Iron with proteins will help you in this condition. The other condition you should rule out is Thyroid dysfunction. Any type of Thyroid dysfunction is known to cause mood changes. Hypothyroid condition is more common during pregnancy. It may also affect the health of the baby and outcome of the delivery. Miscarriages due to hypothyroid state are quite common.

My husband is 25 years old. I tested HCG positive with LMP: 22-01-2010.... But on regular scans the Dr found that the fetus is not showing its growth after 5 weeks and 5 days. (I was asked to take folic acid and progesterone supplement) It neither got aborted by itself nor grew up. We waited till April, yet we could not find the growth. So the Dr gave me medicine to abort my child. It got aborted on 3rd April 2010. Now I got pregnant again with LMP: Aug 6 2010. Again we encountered the same problem. Till yesterday (2-11-2010) the growth is just for 6 weeks and 5 days…. every scan has some improvements but it’s very slow. As of now Fetal pole and ovary sac are found. Now I request your advice whether •     Can I save this child anymore….. Can I test myself for gestation diabetes… if so on treating it, will my child be safe and grow well? •     Can I wait for some more weeks to check whether the baby would grow? •     Some of my friends say (from their experience)that sometimes the child s growth will be slow in the initial stage and pick up quickly later on... will that happen in my case? •     Should I and my husband undergo any tests? if so when can we do the test? now or after deciding on this baby. •     Have you seen any patients with this kind of problem? •     Do I have a bright chance in my next pregnancy…? •     When should I try to conceive again (should I try only after a year or before that?) •     What are the possible problems I may have?

Studies have shown that use of hormones during early stages of pregnancy can harm the fetus if it happens during the stage of organ differentiation, which happens at about 45 days of gestation, or 6 weeks gestation. Any hormone intake prior to this stage, as most often happens unknowingly, has not shown to be harmful. Thus, you are mostly safe since you took the medication very early in your pregnancy and that too, for a smaller period only. Yet, you should test for any possible fetal anomalies and the earliest way available is fetal DNA sampling. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Can a false RPR test with a neg. FTA-ABS test be affected by high prolactin levels? My level was at 22 and I had this positive RPR test come back. I ve had 2 other tests done with my last 2 pregnancies and they were previously normal and have been in a monogamous relationship for 15 years.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope i can help you today.Having a false-positive RPR during a test for syphillis is a relatively common occurrence, which is why the confirmatory test (FTA_ABS) is performed.  FTA, or fluorescent treponemal antibody, is only positive if the organism that causes syphillis is present.  So this test shows that you definitely do NOT have syphillis.False positive RPR's are caused by autoantibodies produced by your body that cause the test to be positive.  These are not commonly associated with an elevated prolactin level, but other autoimmune conditions, such as thyroid disease and lupus, can sometimes cause the test to be positive.  However, in most people, there is no explanation for the positive RPR test.So there is no reason to worry that you have a positive RPR test.  You may test positive on the RPR test in the future, or it may go away by itself.  Your primary care physician may want to evaluate you for autoimmune diseases, depending on your age and current health.I hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, I m 33 weeks pregnant and was given Gertac 3 days ago for reflux. since then I ve had sharp pain in my right shoulder and chest when I swallow. When I lie down it feels like my gut is having spasms or something. When I wake in the morning I m fine and then I eat breakfast and it starts all over again. What can this be? It s very sore. Thank you for you help.","Doctor":"Hello, and i hope I can help you today.Many women get pain in their chest from reflux or gastritis. When your stomach starts to secrete acid, like when you eat, the pain may get worse.Acid reflux literally means that the acid from your stomach sloshes up into your esophagus, and that can cause it to spasm, which you are feeling when you lie down.Taking your Gertac at the full adult dose (150 mg) daily will gradually help the symptoms, but i also suggest you purchase a calcium-containing antacid (like TUMS) and take two whenever you feel the spasms or pain in your shoulder.  Trying to only eat upright and staying upright at least 2 hours after eating will help to reduce the reflux as well.  If you always feel the pain when you lie down, try to prop yourself up on pillows so your head is higher than the rest of your body.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor. I am 5.5 months pregnant. This excessive saliva generation problem is there for me for last 3 months. I use cup to split every minute. This happens even during sleep but it is less compared to day time.Please suggest me a solution to stop this excessive saliva generation.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Ptyalism is the name for the condition that causes excessive saliva during pregnancy.  In some women, the saliva is caused by hormones, while in others, it is due to chronic nausea.  In either case, it will get better after you have the baby, but here are a few things you can try in the meantime:Small, frequent snacks, especially dry crumbly ones like pretzels or crackers, can soothe your stomach and help nausea.Eating ginger (in the form of candies, tea, or sucking on fresh ginger) also soothes the stomach and may help you swallow your saliva.  Chewing gum can also help you swallow your saliva rather than spitting it out.Vitamin B6, in combination with an antihistamine called doxylamine succinate (both can be purchased over the counter and are safe during pregnancy) can help treat nausea as well as help dry the mouth.Anti-nausea medication, prescribed by your doctor, can sometimes help with excessive saliva production.  I suggest you talk with your prenatal care provider about trying medication if natural remedies do not work.  I hope I was able to adequatey answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"My husband and I are ttc, and I just ovulated within the last day or so. We have a trip planned on Monday to go to Six Flags. Will riding the roller coastes prevent a fertilized egg from implanting? Also If I am already running, is it ok to continue on running? I had a c-section 7 months ago, but lost my son at 12 days. Thanks so much!","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Any activity you do that does not hurt you physically will not affect your ability to conceive nor will harm you if you are pregnant.  So you can ride the roller coaster, run, or do any of the activities you usually do to enjoy life and stay healthy, and it will not harm you or interfere with your fertility.The one thing that you may want to consider is that your uterus needs time to heal from a Cesarean section and it is generally recommended you wait one year to become pregnant again to allow the uterine scar to regain full strength.  Women who get pregnant sooner after having a c-section are at increased risk of abnormal attachment of the placenta, and of rupturing their uterus if they go into labor.  I am sure after your last delivery you want to try to conceive right away, but the safest thing would be to wait until a full year passed since your c/section.I hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful to you.Best wishes for your next pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I had an ectooic pregnancy 12/18/15.

Should I be worried","Doctor":"Hello, and i hope I can help you today.Anyone with a history of an ectopic pregnancy has about a 20 percent chance of developing another one, even if the tube was removed.  So I strongly recommend if you develop any pain, especially if it is on one side, that you go to an emergency room for an ultrasound and a HCG hormone level.

A large portion left my body, it was a deep red, about the size of two pinky fingers, along with a blood flow. After this exited my body, the blood stopped and so did my dizziness.

I do not have a family doctor to go to, they are very difficult to get in my city, and was unable to sit and wait in a clinic due to my dizziness.

I m sorry you are having a tough time.

Its not possible to day with absolute certainty that it is miscarriage you have had though it looks like that according to the signs you mentioned.   Please try these things to make you feel better.1. Hydrate yourself by drinking plenty of water.2. You can take an over the counter anti emetic or ranitidine tablet 150mg half an hour before food once or twice for a day or two to help you with nausea.3. Maintain menstrual hygiene.4. Get plenty of rest.5.

Moreover, drugs used to treat her mental condition should be used with caution during pregnancy as most of them are teratogeneic. In the situation described by you, couple counselling should be done to achieve good result. More than medication, your friend needs a patient listener and counselor with whom she can confidently share her sorrow. Hope you find this information useful. Take care."},{"Patient":"So my boyfriend and I had anal and he cummed in me and when he pulled out he said he thinks that some of his cum dripped down to my vagina and he said he felt his cum on the outside of his vagina but we weren't sure if it was his cum or my wetness. How likely is my chance of getting pregnant after that?? I can't consult any other doctor and I have no way of getting a pregnancy test or the pill. Also I skipped my period for the last couple of months so i hav no idea when I will get my period or when I'm ovulating. I'm scared:(((","Doctor":"Hello,Here, you should undergo one blood test for beta-HCG & TVS scan (2-3 weeks after unprotected sex) to rule out possibility of pregnancy.In exclusion of pregnancy, causes of skipping period are ovarian cyst (most common), hormonal imbalance, over wt/ loss, irregular diet habit, mental stress, psychological factors etc.Following above test report, you need to consult with gynecologist for other relevant investigations to pin point the diagnosis. Take suggestive measures accordingly.Practice safe sex in future. Good luck."},{"Patient":"I have had a cough for many years (10+) and can't seem to get to the source of the problem.   I've seen just about every doctor possible and taken just about every test possible to no avail.  I have also been suffering from erectile malfunction for possibly even longer.  For one thing, I wonder if the two together can point to a rare peculiar condition?  But primarily it is the cough that is impacting my life at this time.","Doctor":"Hello, Any physical or organic problems, if chronic, can affect your mental and general physical wellness and can contribute to erectile dysfunction. There may not be a direct relationship with these two. Pleas get advise from a pulmonologist. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. K. V.

Following ovulation, mild to moderate vaginal discharge is common phenomena but it is not a 100% surest feature of ovulation. So chance of being pregnant is there.Here, you should undergo one home pregnancy test after missed period and blood test for beta-HCG after 7 days to confirm.Following test report, consult with gynecologist for other relevant investigation & next line management. Good luck."},{"Patient":"I recently have had an incident where me and my partner had unprotected sex. He did not ejaculate in me, or at all for that matter, but ever since, I have had strange symptoms. I had my period in March that ended on the 12th (the following week is when the unprotected event occured.) My period has always been irregular, but I do get it every month. Hopefully I get it this upcoming week, but about a week after the unprotected event - I spotted once. I went to the bathroom, went to wipe, looked at the paper, and there was a light pink blood, not a lot, just enough to notice. And that was that. This has never happened to me before. Is that a sign of implantation? Also I have had incredibly sore breasts, feel exhausted all the time, occasionally cramp, and am moody. I usually get moody and sore breasts before my period, but not like this. Am I pregnant? If the spotting did indicate implantation today would mark a rough guess of 3 weeks or so. Is it too early to use a home pregnancy test?","Doctor":"Hello,Unprotected sex by withdrawal method has failure rate near about 14%. Precum or prostatic fluid (released before ejaculation) contains small amount sperm and causes pregnancy in some percentage. Though it depends on fertile days.Pink spotting may indicate implantation bleeding. To confirm, you need to undergo one blood test for beta-HCG & TVS scan around 4-5 weeks (from LMP) for accurate result.Following test report, consult with your gynecologist for next line management. Good luck."},{"Patient":"Could i be pregnant?

I'm really worried I could be pregnant, if I was I'd be 5 weeks.","Doctor":"Hello,Taking emergency pill within first 24 hrs gives protection more than 95% against unwanted pregnancy. Withdrawal bleeding appears within 7 days (similar to period).As you got your period, then chance of being pregnant is less. Though, you need to confirm it by doing one home pregnancy test or blood test for beta-hcg.Following test report, you need to consult with your gynecologist for next line management.Wear tight breast support to get relief from discomfort.

Thank You","Doctor":"Hello,In this stage of pregnancy, changing position of the growing baby is quite normal and you have nothing to worry.To avoid premature birth, you sleep in left lateral position, take adequate bed rest in divided time (8-10 hrs at least), avoid all kind of heavy works, do not douching vagina or insert tampon which may cause infection, avoid sexual intercourse also, take healthy diet with prescribed iron/ calcium/ vitamin tabs and do periodic check up for assessment of the baby well being.All the best."},{"Patient":"my last day of period was 28 th april 2013, i am 28 ,on 14 day from my period date i had unprotected sex with my husband. i already have child. i dont want to be pregnent. is there chances of my pregnency??/ pls help me.","Doctor":"Hello,Unprotected sex on 14th day of cycle has high probability of being pregnant.

Would it be possible for him to have dry semen on his hand, finger me, and get me pregnant? Also, i went to the bathroom a little while ago, and saw a little spotting. Is this normal?","Doctor":"hello,Condom and pull out method has also failure rate for some percentage if you did sex on fertile days. On fingering with dry semen, chance of being pregnant is quite less & rare.Little spotting may be occurred due to hormonal imbalance and it is quite normal. You would wait for next coming normal period and if it is delayed more than 7 days, you need to undergo one home pregnancy test initially & blood test for beta-hcg to confirm.Consult with gynecologist after that.
