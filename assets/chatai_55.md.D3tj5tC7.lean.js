Also a regular routine exercises like morning walk depending on your medical fitness would also be helpful.In addition, I would also go for a CBC, serum amylase and lipase, and an LFT to rule out the chances of this being a chronic pancreatitis. An abdominal ultrasound would rule out the pathology in the liver, and a recurrent stone in the common bile duct (CBD). Till the reports of all these investigations along with the result of a clinical assessment are available, I would advise you for an anti spasmodic and a proton pump inhibitor drug for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Asthma as such is usually allergic meaning it gets triggered when exposed to allergens, pollen, dust etc. This exposure causes swelling and increased secretions in the bronchi causing narrowing of the bronchi and wheeze.

After some time, I've finally located on the back of a piece of furniture, there were tiny, hairy black spots growing all over the surface area. I've cleaned everything with bleach and sanitize everything and I stopped smelling the moldy smell. However, for past two-weeks, I keep smelling a strong pungent urine smell everywhere, especially at night as I lay in bed before falling asleep. During the day the smell is more faint and doesn't last as long. But at night it seems like my bed was once soaked in a pool of urine but is now dry; when I smell every surface area of the bed, it smells like clean linen but the urine smell just floats in the air. Dreadful as it sounds, I actually get down on the carpet and sniff for the smell and I find nothing. I own a small dog for almost three years now, he is house-trained and only goes outside or in a designated area in the house (we trained him to use a litter box.) I checked the carpet area around his litter box and there are no urine smell either. When it smells so bad and someone is home with me, I ask if they smell it too but no one never smell anything. I have had migraine headaches for years and when the pungent smell lingers for too long it triggers my migraine. Every day for two-weeks now, I would wake up with a runny nose and sneezing for the first 30-45 mins. When I get out to go to school or at work, I sometime smell a faint urine smell as well, it reoccurs outside of home. This have led me to searching online: some people smell cat urine during their pregnancy or it is a bodily smell. I am not pregnant and I do not have any vaginal disorder or bodily smell, so could it be that I am just imagining it?I did not hit my head or am suffering from any concussion. The smell is too strong to disregard. Is this a psychological disorder? Is there a way to treat this problem? Could it be an allergy? I apologize for such a long post and thank you for your valuable time.","Doctor":"Hello,You need to consult a Neurologist to ensure that the migraine attacks are not as frequent as you think. There are several types of migraine, or worse case scenario he would ask you to get a sleep deprived EEG done to ensure there are no abnormalities with a MRI backup.Allergy tests are certainly required, specific IgE blood test against aeroallergens including molds to ensure that the rhinitis bit is figured out.Long acting antihistamines with nasal sprays will help.Cinnarizine is an antihistamine that combined with paracetamol and domperidone has anti-migraine effects, so may be worth trying.Best Wishes."},{"Patient":"I've had pains in my chest at the top of my ribs and across top of back, like I've been punched, I've been short of breath more then normal (I do have asthma)  and have been coughing flem up all the time.

I hear about a once a year shot; cortizone maybe? people get that really helps, but doctors don't offer it or want to give it when asked about it; why?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for posting,It seems to me you are having a typical case of persistent generalized allergies which often can be very resistant to common antihistamines and may require further therapies. Cortisone has proven to be very useful in the treatment of persistent allergies and you could get about 1-3 shots yearly depending on how well you respond to treatment. But most doctors always want to see if the benefits of giving you cortisone shots out weighs the side effects that come with it. Others you can rely on are allergy shots. Allergy shots help your body get used to allergens, the things that trigger an allergic reaction. They don’t cure allergies, but eventually your symptoms will get better and you may not have allergic reactions as often.  Allergy shots, also called \\"immunotherapy,\\" may work for you if allergy medicines don’t work well for you or you have symptoms more than three months a year.How often will you be getting the shot will depend on how well you respond to initial treatment. At first, you’ll go to your doctor once or twice a week for several months. You’ll get the shot in your upper arm. It will contain a tiny amount of the thing you’re allergic to say pollen, pet dander, mold, dust mites, or bee venom, for example. The shots dose will keep going up until you reach maintenance dose. After that, you’ll usually get a shot every 2-4 weeks for 4-5 months. Then your doctor will gradually increase the time between shots until you’re getting them about once a month for 3-5 years. During that time, your allergy symptoms will get better and may even go away. If your symptoms haven't improved after a year of shots, your doctor will talk to you about other treatment options.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi, I suffered from cold approx  1 year back. The cold stayed for approx 2 to 3 months and then I consulted a doctor. He gave me antibiotics and also asked me to do X-Ray to check for sunus but there was no Sinus however my Nasal route was clogged. The cold subsided and eventually healed. As a result I stoppe taking antibiotic.

If this is negative then you can consider waiting to see if it comes.If there are any symptoms of hormonal issues mentioned above then your doctor may consider blood tests.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi sir , i am having skin allergy , after taking any food i am getting red rashes and swelling in skin especially in hand it is itching too much , my doctor suggested me to take 'montek LC' tablet after taking that i feels normal , once i stopped problem getting started again and also i am taking medicine for epilepsy along with montek LC , please give me some suggestions on this problem sir .","Doctor":"Hi this clearly suggests that you are suffering from allergy. Since red rashes, itching and swelling is more in hands I advice you to wear full sleeve cotton dress and glouses to avoid any contact with allergen, daily wash your dress with hot water and sun dry them. Also the area you are staying should be dust free. With these you can continue montelukast 10 alone without LC every day and levocetrizine only when required(For symptoms). You can apply topical mometasone cream, this will help you in preventing the rashes to occur.Thhe permanent cure is to avoid allergen and if not possible get done skin prick test to find the allergen and then sensitization therapy/immunotherapy can be given.Hope this is more informative and helps you in management.Regards"},{"Patient":"I just gave my 2 year old a bed time snack consisting of banana and avocado, within minutes she had a couple of itchy spots on her cheek.

Do consult your child's doctor for thorough examination and assessment.Hope this helps.Regards,Dr. Divya Kuttikrishnan"},{"Patient":"Hello  Dr. Grief, i just want ask about the effect of prednisone.

Sometimes this gets aggravated with fever and slight coughing. The pediatrician asks us to give him Levolin 0.63 respules 3-4 times a day and Budecort 0.5 respules 2 times a day for 10-15 days when such an episode happens. It is seen that there is recovery that relives him of the immediate stress, but the persistent congestion, which I feel most when i place my hand on his back when he sleeps continues almost all the year through. I notice that he has become lethargic and tires easily. I also had a blood allergy test (general) done which showed high range. But specific test was ruled out by the local doctor as he feels that children this age would show allergies for multiple things which they shall build immunity with age. Along with the nebulisation, i also give him a anti-allergic like atarax or alerid one spoon, once a day. But all this has not elimated the congestion.Let me also mention that both myself and my son have beta thalassimia, and I also suffer from breathing difficulties at times.

It woke me up to my poor nutrition & I started to force myself to eat even when i was not hungry.  It took a while for the pain to get better.  It weakened & over time dropped lower, right to the bend with my left leg.

I am Dr shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, at the first instance I would insist for a regular timing of your diet. Keeping your stomach empty for a long time predisposes its mucosa to harmful effects of the natural acid produced inside the stomch, and if continued result in inflammation and possible ulcer formation in the long run. This could result in gastritis or a peptic ulcer in you giving rise to such symptoms of pain in the abdomen specially when your stomach remained empty. I would advise you initially for a proton pump inhibitor and a liquid antacid for a symptomatic relief at least for six weeks. In case it does not help, or the pain increases, I would not mind to refer you to a gastro-enterologist  for a possible endoscopic evaluation of your gastro intestinal tract.

I still have a dry tickle where I want to cough (it's only a little cough) and tightness in the chest area.  Do you think this is just asthma or related to nasal drip?

I am on Zoloft, Karvezide 300mg and Phototens.","Doctor":"Hi, when there is nasal drip, it is supposed to be the bronchial constriction, and there could be some infection as well so you are week, and could not do the work.

You have not mentioned your age, gender and risk factors for anginal heart disease. These are important in evaluation.2. A pain which comes on exertion but goes with rest, is retrosternal and is definitely related to exercise is likely to be anginal. But pain which does not have relation to exercise, lasts for days together, changes with posture is unlikely to be cardiac in origin. 3. Duromine and drugs for asthma both increases load on heart and cause anginal pain in suitable circumstances.4. Since the pain is there for 1 week, I would request you to see your physician and get evaluated. SincerelySukhvinder"},{"Patient":"I have a loose piece of skin in my left nostril.

If I were your doctor, I would after a clinical assessment of your abdominal findings, advise you for some routine tests like a CBC, clotting profile, a routine/microscopic/culture sensitivity test of the urine to rule out a UTI, a gm stain and a culture sensitivity of any vaginal discharge to rule out a PID, a routine stool test for ova and cyst, a serum amylase and lipase to rule out pancreatic pathology, a LFT, and in addition an ultrasound of abdomen to assist in the diagnosis of any intra-abdominal pathology. A gynaecological assessment for the bleeding would also be warranted. Till then I would advise you for a proton pump inhibitor and an anti spasmodic drug for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Out side food might cause intestinal infections specially amebiasis in some regions which might give rise to gaseous distension and pain abdomen. For this I would advise you for a routine stool test for ova and cyst, and treat it if positive.Next important advice would be to avoid alcoholic beverages, which might along with the spicy food cause trauma to the gastric and intestinal mucosa, apart from causing inflammation to the pancreas and liver giving rise to your symptoms.If I were your doctor, I would advise you for some routine investigations like a CBC, a blood sugar, blood urea, serum creatinine, serum uric acid, an LFT, a serum amylase and lipase, and an ultrasound of abdomen to see the status of intra-abdominal organs. In addition, I might refer you to a gastro enterologist for a possible endoscopic evaluation of your gastro intestinal tract to rule out the possibility of a peptic ulcer resulting from spicy food and alcohol intake.Some modification in your diet like more of roughage, enough liquids, avoidance of oily, fried, and fast food, and avoidance smoking if you do in addition to avoidance of alcohol would go a long way to help you out.Till then you could go for a proton pump inhibitor along with an anti spasmodic drug for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I just began allergy shots 3 months ago.  My blood pressure and pulse have always been normal.  Since 7/21/2013, my blood pressure and pulse have gone up drastically.  I was sent to have a d-dimer work up.  The test came back at .7.  My doctor requested I go to the ER because he thought I might have a PE.  The d-dimer at the hospital came back at .97 - yep, higher, however, my lung scan came back normal.  I have been placed on 12.5 mg Metorprolol.  The blood pressure is staying down but the pulse still ranges between 90 and 110.  Then, thoughts of Thyroid issues came up, so I had a thyroid scan.  Yep, Normal.   I decided not to have my allergy shot this week to see if the shots have anything to do with the sudden increase in blood pressure.  Not really feeling much difference in skipping the shots vs. getting the shots.    Oh, and my nasal passage seems blocked.  I have been having a hard time breathing through my nose.  cant even do a nasal rinse.  It wont come out the other side.  Any suggestions?

At first I thought it is just lingering after the illness because it was a bad one.  I do have asthma but no allergies. My asthma is the type where ones body produces extra mucous.  I cough up white thick sticky gunk and sometimes it has a pale yellow color.  I have noticed at times my voice gets hoarse, not bad but I can tell its differant at times.  I have had multiply chest xrays, i have had a chest CT scan and the only thing it said in the report was this: Few upper limits normal sized mediastinal lymhph nodes slight increase in size from the Octoaber 2010 CT.  I know when they run the inflamation CRP test its like around 11 something and I know the normal is below 1.  No one is giving me an expanation.  Could this be just my next stage of asthma or something else.  my family history is my dad died at age 51 of a heart attack, My mom had her 1st heart attack at age 41 and died of congested heart failure at age 68, my half brother died at age 58.   I am 50, I don't smoke, drink, i am morbidly obese and just got diagnosed with sleep apnea and RLS.  I have had so many respitory illness such as bronchitis and pnuemonia I can't even begin to count.  I have had 2 sinus surgeries.  My cough is embarresing and I want to know why I am coughing.  In 2010 I believe was the year, I received a brand new prescription that had Methascopolomine Hydrobromide in it, after 20 minutes of taking my 1st pill of this prescription I was having stroke like syptoms and ended up in the ER room and hospital overnight.  A pharmacy accidently overdosed me with methascopolomine is what the ER doctor said is what happened.  It was about 1 month after this episode i came down with a very bad bout of bronchitis which turned into pneumonia.  Could this play into my persistent cough?  I have seen several doctors over this and no one seems to care to find out the cause.  Should i let it go and just deal with it or shall I keep searching for a reason.   My thought was-if it is like cancer-lets nip it in the butt but so far i learned nothing.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for using HCM.With the history, it does not look like asthma. Asthma is a type of allergic reaction, presents with wheezing, breath less ness with cough. I advice you to get done spirometry, as this will help you to find whether you are suffering from asthma or COPD.In your case you have RLS and also may be chronic pharyngitis extending even to larynz. Your CRP shows you are being infected some where. Get examined by direct & indirect laryngoscopy and get done once early morning sputum (yellow colour) / throat swab culture and sensitivity to treat the infection.You should reduce your weight, do regular 30 min outdoor exercises along with breathing exercises and have only required amount of calorie.Hope this answered your question. Get back with the reports and also detailed explanation on your symptoms for future discussion on your management. Consult your doctor for further examination and management. Feel free to ask me if you have any further queries.Wish you good health.

As I got older I wasn't bothered with hay fever all that often but during the winter I would get a touch of sinusitis. This year, in Dublin Ireland where I live the pollen count has been particularly high and when I had a cough in May which mostly went but left me with a slight tickle I put it down to hayfever. This was because I had the itchy nose and eyes. Last week I still had a bit of congestion but found a little difficulty breathing. When I had that difficulty for two consecutive nights I went to the doctor. Although my spirometer test was good he prescribed Beclazone 100mg and Salmonal 100mg inhalers. The problem however is that on Saturday after using the inhalers as instructed and Sunday morning, I've had a burning sensation in my chest and tightness and I was breathing quite shallow. If i concentrated I could take a deep breath. I have been diagnosed with low blood pressure but on Saturday my readings were on average 121/68 pulse 80,(I have a blood pressure cuff at home) and had a headache all day. I realise that they are not very high readings but my norm would be 90's/60's. All day Sunday I was uncomfortable with this warm sensation in the chest though it became less intense as the day progressed. I also had a burning sensation between the shoulder blades but that went after a whole too. I was very nervous about taking the inhalers so I skipped last nights dose. This morning I have much less of the burning sensation and tightness. My question is, is this burning sensation and tightness reflecting the inhalers doing their job or am in fact having a reaction to the medication. I stopped taking the dose as the patient leaflet in the belcazone box said if you felt it difficulty breathing or tightness in the chest to stop taking it. Thank you for taking the time to read this and I look forward to your advice.","Doctor":"HIThank for choosing HCM,Mam you became, apprehensive in regards to your problem, it is all the allergic constitution and it takes fairly enough time to to come around, during this time period you need to control your thoughts, otherwise this could lead to illusive, delusive, phenomenon, just react normally every thing seems alright, Have good day."},{"Patient":"I am a 36 y/o female and I have been experiencing lower abdominal fluttering for about a week and a half.

He went in for an implant on a Wed. He got 2 shots of local anesthetic because the first one didn t seem to be working/ strong enough. The dentist also found he had an infection under the crown next to the implant although he did not give my husband Amoxicillin until Friday. On Friday my husband went back to dentist for more local anesthetic and root canal . He came home around noon, ate lunch, and started Amoxicillin. From that evening he started feeling really dizzy and nauseous. On Sat he almost could not function; he was eating but almost vomited and he had to take a very long nap in the afternoon because he was just too dizzy. Slowly, over the weekend, he began to feel better and was able to drive and go to work on Mon. He kept taking Amoxicillin for 10 days. Does this seem like an allergic reaction or a toxicity from too much anesthetic? Reaction to PABA or some other chemical in anesthetic? Dentist seems to think it is an allergy to Amoxicillin .... but my husband has taken antibiotics before w/o such a reaction. Also, he began to feel strange on Thurs even BEFORE starting Amoxicillin.","Doctor":"Hello, Thank you for the detailed query. However, the timeline of starting amoxicillin is a bit confusing when you say 'from that evening (i.e., Friday) he started amoxicillin' while the last sentence contradicts this. Anyway, you are right that this is unlikely a reaction to amoxicillin as he had CONTINUED to take this and was all right. If the 'dizziness' was part of a reaction to penicillin, then he would have been far worse after that! Local anaesthetic (LA) allergy or an intolerance reaction is more likely. Why I say intolerance is because occasionally adrenaline is mixed with the LA and if the injection accidentally goes into the blood stream you feel the adrenaline effects. Your husband definitely needs a full workup to ensure he is not allergic to LAs and there are several of them. Skin prick testing, followed by intradermal testing and if he does not react a subcutaneous challenge is then indicated. If he passes all these tests, he is NOT allergic. If he is alergic to the LA he was given then a series of other LA needs to be done at the same time so that cross reactivity is excluded.

As you have got asthma, any activity which triggers or worsens the attack may give rise to such symptoms due to low oxygen saturation in the blood.

It is likely that the stomach ache and intractable vomiting that she experiences now, are due to gastritis, probably induced by pain killers/iron preparation(Livogen Z). I suggest that Livogen Z may be stopped for a few days and  Veloz D may be continued, which will help in relieving her symptoms. Tab.

I was am a hypothyroidism patient and I was taking Levothyroxine for about 7 years with my dosages going up and down but mostly up. Well, about a month and a half ago, I had to see the ER Doctor because I was having chest pains..caused by my recent (higher) dosage prescribed by doctor. I was on 75mcg of Levothyroxine and my doctor increased my dosage to 100mcg. After about 13 days I started having the chest pain like mentioned and went to the Emergency Room. I told the doctor about my chest pain, about the new dosage raise and about in time past that another doctor tried to raise my prescription to 100mcg and it done the same thing...gave me bad chest pain. I told the ER Doctor I was tired of the Levothyroxine cause it would only work for 2-3 months and would begin to stop working and when other doctors would raise me up to the 100mcg mark it would cause my chest to hurt. So, I asked if he would prescribe me Armour Thyroid to see if it would be better. So the ER doctor prescribed it for me with a dosage of 60mg equal to the 100mcg in Levothyroxine.

Since you are telling many lymphnodes get done one USG neck to see if any significant lymphnodes present there and also one complete hemogram to check or infection or other blood related problem. Lymphnodes are normar structures present as a barrier and if only significant enlargement is a problem. Consult your doctor for local and systemic examination once and management.

The room is a very old (700 year old) stone and plaster room in Austria. During the time I lived there I seemed to develop allergic reactions (sneezing, runny nose) to ordinary substances like wine and fruit. I also developed numbness in the ball of my right foot and toes (the smallest and its neighbor). I do smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol. Since I was living in a famous wine village, I drank a lot more wine than usual. I developed a hacking cough that has been so severe at times that I actually had a seizure (convulsing fingers then fell to the floor with my head and knee banging against the wall for about 20-30 seconds in a semi-conscious state)... the seizure only happened once. I moved out of the old flat and into a modern flat in Germany 3 months ago. The numbness continues, the coughing and sneezing too & I just had a second seizure from coughing. I read some things about \\"mold sickness\\" on the internet. Is that a real possibility or just nonsense? I know I should see a doctor and will as soon as I am financially able. Can you offer any temporary advice? I forgot to mention that there was a lot of mold growing visibly on the walls (it was an old wine cellar).","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for posting on HCM,First of all we would need to keep allergy aside as an exclusive causes, then consider the risk factors at hand that could predispose you to a potential lung diseases. Allergy could be considered with runny nose and sneezing, but i fear cough might be due to another underlying lung diseases.You were: - living in a moldy old house- heavy smoking and drinking- had a seizure episode- your symptoms are cough and sneezing/rhinorrheaMold sickness could be traduced into simply traduced in medical terms as inflammatory process of an organ tissue, which could be of the lungs with infection with fungi, bacteria, mycobacteria/tuberculosis. Mold illness/sickness is not an allergy.  It is inflammation within the body which is caused by an immune system that has gone haywire.  The term \\"mold illness\\" is a subcategory of biotoxin illness, called Chronic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (CIRS). If they were molds were you lived, then aspergillosis could be the origin or even mycobacterium.At your level, there is little you can do to relief yourself of the condition and it is best you see a doctor as soon as possible.There are other possibilities that needs to be ruled out, such as tuberculosis, lung cancer, bronchiectasia etc.Hope this helps and wish you the best"},{"Patient":"I have been really tired last I want to say 3 weeks maybe and I went to the dr. finally last week he did ekg and said I probably just needed to drink more water because I do not drink much through out the day . also went to allergist and they said could b my sinuses but were testing my blood for mono and checking white blood count although its just a procationary. what do u think it could b and I wa sput on 4 mg of a steroid for inflammation but first does made me nausus so I stopped and hacve to go in again tomorrow . should I b worried?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for using HCM.You are giving history of only tiredness and no other symptoms and also not written your blood tests reports.

Treatment of the upper respiratory tract infection by warm water gargles, anti histamines, and anti-biotics (if needed)2. Asthalin inhaler- provide symptomatic relief by causing broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs)So, you can use it whenever you are having an acute attack.3. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of seasonal allergies & asthma.4. Anti-tussives can also be used to provide symptomatic relief from cough.5.

After a clinical assessment, I would go for a stool test for ova and cyst, a urine routine/microscopic and culture sensitivity test to rule out a UTI, and treat it if found positive which should relieve you of your problem. In addition, an ultrasound of abdomen would help us in ruling out a gall stone disease which not infrequently would give rise to pains and bloating feeling after meals specially a fatty meal. Till these reports are available, I would advise you for a proton pump inhibitor, a probiotic and an anti spasmodic drug if need be for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I am 30 and never smoked before.","Doctor":"Hello,An opacity in in a chest x-ray with cough and fever usually due to either due to a community acquired pneumonia or pulmonary tuberculosis. Now, you had said that you are exposed to mushrooms, it can cause a syndrome called acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis but in this case there is confluent opacities bilaterally.

I am 66 yearsold,female.  I tend to have problems with nonspecific itchiness....the middle of my back, then the palms of myhands will itch.  No rhyme nor reason it seems.  I was also diagnosed with allergy induced asthma when I developed the penicillin allergy.  I have done well the last few years and have not needed any inhalers.  I seem to have weird symptoms now that I'm older, such as the itchiness,but also experience my tongue becoming irritated for no apparent reason, or a sore throat will develop.  I must say none of my symptoms are particularly serious, just annoying.

About 3 1/2 weeks ago I had a random cough. After a Half a week, a cold came in so I thought I was experiencing post nasal drip. Then my cold stopped but the cough continued and got worse and worse. Louder, Harder, and started to become consistent. So I went to the doctors and they gave me an inhaler and anti-virus biotics because i showed symptoms of bronchitis and from there on my cough started to fade away. After using the whole bottle it is gone and the puffer had like 300 puffs on it. (No way i'm supposed to use it all) So after a week has gone by, the cough is returning and i'm coughing up phlem again. (MY first phlegm was like brown, then green, then clear) Now the phlegm is just clear but the cough is returning. What's wrong with me?","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for using HCM.With your history you had suffered from viral infection and I think doctor has prescribed you for bronchodilator(inhaler) with anti inflamatory and anti histaminic(bottle). Phlegm being brown then green colour suggest bacterial infection. You can try concentrated salt water gargle, three times a day, steam inhalation, tab Paracetamol 650mg two times a day and tab levo cetrizine one at night for a day along with the inhaler. So after this if the same symptoms continues then i prefer you to meet doctor for examination and can take antibiotic. If you have wheeze, breathless ness i suggest you to meet doctor today only.

And also kept Asthalin (Salbutamol) inhaler for SOS use. Whether such a long use of this drug is alright or I should stop taking them. Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for writing to health care magic. In bronchial asthma during a acute episode we use bronchodilators like salbutamol that you are using. To prevent recurrent episodes we use preventors like budesonide etc to prevent further attacks. After a long use of steroid inhalation your doctor may try and stop those medications to see if there are further attacks. If there are no symptoms you can stop those medications. But if there are symptom recurrences a long term use is required. The side effects out weigh the advantages.

So if in same season the chance of AR is more. For dry cough during cold without wheeze / ronchi, albuterol is not required.This may be due to post nasal drip. Cough syrup with codeine will be good as it is a cough supressant but you also have to take anti inflamatory drugs with anti histamine like Tab.Sinarest. Do salt water gargle.

Whatever the case, what I would recommend is that you avoid the dungeness or blue crab so that you will not trigger the allergic reaction again.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.All the precautions including birth control pills are not 100% fool proof in protection against a pregnancy. If I were your doctor, I would go for a serum HCG determination to rule this out as urine PT is not always fool proof. In addition an ultrasound might also be helpful. However, the frequency in urination could also be due to a UTI and so I would also advise you for a urine routine/microscopic/culture sensitivity test and treat the infection if found positive. This would relieve you of your problem.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

She has stomach problems on a regular basis and has lately developed trouble with being able to get a deep breath. The stomach issues started Thanksgiving a year ago and were diagnosed at the time as stomach migrains. She became very aware of her heart about 2 to three months ago and tells me that she feels it stop beating and then sometimes complains of a sour, lemony feeling around her heart. Her heart rate is variable from around 70 bpm to 115 during these complaints. The breathing problems started about 4 to 5 weeks ago and has sent us racing to the urgent care , emergency room , doctors office and specialist. We have recently even had an ambulance at the house. Her heart rate is often racing and she will begin to hyperventilate as a result of trying to catch her breath. She has normal blood pressure and O2 sat. is 98-100. Her family doctor put her on a steriod inhaler , and feels she is not getting air in the bottom of her lungs so she feels that she is not breathing although her oxygen intake is good. The Xrays of her lungs show a small amount of flem and some inflamation in the bottom two lobes. The Cardiac specialist said the original EKG showed one side of her heart larger than the other but the ECG did not give evidence of this. A 24 hour heart monter did show that her heart skipped two beats in a row two seperate times during the 24 hours, but nothing the doctor considered significant. She has been taking the steriod for two weeks and the breathing seems to be better, although she still feels that it is difficult to taking a full breath. They gave her tums to take when she feels like she is having a heart attack and told us to go home. She has always been extremely healthy and is 53lbs. She is slender for her height but very muscular. She participates in competitive gymnastics and works out 4 times a week for 3.5 hours each time. I am not very satisfied witht he heart Doctors lack of concern for the skipped heart beats and get very concerned when my 8 year old tells me her heart is racing and ask is she is dying!

It s kind of a long story, but I went to the doctor about two weeks ago with tightness (inflammation) in my lungs. I m an asthmatic and have been since I as three months old. Any how, my doctor gave me an corticosteroid injection and some samples of Advair to get me by until my prescription of Symbicort came in. I went about a month without it and believe it caused quite some problem. Well out of embarrasement, I did not tell him that I also had been taking an L- arginine supplement for about 2 weeks. I should have done some research first, because after the fact I learned that this amino acid can cause inflammation in the lungs. I have been taking my normal medicines theophylline 200 mg tabs twice a day, rescue inhaler Proair as needed, and Symbicort 2 puffs twice daily. I am, however still having that feeling of tightness, like a rubber band around the rib cage. Most of the feeling comes during expiration. My asthma overall is much better in my adulthood as opposed to adolescence . My last severe attach was at age 16 when I was about to be put on a ventilator, but through God s grace was spared. I ve noticed that over the last month my blood pressure has been up and down. I would like to think this is due to all the chemicals (Nitric oxide and L-arginine) in addition to being out of my corticosteroid Symbicort.

I do not want to a make a habit of taking it though, as I find it hard on the nervous system . As an aside, I am treated for hypothyroidism and take 137 mcg of synthroid daily. I was wondering if this breathing issue could result from insufficient thyroid hormones. I have a feeling the effect pseudoephedrine has on my breathing is a result of its effect on my nervous system rather than its effect as a decongestant.

I am from India, working in Computer Sciences Corporation as a Manager. I have been suffering with an issue for a quiet long time now, for which I was not able to find a possible solution. I have been trying to contact many doctors in India but none proved to be helpful. So I have been searching online and came across the below link hoping this is the last go, I am trying to find out what is the problem with me.  dermatology .ca/find_derm/profiles/index.html When ever I have fever, loose motions ( Diarrhea ) or any health issues, I usually go for medication to abort the process , but some times some medication results in itchy sensation on my lower lip initially and with in an hour, the lower lip starts swelling. And it remains for a few days until it gets dried up. Later it forms a dark patch and comes off as a dead skin. But in the end, my lip and the surroundings remain dark for ever. This happened a few times with me. And when ever I had this problem, I immediately consulted doctor and they tried medicating me with a tablet or a shot called evil which works as a allergy neutralizer it seems. But that never worked for me. A kind man once told me that this happens when there is sulpher in the medication I take. From then I started avoiding medicines with sulpher content. But recently a couple of days back this issue repeated and this time the medication did not have sulpher content. But still my lower lip swelled and I rushed to doctor and its the same result, the doctor was not able to help. I researched online and came to know , that this could possibly be : Anaphylaxis for which the only solution is to avoid the drugs which cause allergy. But I dont know what causes me allergy exactly. I request you to kindly give me an advise , which could be a temporary or a permanent solution, but kindly advise.. as this problem is causing me some serious paranoids.

If you cannot do this all by your own, then you may need to visit a specialist and get testing done.a disease could also be a possibility but it distribution makes this option less likely. I will go 95% for an environmental trigger and 5% for a disease.Hope this helps. feel free to return to us.Wish you good health"},{"Patient":"Dear Sir / Mam, I am suffering from allergy cough in night only from last 2 months. and also liver pain and mild enlargement of liver from last 4 years Kindly provide manufacturer of phalatricadi kashay.

Your problem started with sudden pain in the upper abdomen, which you assumed to be gas- now you had cough and the same are discomfort started . The most probable cause of such a pain which has recurred can be due to the following, considering you have no other symptoms:-Costochondritis as the most common reason as you do not have any other symptoms.Another probable causes can be : Gall bladder, liver inflammation. I would advise you the following: To get an X-ray of the chest and abdomen and ultrasonography of the abdomen to rule out any internal problem.-Get a local examination done by a General Surgeon so that the costochondritis or so can be confirmed and treated accordingly."},{"Patient":"hi, im 43 year old female and approx 3 months ago i had a respitory lung infection, which has taken a long time to get better... just recently i have been becoming increasing short of breath after taking coughing fits and talking. i have tried my husbands inhaler and this does note help, but when i take a puff of his steriod inhaler it calms me down.","Doctor":"these are allergies and inhalers are preventors steroid help but it should be taken restrictlyyou have allergies and antibioyics trigger themstart with montelucast 10 mg bdbronchodilator syp tfdantacid stp tdsdo for 3 wkafter that go to allergy doctor anf get treatment for curing"},{"Patient":"female - wondering what kind of doctor to call tomorrow to get appt.

I have combination of symptoms which tend to worsen together, usually as the day progresses. They are: chest and abdomen spasm , utterly unlike asthma, which make me feel I can t breathe in, although my o2 sats are normal; the sensation of neck being wrenched forwards; odd pinching in the nose; and tingling in the feet. I am a middle-age man with a history of asthma and, more recently, mild/moderate obstruction, probably caused by smoking, which I gave up 3 years ago. My best FEV is about 75% of normal and I am hyerinflated (up to 110% of normal). ECG and an exercise test have shown nothing wrong with my heart; and although I am a bit overweight, have a hiatus hernia and sometimes get reflux , the gastroenterologist does not think I get oesophageal spasms. Sometimes, these symptoms simply diappear, and although highly uncofortable, they do not prevent me from walking briskly for long distances, cycling, or walking up stairs. A while ago I was thought to be suffering from anxiety, but I doubt it. I was on citalopram and lorazepam , but they did not seem to help, and I am no longer taking them. I take an inhaled corticosteriod and a salbutamol-ipotropium (?) preventer. Could my level of obstruction be causing thing this (my specialist and GP do not think so)?

XXX, I am XXXX, 56 yrs. old. I go to the gym and do cardio exercises everyday. After workout I enter the Steam Room for added comfort. However, since 1985 i started having Asthma . It starts with a Cough & then Asthma comes in. Ventolin Inhalers comforted me until I switched to Symbicort Inhalers 4 years ago. Until Lately I switched back to Ventolin thinking that Symbicort w/ Steroid can Cause Throat Irritation and Severe Side Effects & Erectile Dysfunction as compared to Ventolin.With this, I would like to ask which is better to use Ventolin Inhaler or Symbicort Inhaler? I have been using Ventolin Inhaler before I switched to Symbicort Inhaler 200 mcg. Symbicort was good for me. I only take it once a day & sometimes after 2 or 3 days. there was even a time when a whole month passed w/out me taking a dose. I noticed that my chest tightness usually happens when my stomach is full after dinner at night. Lately I switched to Ventolin Inhaler again but its effect only lasted for about 12 hrs. before taking another dose. Now continuous cough due to irritation of the throat is what I experience before an attack. My throat is itchy & chest tightness follows. Will i just discontinue Ventolin & go back to Symbicort Inhalers? Or can you prescribed a better Inhaler for me? If so, what is the best medicine for me to take. Likewise, a medicine to stop irritation of my throat due to this Medicine. Your advice will greatly be appreciated. Thank you very much!","Doctor":"Hi, You are 56 years, you have asthma since 1985,and using symbicort, you get tight chest, after dinner, switched over to ventorlin.

With the help of these, you can greatly minimise the dose of the bronchodialator inhalers.                          ventorline is a short drug for bid dosage, and symbicort is with the action lasting for 24 hours.

This morning those patches have enlarged to cover a larger area on the back of my lower legs as well as the sides and front of the lower legs. There is slight swelling and no itching. Weather was sunny with the temperature 80 - 86. I did not venture into any of the wooded areas, but I did play from the short grass a number of times. The course was a little spongy with no standing water. This has happened before, but this rash is much worse than any of the previous times. This has been an issue only when golfing but not every time I golf. I do have allergies to the various pollens, one being timothy.

I think they are totally unrelated. Coughing hard may increase the abdominal pressure and open the sphincter that can release some gastric content back into the mouth that can explain some of this.if it were from the lung, then breathing alone should make you have this bad taste all the times.I personally advise against recreational drugs use. If you wish to consider stopping at this time, please consult with your treating physician. However, if you don't wish to right now, i respect your opinion.

Management consists of: 1. Inhalers- provide symptomatic relief by causing broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs) So, you can use it whenever you are having an acute attack. 2. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of seasonal allergies & asthma. 3. Antihistamines can also be used to provide symptomatic relief. 4. Protect yourself from exposure to cold, dust or other allergens. If symptoms still persist, it will be better to consult a Pulmonologist. Wishing you a Good Health.

We went back to the pediatrician and he again tested neg for any strep. She prescribed us with veramyst for allergies and said that sometimes kids just have large tonsils. The veramyst is clearly not working as I am observing both of his tonsils continuing to swell more with each day. The redness is no longer present. He is now snoring and struggling to breath at night when he sleeps. I understand that some people may have large tonsils but I m concerned at the rate of growth.

I am 47 years old and have had issues my whole life with diarrhea or at least very loose stools nearly every day and have sufferred severe stomach cramps and pain. I also have had nausea more days in my life than I haven t. Over the years, I ve had every test you can imagine starting when I was 10 years old. Nothing has ever been found. In fact, my parents were told that I was creating my symptoms for attention since my only other sibling has cerebral palsy . I even had a specialist I was referred to for fatty liver disease tell my the pains in my stomach were psychosomatic. After 3-4 days of no gluten products, I began to feel better. No diarrhea, no nausea, very little stomach pains. Yesterday I ate several biscuits with no other gluten in the entire day. About an hour after I ate the biscuits, I began to feel a tightness at the base of my throat. I thought it was heartburn, but there was never any burning and antacids didn t help. It continued to get worse and I felt that I had to consciously take deep breaths to get enough air. If I sipped on ice cold water the symptoms would subside for a few minutes - maybe 3 minutes then immediately return. I became concerned this was an allergic reaction to the gluten. I have no other allergies other than seasonal and Sulfa medications. I took a 25 mg Benadryl which did nothing. Two hours later, I took some pseudofed, the only other allergy medication I had on hand. I seriously considered going to the ER but the symptoms reached a certain level and stopped progressing so I did not go. It was 6-7 hours before the symptoms finally went away. I have always eaten a lot of bread and flour so I find it hard to believe that these three biscuits could have caused these symptoms, but I didn t have anything else that I haven t ever had before and this is the only thing I have eaten in a week that had any gluten in that I m aware of.

If it is the dust and the landlord is unwilling to remove it then it would have to be regularly cleaned each day.

I would advise you to have another Upper GI endoscopy as this is the only way to prove or disprove the presence of an ulcer or cancer. You also should undergo ultrasonography with color doppler to see if there is a possibility of an aortic aneurysm or any other problem.

I have a word document on my history of my treatments and feelings. No one seems to care. I truly feel that I don t have stress or anxiety. I have had these problems ever since I left South Korea for the military last year. This is my history: 1998 – Strep 2008 – Oral Thrush Treatment Aug. 2011 – Pneumonia Oct 2011 – March 2012 Fatigue that progressed to extreme fatigue. Which meant that I felt tired by mid-day which progressed to me being so tired by time I came home that I just needed to sleep. Irritable/Grouchy. Chest pressure, numbness and tingling in the hands, arms feel heavy and hard to lift above head, difficulty breathing, sinuses, eye pain, headaches, trouble concentrating/memory (fog), mucous, started to lose voice throughout the day. March 2012 – Treated for sinusitis . April – Diagnosed Asthma and given Advair 250 and Ventolin . Today I don’t feel like the Advair and Ventolin are doing much. Suggested to see a cardiologist. Negative results found. Cardiologist hinted at the fact it might be stress. June 2012 - Seen a holistic Dr and was told it could be from a stomach bacteria and treated me with oils a few times. Felt ok for a few days, but the symptoms returned. Eliminated dairy and it lessened the amount of mucous I had. Aug 2012 Started to see Dr. Fost who tested me for allergies and asthma. No allergic reactions . Were any of the tests for food allergies? Had a sinus CT scan. Went to see an ENT with the CT Scan and was told that there is nothing wrong with my sinuses except a little deviated septum and a little tightness in my right nostril. ENT suggested it might be anxiety. Chiropractor said that I’ve developed carpal tunnel in my hands/wrist (right wrist primarily). Sept 2012. Throughout months of my own research and trial and errors at home, I’ve found that my recent ability foul odors (without an odor being present) is due to a stomach bacteria. I went back to remembering that I had oral thrush that never fully went away. This was found to be candida. I spoke with a Blue Cross RN about candida who confirmed that it is a real thing and cause issues like mine. RN also asked about how it could be from GRD. For almost two weeks now I’ve been cleansing, using probiotics, and doing the candida diet. A lot of symptoms feel like they are going away. Sept 27 2012 - Feeling of a little fatigue returning and heavy shoulders. Sept 28 2012 – Visiting asthma and allergy specialist. Diagnosed with vocal dysfunction cord and not asthma. Taught breathing exercises and taken off the advair and ventolin. For two weeks feeling ok. Twice I was able to get myself to cough up phlegm at night when I has trouble breathing. Oct 8 2012 – Slipped on diet and had a regular burger and fries with no cheese. Within a few minutes after, I felt extremely tired and took a nap in the car. Don’t believe it’s vocal dysfunction cord. Oct 9/10 2012 - Numbness in tingling in right arm all night. A couple of times for a few minutes I felt it in my left arm. Chest pain in upper right area near arm pit. In the morning on the 10th the pain moved to the center of my chest. I make sure that don’t sleep on my side anymore to make sure that it is not from sleeping on my arms. Confirmed that it isn’t from sleeping on my side. Worried it’s a heart disease still or lung infection/bacteria. Currently, I get numbness and tingling in right arm. Chest pain that moves from upper right area to center of chest. A pain in chest when at work and think about doing a cell search (I’m a correctional officer). Shortness of breath and lightheaded after walking up and down stairs more than a few times.

Okay, recently I ve been experiencing a long list of seemingly unrelated symptoms including weight loss , brain fog, IBS type symptoms, depression , lack of motivation, acne-seems like cystic acne that are layered on top of one another that starts off with a painful bump and does not heal (also they seem to be interconnected in tunnels deep in my skin), slow wound heeling, weakness, dizziness , lack of appetite, poor blood circulation (numbness and tingling in the extremities or limbs will feel cold and turn kind of purple) , skin seems to be getting dirtier faster(when I take a shower it s like I came back from 3 days of camping), sensation of a bug landing on the skin followed by a hair or black speck expelling from my skin, constipation, skin and hair has lost luster, cognitive problems (sometimes its difficult to articulate a sentence because the word I m looking for escapes me), insomnia , mild mood swings and character changes (general disinterest), migraines or headaches, feels as though my vision isn t as sharp, change in food cravings (I used to have a mature palette now it s more childlike-French fries,bread,cake,fried foods). Possibly forgetting a few, nonetheless, an extensive list. I am the type of person that will slap on a smile and pretend that everything is fine until I can no longer ignore the problem so naturally I just learned to live with each symptom as they came. The acne got to a point where I didn t want to leave my house is when I started googling my symptoms and came to the conclusion that I had a dental abscess from a root canal that I had a year prior and the bacteria was coming through the nerves out through my face and morgellons disease also stood out. I went to the doctor and he prescribed me amoxicillin and my skin seemed to be getting better and it felt as though all the wounds on my body were healing. That was a 2 week stint and when I stopped the medication my healing immediately moved to a much slower pace. It s been about 2-3 months since then and my acne has gotten a lot better. There had been so many layers of acne and took a while to heal each layer-almost there. I feel a lot better now but I am starting to see signs that I m moving towards being infectious again. I was watching doctor oz. the other day and he was talking about celiac disease and gluten the silent killer. As I watched, a growing feeling of hey, I have just about all the symptoms of gluten intolerance and I feel that I have finally found the root cause of my many ailments (also morgellons disease is thought to be a variation of gluten intolerance). Finally, my question. Okay, I have to add a little more backstory my apologies. I have had an alcohol intolerance my whole life and in high school I started taking the prescription medication xanax (benzodiazepine) and for some reason while on Xanax I can drink almost as much as I want and not turn red or feel sick. Previously, one sip of beer would turn my whole body red and make me feel sick. Another side effect Xanax gave me was an uncontrollable hunger that is comparable to when someone smokes weed. It would make me crave foods high in sugar,greasy food, food generally bad for you and in inhuman amounts. I am 5 6 before Xanax around 103 pounds and up to 113 pounds after 2 years of taking Xanax. I quit Xanax a little over a year ago because it was beginning to make me get panic attacks (who knew taking anti-anxiety medication causes you to get anxiety). My point is that after I quit Xanax is when all these symptoms starting appearing given that it when my diet changed from only pigging out when on Xanax to craving those foods all the time which may have triggered the more severe symptoms of gluten allergies. Do you think there is a possible connection? There are so many possibilities of variances such as when I quit Xanax is also the time when I moved into my apt by myself (I previously lived with roommates) so it might be this environment. I am completely aware that I sound like a kook but I am living on my own and have been in such a vegetable state that I haven t worked in over a year and I have no energy and I need a reason besides I am just a lazy slob to my parents who have had just about enough of my inadequacies which I am in total agreeance with yet still cannot make the moves to change. Sorry I realize this is not a therapy session but any professional input would help. I am a 21 year old Korean female 5 6 and now about 96 pounds. I still eat a lot when I do eat and it s high calorie foods that are unhealthy but shouldn t be losing this much weight. Will try the gluten free route starting now...

Age- 71 years Diabetic. Follow he medicines given by doctors in Vellore. ( Tab Minipress XL 5mg, Ecospirin 75mg, stator 10mg, Alfusin, Sandocal D 500mg, Livogen and Glimpiridae 3mg). Later on doctor from our place prescribed insulin wosulin 30:70, unit mostly 10-12 unit at day and 4-6 unit at night, and also added with Repace H tablet at morning. His Cr. was 2.0, 2.2, 2.3 from last 2- 3months, once it became 2.5 again got down to 2.3. Rest his cholesterol was in normal range always. He got admitted due to stomach and urine infection, which doctors said sepsis . His WBC has got too high 0000 at first, neutrophilis 85%. His Cr. got high 3.3 urea -83 at first. Doctors gave him Cilaxter 250mg twice. His ECG reports shows ischemia . He started getting Inj. Omez, Inj. Zofer Tab nitrocontin, 2.6 mg Tab Nicardia retard 20mg Syrup Alkasol Tab urispas (as his prostate gland is little bit enlarged) Father used tab Alfusin from earlier. He is diabetic so he used Inj. Wosulin 30:70 as 10 unit at day and 4 unit at night. His BP record was on that day 134/80. Ecogram reports showed overall contractivity of LV is good. No RCSMA, trace peri cardial effusion (0.51cm) On the 2nd day night his BP 200/110, his Inj. Lasix started from that moment and Tab prozopress XL 2.5mg at bed time. His WBC got down to normal and cr. to 2.3 and urea 46. Cilaxter was for first 3 days but after 4 more days his WBC was 0000. Again he started getting Inj. Merotec 1gm IV twice. He started getting breathing problem and added with Tab Alpruli, Nebulisation with derihaler with derimide. Again his WBC got down gradually, but his Hb got low 8.6 so doctors gave weepox injection. After 2 days his blood reports showed WBC 9200, Cr. 2.9. Hb-9.4, Sodium and potassium is normal. Urine culture showed bacterial infection. Stool culture not done and blood culture report showed nil (testing not done properly. But his BS was high in PP. 200-250mg/dl and fasting was in 150 ranges, but earlier before getting infection his Fasting BS was normally 100-110mg/ He Spent another more week in ICU, he started getting ICU FEAR, which indicates ICU psychosys. Doctors said he got mild LVF, for what he is having breathing probs at early morning some times. We fixed to shift in RN tagore hopital in Kolkata, as this is shortest route by Air from our place. Because longer time in flight is not safe for him to go in Bangalore( as we planned). But on the 21st day suddenly at early morning he got massive attack, doctors said severe LVF. My father was restless at night and no specialist doctors observed at night time. And he went unconscious by morning 9.00 am. Medications given Inj. Iminem, Inj. Lasix, Nebulisation done, Inj. Dopamine, Inj, Deriphylin. After 3 hours BP was 106/ 60 and PR- 58/ min. He went in ventilation as bp - 86/60, pr- 46/ min, Oxygen saturation -60%. After 2 hr 40 mins his ECG was straight and oxygen intake. My question in this case is - IS THIS A LVF OR IT S DUE TO BLOOD INFECTION? If so LVF, THEN HOW MUCH TIME ( YEARS OR MONTHS) REQUIRED TO DEVELOPE LVF? My father used to say chest pain in right arm side, as he was asthmatic and was prone to cold, so we thought it is from asthma and come cold.

I was a letter carrier, and carried a satchel on my shoulder. I also am on a disability for SI Joint Dysfunction. For the past 3 yrs I get these eruptions of bumps, sometimes scaly on my scalp, and now one on my elbow, sores in my mouth, with EXCESSIVE amounts of mucous in the back of my throat, and a feeling as though the palate is swollen or the back of my throat is swollen. ENT said initially I had swollen tonsils, and prescribed an antiobiotic mouthwash which helped. But it keeps coming back. He sent a scope down my throat, and said everything looked clear. 6 yrs ago, during an endoscopy it was found that I had a yeast infection in my esophogus, and prescribed meds to clear it up. I have severe non rheumatoid arthritis since my 20 s in my hands. I ve had one partial rotator cuff tear , and one now has nerve impingement due to spurs. I am a bone spurrer on my hands, as well. I asked my rheumatologist if it could be psoriatic arthritis , since I ve always had arthritic conditions or ligament issues, and now am getting these skin eruptions. He didn t think so. Well, when the one on my elbow went into a bump and got another recurrence on my scalp I asked to get a biopsy. The biopsy diagnosis is seborrheic keratosis. For over 2 yrs, I ve had monthly (it seems) episodes where I feel as though I can t get air. My oxygen levels are always in the 98% range. A pulmonary function test results: Pulmonary Obstructive Disease and told to take an inhaler. (doesn t really seem to help) 4 out of 6 of my bloodworks showed high levels of CO2. Now, recently, I am being woken up, numerous times throughout the night with a feeling of panic, as though I m not getting air. It is VERY painful to sleep, as laying on my ribs causes pain. One night last week I woke up to excruciating stabbing pains in my left lower rib. Normally, this pain is more of a gnawing pain on both sides lower ribs. Sometimes the gnawing pain moves to the center just to the right of my lower rt rib. Because this is becoming worrisome, I saw a dr. in my clinic, since my reg dr. was unavailable, and he is also a DO. He said he could try some myofascial release, and some adjustments. He said I would be sore the following day, but that within 2 days I should know if it helped. He also told me to take 440 mg Naproxen twice daily for inflammation. I also take Tramadol for my SI Joint Pain. Last night, again, was very painful, but not the stabbing pain, and I awoke, feeling like I couldn t get enough air, and like I was run over by a truck.

Is it advisable to look after homeopathy as alternative.","Doctor":"Hello friend,I am a Homoeopath answering your question through Health care magic.My strong advise is to stop all the chemical drugs for your young baby. Further medications will worsen the kidney condition of your child. Basically your child is allergic or sensitive and that is why it shows symptoms of breathlessness and wheezing. The drugs which you give to your baby may temporarily give relief but in long run, they may not cure the chronic problem of your child and is surely going to  get his nephrotic syndrome worse. The best precaution to prevent relapse of nephrotic syndrome is to avoid further medication and to adopt Homoeopathic treatment.In Homoeopathy, we take the case of the child in detail , with special attention to the mental and physical symptoms of the patient, its family history and select a genetic constitutional curative remedy that will give him cure not only for the symptoms of Nephrotic syndrome but also his asthmatic conditions. So approach an expert Homoeopath with your child as early as possible and I can assure you cure for your baby. Best wishes,Dr. C. J.

I have tried a few exercises or positions to see if they can help with my pain and what I have done was get in a sitting position or I would just adjust my knees upward. I have an idea as to why this is happening to me because I have been drinking for the past 12 years and it is more than 4 alcoholic beverages a day so I do believe that my excessive drinking is the cause of all these problems.

It doesn t matter whether they are scented or not, I always have some sort of reaction. Liquid soaps, however, even if they are heavily coloured/scented, don t break me out at all. Could I be allergic to something in the solid soaps? Could it be lye, or is lye in liquid soaps too?","Doctor":"Hello friend,I am a Homoeopath answering your question through Health care magic. Soaps including bar soaps are a common material we use in our daily life. When it started to be your enemy is not mentioned in your question. Surely there will be a point of time when it all started. Now your duty is to find out from which anecdote this allergic reaction started. Then you will also find that it was after a particular conflicting incident in your life that this allergic changes started. This must be related to some unexpected shock, a separation, death of some loved ones etc. prior to the onset . All allergies have usually similar connections with the mind also. Unless this is brought to light, your exact mental make up cannot be understood. In Homoeopathy, we take into consideration your the mental, physical and general symptoms to find out your constitutional remedy. My advise is to approach an expert Homoeopath at the earliest. In Homoeopathy, we need not even avoid the material which causes allergy. While continuing contact with bar soap itself, the sensitivity is corrected.With best wishes for curing your problem through Homoeopathy,Dr. C. J.

For the most part, I cannot cough anything up but when I do, my mucus is thick, whitish/yellow and tastes metallic.

I am breathing somewhat better, but chest is still tight, still have weezing, even after two more neb treatments.

Your doctor has rightly put you on prednisolone of which short course of 10-14 days without tapering is usually ok. It takes 2-3 days for the symptoms to get relieved. Just have a faith on your doctor and wait for the drugs to act.In my opinion a course of antibiotic will be a good add on as you are bringing purulent phlegms.

And is there proper treatment of disease like that. One said that her respiration pipe dont know what it called is getting shrinkage and when giving oxygen so it becomes better. Please advise me .. She is in great pain. Thanks and regards, Habib","Doctor":"Hello Habib,Asthma is caused due to broncho-constriction (obstruction of smaller airway passages) which is indicative of Hyper-responsiveness of air passages.Management consists of:1. Oxygen inhalation, broncho-dilators and corticosteroids - provide symptomatic relief during acute attack by causing broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs)2. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy.3. Antihistamines can also be used to provide symptomatic relief.4. Protection from exposure to cold, dust or other allergens.Though prolonged use of steroid injections have its side effects, the risk-benefit ratio should be taken into consideration before administering them.Presence of pain during coughing or deep breathing can be attributed to either fatigue of respiratory muscles due to labored breathing or due to infection.Investigation like X ray of the chest will be helpful in clinching the diagnosis.If symptoms still persist, it will be better to consult a Pulmonologist & get a proper physical examination done.So that appropriate management steps could be taken.Please let me know if you have any further queries.You can ask me a direct query on this website using the below link:  her a good health.Take care."},{"Patient":"So my nose has been pretty good for the past week or two, but today somehow my allergies came back and it's really bad.

My major symptoms are blockage in nose and shortness in breadth most of the time. I am having this problem for more than 10years and no doctor could tell me a accurate solution for my health issues. My medical history as follows: i) Firstly the doctor diagnosed that the cause of shortness in breadth may be due to deviated septum and allergies associated with it.That diagnosis had been zeroed out with the help of CT scan and X ray in which i don't have any deviated septum and i do have some trace of Maxillary sinusitis. They have given some allergy tablet to overcome my shortness in breadth ( Medicine used : Allegra or Citrazine). But there was no improvement in my health condition. ii) Secondly doctor asked to go for CT-Chest to find out the condition of my lungs. In that it had been cleared that lungs does not have any major deformity but in the same time they cant eliminate the asthma issue with CT-Chest. So i had been medicated with asthma sprays such as Levolin & Serolin-125. I felt some improvement in my health condition. iii) But doctor advised me not to take inhaler continuously, so i discontinued it further. But still i persist with the problem and day to day life is being hectic for me with this breathing issues.

To prevent sneezing and dispnoea there are medicines like montelecast with livocitrizine to be continued for long time to prevent the recurance.

If allergens are detected, avoidance and use of montelukast and/or inhalers during the peak season (if seasonal allergy) will be the answer.2. Lung function tests to see the amount of reversibility and whether inhalers need to be added to control the asthma. If you are not having any asthma attacks while on montelukast, then sometimes a long-term treatment is required (maybe 3-4 years).Of course, smoking and inhalant allergies do not help with asthma control, so getting allergy tests done will be helpful.I hope that was useful.Best Wishes."},{"Patient":"I have had a skin rash small bumps that itch slightly a few weeks ago on the backs of both thighs, now three weeks later on the back of one thigh and around the back of the right side of my waist.

It is possible it could still be an allergy, but reevaluation of the rashes could be important to re adapt or change the treatment. It is however not excluded that it could also not be an allergy, considering it is spreading it is spreading at a fairly not very rapid rate, and that no actual predisposing allergen is incriminated.Consulting your primary care physician would be necessary in characterizing the rashes and making a distinction between rashes of infectious or allergic origin.

Is he/she on breast feed alone or you have already WEANED the baby at 6 months age i.e. started solid simple food like easy-to-digest preparations of cereals, pulses and vegetables?

Since there is no fever the possibility of a bacterial infection is low; As a foul smelling stool with blood and mucous suggests amoebiasis which is not so in your baby's case. As your baby is 8 months old the possibility of MEASLES can't be ruled out (since vaccination against measles is given at 9 months of age and maternal antibodies protect against measles till 6 months of age); refusing feeds could be because of this viral exanthema (rashes) and treatment has to be supportive by continuing BREAST FEED alone."},{"Patient":"Hi, my 5 year old son keeps taking deep breaths as if he was exerting himself running.

However, nothing happened, the tingling  sensations stopped long before I washed it of. Sadly, these thoughts haven't left my head... So, I decided to search for information on the subject, when, why it happens, who tend to suffer from it... As they say we fear of the unknown...

By the way, I have never expierenced a severe allergic reaction, never had allergies but I tend to get hives if I scratch my skin.","Doctor":"Hello,The hives you get when you scratch your skin is called dermographism, and is a common condition. Having dermographism does NOT mean you will develop analphylaxis if you get an allergic reaction to (say) a colouring agent; or you are at high risk of anaphylaxis.There are few options available to you:1. See an Allergist for a Patch Test against the Standard Battery or Cosmetics. This involves a small amount of chemical being attached to the skin (usually at the back) for 48 hours, and see if you have any delayed hypersensitivities. This should lessen your fears and you will know if you are already sensitized to common chemicals.2. If you have had anaphylaxis in the past, you can get a blood test called mast cell tryptase (MCT) levels. If the levels are high, you are (theoretically) at high chance of developing severe allergic reactions to (say) insect stings etc.That you have never developed a severe allergic reaction, the MCT levels will likely be normal (baseline values).I hope that was useful.Best Wishes."},{"Patient":"Hi, over the last few days I seem to be having a short coughs but lots of them throughout the day but it is more concentrated after eating, today I have been having a shortness of breath as well.

This would also be associated with other symptoms such as burning discomfort in the chest, bloating, feeling of regurgiation of food. It is treated with lifestyle modification and medication. The lifestyle modification requires decreasing the use of fried/fatty/acid or spicy food. Weight loss ,if this is an issue , use of small meals and waiting at least 2 hrs after eating before laying down. The shortness of breath may be related to your asthma and it would be best to make sure that this is not the causative factor first.

Or is this the first time you have taken Bactrim? Also, if this is the first time, did the assumed allergic reaction occur immediately after the first dose or after a few doses, and which dose caused this? Which infection have you been diagnosed to have?The reason why I ask these questions is because, the rash could very well be related to the infection that you are currently being treated for. This will have to be ascertained by your treating doctor, so please do consult him/her for the same.The next thing is, if this is indeed an allergic reaction to Bactrim, you will have to immediately discontinue this medication. For this as well, you will have to report to your doctor, who will confirm the cause, discontinue the current medication and initiate a substitute.In the meantime, avoid any irritation to the area of the rash, wear comfortable clothing, avoid scratching the region, and avoid application of any unprescribed medication on the region of the rash.Also please drink lukewarm water with a little salt in it, at least three times a day. I am unsure about your infection or other medications, so I cannot comment on other effects you have been suffering. The best thing right now would be to visit your treating doctor.I hope I have succeeded in providing the information you were looking for.

During sleep this blood would be collected in throat and coughed out on waking up. Probably you are having bacterial or fungal infection of the sinuses ( paranasal sinuses) on left side. it is causing pain on left eye, nose , forehead. You will require treatment with antibiotics and nasal drops that will help open up the sinus openings. The disease can be confirmed by proper examination of nasal cavity , by xray of sinuses , or by nasal endoscopy. Sometimes CT scan of sinuses will be required. You will require treatment fro an ENT surgeon. Sometimes minor surgical procedure may be required to remove pus from sinuses.

You can reduce your chances of an asthmatic attack by carrying your preventer medication with you. You should consider starting it before you leave and continuing it during the course of your trip. The preventer ,if used appropriately would reduce the chances of an acute attack. You should consider speaking to your doctor, he or she may suggest increasing the dose of the preventer while you are away. Additionally you should always walk with your reliever inhalor, remember it is sometimes difficult in an acute event to take the reliever properly so you may want to have an aerochamber with you so you do not have to do the special breathing that is required when using the inhalor on its own.

But he is also always very pale, which is not something I would consider hereditary. His father is Polish, therefore fairly dark complected. I have a lot of Cherokee ancestery myself and am not exactly fair skinned. He's been 'sickly' since entering the world, seeming to have a low immune system, but the doctors brush me off and say he's fine. NOW, since February of this year, he has had two seizures. He has an appointment with a Neurologist, but not until July of this year. The symptoms may all be totally unrelated, but he just doesn't seem like a normal, healthy 6 year old little boy. Anything in particular I should be looking for or checking up on as far as diseases, syndroms, infections, or just any specific conditions I haven't mentioned we've already addressed that sound like they could be of concern?","Doctor":"Hello, To put all the problems in perspective: Your son aged 6, has allergies and asthma, but also pale and gets recurrent infections having now had epilepsy and waiting to see a neurolgist. Blood tests that will be helpful include: Complete blood count - Hb if low, requires treatment especially if iron deficiency anaemia (pale with dark circles under eyes) Liver function tests IgE levels Specific IgE tests against aeroallergen panel (foods as well, if indicated) Thyroid function tests IgG, IgA, IgM - to know if antibody levels are normal He will need an EEG and/or MRI Brain at some point depending what the Neurologist feels. Do not go into syndromic diagnosis at this point unless the investigations point in this direction. I hope all his immunizations are up to date. Try and broaden his diet to increase his weight, with protein drinks and ensure his asthma is well under control. Inhaled steroids (high doses) or oral steroids for asthma can increase susceptibility to infections, so ensure that this is not the case. I hope that was useful. Best Wishes."},{"Patient":"48 yo female, no kids, mild GED, well-controlled Asthma, non-smoker. Female woke up (4) days ago with severe mid chest pain, radiating into right shoulder, mid shoulder blades/ upper back, right neck CA & into the right ear. (throbbing sensation just below right ear) Pain has been constant & (in)creases with deep breathing, or lying down. Greatly (in)creased pain when trying to rest on her right side though the pain remains persistent laying on her left side too. Holding her breath (de)creases the pain somewhat but it does not go away. Nausea is present with some mild loss of appetite. General fatigue has set in with no will to thrive. (mostly due to pain while breathing/ movement) Female's father died of a stroke at age 52 but he smoked heavily. Female's Mat. Grandmother died from Lung Cancer in her 70's but she was also a chronic smoker. No sweating, clammy skin, or shortness of breath while at rest as of yet. Only SOB with prolonged activity. (It feels like a thousand sharp knifes cutting into the wind pipe every time a breath is taken in with radiating pain into right chest, right shoulder, neck & lower right ear. It's like I can feel the air going through the vessels due to the extreme pain, easy to follow the line of the pain? Chest pain radiates across mid chest like a fan opening with each breath. No pain in Left Chest at all unless laying on left side.","Doctor":"Hello, Chest pain can be caused by various reasons, including minor problem such as indigestion or stress, to serious medical emergencies such as a heart attack. Investigations like an Electrocardiogram or Stress Echocardiography can be done to rule out any cardiac involvement. And a Chest X ray will rule out any pathology in the respiratory system. Other causes of chest pain include: 1. Strained chest muscles due to overuse 2. Chest muscle injury 3. Short-term, sudden anxiety with rapid breathing 4. Peptic ulcer disease 5. Pain from the digestive tract, such as esophageal reflux So, it will be better to consult a Doctor & get a physical examination done to rule out other causes. So that proper management steps could be taken. Wishing a Good Health.

IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO HAVE THIS PROBLEM AT THE AGE OF 22.AGE-22/FEMALE","Doctor":"Hello Jyoti, Thanks for your query. The breathing problems mentioned in your post is caused due to broncho-constriction (obstruction of smaller airway passages) which is indicative of Hyper-responsiveness of air passages (seasonal allergy or asthma) Management consists of: 1. Asthalin inhaler- provide symptomatic relief by causing broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs) So, you can use it whenever you are having an acute attack. 2. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of seasonal allergies & asthma. 3. Antihistamines can also be used to provide symptomatic relief. 4. Protect yourself from exposure to cold, dust or other allergens. If symptoms still persist, it will be better to consult a Pulmonologist & get a proper physical examination done. So that appropriate management steps could be taken. Wish you a good health & speedy recovery. Thanks & Take care."},{"Patient":"The area inside my navel appears to be slightly swollen. No larger than a pea. It is not painful on its own, but is tender and slightly uncomfortable (2/10 on pain scale) when you press on it. It also feels as though I am pushing something small back into abdomen when I press on it. Do you have any ideas? Additional info: yesterday I was helping someone attach a rope to a hook in the pool. it was difficult and I had to strain to connect it. I was on my knees pulling rope towrd my body. Abdomen did nothurt yesterday, and still only hurts if I press on it.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for your query and an elucidate history.The condition of a pea-sized swelling in the umbilicus which is tender and you get a feeling of pushing something in on pressure is called an umbilical hernia.This is a small gap in the wall of the umbilicus. You can consult a Surgeon to get an examination done and to decide whether you need a corrective surgery or not. In small sized umbilical hernia, where the content is always a fat-pad, surgery may not be needed until the opening is big enough to cause entrapment of the intestine to cause spigellion sort of hernial obstruction or  causes any other complication. You can keep this under observation and get operated only if causes pain. No pain at straining at the pool is a good sign."},{"Patient":"I have smth happening to le since couple if years.

Scratching or 'writing' on the skin will leave similar marks that stay for a few minutes to maximum an hour. I do not know the exact association with body building supplements to development of physical urticaria or dermographism, but if this condition has started AFTER you have begun on the supplements, then it will be best to stop and see the effect. Otherwise, long-acting antihistamines such as Allegra 180mg once daily is the usual treatment.

I am an African American woman. About a month and a half ago, I got stung by a bee on my left arm between my elbow and biceps . The swelling and the itching somewhat went away a wk later, but a few days after I thought I was getting better, I started getting all these bumbs that started looking like hives when I started to scratch them. A few days later, bumps started appearing in the same location on my right arm. I put cream for about 3 wks. When I didn t see that it was working I went and got Benedryl . I drank a whole box of Benedryl for about 7 days and today it has just gotten worse. I ve been stung by a bee before but I never had a reaction so severe. In fact, this is probably the 3rd or 4th time I ve been stung in my whole 31 yrs of living. On top of that, I have pityriasis rosea .

Will pseodoephedrine help? It is the only antihistamine I have at hand.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for writing your query. You should wash the affected area thoroughly. Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant and will not be helpful in controlling the allergic reaction. You should take antihistaminic medicine like Fenofexadine or Cetrizine for relief. Application of Calamine lotion will help in decreasing the itching sensation, but local application of steroid cream will be more beneficial. You should get yourself examined clinically at the Emergency Department and take the appropiate medicine. Donot apply the post-wax treatment oil in future, as your skin is sensitive to it.

She is also severely allergic to peanuts (40.80 kUA/L with one severe reaction so far) and 8 other food allergens. We haven't witnessed any symptoms that we could have linked to soy consumption.- What exactly would you recommend she avoids: food that may contain trace amounts of soy? food that contain soy protein? food that contain soybean oil? What about soy lecithin?- How important is it that she avoids contact with soy to eventually outgrow her allegy to soy?- Would daily, moderate exposure to soy increase chances of aggravating her allergy to soy? and her prognostic for outgrowing her allergy to soy?Many thanks in advance,Matthieu","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for using Health Care Magic Forum, Soy Induced Anaphylaxis in Child with Asthma and Peanut Allergy Soy is one of the top eight allergens. What you may not know is that a child with a peanut allergy can have an allergic reaction after eating a food that contains soy, according to the Asthma and Allergy Resource Center. How could soy cause an allergic reaction in my child with peanut allergy? In scientific terms, soybean allergens are “homologous” to known peanut allergens and can be recognized by 44% of peanut-allergic patients. What that means is that a child with a peanut allergy can have an allergic reaction and even go into anaphylaxis after eating soy. Because this cross-reactivity is rarely mentioned in the press, many parents are unaware of the potential health risks that soy may present to children with peanut allergies. What are the Signs of a Cross-Reaction to Soy? The child suffer fatal asthma attacks. What Can I Do to Protect My Child with Peanut Allergy? \\"If your child is allergic to peanuts, you should consider eliminating soy as well as all peanuts from your child’s diet, even if your child has never reacted poorly to soy in the past. Some sensitive children have “hidden” soy allergies that manifest for the first time with a severe – even fatal – reaction to even the low levels of “hidden” soy commonly found in processed food products. Those at the highest risk suffer from asthma as well as peanut allergy.” What products contain soy? Soy can be found in soy milk, tofu, soy sauce, baby formula and other soy products. Soy is also used in many processed foods, as soy lecithin, soy lectin, soybean oil and other soy derivatives. Soy is commonly used as animal-feed in livestock. It is only within the last nine years that soy has become one of the top eight allergens. Soy has recently been genetically engineered to contain new proteins and potential allergens. Daily moderate exposure to soy increase chances of aggravating her allergy . I Hope I Provided Useful Information. Do ask Furthur Questions to help You get well soon.

C. M. Allergy is a very common disease and  I would like to say in one word that in modern era at least we can't escape from this  disease. Dust , linen, fiber, fine powder, mite  pet hairs sudden  change  in temp ( up & down) , polluted industrial air are the major causes of allergy. Initial symptoms are , Itch in throat, nose, Tears from the eyes, Sneezing , Common cold ( coryza) Stuffy nose, Snot from nose begins watery in consistency and afterwards in thick mucus form, COUGH ( later stage due to infection) Breathlessness ( later stage) Many patients don'e agree that they have asthma , but the hard fact is allergy to allergens are a precursor of ASTHMA. The best way is take precautions about these above mentioned reasons. If, still you have these things than consult a physician and have a treatment of allergy ( due to initial phase). Good luck.

A thick and thin blood films in search of parasites like microfilaria should be actively searched for. A past history of recent travel to an area endemic for parasitic worms shall be of utmost importance. I suggest a good clinical evaluation  by your internist and appropriate blood tests be done.

Was examined by an ENT, who found a bleeding anterior artery in my right nostril, and it was cauterized. It stopped the bleeding, but obviously,  I couldn't blow my nose for a week. It's allergy season, and I'm very allergic to pollens. Started to wheeze. I've never wheezed before this. Yesterday I was able to gently blow my nose, and the wheezing stopped. This morning, I coughed up clotted blood. It wasn't much, but it alarmed me.  Is that a natural occurrence after such a large nose bleed? Is it just blood that went to my lungs from the nose? Should I ignore it and just wait and see. Otherwise, I feel fine, just congested from allergies.  Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM. Yes, this is normal for nose bleeding because usually some amount of blood comes into tho mouth so this isnt actually coughing. YOu should take antiallergic medicines in seasons of pollens. There is no specific prevention of nose bleeding but it usually stops spontaneously. If this persists you should check blood clotting factors and blood pressure to see is there any disorder.

Coughing spells can sometimes be due to reflux of stomach acid (GERD) so omeprazole is good to continue and see if that helps. Pain under the breast, that increases on deep breath, is a sign of infection lining the lungs, called pleurisy. This can happen with viral infections, and you do seem to get a viral-infection induced asthma attack. Please ensure you get a Chest X Ray done, increase the dose of the inhalers or switch to a combination inhaler (Seroflo 250 2 puffs twice daily), and antihistamines.

C. M. Inhalation , if any foreign body in lungs it will produce cough uninterrupted (bout of cough) If you have cough  from this incident than inhalation of some plastic material could be imagine. If such type of symptoms are there than you have to consult a physician and he will  get a bronchoscopy of your's lung to find out any foreign particles in airways(  pharynx, trachea, bronchus . If cough is not there than it might be a mistaken thing. Your's question is this that there are burning in throat and also irritation, these two symptoms are same things just to fear of inhalation of a foreign thing. 2 nd reason may be some injury due to engulf of some thing in esophagus to stomach. Take an antacid  with oxycetacain ( local anesthetic) at the advice of doctor whichwll give immediate relief. Please get one X ray of abdomen to find out any plastic like thing in stomach (color X ray) Regards.

In most cases it is viral but bacterial infections can also occur. The pain and swelling in the face imply that the sinuses are infected. You can consider using antihisatmines and decongestants which would relieve the nasal congestion and swelling in the face. Decongestants can be oral or topically applied. Since you are having a productive cough, you may want to consider using a mucolytic which would help to break up the mucus in the chest.

I take asthma medicine with steroid each day.  My pharmacist said it is probably due to the steroid and there is a name for it but I can,t remember it.  Once I stop taking the asthma medicine during a 2 year period it went away, but to be able to have quality of life I have to take every day (Its happened with Advair and Symbycort) Just using the nebulizer does not help enough with my breathing, is there another daily medicine without steroids you could recommend so I can speak to my primary care doctor about?","Doctor":"Hi ginnm529, Thanks for visiting HCM. Let me tell you that steroids are the backbone of asthma medication. No bronchodilator can be prescribed without steroid combination. So forget about not taking steroid. Now regarding your second query of lump behind ears....These seem to be sebaceous cyst. You must have noticed some cheesy material coming out when they burst. I will advise you to meet a general surgeon and get both these lumps/ cysts excised. Its a simple outdoor procedure done under local anaesthesia. If you leave them as it is, they will frequently recur and many a times will get infected too, requiring antibiotic treatment. So continue your asthma medication and meet a general surgeon.

I have loudness confirmation problem i.e. i am not able to judge and maintain loudness while speaking cause every time i speak i hear a sound of vibration with every word. For words like m and n there is similar vibration. Sometimes during day the vibration gets louder to me than my voice and hence i cannot judge how loud i might be speaking and that makes speaking ,talking and reading very difficult. I have feeling of strain in my voice and i think i can t make good output of voice or sound but my friends say that I sound fine. I can t hear to my own sound in a noisy place and i just could feel vibration sounding very deep while i could hear others speaking normally while i can t do so. Also i have to put extra effort or pressure to sound audible to others. Every time i speak my ear adds extra sound to my voice that only i can hear. it vibrates in a same way as cars glass vibrates with the audio system. + I have dermatitis and rhinitis dermatitis was more prominent in previous years but now its mild but it has not gone while rhinitis is persistent, It started from dermatitis/eczema in the year 2006 and it went off and came back with treatments but did not left ,three and half years ago i started showing symptoms of rhinitis with this ear problem which i misunderstood to be cold .

Asthma, if controlled, is not a contraindication for dancing. Whether it has got any positive effect on asthma course or symptoms has not been proven in randomised controlled studies. Some Indian studies have proven pranayam to be beneficial to asthmatics. There is a special variant of asthma called exercise  induced asthma, where any sort of exercise, even dancing too may lead to asthma attack. The mechanism is, increased airflow through airways lead to cooling effect and drying of airways causing degranulation of cells which causes airway constriction and asthma attack. If one has got this particular type of asthma, then better take your reliever inhaler before going for dance. Best wishes"},{"Patient":"On 26th February had a severe allergic reaction.

Headache pain is no longer confined to the right or left hemisphere, now it can be most anywhere in the head. Pain is fairly mild when the HA starts, taking 4 - 6 hrs to most painful, and lasts 12 - 16 hrs (sometimes 30+ hrs). Only 2 - 4% of the headaches are as painful as they were in the early yrs. I m experiencing pressure (tightness) mostly in my neck and head accompanied by heavy (hard) heart-beat occurring in the the most painful part of the headache. The pressure (tightness) is a dead ringer for that experienced when taking Imitrex . With the last few headaches I can feel and hear the heart beat plainly and notice it is skipping a beat (4 beats then a miss). I have low blood pressure (100 over 70), pulse 58 to low 60 s. I have seen all kinds of doctors. I ve tried just about everything but acupuncture and botox.

I would like to know whether we will have to continue with this medication in future if there is an attack.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic. Inhaled steroids suppress bronchial inflammation. When given as inhaled preparations, steroids afford more symptomatic releif  and less side effects. Steroids reduce the inflammation thereby reducing mucosal edema (swelling).  Although, not a bronchodilator (dilatation of air way) steroids provide sustained  relief. Only when given as oral preparations (in the form of tablet) for a long period of time the steroids result in many side effects. As an anti inflammatory, they are highly useful in asthma that too when given as nebulizer. Pulmicort nebulizer contains the steroid Budesonide. It exerts its action mainly in the air way. It is minimally absorbed and so results in less side effects. It results in few side effects like nasal irritation, itching, sneezing and throat dryness. It can also be taken as a prophylactic (preventive drug) and also for seasonal attacks. You can very well continue to use Pulmicort for your son as per your treating Dr,s advice. However irrational use should be avoided. I hope this is helpful to you."},{"Patient":"I have had mono for almost 9 months now (just got tested again last week) and it is not getting any better.

At times, the child might be required to take drugs for even up to one year. Treatment of asthma required avoiding attack triggers, always having available a fast acting asthma attack relief drugs (Ventoline) and being compliant to the drugs. It its necessary to consult a pulmonologist to carry out a clinical evaluation, do peak flow measures to appreciate the intensity and choice of drugs to be prescribed. Your daughter might require to be on some drugs, Say Seretide even up to one year or more for symptoms to get ameliorated. I suggest you book an appointment with a pulmonologist.

Asthma can be exacerbated in the following conditions: 1) Patient not adherent to medication or else not taking proper medication so that their asthma is not controlled. 2) Viral infections especially during winters. 3) Change in ambient temperature of the environment. 4) Exercise in individuals with uncontrolled asthma. 5)cases of brittle asthma where there is sudden attack and patient may die suddenly. Severe asthma attacks may land up the patient in coma needing mechanical ventilation. Prognosis or chance of recovery remains good.

My Dr. and I thought it was allergies and we only recently realized that there is a greater problem.

Now I'm hearing a ringing in my ears :( Am I going to have Tinnitus? I'm really worried that it will be permanent. My Dr. told me to take my allergy pills to help the swelling. I am also scheduled to see a nose specialist next week. Just wondering if there's anything else I can do?","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for the query, Nasal sprays in nasal congestion are usually a type of anti allergic drugs called anti histamic drugs or nasal steroids. Clinical response to such treatment could indicate the implication of a hypersensitive or abnormally high inflammatory reaction. Other considerations like fever, quality of the discharge (pus) and the past history of other allergic states like eye symptoms, cough symptoms must be considered. Tinnitus could be a sign of the general inflammatory process, but a keen evaluation of the ears, preferably by an ENT specialist is advisable. I suggest you continue with your nasal spray as you wait for your appointment with the ENT specialist.
