For each residue class ( a pmod{2011} ), there are (frac{2011}{text{ord}_{2011}(a)}) such integers.6. Summing Over All Residue Classes:   The total number of valid ( x ) is:   [   sum_{a=1}^{2010} frac{2011}{text{ord}_{2011}(a)}   ]   This sum can be simplified using the properties of Euler's totient function (phi):   [   sum_{d|2010} frac{phi(d)}{d}   ]7. Calculating the Sum:   The sum (sum_{d|2010} frac{phi(d)}{d}) is a known result in number theory. For ( 2010 = 2 times 3 times 5 times 67 ), the sum evaluates to 1197.8. Probability Calculation:   The probability is then:   [   frac{1197}{2011}   ]9. Relatively Prime Check:   Since 1197 and 2011 are relatively prime, the fraction is in its simplest form.The final answer is (boxed{1197})"},{"problem":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_{n}} with the sum of the first n terms as S_{n}, if 2a_{8}+a_{2}=12, then S_{11}=______.","solution":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_{n}} with the common difference denoted as d, we are told that 2a_{8}+a_{2}=12. Let's break down the solution step by step:1. Express a_{8} and a_{2} in terms of a_{1} and d:   - a_{8} = a_{1} + 7d   - a_{2} = a_{1} + d2. Substitute these expressions into the given equation:   - 2(a_{1} + 7d) + (a_{1} + d) = 123. Simplify the equation:   - 2a_{1} + 14d + a_{1} + d = 12   - 3a_{1} + 15d = 124. Factor out the common factor of 3:   - 3(a_{1} + 5d) = 125. Divide both sides by 3 to solve for a_{1} + 5d:   - a_{1} + 5d = 46. Recognize that a_{1} + 5d represents a_{6}, so a_{6} = 4.7. To find S_{11}, the sum of the first 11 terms, use the formula S_{n} = frac{n}{2}(a_{1} + a_{n}):   - Since a_{6} = 4, and a_{11} = a_{1} + 10d, we can express S_{11} as:   - S_{11} = frac{11}{2}(a_{1} + a_{1} + 10d)8. Knowing a_{6} = 4, we can simplify S_{11}:   - S_{11} = frac{11}{2} times 2a_{6} = 11 times 49.

Refer to Fig. 29.On the first segment (from 0 to 2 pi), there is one positive root (and one root zero), on each subsequent segment, except the last one, there are two roots. To determine the number of roots on the last segment, let's estimate its size: frac{100}{2 pi} is obviously between 15 and 16left(frac{100}{15}=6.66 ldots>2 pi ; quad frac{100}{16}=6.255>pi right); therefore, on this segment, a complete positive half-wave of the sine wave fits and, thus, there are also two roots on it.Thus, we have 1+14 cdot 2+2=31 positive roots of our equation. There are as many negative roots, and one root is zero.Finally, the total number of roots is 31 cdot 2+1=63.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_b937612abb2773f7abffg-282.jpg?height=199&width=908&top_left_y=365&top_left_x=120)Fig. 29.b) The solution to this problem is analogous to the solution of part a). First of all, it is obvious that if sin x=lg x, then x leqslant 10 (otherwise, the left side of our equality is no more than 1, while the right side is greater). Since 2 cdot 2 pi>10, on the segment of the O x axis from x=0 to x=10, one complete wave of the sine curve y=sin x and part of the next wave fit (Fig. 30). The graph of y=lg x,![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_21_b937612abb2773f7abffg-282.jpg?height=296&width=948&top_left_y=891&top_left_x=85)Fig. 30.obviously intersects the first wave of the sine curve at one point. Further, since 2 pi+frac{pi}{2} lg x and, thus, the graph of y=lg x intersects the first half of the second positive half-wave; since lg x=1>sin x at the point x=10, it must intersect the second half of this half-wave as well. Thus, we conclude that the equation sin x=lg x has a total of three roots."},{"problem":"Problem 3. Vasya solved problems for 15 days - at least one problem each day.

Find the maximum number of \\"triangular ties\\" (here, a \\"triangular tie\\" refers to a situation where 3 people each have one win and one loss against each other).","solution":"5. Represent 14 people as A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{14}, and let A_{i} win a_{i} games. If there is no \\"triangle\\" among any 3 people, then there must be one person who wins the other two, hence no \\"triangle\\" trio. The number of such trios is sum_{i=1}^{14} C_{a_{i}}^{2} (with the convention that C_{0}^{2}=C_{1}^{2}=0). Therefore, the number of \\"triangle\\" trios is S=C_{14}^{3}-sum_{i=1}^{14} C_{a_{i}}^{2}. To find the maximum value of S, we need to find the minimum value of sum_{i=1}^{14} C_{a_{i}}^{2}. Since there are no ties, sum_{i=1}^{14} a_{i}=C_{14}^{2}=91. First, we prove that if sum_{i=1}^{14} C_{a_{i}}^{2} is minimized, then left|a_{i}-a_{j}right| leqslant 1(1 leqslant i<j leqslant 14). Indeed, if there exist 1 leqslant i, j leqslant 14 such that a_{j}-a_{i} geqslant 2, let a^{prime}{ }_{i}=a_{i}+1, a_{j}^{prime}=a_{j}-1, a_{k}^{prime}=a_{k}(k neq i, j), then a_{k}^{prime} geqslant 0(1 leqslant k leqslant 14) and sum_{k=1}^{14} a_{k}^{prime}=sum_{k=1}^{14} a_{k}=91, and sum_{k=1}^{14} C_{a_{k}}^{2}-sum_{k=1}^{14} C_{a_{k}}^{2}=C_{a_{i}+1}^{2}+C_{a_{j}-1}^{2}-C_{a_{i}}^{2}-C_{a_{j}}^{2}=C_{a_{i}}^{1}-C_{a_{j}-1}^{1}=a_{i}-left(a_{j}-1right)=-left(a_{j}-a_{i}-1right)<0, which contradicts the assumption that sum_{i=1}^{14} C_{a_{i}}^{2} is minimized. Therefore, when sum_{i=1}^{14} C_{a_{i}}^{2} is minimized, left|a_{i}-a_{j}right| leqslant 1(1 leqslant i<j leqslant 14). Without loss of generality, assume that among a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{14}, there are n values of x+1 and 14-n values of x, then n(x+1)+(14-n) x=91, n+14 x=91, so x, n are the quotient and remainder of 91 divided by 14, i.e., x=6, n=7, meaning that a_{1}, cdots, a_{14} have 7 values of 6 and 7 values of 7 when sum_{i=1}^{14} C_{a_{i}}^{2} is minimized, which is 7 times C_{6}^{2}+7 times C_{7}^{2}=252.

For x = -1 and y = 4, we get a - b + c = 4.3.

The success or failure of each level is independent of the others.  (1) Find the probability that Xiao Li successfully completes the first level but ends up with zero total prize money.  (2) Let X be the random variable representing the total prize money Xiao Li receives. Find the probability distribution and the expected value of the random variable X.","solution":"Let's break down the solution into detailed steps: Part 1: Probability Xiao Li successfully completes the first level but ends up with zero total prize moneyGiven:- Probability of Xiao Li successfully completing level i is denoted as P(A_i) for i=1,2,3.- Probability of Xiao Li choosing to continue after successfully completing level i is denoted as P(B_i) for i=1,2.To find P(C), the probability Xiao Li successfully completes the first level but ends up with zero total prize money, we consider two scenarios:1. Xiao Li successfully completes the first level, chooses to continue, but fails the second level.2. Xiao Li successfully completes the first and second levels, chooses to continue after both, but fails the third level.Therefore, we calculate P(C) as follows:[P(C) = P(A_{1}B_{1}overline{A_{2}}) + P(A_{1}B_{1}A_{2}B_{2}overline{A_{3}})][= frac{3}{4} times frac{3}{5} times frac{1}{3} + frac{3}{4} times frac{3}{5} times frac{2}{3} times frac{2}{5} times frac{1}{2}][= frac{21}{100}]Hence, P(C) = boxed{frac{21}{100}}. Part 2: Probability Distribution and Expected Value of XThe possible values of X are 0, 600, 1500, and 3000. We calculate the probabilities for each value of X:1.

P(X=1500): Xiao Li successfully completes the first two levels, chooses to continue after the first but not after the second.[P(X=1500) = P(A_{1}B_{1}A_{2}overline{B_{2}}) = frac{3}{4} times frac{3}{5} times frac{2}{3} times frac{3}{5} = frac{9}{50}]4.

Shift the Parabola Down by 2 Units: The given parabola is y=ax^{2}+bx-2. When we shift it down by 2 units, the equation becomes:   [   y = ax^{2} + bx - 2 - 2   ]   Simplifying this, we get:   [   y = ax^{2} + bx - 4   ]2. Compare with the Symmetric Parabola: The parabola that is symmetric about the y-axis is given by y=frac{1}{2}x^{2}+x-4. For two parabolas to be symmetric about the y-axis, their x^{2} coefficients must be equal, and their linear term must be opposites (considering one parabola is a reflection of the other across the y-axis). However, since the problem states that the new parabola obtained is symmetric about the y-axis with the given parabola, we interpret this as both having the same x^2 coefficient due to their shapes being identical and mirrored, rather than being direct reflections in terms of position. Thus, we equate the coefficients directly:   [   a = frac{1}{2}   ]3. Determine the Relationship Between b and a: Given the symmetry and the fact that the parabolas have the same x^2 coefficient and constant term, we focus on the relationship between b and a. The original equation for symmetry provided in the solution seems to imply a misunderstanding of the symmetry condition. Since the parabolas are identical in shape and mirrored in position, we directly compare the linear coefficients. The given solution's approach to use frac{b}{2a}=-frac{1}{2timesfrac{1}{2}} is incorrect based on the usual interpretation of symmetry. However, following the provided solution's logic without introducing new ideas, we accept the comparison of coefficients as given:   [   frac{b}{2a} = -frac{1}{2timesfrac{1}{2}}   ]   Simplifying this, we find:   [   frac{b}{2timesfrac{1}{2}} = -1   ]   Therefore, solving for b, we get:   [   b = -1   ]4.

However, we also havealpha+beta=beta^{2}+alpha^{2}-4=(alpha+beta)^{2}-2 alpha beta-4Thus -1=1-2 alpha beta-4, which implies that alpha beta=-1. Therefore (a, b)=(-(alpha+ beta), alpha beta)=(1,-1).(III) If alpha=alpha^{2}-2=beta^{2}-2 and alpha neq beta, then alpha=-beta. Thus alpha=2, beta=-2 or alpha=-1, beta=1.

This is based on the SAS (Side-Angle-Side) congruence theorem, where the angle is the right angle between the legs. Since the legs (sides) are equal and the angle between them (right angle) is the same, the triangles are congruent. Therefore, Statement A is correct.- Statement B: Two right triangles with an acute angle and the hypotenuse being equal are congruent. This follows the AAS (Angle-Angle-Side) congruence theorem, where one angle is the right angle, the other angle is the given acute angle, and the side is the hypotenuse. Since the angles and the hypotenuse are equal, the triangles are congruent. Thus, Statement B is correct.- Statement C: Two right triangles with the hypotenuse and one leg being equal are congruent. This is an application of the HL (Hypotenuse-Leg) congruence theorem, which is specific to right triangles. If the hypotenuse and one leg of two right triangles are equal, then the triangles are congruent. Hence, Statement C is correct.- Statement D: Two right triangles with two equal sides are congruent. To analyze this, consider two right triangles where one has legs of 3 and 4, making the hypotenuse 5 by the Pythagorean theorem (3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2). If another right triangle has a leg of 3 and a hypotenuse of 4, it does not follow the Pythagorean theorem, and thus cannot be a right triangle with those dimensions, or if it is a right triangle, it would not be congruent to the first one without knowing the specific sides that are equal.

Clearly, in any 17 points of S, at least 11 points can be covered by a circle centered at O with a diameter of 1. Moreover, any circle with a diameter of 2 can cover at most one vertex of the hexagon and cannot cover any other points in S, so at least 7 circles with a diameter of 2 are needed to cover all 2009 points in S, hence n geqslant 7.Next, we prove that at most 7 circles with a diameter of 2 are sufficient to cover all 2009 points in S.For any 8 points in S, take another 9 points from S, making a total of 17 points.

A certain scenic spot has developed a commemorative product, with a cost of 30 yuan per item. It is put on sale in the scenic spot with a set selling price not lower than the cost and not higher than 54 yuan. After conducting a survey on sales for a period of time, it was found that the daily sales quantity y (items) and the selling price x (yuan/item) satisfy a linear function relationship.

What is the maximum profit?","solution":" Step-by-Step Solution# Part 1: Finding the Function RelationshipGiven that the daily sales quantity y (items) and the selling price x (yuan/item) satisfy a linear function relationship, we can express this relationship as y = kx + b. We have two points from the table: (35, 90) and (40, 80). Substituting these into the equation gives us two simultaneous equations:1. Substituting (35, 90) into y = kx + b gives 90 = 35k + b.2. Substituting (40, 80) into y = kx + b gives 80 = 40k + b.Solving these equations simultaneously:- Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get -10 = 5k Rightarrow k = -2.- Substituting k = -2 into 90 = 35k + b, we get 90 = -70 + b Rightarrow b = 160.Therefore, the function relationship between y and x is y = -2x + 160.# Part 2: Determining the Selling Price for a Daily Profit of 1200 YuanGiven the daily profit from sales is 1200 yuan, we use the profit equation Profit = (Selling Price - Cost) times Quantity Sold. The cost is given as 30 yuan per item, and the relationship between selling price and quantity sold is y = -2x + 160. Thus, the equation becomes:1200 = (x - 30) cdot (-2x + 160).Expanding and solving this quadratic equation, we find that x_1 = 50 and x_2 = 60. Given the constraints that the selling price must be between 30 yuan and 54 yuan, only x = 50 is valid.Therefore, the selling price should be boxed{50 text{ yuan}}.# Part 3: Maximizing Daily ProfitLet the daily profit w be expressed as w = (x - 30) cdot (-2x + 160). This simplifies to w = -2x^2 + 220x - 4800. Completing the square gives us w = -2(x - 55)^2 + 1250. Since the coefficient of the squared term is negative (-2 < 0), the parabola opens downwards, indicating a maximum point at x = 55. However, given the constraint x leqslant 54, the closest we can get to this maximum point is at x = 54.Substituting x = 54 into the profit equation, we find the maximum profit to be w = -2(54 - 55)^2 + 1250 = 1248 yuan.Therefore, when the selling price is boxed{54 text{ yuan}}, the daily profit is maximized, and the maximum profit is boxed{1248 text{ yuan}}."},{"problem":"In triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c, respectively, and b= sqrt {3}, cos Asin B+(c-sin A)cos (A+C)=0.(1) Find the measure of angle B;(2) If the area of triangle ABC is dfrac { sqrt {3}}{2}, find the value of sin A+sin C.","solution":"(1) From cos Asin B+(c-sin A)cos (A+C)=0, we havecos Asin B-(c-sin A)cos B=0,which implies sin (A+B)=ccos B and sin C=ccos B.

What is the minimum number of factors that must be erased to achieve this?## Solution of the exercises## Translation of the solutionTo solve this problem, we need to ensure that the equation on the board has no real solutions after erasing some factors. Let's analyze the given equation:(x-1)(x-2) ldots(x-2016) = (x-1)(x-2) ldots(x-2016).This equation is always true for any ( x ) because both sides are identical. To make the equation have no real solutions, we need to ensure that the left-hand side (LHS) and the right-hand side (RHS) are never equal for any real ( x ).One way to achieve this is to make the LHS and RHS different polynomials. We can do this by erasing different sets of factors from each side. Specifically, we need to ensure that the remaining polynomials on both sides do not have any common roots.Consider the polynomial on the left-hand side:P(x) = (x-1)(x-2) ldots (x-2016).If we erase ( k ) factors from ( P(x) ), the remaining polynomial will be:P_1(x) = (x-a_1)(x-a_2) ldots (x-a_{2016-k}),where ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2016-k} ) are the roots that remain.Similarly, if we erase ( k ) factors from the right-hand side, the remaining polynomial will be:P_2(x) = (x-b_1)(x-b_2) ldots (x-b_{2016-k}),where ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{2016-k} ) are the roots that remain.To ensure that ( P_1(x) neq P_2(x) ) for any real ( x ), we need to ensure that the sets of roots ( {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2016-k}} ) and ( {b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{2016-k}} ) are disjoint. This means that we need to erase at least 2016 factors in total (1008 from each side) to ensure that the remaining polynomials have no common roots.Therefore, the minimum number of factors that must be erased is:boxed{2016}","solution":"If there remains a factor x-1 on the right and one on the left, then the equation admits 1 as a solution, and the same applies to the other factors. Therefore, at least one x-1 must be erased, at least one x-2, etc., which means at least 2016 factors must be erased.It remains to show that it is possible to erase exactly 2016 numbers. One way to do this is to erase x-i on the left if i is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4, and on the right if i is congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 4.## 4 Group mathrm{D} : arithmetic## 1 Wednesday 17 morning : Matthieu LequesneDefinition 16. Let x in mathbb{Z}. We say that x is a quadratic residue modulo p (or that bar{x} is a quadratic residue in mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z}) if x is not divisible by p and if bar{x} is the square of an element of mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z}.We denote left(frac{x}{p}right)=1 if x is a quadratic residue modulo p, left(frac{x}{p}right)=0 if p mid x, and left(frac{x}{p}right)=-1 otherwise. The symbol left(frac{x}{p}right) is called the Legendre symbol.Theorem 17 (Euler's Criterion). Let p be an odd prime, and x in(mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z})^{*}. Then x is a quadratic residue if and only if x^{frac{p-1}{2}}=overline{1}. Otherwise, we have x^{frac{p-1}{2}}=-overline{1}.Proof. Let's start by counting the quadratic residues of (mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z})^{*}. Let x be a quadratic residue, say x=y^{2} with y in(mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z})^{*}. We then also have x=(-y)^{2}, but y neq -y since p is odd, so x is the square of at least two elements of (mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z})^{*}. In fact, it is the square of exactly two elements, because the polynomial X^{2}-x is of degree 2, and thus has at most two roots in mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z}. Since (mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z})^{*} has p-1 elements, and since each quadratic residue is the square of exactly two of these elements, we deduce that there are exactly frac{p-1}{2} quadratic residues.All these quadratic residues satisfy x^{frac{p-1}{2}}=overline{1}, since writing x=y^{2}, we get x^{frac{p-1}{2}}=y^{p-1}=overline{1}, by Fermat's little theorem. It remains to show that these are the only ones. But the polynomial X^{frac{p-1}{2}}-overline{1} has at most frac{p-1}{2} roots in mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z}, and all the quadratic residues, which are frac{p-1}{2} in number, are roots of it. Therefore, these are the only roots, which concludes the first part of the theorem.To prove the second part, it suffices to show that the function f(x)=x^{frac{p-1}{2}} takes only the values overline{1} and -overline{1} when x runs through (mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z})^{*}. But f(x)^{2}=x^{p-1}=overline{1}, so the values taken by f on (mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z})^{*} are square roots of 1: these are overline{1} and -overline{1}.This proof, or at least the first paragraph, is worth knowing, as it provides information on the distribution of quadratic residues: their number, and the fact that each is the square of exactly two elements. From this, we can deduce, for example, that 1^{2}, 2^{2}, ldots,left(frac{p-1}{2}right)^{2} form a complete set of representatives of the quadratic residues of mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z}, because they are frac{p-1}{2} in number and are pairwise non-opposite.Another important remark is that Euler's criterion can be reformulated as follows using the Legendre symbol: for any odd prime p and any x in mathbb{Z}, we have left(frac{x}{p}right) equiv x^{frac{p-1}{2}} bmod p (note that this works even if p mid x). We immediately deduce that the Legendre symbol is completely multiplicative with respect to its upper argument, that is, for all x, y in mathbb{Z}, we have left(frac{x}{p}right)left(frac{y}{p}right)=left(frac{x y}{p}right). In particular, the product of two quadratic residues is a quadratic residue, and the inverse of a quadratic residue is a quadratic residue (we say that the set of quadratic residues is a subgroup of left.(mathbb{Z} / p mathbb{Z})^{*}right), but also, the product of two non-quadratic residues is a quadratic residue, and the product of a quadratic residue and a non-quadratic residue is not a quadratic residue."},{"problem":"Given cosleft(alpha+ frac{pi}{2}right) = frac{4}{5}, and alpha in left( frac{3pi}{2}, 2pi right), find the value of sin 2alpha.","solution":"First, we use the formula for the cosine of a sum of angles: cos(alpha + frac{pi}{2}) = cosalpha cosfrac{pi}{2} - sinalpha sinfrac{pi}{2} = -sinalpha = frac{4}{5}.

Solution: To solve this problem, we need to study the properties of the Legendre symbol with the general term left(frac{n(n+1)}{p}right), where (n, p)=1.By (n, p) being coprime, we know there must exist an integer r_{n} such that p nmid r_{n} and n r_{n} equiv 1(bmod p). This r_{n} is called the modular inverse of n modulo p. From the properties of the Legendre symbol, it is easy to see thatbegin{aligned}left(frac{n(n+1)}{p}right) & =left(frac{nleft(n+n r_{n}right)}{p}right)=left(frac{n^{2}left(1+r_{n}right)}{p}right) & =left(frac{n}{p}right)^{2}left(frac{1+r_{n}}{p}right)=left(frac{1+r_{n}}{p}right)end{aligned}We will prove that for n neq m(bmod p), p nmid n m, it must also be true thatr_{n} notequiv r_{m}(bmod p)That is, different numbers in the reduced residue system modulo p must correspond to different inverses. We use proof by contradiction. If r_{n} equiv r_{m}(bmod p), multiplying both sides by n m givesnleft(m r_{m}right) equiv mleft(n r_{n}right)(bmod p)Then, by the definition of the inverse, we getn equiv m(bmod p)This leads to a contradiction. This proves that when n runs through 1,2, ldots, p-1, the corresponding inverse r_{n} also runs through 1,2, ldots, p-1(bmod p), just in a different order. Also, note that from p-1 equiv-1(bmod p), we immediately get(p-1)^{2} equiv(-1)^{2} equiv 1(bmod p)So r_{p-1}=p-1. Therefore, when n takes 1,2, ldots, p-2, the inverse r_{n} of n also takes 1,2, ldots, p-2(bmod p), just in a different order. Thus, we getbegin{array}{l}left(frac{1.2}{p}right)+left(frac{2.3}{p}right)+ldots+left(frac{(p-2)(p-1)}{p}right) = sum_{n=1}^{p-2}left(frac{1+r_{n}}{p}right)=sum_{r=1}^{p-2}left(frac{1+r}{p}right) =sum_{r=1}^{p-1}left(frac{r}{p}right)-left(frac{1}{p}right)end{array}Since in a reduced residue system modulo p, there are exactly frac{p-1}{2} quadratic residues and frac{p-1}{2} quadratic non-residues, we have sum_{r=1}^{p-1}left(frac{r}{p}right)=0.

Understanding the Problem:   We are given ( n ) points in the plane with no three points collinear. We need to determine the minimum number of segments that must be colored red such that among any four points, three of them form a red triangle.2. Initial Assumptions:   Assume the edge ( ab ) is not red. This implies that for any four points ({a, b, x, y}), there must be a red triangle among them.3. Implications of the Assumption:   Since ( ab ) is not red, the edges ( xy ) must be red. Additionally, either ( ax ) and ( ay ) must be red, or ( bx ) and ( by ) must be red. This ensures that among any four points, three of them form a red triangle.4. Red Subgraph:   This implies that the complete graph ( K_n ) minus the edge ( ab ) (denoted as ( K_n - {a, b} )) must be red. Let ( A ) be the set of vertices ( x ) such that ( ax ) is red, and ( B ) be the set of vertices ( y ) such that ( by ) is red. It follows that ( A cup B = K_n setminus {a, b} ).5. Contradiction and Conclusion:   If we could find ( x in A setminus B ) and ( y in B setminus A ), then ({a, b, x, y}) would not satisfy the condition, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, ( B setminus A = emptyset ), implying ( A = K_n setminus {a, b} ). Thus, ( K_n - {b} = K_{n-1} ) is red.6.

This translates to:   [   e^{-xi}(f'(xi) - f(xi) - alpha) = 0 implies f'(xi) - f(xi) - alpha = 0 implies f'(xi) = f(xi) + alpha   ]   This is the condition given in the problem.4. Apply Rolle's Theorem:   For chi_f to have a zero in (0,1), by Rolle's Theorem, it must be that chi_f(0) = chi_f(1). This is because chi_f is continuous on [0,1], differentiable on (0,1), and if chi_f(0) = chi_f(1), then there must be some xi in (0,1) where chi_f'(xi) = 0.5. Evaluate chi_f at the endpoints:   [   chi_f(0) = (f(0) + alpha)e^{-0} = alpha   ]   [   chi_f(1) = (f(1) + alpha)e^{-1} = (1 + alpha)e^{-1}   ]   For chi_f(0) = chi_f(1), we need:   [   alpha = (1 + alpha)e^{-1}   ]6. Solve for alpha:   [   alpha = frac{1 + alpha}{e}   ]   Multiply both sides by e:   [   ealpha = 1 + alpha   ]   Rearrange to solve for alpha:   [   ealpha - alpha = 1 implies alpha(e - 1) = 1 implies alpha = frac{1}{e - 1}   ]The final answer is boxed{frac{1}{e - 1}}"},{"problem":"If the inequality 3x^{2}-log_{a}x < 0 holds true for any x in (0, frac{1}{3}), then the range of values for the real number a is:A: left[ frac{1}{27},1 right)  B: left( frac{1}{27},1 right)  C: left(0, frac{1}{27} right)  D: left(0, frac{1}{27} right]","solution":"To solve the problem, we construct two functions, f(x) = 3x^{2} and g(x) = -log_{a}x, for the interval (0, frac{1}{3}).Since the inequality 3x^{2}-log_{a}x < 0 is always true for x in (0, frac{1}{3}), we can infer that fleft( frac{1}{3} right) leq gleft( frac{1}{3} right).

Since the x-coordinate of these points is 0, we know that the distance from the center of the circle to either of these points is equal to the radius r. Therefore, we can write two additional equations:   - a^2 + (-4 - b)^2 = r^2 (distance from center to point A)   - a^2 + (-2 - b)^2 = r^2 (distance from center to point B)Now, we can solve this system of equations for a, b, and r:begin{cases} 2a - b - 7 = 0  a^2 + (-4 - b)^2 = r^2  a^2 + (-2 - b)^2 = r^2 end{cases}Solving the first equation for b, we get b = 2a - 7.

We denote the polynomial x^{2}+x+a by P_{a}(x), the polynomial forming the other factor of the left side by Q(x) and the polynomial on the right side by R(x).

It remains to check a=2 and a=-1. Before we use the procedure above again, we need a factorization of R(x). We observe that x^{4}+1 is a divisor of R(x), since the right side may be written as left(x^{4}+1right)left(x^{13}+x-90right). If a=-1 we get for x=2 that P_{1}(2)=5, while x^{4}+1=17 and x^{13}+x-90=8104. So the right hand side is not divisible by 5 .

(2) If the products produced by the three manufacturers are mixed together and one piece is randomly selected from the mixed products, find the probability that this product is qualified.","solution":" Solution Detailed Steps# Part 1:Given that Zsim N(200,150) and sqrt{150}approx 12.2, we are required to find P(187.8leqslant Zleqslant 212.2).The standard deviation sigma = sqrt{150} approx 12.2.So, the probability that Z falls within one standard deviation of the mean (i.e., within 200 pm 12.2) is approximately given by:  [ P(200-12.2 leqslant Z leqslant 200+12.2) ]By the properties of the normal distribution:  [ P(187.8leqslant Zleqslant 212.2) approx P(mu -sigma leqslant Z leqslant mu +sigma) approx 0.6827 ]Thus, the probability is boxed{0.6827}.# Part 2:Let's find the probability that a randomly selected product is qualified, given the products are mixed together from three manufacturers A, B, and C, with qualification rates 0.95, 0.90, and 0.80, respectively, and the proportions 2:3:5.First, we adjust the proportions to probabilities:  Total parts = 2+3+5 = 10  [ P(B_{1}) = frac{2}{10} = 0.2, , P(B_{2}) = frac{3}{10} = 0.3, , P(B_{3}) = frac{5}{10} = 0.5 ]Given qualification rates as conditional probabilities:  [ P(A|B_{1})=0.95, , P(A|B_{2})=0.9, , P(A|B_{3})=0.8 ]Using the law of total probability, the overall probability of selecting a qualified product is:  [ P(A)=sum_{i=1}^{3}P(B_i)⋅P(A|B_i) = 0.2 times 0.95 + 0.3 times 0.9 + 0.5 times 0.8 ][ P(A) = 0.19 + 0.27 + 0.4 = 0.86 ]Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected product is qualified is boxed{0.86}."},{"problem":"Let x, y and z be positive real numbers satisfying x^{3} y^{2} z=1. What is the minimum value of x+2 y+3 z?","solution":"It is about minimizing the sum x+2 y+3 z by exploiting the condition x^{3} y^{2} z=1 using the AM-GM inequality. Unfortunately, there are no terms in x^{3} or y^{2} in the expression x+2 y+3 z. Therefore, we need to split the term x into three terms so that the application of the AM-GM inequality will introduce a term in x^{3} which should simplify due to the assumption x^{3} y^{2} z=1. Similarly, we need to split the term 2 y into two to get an exponent of two and leave the term 3 z as is because the exponent 1 already matches. Thus, we writebegin{aligned}x+2 y+3 z & =frac{1}{3} x+frac{1}{3} x+frac{1}{3} x+y+y+3 z & geqslant 6 sqrt[6]{frac{1}{3} x times frac{1}{3} x times frac{1}{3} x times y times y times 3 z} text { by the AM-GM inequality } & =6 sqrt[6]{frac{1}{9} x^{3} y^{2} z}=6 sqrt[6]{frac{1}{9}} text { since } x^{3} y^{2} z=1end{aligned}Be careful, we still need to verify that the value 6 sqrt[6]{frac{1}{9}} can be achieved to conclude that it is the minimum! Indeed, since x, y, and z are positive, we could easily say without much risk that x+2 y+3 z geqslant 0, but 0 is not the minimum.

Depending on the location of X, the number of rays distributed among these four triangular sectors will vary. We start by finding the corner-most point that is 100-ray partitional (let this point be the bottom-left-most point). We first draw the four rays that intersect the vertices. At this point, the triangular sectors with bases as the sides of the square that the point is closest to both do not have rays dividing their areas. Therefore, their heights are equivalent since their areas are equal. The remaining 96 rays are divided among the other two triangular sectors, each sector with 48 rays, thus dividing these two sectors into 49 triangles of equal areas. Let the distance from this corner point to the closest side be a and the side of the square be s. From this, we get the equation frac{atimes s}{2}=frac{(s-a)times s}{2}timesfrac1{49}. Solve for a to get a=frac s{50}. Therefore, point X is frac1{50} of the side length away from the two sides it is closest to. By moving X frac s{50} to the right, we also move one ray from the right sector to the left sector, which determines another 100-ray partitional point. We can continue moving X right and up to derive the set of points that are 100-ray partitional. In the end, we get a square grid of points each frac s{50} apart from one another. Since this grid ranges from a distance of frac s{50} from one side to frac{49s}{50} from the same side, we have a 49times49 grid, a total of 2401 100-ray partitional points. To find the overlap from the 60-ray partitional, we must find the distance from the corner-most 60-ray partitional point to the sides closest to it. Since the 100-ray partitional points form a 49times49 grid, each point frac s{50} apart from each other, we can deduce that the 60-ray partitional points form a 29times29 grid, each point frac s{30} apart from each other. To find the overlap points, we must find the common divisors of 30 and 50 which are 1, 2, 5, and 10. Therefore, the overlapping points will form grids with points s, frac s{2}, frac s{5}, and frac s{10} away from each other respectively. Since the grid with points frac s{10} away from each other includes the other points, we can disregard the other grids. The total overlapping set of points is a 9times9 grid, which has 81 points.

Transforming the inequality f(m) - f(1 - m) geqslant frac{3}{2} - 3m into g(m) geqslant g(1 - m), we can solve for the range of m using the monotonicity property of g(x). This problem primarily assesses the ability to investigate a function's monotonicity utilizing its derivative and the key to solving it lies in constructing an appropriate function. It is a challenging problem."},{"problem":"Given are n points with different abscissas in the plane. Through every pair points is drawn a parabola - a graph of a square trinomial with  leading coefficient equal to 1. A parabola is called good if there are no other marked points on it, except for the two through which it is drawn, and there are no marked points above it (i.e. inside it).  What is the greatest number of good parabolas?","solution":"1. Transformation of Points:    Given the points ((x_i, y_i)) in the plane, we perform the transformation ((x_i, y_i) rightarrow (x_i, y_i - x_i^2)). This transformation effectively shifts the points such that the parabolas (y = x^2 + bx + c) between the original points become straight lines in the transformed plane.2. Convex Hull and Good Lines:   In the transformed plane, we need to find the maximum number of \\"good\\" lines. A line is \\"good\\" if it does not pass through any other points and no points lie above it. This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of \\"good\\" parabolas in the original plane.3. Convex Hull Analysis:   Consider the convex hull of the transformed points. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points. If the convex hull is a (k)-gon, then there are (k) boundary lines.4. Counting Good Lines:   Among the (k) boundary lines of the convex hull, at most (k-1) can be \\"good\\". This is because at least one of the boundary lines will have the convex hull above it, making it not \\"good\\". 5. Upper Bound:   Since (k leq n) (the number of points), the maximum number of \\"good\\" lines is (n-1). This is because the convex hull can have at most (n) vertices, and thus at most (n-1) \\"good\\" lines.6. Sharpness of the Bound:   This bound is sharp. For example, if the points are chosen on the (x)-axis (before the transformation), the convex hull will be a line segment, and there will be exactly (n-1) \\"good\\" parabolas.Conclusion:The greatest number of \\"good\\" parabolas is (n-1).The final answer is (boxed{n-1})"},{"problem":"## Problem StatementCalculate the lengths of the arcs of the curves given by the parametric equations.begin{aligned}& left{begin{array}{l}x=2(2 cos t-cos 2 t) y=2(2 sin t-sin 2 t)end{array}right. & 0 leq t leq frac{pi}{3}end{aligned}","solution":"## SolutionThe length of the arc of a curve defined by parametric equations is determined by the formulaL=int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} sqrt{left(x^{prime}(t)right)^{2}+left(y^{prime}(t)right)^{2}} d tLet's find the derivatives with respect to t for the given curve:begin{aligned}& x=2(2 cos t-cos 2 t) ; x^{prime}(t)=2(-2 sin t+2 sin 2 t)=4(sin 2 t-sin t) & y=2(2 sin t-sin 2 t) ; y^{prime}(t)=2(2 cos t-2 cos 2 t)=4(cos t-cos 2 t)end{aligned}Then, using the above formula, we get:begin{aligned}& L=int_{0}^{pi / 3} sqrt{(4(sin 2 t-sin t))^{2}+(4(cos t-cos 2 t))^{2}} d t= & =int_{0}^{pi / 3} 4 sqrt{sin ^{2} 2 t-2 sin 2 t sin t+sin ^{2} t+cos ^{2} t-2 cos 2 t cos t+cos ^{2} 2 t} d t= & =int_{0}^{pi / 3} 4 sqrt{1-2 sin 2 t sin t+1-2 cos 2 t cos t} d t= & pi / 3 & =int_{0}^{pi / 3} 4 sqrt{2} sqrt{1-sin 2 t sin t-cos 2 t cos t} d t= & =int_{0}^{pi / 3} 4 sqrt{2} sqrt{1-sin t cos t sin t-left(1-sin ^{2} tright) cos t} d t= & =int_{0}^{pi / 3} 4 sqrt{2} sqrt{1-sin ^{2} t cos t-cos t+sin ^{2} t cos t} d t= & =int_{0}^{pi / 3} 4 sqrt{2} sqrt{1-cos t} d t=int_{0}^{pi / 3} 4 sqrt{2} sqrt{2} sin frac{t}{2} d t=int_{0}^{pi / 3} 8 sin frac{t}{2} d t= & =int_{0}^{pi / 3} 8 cdot 2 sin frac{t}{2} dleft(frac{t}{2}right)=left.16left(-cos frac{t}{2}right)right|_{0} ^{pi / 3}=-16left(cos frac{pi}{6}-cos 0right)=-16left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}-1right)=8(2-sqrt{3})end{aligned}% D1%8B_18-20»Categories: Kuznetsov Problem Book Integrals Problem 18 | Integrals | Problems for CheckingUkrainian Banner Network- Last modified: 13:46, 22 May 2010.- Content is available under CC-BY-SA 3.0.Created by GeeTeatoo## Problem Kuznetsov Integrals 18-21## Material from Plusi"},{"problem":"(7) A bag contains n(n>1) red balls and 5 white balls.

What is the largest angle of the triangle?","solution":"It is known that for the area t of a triangle, the radii varrho, varrho_{a}, varrho_{b}, and varrho_{c} of the inscribed and excircles, and the semiperimeter s, the following relationships hold:t=varrho cdot s=varrho_{a}(s-a)=varrho_{b}(s-b)=varrho_{c}(s-c)In our problem - since the inscribed circle is the smallest and any two radii have different lengths - we can assume that the sides are in the following order: a1).According to these,begin{gathered}q=frac{varrho_{a}}{varrho}=frac{varrho_{c}}{varrho_{b}}, quad text { i.e., } quad frac{s}{s-a}=frac{s-b}{s-c} s(s-c)=(s-b)(s-a) (a+b+c)(a+b-c)=(c+a-b)(c-(a-b)) (a+b)^{2}-c^{2}=c^{2}-(a-b)^{2} a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}end{gathered}Thus, by the converse of the Pythagorean theorem, the triangle can only be a right triangle - if it exists at all - and its largest angle can only be gamma=90^{circ}.However, since in this determination (1) we only used two ratios, we do not yet know if there is a right triangle for which thefrac{varrho_{b}}{varrho_{a}}=qrequirement is also satisfied. Clarifying this would not have been possible within the time of the competition (see the following 3rd remark).Remarks. 1. Some may still know the following formulas, which allow for \\"easier\\" (i.e., using logarithm tables) calculation of angles from the sides, compared to the \\"cumbersome\\" cosine rule:operatorname{tg} frac{gamma}{2}=sqrt{frac{(s-a)(s-b)}{s(s-c)}}, quad sin frac{gamma}{2}=sqrt{frac{(s-a)(s-b)}{a b}}, quad cos frac{gamma}{2}=sqrt{frac{s(s-c)}{a b}}(The similar formulas for the other two angles can be written by cyclic permutation of the sides, while s remains unchanged.) According to the first formula,operatorname{tg} frac{gamma}{2}=sqrt{frac{varrho cdot varrho_{c}}{varrho_{a} cdot varrho_{c}}}=sqrt{frac{varrho^{2} q^{3}}{varrho^{2} q^{3}}}=1frac{gamma}{2}=45^{circ}, gamma=90^{circ}. Here, the existence of the triangle is guaranteed because the formulas only give meaningless results for non-existent triangles.2. The mentioned formulas - and many similar ones - are from the era when the most advanced tool for computation was the logarithm table. In the following - only in large steps - came the mechanical calculators with gears, first manual, then motorized, and today the electronic calculators. (We omitted the slide rule, which was only good for quick estimates compared to these.) - The formulas are still valid today. - However, the operatorname{tg} x / 2 appears, for example, in the transformation of certain integrals; but it is impossible to list all such small but well-usable tricks in theory.3. For a right triangle that also satisfies the varrho_{b}: varrho_{a}=q requirement, we get a cubic equation for the tangent of half the larger acute angle. Similarly to the above,begin{aligned}& operatorname{tg} frac{beta}{2}=sqrt{frac{(s-a)(s-c)}{s(s-b)}}=sqrt{frac{varrho cdot varrho_{b}}{varrho_{a} cdot varrho_{c}}}=frac{1}{q} quad text { and } & operatorname{tg} frac{alpha}{2}=frac{1}{q^{2}}end{aligned}(i.e., the tangents of the half-angles also form a geometric sequence with 3 elements and the same ratio). From these,begin{gathered}operatorname{tg}^{2} frac{beta}{2}=frac{1}{q^{2}}=operatorname{tg} frac{alpha}{2}=operatorname{tg}left(45^{circ}-frac{beta}{2}right)= =frac{1-operatorname{tg} frac{beta}{2}}{1+operatorname{tg} frac{beta}{2}}=frac{1-frac{1}{q}}{1+frac{1}{q}}=frac{q-1}{q+1} q^{3}-q^{2}-q-1=0end{gathered}(This \\"beautiful\\" equation also pops up in the solution of many other simply formulated problems.) Its approximate solution is:q=1.83929, quad alpha=32^{circ} 56^{prime} 6^{prime prime}, quad beta=57^{circ} 3^{prime} 54^{prime prime}Second solution. In addition to the notation used in the previous solution, let the vertices of the triangle be A, B, C, the center of the inscribed circle be O, and the centers of the excircles be O_{a}, O_{b}, O_{c} such that the circle centered at O_{a} touches the extensions of the sides A B and A C, and the side B C from the outside, and so on. Thus, the line O O_{a} bisects the angle B A C, and the line O_{b} O_{c} bisects the exterior angles at A, making it perpendicular to O A. O is the orthocenter of the triangle O_{a} O_{b} O_{c} and an interior point of the triangle, so this triangle is acute-angled.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_823261d193f0d3d28e5bg-2.jpg?height=1093&width=943&top_left_y=993&top_left_x=580)Let the points of tangency of the circles on the line A B be E, E_{a}, E_{b}, E_{c}, respectively. From the similar right triangles A O E and A O_{a} E_{a}, as well as A O_{b} E_{b} and A O_{c} E_{c},frac{A O_{a}}{A O}=frac{E_{a} O_{a}}{E O}=frac{varrho_{a}}{varrho}=q=frac{varrho_{c}}{varrho_{b}}=frac{E_{c} O_{c}}{E_{b} O_{b}}=frac{A O_{c}}{A O_{b}}(The elements to the right of q are in the same logical order as the others from left to q.) Let's make a small swap in the ratios at the two ends of the sequence:frac{A O_{a}}{A O_{c}}=frac{A O}{A O_{b}}According to this, the ratios of the legs of the right triangles A O_{a} O_{c} and A O O_{b} are equal. Therefore, these two triangles are similar. For one of their corresponding angles and the vertex angle of the latter,A O_{a} O_{c} varangleleft(=O O_{a} B varangleright)=A O O_{b} varangle=O_{a} O B varangle,which means that the angles of the right triangle O O_{a} B are equal, so each is 45^{circ}.On the other hand, the Thales circle over the segment O O_{a} passes through B and C, and these are on the opposite side of O O_{a}, sofrac{A C B varangle}{2}=O C B varangle=O O_{a} B varangle=45^{circ}thus A C B varangle=90^{circ}, which is then the largest angle of the triangle A B C.

Initial Setup and Definitions:   - We start with a pile of ( n ) pebbles in a single column.   - The operation rule allows moving a pebble from the top of a column to the top of the column immediately to its right if the column has at least two more pebbles than the column to its right.   - The goal is to show that the final configuration is unique regardless of the choices made during the process.2. Claim 1: The sequence must be non-increasing.   - Proof:      - By the operation rule, a pebble can only be moved if the column it is in has at least two more pebbles than the column to its right.     - This ensures that the number of pebbles in any column is always greater than or equal to the number of pebbles in the column to its right.     - Therefore, the sequence of column heights is non-increasing.3. Claim 2: The final configuration can only differ by 0 or 1 for every consecutive pile.   - Proof:     - If the difference between consecutive columns were greater than 1, a pebble could still be moved according to the operation rule.     - Hence, in the final configuration, the difference between the heights of consecutive columns must be 0 or 1.4. Claim 3: The final configuration cannot have at least 3 of the same numbers in a row.   - Proof:     - Assume for contradiction that there are at least 3 columns with the same number of pebbles, say ( a ).     - This would imply a sequence like ( cdots, a, a, a, cdots ).     - However, any reverse-operation applied to this would create an increasing sequence, which contradicts the non-increasing property established in Claim 1.5. Claim 4: The final configuration cannot have more than 1 pair of consecutive equal integers.   - Proof:     - Assume for contradiction that there are more than 1 pair of consecutive equal integers.     - This would imply a sequence like ( cdots, n+k, n+k, n+k-1, n+k-2, cdots, n, n, cdots ).     - Performing reverse-operations on these pairs would eventually lead to a configuration where the pairs are next to each other, creating a row of 3 or an increasing sequence, which contradicts Claims 1 and 3.6. Uniqueness of the Final Configuration:   - The claims ensure that the final configuration is unique and follows a specific pattern.   - To find this unique configuration, we need to determine the largest integer ( k ) such that ( n > frac{k(k+1)}{2} ).   - This ( k ) can be found using the formula ( k = leftlfloor frac{-1 + sqrt{1 + 8n}}{2} rightrfloor ).7.

Analyze the properties of the rhombus:   - In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and opposite angles are equal.   - Since (angle DAB = 60^circ), (angle ABC = 120^circ) because the sum of the angles in a rhombus is (360^circ).3. Use geometric properties and symmetry:   - Since (ABCD) is a rhombus with (angle DAB = 60^circ), the diagonals (AC) and (BD) bisect each other at right angles (90 degrees) and bisect the angles of the rhombus.   - Therefore, (angle DAC = 30^circ) and (angle DBC = 30^circ).4. Consider the intersection points and angles:   - Let (O) be the intersection of diagonals (AC) and (BD). Since diagonals bisect each other at right angles, (angle AOB = 90^circ).   - Since (E) is on (AD), and (F) is the intersection of (AB) and (CE), we need to consider the triangles formed by these intersections.5. Use trigonometric relationships:   - Since (triangle AOB) is a right triangle with (angle AOB = 90^circ), and (angle DAB = 60^circ), we can use trigonometric ratios to find the lengths of segments if needed.   - However, we are more interested in the angles formed by these intersections.6. Analyze the angles around point (G):   - Since (G) is the intersection of (BE) and (DF), we need to consider the angles formed by these lines.   - Notice that (angle DGB) is formed by the intersection of (DF) and (BE).7. Use the properties of the rhombus and symmetry:   - Since (angle DAB = 60^circ), and the diagonals bisect the angles, (angle DGB) will be influenced by the symmetry and the properties of the rhombus.   - Given the symmetry and the fact that the diagonals bisect the angles, (angle DGB) will be equal to (angle DAB).8.

Since left[frac{17-1}{3}right]+1=6, there must be 6 vertices of the same color, say yellow. Connecting these 6 vertices pairwise, we get C_{6}^{2}=15 line segments.

From (2),A bar{A}=p cdot A Q+(1-p) cdot A P=2 p(1-p) cdot A R=frac{2 lambda}{(lambda+1)^{2}} A Rso bar{A} can also be obtained from A by a similarity transformation with center S and ratioq=frac{bar{A} S}{A S}=1-frac{A bar{A}}{A S}=1-frac{3 lambda}{(lambda+1)^{2}}=frac{lambda^{2}-lambda+1}{lambda^{2}+2 lambda+1}Similar statements can be shown for the other two vertices of bar{H}, thus completing the proof of our previous remark.According to the statement we have just proven, H_{n+1} can be obtained from H_{n} by a similarity transformation with ratio q, so the perimeter of H_{n+1} is q times the perimeter of H_{n}. Therefore, the perimeters of the triangles H_{n} form a geometric sequence where the first term is 1 and the ratio of consecutive terms is q, with |q|<1. It is known that in this (infinite) sequence, the sum of the terms is left(1-q^{n}right) /(1-q), so the sum K of the perimeters of the triangles H_{n}, as n grows without bound,K=frac{1}{1-q}=frac{(lambda+1)^{2}}{3 lambda} quad text { length units. }We have already seen that the 1 / lambda inscribed triangle of a triangle's lambda inscribed triangle is the same as the lambda inscribed triangle of the triangle's 1 / lambda inscribed triangle. Therefore, the perimeters of the triangles H_{n}^{prime} also form a geometric sequence where the ratio of consecutive terms is q. The statement in part b) of the problem thus follows from the fact that the sums of infinite geometric series with the same ratio are in the same ratio as the first terms of these series."},{"problem":"6.

Thus, since there are 5 odd tiles and 4 even tiles, the only possibility is that one player gets 3 odd tiles and the other two players get 2 even tiles and 1 odd tile.  We count the number of ways this can happen.

This gives us a total of  10 cdot 2 cdot 6 = 120 possibilities in which all three people get odd sums.In order to calculate the probability, we need to know the total number of possible distributions for the tiles.  The first player needs three tiles which we can give him in dbinom{9}{3} = 84 ways, and the second player needs three of the remaining six, which we can give him in dbinom{6}{3} = 20 ways. Finally, the third player will simply take the remaining tiles in 1 way. So, there are dbinom{9}{3} cdot dbinom{6}{3} cdot 1 = 84 cdot 20 = 1680 ways total to distribute the tiles.We must multiply the probability by 3, since any of the 3 players can have the 3 odd tiles.Thus, the total probability is frac{360}{1680} = frac{3}{14}, so the answer is 3 + 14 = boxed{017}.Solution 2Let O stand for an odd number and E an even.Therefore, one person must pick OOO, the other person must pick OEE and the last person must pick OEE.

There are 5 odd numbers from 1-9 and there are four even numbers from 1-9. Since this problem is asking for the probability that the each player gets an odd sum, we also have to calculate the total numeber of ways. In this case, there are only two ways to get an odd sum. Either have the sequence OOO or OEE where the letters O and E stand for odd and even respectively. Since we constrained to only 5 odds, the only way to do the pairing is [OOO-OEE-OEE]There are of couse three ways to choose who gets the three odds. Once we have chosen who has gotten the three odds, we can actually reorder the sequence like this:[OEE-OEE-OOO]Now since we are choosing in groups, we can ignor order of these terms.For the first OEE, there are 5 ways to choose which odd to use, and dbinom{4}{2} or 6 ways to choose the evens.Great, let's move on to the second OEE. There are 4 odds left, so there are 4 ways choose the odds. Since there are only two even numbers, they have to go here, so there is only 1 way to choose the evens. The three odds will now fall in place. We can now multiply all the numbers since they are independent, and we have 5*6*4*3 or 360. Since this is a probability question, we have to ask ourselves how many ways are there to distribute the 9 tiles equally among 3 players. Fortunately for us, this is not hard as the first player has dbinom{9}{3} options and the second player has dbinom{6}{3}. When we multiply these, we get 1680. This is our denominator.When we make the fraction, we have frac{360}{1680}.

Therefore, the area A is given by:A = int_{0}^{1} (x^2 - x^3) dxCalculating the integral, we have:A = left[frac{x^3}{3} - frac{x^4}{4}right]_0^1 = left(frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{4}right) - (0 - 0) = frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{12}Therefore, the area of the closed figure formed by the curves y = x^2 and y = x^3 is boxed{frac{1}{12}}."},{"problem":"2.

Answer. left(0,2^{10}right),left(2^{10}, 0right).","solution":"Solution. We will show that if x^{3}+y^{3} is a power of two not less than the second, then both variables must be even numbers. Indeed, x^{3}+y^{3}=(x+y)left(x^{2}-x y+y^{2}right)=2^{n}, n geq 2, if one of the variables is odd, then the other is also odd, since the sum of their cubes is even. In this case, the second bracket in the factorization will be an odd integer, dividing a power of two, that is, x^{2}-x y+y^{2}= pm 1. Consider the last equality as a quadratic equation in terms of x, if it has a solution, its discriminant, equal to -3 y^{2} pm 4 must be non-negative, which is possible only when y=0, pm 1. For y=0 we get x^{2}= pm 1, from which x= pm 1. For y=1 we get x^{2}-x+1= pm 1, from which x=1,0. For y=-1 we get x^{2}+x+1= pm 1, from which x=-1,0. For odd x, y we get two pairs of values: (1,1) and ( -1,-1 ), for which x^{3}+y^{3} is, respectively, 2 and -2, so only the first pair (1,1) fits, and x^{3}+y^{3} in this case is 2 - a power of two below the second.Now consider the original equation. Given the proven fact, both variables are even, dividing the entire equation by 8, we get a new equation in integers left(frac{x}{2}right)^{3}+left(frac{y}{2}right)^{3}=2^{27}, in which the right-hand side is again a power of two higher than the first. Continuing in the same vein, we will reach the equation left(frac{x}{2^{10}}right)^{3}+left(frac{y}{2^{10}}right)^{3}=1. From the solution of the equation x^{2}-x y+y^{2}= pm 1 in the previous part, taking into account left(frac{x}{2^{10}}right)^{3}+left(frac{y}{2^{10}}right)^{3}=1 for left(frac{x}{2^{10}}, frac{y}{2^{10}}right) we get (1,0) or (0,1), from which (x, y) is (x, y) or left(0,2^{10}right).Grading criteria.

We can start by finding the area of the first triangle, triangle DQ_1^{}P_1^{}. This is equal to frac{1}{2} ⋅ DQ_1^{} ⋅ P_1^{}Q_2^{}. Notice that since triangle triangle DQ_1^{}P_1^{} is similar to triangle triangle ABP_1^{} in a 1 : 2 ratio, P_1^{}Q_2^{} must equal frac{1}{3} (since we are dealing with a unit square whose side lengths are 1). DQ_1^{} is of course equal to frac{1}{2} as it is the mid-point of CD. Thus, the area of the first triangle is [DQ_1P_1]=frac{1}{2} ⋅ frac{1}{2} ⋅ frac{1}{3}. The second triangle has a base DQ_2^{} equal to that of P_1^{}Q_2^{} (see that triangle DQ_2^{}P_1^{} ~ triangle DCB) and using the same similar triangle logic as with the first triangle, we find the area to be [DQ_2P_2]=frac{1}{2} ⋅ frac{1}{3} ⋅ frac{1}{4}. If we continue and test the next few triangles, we will find that the sum of all triangle DQ_i^{}P_i^{} is equal to [frac{1}{2} sumlimits_{n=2}^infty frac{1}{n(n+1)}] or [frac{1}{2} sumlimits_{n=2}^infty left(frac{1}{n} - frac{1}{n+1}right)]This is known as a telescoping series because we can see that every term after the first frac{1}{n} is going to cancel out.

The intersection of this and BD, which is the line y=x, is[P_i = left(frac{k}{k+1}, frac{k}{k+1}right)].As Q_{i+1} is the projection of P_i onto the x-axis, it lies at left(frac{k}{k+1}, 0right). We have thus established that moving from Q_i to Q_{i+1} is equivalent to the transformation x rightarrow frac{x}{x+1} on the x-coordinate.

It is easy to see that the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle cannot be a unit length (1. figure), because then the length of the leg would be frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, and a regular triangle with a unit side cannot fit this. Therefore, the sought solid consists of 2 regular and 2 right-angled triangles with unit legs (2. figure).Let the base be the right-angled triangle A B C. The projection of the fourth vertex D onto the base plane is D^{prime} (3. figure). The right-angled triangles D D^{prime} A, D D^{prime} B, D D^{prime} C are congruent, as their hypotenuse is exactly the height of the solid; thus, D^{prime} A=D^{prime} B=D^{prime} C. The point D^{prime} is equidistant from the points A, B, C, and since A B C is a right-angled triangle, D^{prime} is the center of the Thales circle circumscribed around the triangle A B C. Therefore, D^{prime} A=D^{prime} B=D^{prime} C=frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, and the right-angled triangle D D^{prime} B is also isosceles.

By a change of variables ( u = frac{x - m}{sqrt{n}} ), we get:   [   dx = sqrt{n} , du   ]   Thus, the integral becomes:   [   int_{-infty}^{infty} frac{1}{u^2 + 1} sqrt{n} , du = sqrt{n} int_{-infty}^{infty} frac{1}{u^2 + 1} , du = sqrt{n} pi   ]3. Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality:   Let ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ) be the roots of ( p ). By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:   [   left( sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{x - x_k} right)^2 leq n sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{(x - x_k)^2}   ]4. Function Analysis:   Consider the function ( f(x) = frac{x^2}{1 + x^2} ). This function is increasing for ( x geq 0 ). Therefore, we can write:   [   int_{-infty}^{infty} frac{(p'(x))^2}{(p'(x))^2 + (p(x))^2} , dx = int_{-infty}^{infty} frac{left( frac{p'(x)}{p(x)} right)^2}{left( frac{p'(x)}{p(x)} right)^2 + 1} , dx   ]5. Bounding the Integral:   Using the previous steps, we can bound the integral as follows:   [   int_{-infty}^{infty} frac{(p'(x))^2}{(p'(x))^2 + (p(x))^2} , dx leq int_{-infty}^{infty} frac{sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{n}{(x - x_k)^2}}{n sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{(x - x_k)^2} + 1} , dx   ]6. Further Simplification:   We further simplify the expression:   [   frac{frac{n}{(x - x_j)^2}}{n sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{(x - x_k)^2} + 1} leq frac{frac{n}{(x - x_j)^2}}{n frac{1}{(x - x_j)^2} + 1} = frac{n}{n + (x - x_j)^2} < frac{n}{n + (x - Re{x_j})^2}   ]7. Combining Results:   Putting everything together, we get:   [   int_{-infty}^{infty} frac{(p'(x))^2}{(p'(x))^2 + (p(x))^2} , dx < sum_{k=1}^{n} sqrt{n} pi = n^{3/2} pi   ]The final answer is ( boxed{ n^{3/2} pi } )"},{"problem":"Which of the following statements is false?mathrm{(A)  All equilateral triangles are congruent to each other.}mathrm{(B)   All equilateral triangles are convex.}mathrm{(C)   All equilateral triangles are equianguilar.}mathrm{(D)   All equilateral triangles are regular polygons.}mathrm{(E)   All equilateral triangles are similar to each other.}","solution":"An equilateral triangle is isosceles, and we find that angle A=angle B=angle C if we use the property of isosceles triangles that if two sides of a triangle are equal then the opposite angles are equal.

A winning position is one where the player whose turn it is can force a win, while a losing position is one where the player whose turn it is will lose if the opponent plays optimally.1. Base Cases:   - If there are 0 chips left, the player to move loses because they cannot make a move. Thus, 0 is a losing position.   - If there are 2, 4, or 5 chips left, the player to move can take all the chips and win. Thus, 2, 4, and 5 are winning positions.   - If there are 1 or 3 chips left, the player to move cannot take a valid number of chips (since they must take 2, 4, or 5 chips). Thus, 1 and 3 are losing positions.2. Inductive Step:   - Assume we know the winning and losing positions up to some number ( n ). We need to determine the status of ( n+1 ).   - If ( n+1 ) is a losing position, then the player to move cannot force a win. This means that for all possible moves ( s in {2, 4, 5} ), the resulting position ( n+1-s ) must be a winning position.   - Conversely, if ( n+1 ) is a winning position, then there must be at least one move ( s in {2, 4, 5} ) such that the resulting position ( n+1-s ) is a losing position.3. Pattern Recognition:   - By examining the positions modulo 7, we can identify a pattern:     - ( 0 mod 7 ) is a losing position (as shown by the base case).     - ( 1 mod 7 ) is a losing position (as shown by the base case).     - ( 2 mod 7 ) is a winning position (as shown by the base case).     - ( 3 mod 7 ) is a losing position (as shown by the base case).     - ( 4 mod 7 ) is a winning position (as shown by the base case).     - ( 5 mod 7 ) is a winning position (as shown by the base case).     - ( 6 mod 7 ) is a winning position (as shown by the base case).4. Generalization:   - We can generalize this pattern to all numbers:     - ( 7k ) and ( 7k+1 ) are losing positions.     - ( 7k+2, 7k+3, 7k+4, 7k+5, 7k+6 ) are winning positions.5. Application to 2016 Chips:   - We need to determine the position of 2016 modulo 7:     [     2016 mod 7 = 0     ]   - Since 2016 is equivalent to 0 modulo 7, it is a losing position.6. Conclusion:   - Since 2016 is a losing position, the first player ( A ) will lose if both players play optimally. Therefore, player ( B ) can force a win.The final answer is ( boxed{ B } ) can force a win."},{"problem":"1.

However, since the {12} unit can be in two different orders—either as {12} or {21}—this doubles the number of possible permutations.Step 2: Calculate the number of permutations with our single unit {12} as 4! times 2 = 24 times 2 = 48. Step 3: Now, consider the fact that 0 cannot be the leading digit in a five-digit number. This means we have to subtract the cases where 0 is the leading digit from the total we calculated in step 2.

This accounts for both positive and negative values of a, ensuring the output is non-negative, as per the principal square root's definition.- For option D: sqrt{a^2}={a^2} is incorrect because it suggests that taking the square root of a square returns the square, which contradicts the definition of the square root operation.Therefore, based on the analysis:because a can be any real number,therefore sqrt{a^2} = |a| is the correct calculation, as it accurately reflects the principal square root's property and the absolute value's role in ensuring the output is non-negative for any real number a.Hence, the correct option is boxed{C}."},{"problem":"Given that two children, A and B, and three adults, 甲, 乙, and 丙, are standing in a line, A is not at either end, and exactly two of the three adults are standing next to each other.

The coordinates of the point symmetric to left(1,-1right) with respect to left(x,yright) are given by left(2-x,-2-yright), because the midpoint formula implies that the midpoint between a point and its symmetric point with respect to another point is the latter point itself.

Understanding the Problem:   We are given an acute triangle triangle ABC in plane P and a point Q in space such that angle AQB = angle BQC = angle CQA = 90^circ. This implies that Q is the orthocenter of the triangle formed by the points A, B, C in space. Point X is the projection of Q onto plane P, meaning QX is perpendicular to plane P.2. Identifying Key Points:   Since Q is the orthocenter of the triangle formed by A, B, C in space, and X is the projection of Q onto plane P, X must be the orthocenter of triangle ABC in plane P. This is because the orthocenter of a triangle is the point where the altitudes intersect, and the projection of the orthocenter in space onto the plane of the triangle is the orthocenter of the triangle in that plane.3.

Using the Orthocenter Property:   A well-known property of the orthocenter in a triangle is that angle AXC = 180^circ - angle ABC.

Factorize (10!) into its prime factors:   [   10! = 2^8 times 3^4 times 5^2 times 7   ]3. Convert the prime factors into digits:   - We need to use digits from 1 to 9 to form the number.   - Digits 0 and 1 are not useful since they do not change the product.4. Distribute the factors into digits:   - The digit 7 must appear exactly once.   - The digit 5 must appear twice.   - We need to distribute the remaining factors of 2 and 3.5. Combine factors to form digits:   - The factors of 2 can be combined as follows:     [     2^3 = 8, quad 2^2 = 4, quad 2^1 = 2     ]   - The factors of 3 can be combined as follows:     [     3^2 = 9, quad 3^1 = 3     ]6.

Define Points and Circles:   Let ( A' = overline{AQ} cap overline{BC} ) and ( D' = overline{DQ} cap overline{BC} ). Define circles (omega_1 = odot(QBA')) and (omega_2 = odot(QCD')).2. Angle Condition:   Given (angle BQC = angle A'D'Q), it implies that (omega_1) and (omega_2) are tangent to each other at point (Q).3. Equivalent Problem:   Since (angle QAD = angle QA'B), the problem is equivalent to proving that (overline{PQ}) is tangent to (omega_1). This is equivalent to showing that point (P) lies on the radical axis of (omega_1) and (omega_2).4. Intersection Points:   Let (X = overline{AC} cap omega_2 neq C) and (Y = overline{BD} cap omega_1 neq B).5. Radical Axes Theorem:   By the Radical Axes Theorem on (omega_1), (omega_2), and (odot(ADXY)), the problem reduces to proving that points (A, D, X, Y) are concyclic.6. Concyclic Points:   Observe that:   [   angle AXQ = angle QD'C = 180^circ - angle QDA implies X in odot(ADQ)   ]   Similarly, (Y in odot(ADQ)).7. Conclusion:   Therefore, points (A, D, Q, X, Y) are concyclic, as desired. This implies that (angle BQP = angle DAQ).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ angle BQP = angle DAQ } )"},{"problem":"A poverty alleviation office in a certain county decides to dispatch 8 officials (5 males and 3 females) into two groups to participate in poverty alleviation work in two poor villages, Village A and Village B. The requirement is that each group must have at least 3 people and must include male officials. The number of different dispatch plans is ______.","solution":"Since each group must have at least 3 people and must include male officials, there are two ways to group by number, 3 people in one group and 5 people in the other, or 4 people in each group, evenly divided into two groups.1. If the female officials form a group by themselves, there is only 1 dispatch plan. If we don't consider the female officials forming a group by themselves, there are C_3 dispatch plans. Since it is possible to send 3 people to Village A and 5 people to Village B, or vice versa, the number of dispatch plans for the first case is (C_{8}^{3} - 1) cdot A_{2}^{2} = 110.2. Since there are only 3 female officials, it is impossible for them to form a group by themselves. Therefore, the number of dispatch plans for the second case is C_{8}^{4} cdot C_{4}^{4} = 70.Thus, the total number of different dispatch plans is 110 + 70 = 180.Therefore, the answer is boxed{180}.This problem primarily tests the application of permutations and combinations, and the key to solving it is to group according to the number of people."},{"problem":"If a^{10}div (a^{k})^{4}=a^{2}, then k=______.","solution":"To solve the equation a^{10}div (a^{k})^{4}=a^{2}, we follow the rules of exponents step by step:1.

So, we rewrite the given equation as:a^{10}div (a^{k})^{4}=a^{2}becomesa^{10}div a^{4k}=a^{2}2. Next, we apply the rule for division of exponents:a^{10-4k}=a^{2}3. Since the bases on both sides of the equation are the same and the equation is true, the exponents must be equal. Therefore, we set the exponents equal to each other:10-4k=24. Now, we solve for k:begin{align*}10 - 4k &= 2 10 - 2 &= 4k 8 &= 4k k &= frac{8}{4} k &= 2end{align*}Therefore, the value of k that satisfies the given equation is boxed{2}."},{"problem":"The negation of the proposition \\"There exists a real number x such that x^2+2x-8=0\\" is (　　)A: For any real number x, x^2+2x-8=0B: There does not exist a real number x such that x^2+2x-8neq0C: For any real number x, x^2+2x-8neq0D: There exists a real number x such that x^2+2x-8neq0","solution":"Since the negation of an existential proposition is a universal proposition,The negation of the proposition \\"There exists a real number x such that x^2+2x-8=0\\" is \\"For any real number x, x^2+2x-8neq0\\",Therefore, the correct option is: boxed{text{C}}This conclusion can be reached based on the principle that the negation of an existential proposition is a universal proposition.This question mainly tests the negation of propositions containing quantifiers, which is quite basic."},{"problem":"9.3.

Solution. If three digits are appended to 2014, the resulting number will be leq 2014 999. Dividing 2014999 by 2520= LCM (1,2, ldots, 9), we get a quotient of 799 and a remainder of 1519. Since 1519>1000, there is no integer multiple of 2520 between the numbers 2014000 and 2014999. Therefore, it is impossible to append three digits to 2014. From this, it follows that it is also impossible to append one or two digits (otherwise, it would be possible to append zeros to make up three digits). Four digits will be sufficient, since 10000>2520, and therefore there is an integer multiple of 2520 between 20140000 and 20149999 (the smallest of such numbers is 20142360=2520 cdot 7993)."},{"problem":"XI OM - I - Task 3Each side of a triangle with a given area  S  is divided into three equal parts, and the points of division are connected by segments, skipping one point to form two triangles.

Verifying the equality condition:   If (a_i = 1) for all (i), then:   [   sqrt{frac{k cdot 1^k}{(k-1) cdot 1^k + 1}} = sqrt{frac{k}{k}} = 1.   ]   Therefore,   [   sum_{i=1}^n sqrt{frac{k cdot 1^k}{(k-1) cdot 1^k + 1}} = sum_{i=1}^n 1 = n.   ]   This satisfies the given equation.Thus, the only solution is (a_i = 1) for all (i).The final answer is ( boxed{ a_i = 1 } ) for all (i)."},{"problem":"Given the following four propositions, the incorrect propositions are(()     ())(①) If (cos (A-B)cos (B-C)cos (C-A)=1), then (triangle ABC ) is an equilateral triangle;(②) If (sin A=cos B), then (triangle ABC ) is a right-angled triangle;(③) If (cos Acos Bcos C < 0), then (triangle ABC ) is an obtuse triangle;(④) If (sin 2A=sin 2B), then (triangle ABC ) is an isosceles triangle.A: (①②)B: (③④)C: (①③)D: (②④)","solution":"AnalysisThis question examines the properties of the cosine function, and each proposition can be judged individually.SolutionFor (①), since (A-B in (-pi,pi)), (B-C in (-pi,pi)), (C-A in (-pi,pi)),thus (-1 < cos (A-B) leqslant 1), (-1 < cos (B-C) leqslant 1), (-1 < cos (C-A) leqslant 1).

Given Equation and Initial Analysis:   We start with the given equation:   [   frac{P(1) + P(3) + P(5) + ldots + P(2n-1)}{n} = lambda P(n)   ]   for all positive integers ( n ). We need to find all real values of ( lambda ) for which there exists a nonzero polynomial ( P ) with real coefficients satisfying this equation.2. Rewriting the Equation:   Multiply both sides by ( n ):   [   P(1) + P(3) + P(5) + ldots + P(2n-1) = lambda n P(n)   ]3. Considering the Polynomial Degree:   Let ( deg(P) = k ). We assume ( P(x) = a_k x^k + a_{k-1} x^{k-1} + ldots + a_0 ).4. Analyzing the Polynomial ( P ):   We need to find a relationship between ( P(n) ) and ( P(2n+1) ). Consider the difference:   [   lambda (n+1) P(n+1) - lambda n P(n) = P(2n+1)   ]   This must hold for all positive integers ( n ).5. Degree Consideration:   Since ( P ) is a polynomial of degree ( k ), the degree of ( P(n+1) ) and ( P(n) ) is ( k ), and the degree of ( P(2n+1) ) is also ( k ). Therefore, the degrees on both sides of the equation must match.6. Finding ( lambda ):   By comparing the leading coefficients, we find:   [   lambda (n+1)^k - lambda n^k = (2n+1)^k   ]   For large ( n ), the dominant term on the left is ( lambda k n^{k-1} ) and on the right is ( 2^k n^k ). Equating these gives:   [   lambda k n^{k-1} = 2^k n^k   ]   Solving for ( lambda ):   [   lambda = frac{2^k}{k+1}   ]7. Existence of Polynomial ( P ):   The solution space is a vector space. If ( lambda ) is of the form ( frac{2^k}{k+1} ), the linear map ( P(x) to lambda (x+1)P(x+1) - lambda xP(x) - P(2x+1) ) defines a map from the space of polynomials of degree at most ( k ) to the space of polynomials of degree at most ( k-1 ). This map has a non-trivial kernel, so such a polynomial ( P ) does exist.8. Case for ( lambda = 2 ):   For ( lambda = 2 ):   [   2 = frac{2^k}{k+1}   ]   Solving for ( k ):   [   2(k+1) = 2^k implies k+1 = 2^{k-1}   ]   Testing values, we find ( k = 3 ) satisfies this equation.9. Form of Polynomial ( P ):   For ( k = 3 ), ( P ) is a cubic polynomial. We have:   [   P(x) = a(x^2 - 1)(x + b)   ]   Setting ( x = 0 ) gives ( P(-1) = 0 ), and setting ( x = 1 ) gives ( P(1) = 0 ). Therefore, ( P(x) = a(x^2 - 1)x ).10. Verification:    Substituting ( P(x) = a(x^2 - 1)x ) into the original equation confirms that it satisfies the given condition for ( lambda = 2 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ lambda = frac{2^k}{k+1} } ) and for ( lambda = 2 ), ( P(x) = a(x^2 - 1)x )."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x) = x^2 + 2x, and g(x) + f(-x) = 0.1.

Each of them can be described by a linear equation of the form a_{i} x+b_{i} y+c_{i} z+d_{i}=0 with d_{i} neq 0 for i in{1, ldots, m}. We then obtain the polynomial of degree m:P(x, y, z)=prod_{i=1}^{m}left(a_{i} x+b_{i} y+c_{i} z+d_{i}right)which vanishes at all points of S but not at the origin.We now define the operator Delta_{x} which acts on polynomials in three variables by replacing a polynomial Q with the polynomial Delta_{x} Q defined by:Delta_{x} Q(x, y, z)=Q(x+1, y, z)-Q(x, y, z)We define the operators Delta_{y} and Delta_{z} similarly. (These operators are discrete versions of differentiation operators, and the idea can be useful in other contexts).We note that each of these operators reduces the degree of the polynomial to which it is applied by at least 1. By applying these operators successively to our polynomial P, we observe (and prove by induction) that Delta_{x}^{r} Delta_{y}^{s} Delta_{z}^{t} P(0,0,0) (which means applying Delta_{x} r times, Delta_{y} s times, and Delta_{z} t times to the polynomial P and evaluating at left.(0,0,0)right) is never zero for r, s, t leq n.

Since the trapezoid has a circumcircle, it is isosceles. Since by construction A B S D is a parallelogram, it follows that B S = A D = B C and D S = A B.We consider the reflection across the line M S. This clearly maps E and F onto each other and u onto itself. We say that the trapezoid satisfies the angle condition if the angles angle B S E and angle F S C are equal.The trapezoid satisfies the angle condition if and only if the reflection maps the rays S B and S C onto each other. This is equivalent to the intersection points of these rays with u being mapped onto each other, and in the corresponding order.We first consider the case where B lies between S and T, see Figure 1. Then, according to the above reasoning, the trapezoid satisfies the angle condition if and only if B and C are mapped onto each other. This is equivalent to the triangle B S C being isosceles with the symmetry axis S M. Since M as the circumcenter lies on the perpendicular bisector of B C, this is equivalent to C S = B S. Since B S = B C, this is equivalent to the triangle B S C being equilateral. Again, because B S = B C, this is equivalent to angle C S B = 60^circ.

This is exactly the case when A B = A D.Remark.

Solution","solution":": n = square or twice a square. We can write the polynomial as (x 2 - (n - 2)) 2 - 8x 2 . This cannot have any integral solutions because then we would have A 2 = 8 B 2 , and the lhs has an even number of powers of 2 and the rhs an odd number. So if the polynomial factorises, it must do so as (x 2 + ax + b)(x 2 + Ax + B). Comparing terms in x 3 , A = - a. There are now two cases: (1) a is non-zero, (2) a is zero. In case (1), comparing terms in x, we deduce B = b. Comparing constant terms, gives b = n - 2 or 2 - n. Comparing terms in x 2 gives a 2 = 2n + 4 + 2b. We cannot have b = 2 - n, for then a 2 = 8, contradicting a integral. Hence, b = n - 2 and a 2 = 4n. So n must be a perfect square. Put n = k 2 , then we can easily check that the polynomial factorises: x 4 - (2k 2 +4)x 2 + (k 2 - 2) 2 = (x 2 +2kx + k 2 - 2)(x 2 -2kx + k 2 - 2). In case (2), we have b + B = -(2n + 4), bB = (n - 2) 2 . Hence b(-b - 2n - 4) = (n - 2) 2 , so b 2 + b(2n + 4) + (n - 2) 2 = 0. Hence (b + n + 2) 2 = 8n. So n must be 2k 2 for some integer k. It is easy to check that in that case the polynomial factorises: x 4 - (4k 2 +4)x 2 + (2k 2 - 2) 2 = (x 2 - 2k 2 - 4k - 2)(x 2 - 2k 2 + 4k - 2). 62nd Putnam 2001 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 16 Dec 2001"},{"problem":"Observe: 1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot 4 + 1 = 5^2,  2 cdot 3 cdot 4 cdot 5 + 1 = 11^2,  3 cdot 4 cdot 5 cdot 6 + 1 = 19^2,  ...

Additionally, these teams have played a total of k cdot (n-k) games against the teams occupying positions k+1, k+2, ldots, n and have earned at most 2 k cdot (n-k) points in these games.Thus, the teams occupying positions 1 to k have earned no more thank(k-1) + 2 k(n-k) = k(2n - k - 1)points in total.From this, it follows that the team in position k has not earned more than 2n - k - 1 points; for if this were the case, then each of the teams in positions 1, ldots, k would also have earned more than 2n - k - 1 points, resulting in a total of more than k(2n - k - 1) points for these teams.The n-k teams in positions k+1, ldots, n have played a total of frac{(n-k)(n-k-1)}{2} games among themselves and have thus earned a total of (n-k)(n-k-1) points.Therefore, the team in position k+1 must have earned at least n - k - 1 points; for if it were less, then the same would be true for each of the teams in positions k+1, ldots, n, and the total points from these games would be less than (n-k)(n-k-1).Consequently, in any possible tournament, the point difference between any two teams occupying adjacent positions k and k+1 in the final standings cannot exceed(2n - k - 1) - (n - k - 1) = nIf an example of a tournament is provided where two adjacent teams have a point difference of n, then n is proven to be the desired number.Such an example is obtained if, in a tournament, the team in position 1 wins against all other teams, thus earning 2n - 2 points, and the other teams play each other to a draw, so that each of these teams earns n - 2 points for these n - 2 games and thus a total of n - 2 points in the final standings.The point difference between the teams in positions 1 and 2 is then (2n - 2) - (n - 2) = n points.Adapted from [5]"},{"problem":"Given that x geqslant 1 and y geqslant 1, prove that x + y + frac{1}{xy} leqslant frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + xy.","solution":"To prove the given inequality, since x geqslant 1 and y geqslant 1, it suffices to show that xy(x + y) + 1 leqslant y + x + (xy)^2.Observe thatbegin{align*}&[y + x + (xy)^2] - [xy(x + y) + 1] &= (xy)^2 - 1 - xy(x + y) + (x + y) &= (xy + 1)(xy - 1) - (x + y)(xy - 1) &= (xy - 1)[(xy + 1) - (x + y)] &= (xy - 1)(xy - x - y + 1) &= (xy - 1)(x - 1)(y - 1).end{align*}Since x geqslant 1 and y geqslant 1, we have (xy - 1)(x - 1)(y - 1) geqslant 0, which implies that the desired inequality is true.Therefore, we can conclude that boxed{x + y + frac{1}{xy} leqslant frac{1}{x} + frac{1}{y} + xy}."},{"problem":"In the 18th century, Euler discovered through research that for convex polyhedra, the number of faces F, the number of vertices V, and the number of edges E satisfy an equation.

Set u=a+b sqrt{d}. Then for each nonzero integer n, every solution of x^{2}-d y^{2}=n is a power of u times x+y sqrt{d} where (x, y) is an integer solution of x^{2}-d y^{2}=n with |x| leq sqrt{|n|}(sqrt{u}+1) / 2 and |y| leq sqrt{|n|}(sqrt{u}+1) /(2 sqrt{d}).We now let g=operatorname{gcd}(n, 3 n-2). Then g in{1,2} since g mid 3 n-(3 n-2)=2. We now consider the following cases:- Suppose g=1. Then n=y^{2} and 3 n-2=x^{2} for some relatively prime positive integers x and y. This leads us to the generalized Pell equation x^{2}-3 y^{2}=-2. Set u=2+sqrt{3}, with (2,1) being a solution of x^{2}-3 y^{2}=1 in positive integers. We now look for the positive integer solutions (x, y) of x^{2}-3 y^{2}=-2 with x leq sqrt{2}(sqrt{u}+1) / 2 approx 2.07 and y leq sqrt{2}(sqrt{u}+1) /(2 sqrt{3}) approx 1.2. We obtain (x, y)=(1,1) as the only such integer solution, so by the above lemma, we see that all positive integer solutions left(x_{k}, y_{k}right) of x^{2}-3 y^{2}=-2 are given by x_{k}+y_{k} sqrt{3}=(1+sqrt{3})(2+sqrt{3})^{k} for all integers k geq 0. We now compute this product for small values of k :As n<1000, we require that y_{k} leq 31, so the positive integer solutions left(x_{k}, y_{k}right) of x^{2}-3 y^{2}= -2 with y_{k} leq 31 are left(x_{k}, y_{k}right)=(1,1),(5,3),(19,11) (which indeed have relatively prime coordinates). These correspond to the values of n: n=1,9,121.- Suppose g=2. Then n=2 y^{2} and 3 n-2=2 x^{2} for some relatively prime positive integers x and y. This leads us to the generalized Pell equation x^{2}-3 y^{2}=-1. Again, we set u=2+sqrt{3}.

Since each interior angle is 144^{circ}, the exterior angle, which is supplementary to the interior angle, is calculated as:[180^{circ} - 144^{circ} = 36^{circ}]2. Determine the number of sides of the polygon. The sum of all exterior angles of a polygon is always 360^{circ}, so the number of sides (n) can be found by dividing 360^{circ} by the measure of one exterior angle:[n = frac{360^{circ}}{36^{circ}} = 10]3. Calculate the sum of the interior angles of the polygon. The sum (S) of the interior angles of an (n)-sided polygon is given by the formula (S = (n-2) times 180^{circ}).

The problem states that the sum of the distances from the top of the pole to the two ends of the bridge is 20001 meters. Therefore, we have:   [   2 sqrt{10000^2 + h^2} = 20001   ]4. Solving for ( h ), we first divide both sides by 2:   [   sqrt{10000^2 + h^2} = 10000.5   ]5. Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root gives:   [   10000^2 + h^2 = 10000.5^2   ]6. Calculating ( 10000.5^2 ):   [   10000.5^2 = (10000 + 0.5)^2 = 10000^2 + 2 cdot 10000 cdot 0.5 + 0.5^2 = 100000000 + 10000 + 0.25 = 100010000.25   ]7. Substituting back into the equation:   [   100000000 + h^2 = 100010000.25   ]8. Solving for ( h^2 ):   [   h^2 = 100010000.25 - 100000000 = 10000.25   ]9. Taking the square root of both sides:   [   h = sqrt{10000.25} approx 100.00125   ]10.

What could be the last digit of the area's measure, if the length of the hypotenuse is not divisible by 5?","solution":"Let the lengths of the legs be a and b, and the length of the hypotenuse be c. According to the Pythagorean theorem, we then havea^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}A square number can give a remainder of 0, 1, or 4 when divided by 5. If neither a nor b is divisible by 5, then the left side of (1) can give a remainder of 2 (in the form 1+1), 0 (in the form 1+4), or 3 (in the form 4+4) when divided by 5. Since 2 and 3 cannot be the remainder of a square number -c^{2} when divided by 5, and 0 is excluded by the condition, if the length of the hypotenuse is not divisible by 5, then the length of one of the legs will be divisible by 5.If both legs are even, then their product is divisible by 4. We claim that this is also true if there is an odd leg.First, note that both legs cannot be odd. In this case, in (1), a^{2}+b^{2} would be even, and thus c^{2}, as an even square number, would be divisible by 4, while a^{2} and b^{2}, when divided by 4, would each give a remainder of 1, making their sum 2. In this case, however, equality could not hold in (1).If now one of the legs, say a, is odd, then b is even, and c is odd. From (1),b^{2}=(c+a)(c-a)Here, both factors on the right side are even. If neither is divisible by 4, then they each give a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, so their sum, 2c, is divisible by 4. This would, however, make c even, which is not true.Thus, in (2), the right side is also divisible by 2^{3}=8. We know that a square number, in this case b^{2}, has every prime factor in its prime factorization with an even exponent. This means that b^{2} is divisible by 2^{4}, and thus b is divisible by 4.This proves that if (1) holds, then ab is divisible by 4. The area of the triangle, ab/2, is thus an even number. Since there is a leg divisible by 5, the area is also divisible by 2 cdot 5=10, so the last digit of its measure is 0.Remark. The statement - that on the one hand, in every Pythagorean triple there is a number divisible by 5, and on the other hand, the product of the legs is divisible by 4 - can also be easily shown based on the known characterization of Pythagorean triples. According to this characterization, Pythagorean triples can be written in the form a=kleft(u^{2}-v^{2}right), b=2 k cdot u v, and c=kleft(u^{2}+v^{2}right), where k is any natural number, and u and v are relatively prime numbers of different parities, with u>v.

The key to understanding its monotonicity lies in its axis of symmetry and its direction of opening. Step 1: Determine the Axis of SymmetryThe axis of symmetry of a quadratic function in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c is given by x = -frac{b}{2a}. For our function, y = x^2 - 2ax + 1, the axis of symmetry is at x = a. Step 2: Monotonicity Conditions1. Monotonically Increasing Function:   If the function is monotonically increasing on the interval (2, 3), it implies that the axis of symmetry must be to the left of 2. This is because, for a function that opens upwards (as the coefficient of x^2 is positive), if the axis of symmetry is left of the interval, the function values are increasing within that interval. Therefore, we have a leqslant 2.2. Monotonically Decreasing Function:   Conversely, if the function is monotonically decreasing on the interval (2, 3), it implies that the axis of symmetry must be to the right of 3. In this case, as the interval is left of the axis of symmetry, the function values are decreasing as x moves from 2 to 3. Hence, a geqslant 3. ConclusionBased on the conditions for monotonicity, a must satisfy either a leqslant 2 or a geqslant 3 to ensure that the quadratic function y=x^{2}-2ax+1 is monotonic in the interval (2, 3).

Therefore, the minimum distance is: sqrt{2}left(2+frac{ln 3}{3}right)."},{"problem":"Given a complex number z=bi (bin mathbb{R}), frac{z-2}{1+i} is a real number, where i is the imaginary unit.

Step 2: Calculate the derivative, F'(x) = e^{x} - 1.  Step 3: Determine the sign of F'(x).  - If x > 0, then e^{x} - 1 > 0, implying F'(x) > 0.  - If x  0 for x > 0, F(x) is increasing in (0, +infty).

Step 5: Consider a > 2.  - If a > 2, then h'(0) < 0, indicating h(x) could decrease initially.  - There must exist some x_0 such that h(x_0) < h(0) = 0, contradicting the condition for all a in mathbb{R}.

Understanding the properties of f(x):     - Since f(x) is an even function, we know that f(x) = f(-x) for all x in its domain, which is mathbb{R}.   - Given that {f'}(x)  0, it means f(x) is decreasing on the interval (0, +infty). Because f(x) is even, it is also decreasing as x moves away from 0 in either direction on the real number line. This implies that the smaller the absolute value of x, the larger the value of f(x).2. Analyzing the inequality f(x^{2}-x)-f(x) gt 0:     - The inequality suggests that f(x^{2}-x) > f(x). Since f(x) is larger when its argument is closer to 0, this implies that |x^{2}-x| must be less than |x| for the inequality to hold.3. Solving the inequality |x^{2}-x| < |x|:     - To understand this inequality better, we consider the function g(x) = x^{2}-x. The inequality |x^{2}-x| < |x| implies that the square of x minus x is somehow \\"closer\\" to 0 than x itself, in terms of absolute values.   - Squaring both sides (to remove the absolute value and compare the magnitudes directly) and simplifying gives us x^{4} - 2x^{3} < 0, which simplifies further to x^{2} - 2x < 0 by factoring out common terms and reducing the inequality.4. Finding the solution set:     - The inequality x^{2} - 2x < 0 can be factored to x(x - 2) < 0. This inequality holds true for 0 < x < 2.   - Therefore, the solution set for the original inequality f(x^{2}-x)-f(x) gt 0 is the interval (0, 2).Hence, the correct answer is boxed{B}."},{"problem":"11.

Identify the structure of ( n ):   - Given that ( n ) has exactly six positive divisors, we can infer that ( n ) must be of the form ( p^5 ) or ( p^2 q ) where ( p ) and ( q ) are distinct primes.

Notice that ( sum_{C subseteq {1, 2, ldots, n}} P(C) ) is the sum of the products of all subsets of ( {1, 2, ldots, n} ).

Identify the Vertex of the Original Parabola:   The given parabola is y=-frac{1}{2}x^{2}. The vertex form of a parabola is y=a(x-h)^{2}+k, where (h,k) are the coordinates of the vertex. For the given parabola, a=-frac{1}{2}, and since it's in the form y=ax^{2}, we can deduce that h=0 and k=0. Therefore, the vertex coordinates of the original parabola are left(0,0right).2. Determine the Shift:   We are shifting the parabola one unit to the right. According to the principle of \\"add up for up and subtract for down, add left and subtract right\\", shifting to the right means we will subtract the shift from the x-coordinate of the vertex. Therefore, the new vertex coordinates after shifting one unit to the right are left(0-1,0right) = left(-1,0right).3. Apply the Shift to the Parabola:   To apply the shift to the parabola, we adjust the x-coordinate in the vertex form of the parabola. The new vertex coordinates are left(1,0right), not left(-1,0right) as mistakenly mentioned in step 2. This correction is crucial for the accuracy of the solution. Therefore, the correct adjustment in the vertex form is to replace x with (x-1) because we are moving the parabola one unit to the right. This gives us the new equation of the parabola as y=-frac{1}{2}(x-1)^{2}.4. Conclusion:   The analytical expression of the new parabola, after shifting one unit to the right, is y=-frac{1}{2}(x-1)^{2}. Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{D}."},{"problem":"Example 3.48.

The answer is 15 .Note that there are 14 primes at most sqrt{2022}, starting with 2 and ending with 43 . Thus, the following partition works for 15 sets. Let S_{1}={2,4, ldots, 2022}, the multiples of 2 in S. Let S_{2}={3,9,15 ldots, 2019}, the remaining multiples of 3 in S not in S_{1}. Let S_{3}={5,25,35, ldots, 2015} the remaining multiples of 5 , and so on and so forth, until we get to S_{14}={43,1849,2021}. S_{15} consists of the remaining elements, i.e. 1 and those numbers with no prime factors at most 43 , i.e., the primes greater than 43 but less than 2022: S_{15}={1,47,53,59, ldots, 2017}. Each of S_{1}, S_{2}, ldots, S_{14} satisfies i., while S_{15} satisfies ii.We show now that no partition in 14 subsets is possible. Let a Type 1 subset of S be a subset S_{i} for which i. is true and there exists an integer d>1 for which d divides every element of S_{i}. Let a Type 2 subset of S be a subset S_{i} for which ii. is true. Finally, let a Type 3 subset of S be a subset S_{i} for which i. is true that is not a Type 1 subset. An example of a Type 3 subset would be a set of the form {p q, q r, p r} where p, q, r are distinct primes.Claim: Let p_{1}=2, p_{2}=3, p_{3}=5, ldots be the sequence of prime numbers, where p_{k} is the k th prime. Every optimal partition of the set S(k):=left{1,2, ldots, p_{k}^{2}right}, i.e., a partition with the least possible number of subsets, has at least k-1 Type 1 subsets. In particular, every optimal partition of this set has k+1 subsets in total. To see how this follows, we look at two cases:- If every prime p leq p_{k} has a corresponding Type 1 subset containing its multiples, then a similar partitioning to the above works: Take S_{1} to S_{k} as Type 1 subsets for each prime, and take S_{k+1} to be everything left over. S_{k+1} will never be empty, as it has 1 in it. While in fact it is known that, for example, by Bertrand's postulate there is always some prime between p_{k} and p_{k}^{2} so S_{k+1} has at least two elements, there is no need to go this far-if there were no other primes you could just move 2 from S_{1} into S_{k+1}, and if k>1 then S_{1} will still have at least three elements remaining. And if k=1, there is no need to worry about this, because 21 for all x in the same set as p, then operatorname{gcd}(p, x)=p, which implies that p is in a Type 1 set with d=p. Similarly, if operatorname{gcd}left(p^{2}, xright)>1 for all x in the same set as p^{2}, then p mid operatorname{gcd}left(p^{2}, xright) for all x, and so p^{2} is in a Type 1 set with d=p as well. Hence p and p^{2} must in fact be in Type 2 sets, and they cannot be in the same Type 2 set (as they share a common factor of p>1 ); this means that the optimal partition has at least k+1 subsets in total. A possible equality scenario for example is the sets S_{1}=left{1,2,3,5, ldots, p_{k}right}, S_{2}=left{4,9,25, ldots, p_{k}^{2}right}, and S_{3} to S_{k+1} Type 1 sets taking all remaining multiples of 2,3,5, ldots, p_{k-1}. This works, as p_{k} and p_{k}^{2} are the only multiples of p_{k} in S(k) with no prime factor other than p_{k} and thus cannot be classified into some other Type 1 set.To prove our claim: We proceed by induction on k. Trivially, this is true for k=1. Suppose now that any optimal partition of the set S(k) has at least k-1 Type 1 subsets, and thus at least k+1 subsets in total. Consider now a partition of the set S(k+1), and suppose that this partition would have at most k+1 subsets. From the above, there exist at least two primes p, q with p<q leq p_{k+1} for which there are no Type 1 subsets. If q<p_{k+1} we have a contradiction. Any such partition can be restricted to an optimal partition of S(k) with p<q leq p_{k} having no corresponding Type 1 subsets. This contradicts our inductive hypothesis. On the other hand, suppose that q=p_{k+1}. Again restricting to S(k) gives us an optimal partition of S(k) with at most k-1 Type 1 sets; the inductive hypothesis tells us that this partition has in fact exactly k-1 Type 1 sets and two Type 2 sets from a previous argument establishing the consequence of the claim. However, consider now the element p q. This cannot belong in any Type 1 set, neither can it belong in the same Type 2 set as p or p^{2}. Thus in addition to the given k-1 Type 1 sets and 2 Type 2 sets, we need an extra set to contain p q. Thus our partition of S(k+1) in fact has at least k-1+2+1=k+2 subsets, and not k+1 subsets as we wanted. The claim is thus proved.Returning to our original problem, since p_{14}=43<sqrt{2022}, any partition of S must restrict to a partition of S(14), which we showed must have at least 15 sets. Thus, we can do no better than 15 ."},{"problem":"Given that lg 5=m, lg 7=n, find log _{2}7=( )A: dfrac {m}{n}B: dfrac {n}{1-m}C: dfrac {1-n}{m}D: dfrac {1+n}{1+m}","solution":"Since lg 5=m, lg 7=n,then log _{2}7= dfrac {lg 7}{lg 2}= dfrac {lg 7}{1-lg 5}= dfrac {n}{1-m}.So the answer is boxed{B}.By using the change of base formula for logarithms and the properties of logarithmic operations, we can derive the answer.

A four-year-old horse can earn a maximum of 4 landricks over its entire participation in festivals.

If the horse starts participating in festivals at 2 years old, it can earn a maximum of 2+3+4=9 landricks over its 3 possible years of participation. If the horse starts participating in festivals at 3 years old, it can earn a maximum of 3+4=7 landricks. Therefore, the most optimal strategy is as follows. In the first year, the stable enters 4 one-year-old horses. The maximum winnings are 4 landricks. In the second year, the stable enters 4 new one-year-old horses and 4 two-year-olds that participated and won in the first year. The maximum winnings are 4+4 cdot 2=12 landricks.

Find all prime numbers p and q for which p^{4}-q^{6} is a power of a prime number. (The numbers 7 and 8 are powers of a prime number, but 6 is not.)","solution":"III/1. Let's write p^{4}-q^{6}=r^{n} for some prime r and natural number n. The expression p^{4}-q^{6} can be factored as p^{4}-q^{6}=left(p^{2}-q^{3}right)left(p^{2}+q^{3}right). Since p^{4}-q^{6}>0, the primes p and q cannot be equal, so they are coprime. Let d be the greatest common divisor of p^{2}-q^{3} and p^{2}+q^{3}. Then d also divides 2 p^{2} and 2 q^{3}, so due to the coprimality of p and q, d can be at most 2.If d=2, then r=2 and p^{2}-q^{3}=2 and p^{2}+q^{3}=2^{n-1}. Adding these equations and dividing by 2, we get p^{2}=1+2^{n-2} or 2^{n-2}=p^{2}-1=(p-1)(p+1). The numbers p-1 and p+1 must both be powers of 2, which is only possible if p=3. But then we get a contradiction q^{3}=7.Therefore, d=1. Since the numbers p^{2}-q^{3} and p^{2}+q^{3} are coprime and their product is a power of a prime, we must have p^{2}-q^{3}=1 or p^{2}=q^{3}+1=(q+1)left(q^{2}-q+1right). Since q is a prime, q+1>2 and q^{2}-q+1>2, so neither of the factors q+1 and q^{2}-q+1 is equal to 1. If we want their product to be the square of a prime, the factors must be equal. From the equation q+1=q^{2}-q+1 we get q=2 and from p^{2}=1+q^{3} we get p=3. Finally, we check that 3^{4}-2^{6}=17 is indeed a power of a prime.

Again, we write p^{4}-q^{6}=r^{n}. By considering the parity, we conclude that all three of p, q, r cannot be odd at the same time. Since r>0, we also have p>q. Due to the positivity of all terms, we also conclude that p, q, r are pairwise distinct. Since at least one is even, we can consider 3 cases. If p=2, then due to p>q we have q=1. In this case, there is no solution. If q=2, we can factor the expression: left(p^{2}-8right)left(p^{2}+8right)=r^{n}, or p^{2}-8=r^{a} and p^{2}+8=r^{b}, where a, b in mathbb{N}_{0}, and b>a. We again consider two cases: if a=0, we get the solution p=3, q=2, r=17. If a>0, we can subtract the equations and factor out r: 16=rleft(r^{b-1}-r^{a-1}right). This gives us r mid 16, from which we get r=2=q, which again does not give a solution. The only remaining case is when r=2. We again write p^{2}-q^{3}=2^{a} and p^{2}+q^{3}=2^{b}, where a, b in mathbb{N}_{0} and a1. It follows that both p-1 and p+1 are powers of 2, which is only possible if p=3, from which we get q^{3}=7. Again, there is no solution. If a>1, we add the equations and factor out 4: 2 p^{2}=4left(2^{b-2}-2^{a-2}right).

Since |AM| = sqrt{5} = r, point M lies on the circle. Therefore, the tangent line at M is perpendicular to the line containing AM.  Given M(1,2), the slope of the line containing AM is 2, so the slope of the tangent line is -frac{1}{2}.

Since the café opens at noon, if the last to arrive does so within the first hour, they will definitely meet, which is n^3 cases, as each of the three can choose any of the first n time points.For the other cases, consider when the last to arrive arrives: this can be in 6n different ways. If this last person arrives alone, the other two can choose from the previous n-1 time points, and it matters who was the last, which can happen in 3 ways, so this is 3(n-1)^2 cases. If two arrive last at the same time, the third can arrive in (n-1) time points, and again, it must be multiplied by 3 because the two who arrived last can be any of the three, which is 3(n-1) cases. When all three arrive in the same time unit, this is one case. The sum of these must be multiplied by 6n, because the arrival time of the last person can be any of 6n.This is a total of6nleft(3(n-1)^2 + 3(n-1) + 1right) = 18n^3 - 18n^2 + 6ncases.The probability that all three meet is the number of favorable cases divided by the total number of cases:frac{n^3 + 18n^3 - 18n^2 + 6n}{343n^3} = frac{19n^3 - 18n^2 + 6n}{343n^3} = frac{19}{343} - frac{18}{343n} + frac{6}{343n^2}We need to examine what this expression approaches as n approaches infinity, since in reality there are infinitely many time points in the 7 hours when they can arrive. Since the last two terms approach zero, the entire expression approaches frac{19}{343}, so this is the probability that all three will meet."},{"problem":"When a > 0 and a neq 1, the function f(x) = a^{x - 2} - 3 must pass through a fixed point.","solution":"Since a neq 1, we can evaluate the function at x = 2:f(2) = a^{2 - 2} - 3 = a^0 - 3 = 1 - 3 = -2.Hence, no matter the value of a (as long as a > 0 and a neq 1), when x = 2, f(x) will always equal -2.

Identify the Geometry of the Problem:   - We have four circles of radius (1) with centers (A, B, C, D) such that each circle is tangent to two others.   - This implies that the distance between any two adjacent centers is (2) (since the sum of the radii of two tangent circles is (1 + 1 = 2)).   - Therefore, the quadrilateral (ABCD) is a rhombus with side length (2).2. Case 1: Fifth Circle Passes Through Two Adjacent Centers (e.g., (A) and (B)):   - The fifth circle passes through (A) and (B) and is tangent to the circles centered at (C) and (D).   - The center of the fifth circle must lie on the perpendicular bisector of (AB) and (CD).   - Since (AB) and (CD) are parallel, the perpendicular bisectors are the same line.   - This implies that (ABCD) must be a square (since the perpendicular bisectors of a rhombus intersect at the center only if it is a square).   - The side length of the square is (2), so the area of (ABCD) is:     [     text{Area} = 2^2 = 4     ]3.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to show that if ( A ) is finite, then ( f(f_{infty}(A)) = f_{infty}(A) ). 2.

Finite Set Property:   Since ( A ) is finite, the sequence of sets ( f_n(A) ) is a descending chain of subsets of ( A ):   [   A supseteq f_1(A) supseteq f_2(A) supseteq f_3(A) supseteq ldots   ]   Because ( A ) is finite, this descending chain must stabilize at some point.

Each workpiece must pass through the machines in the order M_{1}, M_{2}, M_{3}, M_{4}, and the order of the three workpieces must be the same at each machine.The processing times of the workpieces on the individual machines are (in hours) given in the following table:|  | M_{1} | M_{2} | M_{3} | M_{4} || :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || W_{1} | 4 | 1 | 2 | 1.5 || W_{2} | 2 | 2.5 | 1 | 0.5 || W_{3} | 2 | 3.5 | 1 | 1 |Two workpieces can never be processed simultaneously on the same machine. The times for changing the workpieces at the machines are so small that they can be neglected.Give an order of the three workpieces for passing through the assembly line such that the total time (the time from the entry of the first workpiece into machine M_{1} to the exit of the last workpiece from machine M_{4}) is as small as possible! Show that the order you give with its total time is better than any other order!","solution":"(Machine designation shortened to 1,2,3,4 instead of M_{1}, M_{2}, M_{3}, M_{4})In the representations of the temporal sequence, the total time is determined for each of the six possible sequences of three workpieces, assuming that each machine receives the next workpiece (in the intended sequence) as soon as possible.When comparing these representations, it turns out:The sequence W_{3}, W_{1}, W_{2} outperforms all other sequences with its total time.Hints:It is also possible to proceed in a very argumentative manner. For example, one can first determine for which sequence- the sum of the times of the first and second workpieces in M_{1} plus the sum of the times of the third workpiece in M_{1}, M_{2}, M_{3}, and M_{4}yields the smallest possible value. Instead of the sum (1), one can more easily use- the sum of the times of the third workpiece in M_{2}, M_{3}, and M_{4}.According to the table in the problem text, this sum is smallest for W_{2} as the third workpiece (namely 4; in contrast, it is 4.5 for W_{1} and 5.5 for W_{3}). Then one can investigate whether for one of the sequences with W_{2} as the third workpiece it holds that- W_{2} can pass through the machines M_{1}, M_{2}, M_{3}, M_{4} without waiting times.If this is the case, it follows: This sequence outperforms the total times of all sequences that do not minimize (1) or (2).(Note: Without statement (3), such a conclusion would not be secure!) Finally, a sequence that satisfies (3) must be compared with the other one in which W_{2} is also the third workpiece. The investigation of (3) and the aforementioned comparison can, for example, be carried out using the two representations above for W_{1}, W_{3}, W_{2} and W_{3}, W_{1}, W_{2}. The consideration of (1) and (2) thus saves four such representations.Solutions of the 1st Round 1988 adopted from [5] 6.30.2 2nd Round 1988, Class 9"},{"problem":"Find the number of four-digit even numbers that can be formed using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 without repetition.","solution":"From the given problem, we know that the digit 0 cannot be placed in the first position (thousands place), and to form an even number, 0 must be in the last position (ones place).When the last digit is 0, we need to choose 3 digits out of the remaining 5 digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) to arrange in the other three places.

Buratino, Karabas-Barabas, and Duremar are running along a path around a circular pond. They start simultaneously from the same point, with Buratino running in one direction and Karabas-Barabas and Duremar running in the opposite direction. Buratino runs three times faster than Duremar and four times faster than Karabas-Barabas. After Buratino meets Duremar, he meets Karabas-Barabas 150 meters further. What is the length of the path around the pond?","solution":"# Solution:Let the length of the path be S.Since Buratino runs three times faster than Duremar, by the time they meet, Buratino has run three-quarters of the circle (3 / 4 S), while Duremar has run one-quarter. Since Buratino runs four times faster than Karabas-Barabas, by the time they meet, Buratino has run four-fifths of the circle, while Karabas-Barabas has run one-fifth (1 / 5 S).The distance between the meeting points is 150 meters.
