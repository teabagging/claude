I ve always been a bit anxious over trivial things that others seem to have no problem with, like going to work and presenting something in front of the class. My anxieties really hold me back and I feel like I can t do anything worthwhile whilst I feel this nervous. Most days I just feel down and find it difficult to keep going.

With due respect and honorable regards I mention my illness that: Three years ago because of no appetite and desire for food I was not able to eat the needed amount of food therefore I got a terrible pain in my stomach as I guessed it as a common matter it stretched in less than 6 months, and my sickness expanded not only to certain parts in stomach but also to the intestines, shoulders and stress on my mind. I really suffered from that bad sickness and always was in thought of suicide , finally I was sent to Karachi Pakistan for treatment and the Doctor gave me some mental pills and told that was enough for recovery but while I took the drugs, not only remained untreated but also ruined my digestive system and made my sickness worst as well. Suffering for 15 months I was again sent to Kabul for endoscopic medical tests, as the doctor performed his test he declared that I have a very bad virus named H.Pylori and gave the medidicine that matched my disease, but since five months I live without any supervision and guidance of any stomach doctor so, my sickness became active again and my head and stomach are in extremely bad condition. I do not know what to do but someone advised me to contact this site which is always present in service of poor patients, I was really happy hearing about this site and hope it will help solving my sickness.","Doctor":"Hello, If you have H. pylori infection then the full treatment course is 14 days long but even after completing full treatment, the chances of recurrence are very high. The only other choice is long term use of drugs called proton pump inhibitors. You can take Omeprazole capsule daily till you get relief. The other most important measure you must take is lifestyle modification. Worrying too much about the disease is a factor that aggravates it. So relax. Reduce intake of spicy food, quit alcohol and smoking, drink lots of fluids and hopefully you will be fine.

In today's world, the incidence of child abuse has gone up very much. Paedophiliacs as they are called, rarely admit to abusing a child.

Legal security can also be acquired as per the rules and the accused can be tried. The child needs lot of moral support from an understanding and dependable adult like you and would come out of the trauma in course of time. Any physical injuries should be attended to.

Seasonal changes in mood and behavior are a well documented entity.Seasonal Affective Disorder is a kind of mental disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of mood changes occurring yearly during specific seasons. The description by you points towards SAD. The changes are usually those of depression but in your mother's case it is more likely of what we call Recurrent Unipolar Mania as evident from the symptoms of racing thoughts and unpredictable behaviors in the background of hyper religiosity. SAD is thought of as being due to changes in the levels of certain hormones and neurotransmitters. It is imperative that your mother be seen by a Psychiatrist who will evaluate the seasonality (whether these episodes occur during summer or winter),presence of depressive/other symptoms during other seasons of the year and the nature and intensity of symptoms. SAD can be treated effectively by appropriate medications and it is also essential for her to maintain her biological rhythms such as her sleep  as disruption of these are likely to trigger/worsen episodes.

I was put on an anitdepressant called paxil for my anxiety. i started taking 5 mg for one week then i increased to 10 mg about two days after switching to the 10 i started to notice having a weird feeling i have never experienced before. i was feeling agitatied irrated depressed and very anxious and my nerves were on edge. i believed that it might be a side effect of the drug i tryied to push through it hearing that the side effects do go away after 4 days of this it became unbareable and i was so afraid that i quit taking it. the physical side effects went away within 2 days but i still felt aggition and depression and my anxiety was worse than before the medicine. i stopped taking it last tuesday. i told me doctor about this and he prescribed me a new antidepressant zoloft . both of the medications were generic brand. i took my first pill 25mg on this tuesday around noon. i did feel a little optimistic after taking it hoping it may help me. around 7 oclock that evening i started to feel this rush of fear and thoughts about all the bad things going on in my life. i started to panic and pace around my room crying and feeling like im going crazy. I ran outside to see if it would help but it didnt. I really wanted to go to the hospital but instead to calm me down i drank 2 glasses of whiskey in 20 mins. Ever since then i have become extremely aggitated and very anxious worse than before when i expeienced these symtoms on paxil. i wake up in the morning around 5 or 6 every day very anxious and racing thoughts. i fall asleep ok around midnight after being awake around 18 hours. In the past month me and my girlfriend broke up after being together for 2 years and i know it was because of my anxiety that our relationship failed. my car broke down so me and my dad are fixing it in his garage. ive been having problems at work because of my anxiety. Ive been smoking weed everyday for my anxiety over the past 2 years and just recently about a month ago decided to quit to get healthy and in shape. just everything pilling up it very overwhelming and depressing. i read online that seratonin syndrome can occur when you increase a dose in a ssri anitdepressant. Im wondering if my taking the zoloft agitated this and made my symtoms worse. I saw the doctor on thursday to tell him about this. he seemed he like he didnt know too much about mental health so he called a psychiatrist to fit me into an appointment on monday morning. in the mean time he prescribed me antivan to calm me down. i took the first pill thursday around 2 it was .5 mg. I didnt experience any change in my anxiety and mabye a less slightly aggitated but not enought to calm me down. i decided to up the dose to 1 mg too see if it would be any different i took that at 7 pm thursday evening after 2 hours of waiting for anything i didnt experience any change either. i became very upset and panicky becuase i thought something was seriously mentally wrong with me for this not to work. I had to resort to smoking marijuana just to calm my nerves and its my only option right now or going to the emergency room. im trying to hold on to seeing the psychiatrist on monday but im afraid it may effect my work this weekend i work at a resaurant and it really busy on the weekends. Any thoughts on what i am going throught would be greatly appriciated.","Doctor":"Hello Ryan . There seems many reasons for your anxiety. First it may be you quit your cannabis only recently and you may be having some withdrawal of that and you are getting anxiety symptoms because of that. Secondly your doctor should have told you that SSRI have a anxiety provoking effect initially . Only after sometime they have anti anxiety effect. Also medication show side effects earlier than the effect. That is why you have increased anxiety before relief. To relief such symptoms your doctor have prescribed you bezodiazepine , but don't take it more than prescribed as you already have  addiction issues and you are prone to develop addiction to it. As far as continuing the medication is concerned, you can do under the cover of benzodiazepine ,which will help you to cope the anxiety and will help you pass the duration of time left to meet psychiatrist. Meet your psychiatrist ASAP as he can give additional medication which reduce the severity of anxiety Take care"},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with light insanity schizophrenia and sadism but with self control i never harmed anyone Last week someone ran into me and i hit my head really hard and now its all gone the voices the urges to kill all of it i know it should like a good thing but i cannot handle it its like im someone else and its scary i dont know what to do.","Doctor":"Hi.

You have described as experiencing extremes of mood- elation on one hand and depression on the other.These are two poles of mood extremities  and when they keep swinging back and forth or occur together(what we call a mixed state) causing a disruption in normal functioning it is an indication of Bipolar Mood Disorder.Suicidal urges commonly accompany the depressive phase as is evident in your case. Bipolar Disorder is usually treated with a combination of medications of which a Mood Stabilizer plays an important role in controlling the symptoms as well as in preventing further episodes. Hence it is imperative that you consult your doctor at the earliest and be started on the appropriate medications.It is also essential that you continue maintenance medications even after your symptoms remit in order to prevent recurrences.You will also be educated on measures such as ensuring good sleep as disruption of biological rhythms might also trigger an episode.

Plz suggest any medicine or exercise or should I consult some Doctor","Doctor":"hi, you seem too upset......this answer is going to be a long one,be patient,relax and read it(but i chose it to help you out) one thing i can get from you is you are depressed ,depressed so much that you are harming yourself depression occurs due to many reasons,psychological factors.........physical factors relating to your health example:if you are too anaemic you feel like crying ,shouting,getting angry easily etc you told this started from your marriage ,this changes a lot in a girl's life after marriage you told you are a mother,so a new one in the family!!!!things change too thing is you are a bit too sensitive,to cope with the new changes  in life good or bad nothing wrong,dont worry it happens to everyone..even  your mother would have faced it when she was at your age but reason that the others are normal and you turned out like this is.....your way of handling and managing issues the hormonal changes during your pregnancy and post pregnancy may be a partial culprit in your case losing temper is an easy thing ...but it costs you a lot,you couldnt get back what you lose sometimes you may need a good personal counselling,your family doctor is sufficient but working in a firm explains me you are educated,show the differrence  of knowledge you have... do you really need an otherr person to help you lead a normal life which a uneducated one is doing very easily realise you are strong,when eveybody loves you what is the use to think all nonsense and waste time and energy of you and your family lucky ,you got a husband who listens to all what you say and stays calm hoping you become normal,you are like an other kid for him remember \\"words have life,so think before you speak\\". \\"works once done cannot be taken back\\" more so when you are angry try to balance your emotions its in your skill of leading good life together with your husband lies the future of your kid ok its too much of speech coming to the  remedy you dont need a medicine to lead your normal life, 1.relax yourself 2.enjoy life 3.meditation helps a lot believe me 4.just before you act in temper remember my words count numbers,repeat a gods name (an old trick seems to be silly but really really works) 5.listen to music 6.join in a gym ,sternous exercise brings all the bad stuff out of your mind and body 7.go dance till your legs ache 8.go shopping 9.spend time with your school, and college friends but all these works out when you are seriously willing to overcome your

[ WWW.WWWW.WW ] _score is 39-","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for using the HCM. I am happy to address your questions,  bipolar disorder (also known as manic depression) causes serious shifts in mood, energy, thinking, and behaviour from the highs of mania on one extreme, to the lows of depression on the other. More than just a fleeting good or bad mood, the cycles of bipolar disorder last for days, weeks, or months. And unlike ordinary mood swings, the mood changes of bipolar disorder are so intense that they interfere with your ability to function. During a manic episode, a person might impulsively quit a job, charge up huge amounts on credit cards, or feel rested after sleeping two hours. During a depressive episode, the same person might be too tired to get out of bed and full of self-loathing and hopelessness over being unemployed and in debt. The causes of bipolar disorder aren’t completely understood, but it often runs in families. The first manic or depressive episode of bipolar disorder usually occurs in the teenage years or early adulthood. The symptoms can be subtle and confusing, so many people with bipolar disorder are overlooked or misdiagnosed resulting in unnecessary suffering. But with proper treatment and support, you can lead a rich and fulfilling life. Many factors are involved in diagnosing bipolar disorder. Your clinician may need to ask about your family history, your recent mood swings and for how long you've had them, perform a thorough examination to look for illnesses that may be causing the symptoms, run laboratory tests to check for thyroid problems or drug levels, talk to your family members about your behaviour, take a medical history, including any medical problems you have and any medications you taken, watch your behavior and mood. Hope I have answered your query. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help.

If they still persist, then you should be evaluated by endoscopy with blood and urine examinations. Only after finding out the cause,You can take ondonsetron for vomiting and pain killers.

It happened over the summer in the midst of a research scholarship during which i was spending alot of time alone. I have a work co- op for 6 weeks straight after the scholarship and it got really bad (sleeping very poorly, crying alot, awkward in communication and an increase in anxiety ) which would have been atypical for me. I stabilised in the next few weeks..but since then i feel i fall into bouts of really bad form...but it s really odd as the bouts could last minutes sometimes, sometimes hours and then leave and i completely forget that I feel that way..it could be 5mins of really low form and then boom i m fine..or vice versa i could be with my friends having a great time and then BANG this wave of bad form falls upon me and I just cover it up and say I m grand. Recently, I am in good form and my normal self but I feel a loss of interest in some hobbies and things in general. I was playing high level sport up until a month ago and now I don t want to play anymore..i felt myself overthink the whole thing ad get anxious and paranoid..but strangely I m in good form so I don t know. It s just I m worried when I fall into these bouts...they are short lasting usually but I want to know the reason behind them.

That was my first experience that scared me, and after that they got worse, they have stopped for a while Intel we tore down our kitchen, and built a new room which i stayed it. After that i would wake up half concision, and i would look at my walls, my dresser and everything would be extremely small, and i would stand up crying feeling like i was getting bigger, like something was sucking me, and i would hear this voice, telling me to collect these things and if i didn t it would kill me. I remember running and screaming down the hall to my parents and saying its going to kill me, and running to the door unlocking it and running out into the street, other times my dad would beat me to the door and keep it locked i would cry trying to open the door begging him to let me out, just begging him, Finally my dad took me to my mom in their room and sat me down and folding my hands and told me to pray to god i sat their crying repeating what my mom said and i would just fall asleep after. I would wake up the next day and barley remover a thing, that has happened several different times at my old house, all in the middle of the night. We moved to Wyoming in a trailer park, and it happened their again.. waking up to the same feeling and the voice, I was again half asleep and the only thing i remember is riding my bike, and dropping it in the middle of the street and running home to my mom to pray, ever since then i had a bible in my room laying open to the middle page and i was fine every night. I moved back into my old house in montana and i was just fine the panic attacks stopped for a few months and i talked to my parents about this, when i was around 11-16 and my dad said it was all in my head im crazy and willing my self to do this, He still thinks this today. Recently we moved about 3-4 years ago and i have been just fine, tell I woke up in the middle of the night, i was freaking out and all i remember is picking a piece of carpet off this cat stand and holding it up to my dad, telling him its going to kill me, its going to kill me! After that i don t remember a thing. It had been 2 years since iv had a panic attack tell then. That happened when i was 13.

And i have heard voices telling me im worthless and no one wants me..But that last panic attack i had i remember waking up around 11:30 my hand hanging off the bed, i remember looking at my hand and everything around it got small i stood up wrapped my blanket around myself and stood in the hallway calling my moms name crying, Saying i don t fell well i feel like im ugh what i said i cant explain how i felt, My mom told me to sit down and watch tv, calm down..

Regards Dr. Dinesh"},{"Patient":"? Please type your query here.. RESPECTED SIR, I want to ask that both Somatoform and somatization disorders are cause due to factors like stress and anxiety so what is the difference between both of them..because we are saying that in Somatoform physical illness leads to anxiety but the cause of this physical illness is the stress itself so how can we differentiate between both of them.","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcaremagic. Thanks for your question... Somatoform disorders are a group of disorders characterized by predominantly physical symptoms which cannot be explained fully by a medical condition and which are not due to the direct effect of a substance or due to any other mental disorder. There are many subtypes of somatoform disorders and \\"Somatization Disroder\\" is one such subtype of somatoform disorder. In somatization disorder, the person has MULTIPLE unexplained physical symptoms, usually involving different systems of the body. All somatoform disorders, including somatization disorder, are thought to have a psychological basis and are closely associated with stress/ anxiety. It is also important to note that since the mind and the body are interconnected and function in unison, the relation between stress / anxiety / psychological problems and somatic / physical symtoms is often reciprocal... i.e. each one can influence the other. So, when the mind is not at peace and under stress, it can affect the body as well and manifest as physical symptoms. I hope I have clarified your doubt.

It seems like you have some kind of obsessive illness. Obsessive disorder is a mental condition where a person has repeated recurring thoughts. The thoughts may be limited to a particular episode (like in your case) or with many other similar thoughts. This condition can be treated with the help of medications and behavioural therapy. At the age of 13, I do not think you will be allowed to directly consult a doctor. Hence I recommend you talk to your parents or a guardian about your thoughts. Consulting a psychiatrist for therapy and medication will resolve your symptoms. Hope this helps.

My mental health isn t good and I am feeling completely depressed and very irritable, I m also being anti social. I am visiting family right now. For 9 years my father has been remarried and has another child, and has raised 4 other step children. I ve had to watch my mother struggle to raise me on her own with no financial support from him, and he s had little part of my life apart from random visits, I ve suffered childhood anxiety that carried on into adulthood because of my absent father. Now at 20 I still feel obliged to travel 2 hours by plane + 2 hours by car to get here to see them and act like family and keep a connection, I don t want to have this responsibility. I am struggling to maintain my composure this time around as I have gone through illness and injury last year, and had a very hard year overall and am just starting to get back into a good frame of mind to continue my studies in 2 weeks time. I am feeling extremely trapped in this environment, witnessing my step siblings hugging my father and watching him behave fatherly towards them, fathering his 4 year old daughter, and dealing with his wife who is a demanding and silently judgemental woman is hard on its own. She has been the brick wall between myself and my father, and continues to disallow any quality time for us. I want to go home, but will need to be here for another week, taking time from my own life and giving it to people who are undeserving and will put me back in the back seat once I leave, and I ll hardly enter their thoughts. After a very hard year, I don t have enough of myself to give to these people, and I just don t feel like I can continue to act friendly and polite to them with so much pain and hurtful history in the back of my mind, It just feels very unfair, and I m feeling very hurt. I can t afford to be slipping back into a depression because I need to be mentally strong to handle a full time work load. Is it wrong of me to be keeping so distanced in how I interact while I am here? And how should I go about keeping my mental health good and not becoming more and more depressed? Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Hi, No, your feelings are not wrong. You need to be happy and mentally sound. You have a bright future ahead of you for which you need to be focused and you also need to work for it. This should be your goal in life. You need not try to act good with people who don't seem to bother or worry for you and your mother. Politeness is good but not at the cost of our own happiness. Try to develop good friends and lead a happy and productive life. Evade all depressing times with your father and his family. It is time to realize that you do not really need them. No father is better than a bad father. there are many people in this world who grow up as confident and good citizens without any love or care from father. Yes, it will be better if one has a good father. But it need not be bad if one does not have such father. Believe in yourself. Take care and live your live with happiness for you and your mother. Above all, stop expecting anything like financial help or love from your father. It will only lead to depression. Detach your mind from them and start afresh. Best wishes!"},{"Patient":"My wife is feeling a pain on lafeside of back on kedney.

Thanks for visiting healthcaremagic.com.  I am glad that you have had all of the test above because that helped to rule out a lot of diseases.  I believe that you are suffering from panic/anxiety attacks. Panic attacks are defined as a period of intense fear or discomfort in which 4 or more of these symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes (usually). 1. Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate * 2. Sweating * 3. Trembling or shaking 4. Sensation of shortness of breath or smothering * 5. Feeling of choking 6. Chest pain or discomfort 7. Nausea or abdominal issues 8. Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded or faint 9.  Feeling detached from one's self 10.  Fear of losing control or going crazy * 11. Fear of dying * 12. Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations) * 13. Chills or Hot flashes I put stars by the symptoms that you mentioned above and put stars by the fear related points because you do not clarify what you are having fear of.  You have at least 4 out of these symptoms above. This is a medical condition and is well recognized in the mental/behavioral health community.  This condition can be treated with antidepressant medications and/or anti-anxiety medications.

Also i have had depression in the past which i delt with myself but now realise i havnt sorted any of it out.","Doctor":"Hi  russellp39. Thanks for your question. Fortunately i am a psychiatrist and a deaddiction specialist, Codeine is a opium group of drug having high addiction potential. You should know why a person addict to some drugs because when they leave it there are withdrawal symptoms  to neutrilise those symptoms that person again go to take the drug. Its good that you want to leave the habit.So for that better thing to admit in any deaddiction center. As you know when you leave the habit all on a sudden you have withdrawal symptoms like-insomia,lacrimation,diarrhea,piloerrection,dysphoric mood, mydriasis,yawning,autonomic hyperactivity and that can be manage by giving antidote or clonidine and after overcome of withdrawal symptoms you have to take one opiod agonist for replacement for prevention of relapse.there are so many drugs for that.I can not name those in this forum. Side by side psycho education and counselling should go that is called relapse prevention counselling or RPC that help you to avoid situation which provoke you to take drugs and also to control yourself during craving. Psycho education of the family member also should be done that how they behave with you. For the whole thing you need to be admitted for 4-6 weeks and you become free of codeine and will be able to lead normal life. By the way your personality changes are due to drugs and depression is also due to codeine .It is called substance induce mood disorder.When you will leave the habit you mood and personality become gradually normal.

About your suicidality i can tell no antidepressant produces suicidality it may be due to your disease process which can not control properly by drugs due to inadequate doses,wrong selection of drugs or may be you stop the drug yourself. The main problem i dont know which drugs you are taking.Dont be frustrated because there are drugs which has very low this kind of side effect.So please visit your psychiatrist,tell him your problem and also ask for any non pharmacological treatment means cognitive behavior therapy he can be thought for you. But please don't stop the drug.It will increase your problem so much.

Diet and weight loss are important when one is overweight, but one has to be careful not to go overboard when it comes to caloric restriction. Consulting a good dietician/nutritionist would be a very valuable exercise in your case, because this clinician can help you develop an excellent diet and exercise regimen that will help you achieve your goals safely and expeditiously. Doing it your way may get quicker results, but it may also take a negative toll on your body for obvious reasons. Best of luck with your situation. Feel better!

Thank You.","Doctor":"The treatment for OCD begins with a consultation with a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist will likely recommend medication and psychotherapy to help you. Medication that has proven efficacy includes SSRIs and tricyclics. Look these up online to learn more about them. Typically these meds are initiated at low doses and gradually increased until the patient reports some symptom improvement. Sometimes high doses of these medications are required in order to see a significant response. If one medication is not enough to relieve your symptoms, the psychiatrist may decide to add a second medication to the regimen in an attempt to capture more of your symptoms. Cognitive behavioral psychotherapy may also help you with some symptom relief. Don't give up hope; there is help for you out there.

The doctor put him on Lithium twice a week on a heavy dose for the last 3 weeks coz his levels are way out. He is very cooperative with the doctor and I told him I will stand by his side. However, since he is on medication , he lost his feeling for me and said he can t feel that he loves me anymore but he knows he still cares for me and miss me too but just no loving feeling. He said he wasn t even sure if the love he had for me was due to his sickness. Could you please advice if this is due to medication or the nature of his sickness, would his feeling of love for me ever come back? Also, he was honest to me that he started to look at other girls and wanting to speak and hook up with them not for sex but just the feeling of conquering them. He felt guilty after having that thought but both of us are really worried if he would slip one day into a mistake that could destroy our relationship. Could this be controlled by medication or treatment? What can I do to help him? He is going to see a psychologist next week to start his treatment. Thank you very much","Doctor":"Complicated question. I'll try to tackle it for you in several ways. Firstly, Bipolar Disorder usually means the person has manic episodes. These episodes involve having too much energy, staying up many nights with little sleep due to too much energy, racing thoughts, rapid speech, distractibility, increase in goal-directed or dangerous behaviors, grandiosity, and sometimes delusions and/or hallucinations if the episode is severe. Lithium calms these manic episodes and also prevents depression and suicidality. Many patients complain that Lithium helps stabilize their mood but as a side effect it can dampen enjoyment, pleasure and motivation to accomplish things. This is a possibility for your boyfriend. If he claims he stopped caring for you soon after he started taking lithium, it could well be that this medication has dampened some of his feelings of love and romance for you. A switch to a different mood stabilizer like Lamotrigine or Valproic Acid or Carbamazepine may help recover this \\"emotion.\\" wanting to look at other girls could be a symptom of poorly controlled mania: he could have too much sexual energy.

But, I have always had low self esteem ever since I was young and I notice as time goes by, these feelings always come back-the result is me feeling like I dont deserve my job,relationship,good friends(I dont have many as there is, that is another story)..its like I cant trust anyone anymore and I gave up on trying to be happy.

I firmly believe that he may be suffering from a form of bipolar but when i try and approach him about his behaviour he gets angry and thinks that it is all in my head and there is nothing wrong with him. His mood swings are becoming more frequent and it is starting to affect our 8 year old daughter, he needs help but i can t get through to him as he thinks there is nothing wrong with him. What can i do?","Doctor":"Your situation is very difficult and I am deeply disturbed and sorry to hear about your suffering. It 's all the more painful because you are not the one with the problem, it's your husband. My first piece of advice to you is to protect yourself and your child from this man's outbursts. If you can, you should take your child and leave the house each time these outbursts occur. Notifying family members (and perhaps friends) of the situation will help to protect and support you to some extent. Your husband may indeed have bipolar disorder as you suspect, but more importantly he has a horrible lack of insight into his problem thereby making it impossible for him to understand his need for treatment. Because of this, his prognosis for improvement is very poor indeed. You cannot force him into treatment if he refuses it; however, a nicely written lawyer's letter on your behalf may help you. You may have to leave this man if he does not seek treatment for this intense problem. Best wishes and I hope things improve for you!"},{"Patient":"dear doc i am suffring from anxiety from the last 5 years and panic disorder from the last one year and fear of death like symptom,also pain and itiching like sensation in my lower gums as i lower the dose of medicine sometime,i am prescribed with oxetol 300mg, paxidep 12.5 mg.clonotrilo.25 mg my age is 29 and my wt is 82 .spell of crying episode as well as feelinng of suicide will conqure my mind my basic problem is broken love affair 3 times feeling of used and disrespect.how can i get rid of these medicine and of course this depression as i stop taking therse medicine afeeling of fear always haunt me that something will happen to me if i stop taking these medicines .. pls help me doc at any cost i am from aligarh(up)","Doctor":"Hi, Well i agree that you have faced some painful incidents in the past, but life never stops, it keeps on moving, so you shall also move on. As far as feeling of disrespect and used is concerned, there is nothing like that. Problem is that we take everything from our near and dear ones in high intensity, the reason probably is expectations. We expect a lot from people on whom we rely, so if that expected things does not happens it leads to disappointment. My advise to you is: 1. Make yourself busy in anything you like. 2. Join some course or take up some job and if that is also not possible then join some organisation where you can contribute with your efforts. 3. Report to your doctor about anything related to medicines. 4. You can try alternative medicine like Homoeopathy also to help in coming out of this phase. 5. Try to be happy and make others happy. 6. Join some Sport activity or start some exercise like jogging, running, swimming etc. because exercise is the best way to combat bad effects of stress.

Let me know you that the ocd medicine is taking since 6 month.3 to 4 month after taking that medicine i am faceing sexual problem. decrease in penis erection . now before one week my penis is totally not erected. what to do pls suggest","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your question... You have mentioned that you are on two psychiatric medication - Paxidep CR (Paroxetine) and Lonazep MD (Clonazepam). Paxidep CR is an anti-depressant / anti-obsessive medication belonging to a class called SSRIs and Lonazep is an anti-anxiety / sedative medication. Now, all SSRIs (including Paxidep) have a potential side effect of causing sexual problems, like erectile dysfunction, inhibited orgasm and decreased sexual drive (libido). These are relatively common but the extent and severity of these sexual side effects vary from person-to-person. Usually, they are temporary, and as the body gets used to the medication, the side effects also gradually come down. However, some persons can have persistent or severe symptoms. Your sexual problem seems to be significant and causing you distress. Here are a few options which can be considered and discussed with your doctor: - Using certain medication temporarily which will improve your erection (like Sildenafi, Tadalafil) and wait to see if the sexual side effects gradually subside with time. - Considering a change in medication - but this has to be done only on consultation with your doctor. The other thing to be aware is that since you have diabetes, there may be a likelihood that if there are any vascular complications related to diabetes, then that may be worsening your erectile dysfunction. So, it may be advisable to have an evaluation done for that also. Please do not hesitate to discuss this problem with your psychiatrist. It is a common problem faced by many persons who are on psychiatric medication and your doctor would be able to advise you further about the appropriate management option. All the best. - Dr. Jonas Sundarakumar Consultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"I do have anxiety and depression , but I ve been fine lately, and I have missed one period last month, but I have it now..

If not then symptoms you described may be due anxiety or tension headache if you have heaviness of head or headache. If it is so find out the source such as work related stress, over burden of any kind etc. and manage accordingly such as time management, resource management etc. Also try relaxation technique, deep breathing exercise etc. If you have a diagnosis you require active treatment from qualified psychiatrist in form of medication with or without psychotherapy.

Next time when you go to your physician get yourself evaluated for Anxiety neurosis and ensure you get a treament for that.

However, you need to clarify how long such symptoms last... i.e. do they last for days or weeks together and come as episodes or whether you feel this way only for very brief time periods and only as a response to stressful / upsetting situations.If you have been experiencing symptoms for many days or weeks together and coming as episodes, then it is more likely that you are having a depressive disorder, for which you need to seek help from a psychiatrist and if your symptoms are quite disabling, then you may need to take medication. If on the other hand, your symptoms are a reaction to stressful situations and they do not last long, then you may need help regarding stress management. There are various forms of psychological / talking therapies which can help you deal with your stress, help you handle it in a healthier manner and also help you acquire better coping strategies and skills.I feel that since you feel that the symptoms are disabling and causing you distress, you should not hesitate to seek professional help.Wish you all the best.-Dr. Jonas Sundarakumar Consultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"I am 18 years, my height is 6 ft 2 inch, I have had no medical problems in the past.

I understand your concern about the strange things that seem to be happening at home. I know how distressing and difficult it can be if you are feeling constantly concerned and afraid about this. Lynda, firstly I want you to understand that as doctors, we are here to help you get out of your distress and I am here to do precisely that by giving you the most appropriate advice. Now, having that in mind, I also want you to understand that sometimes, when we are suffering from a psychological disorder, we may tend to have excessive fears, beliefs or concerns which may actually be a result of the psychological disorder itself. You have mentioned have been suffering form depression and are on treatment currently. Based on my experience of having seen many patients presenting with similar problems like yours, I feel that these are part of the psychological disorder only. I know and understand very well that to you these things may appear absolutely real and it may be difficult to accept the fact that these may not be entirely real. But, sometimes, the psychological disorder can influence our minds and cloud our thinking so much that we may end up believing things which may not be entirely real. This can then result in excessive and irrational fears. Now, again, I want you to be very clear that I am in no way trying to say that the distress and suffering that you are going through is unimportant... I fully agree with you that it is very upsetting and difficult. But, it is also important to be aware and open to the fact that your beliefs / fears may be as a result of the psychological problem you are going through... I would strongly suggest to get a review appointment with your psychiatrist. I'm sure he would be able to assess you more in detail and adjust your medication accordingly to control these fears.

Is it hepatitis C that you are worried about or is it something else? Usually seroconversion takes place by 6-8 weeks after exposure and you would test positive for the infection after that so as the episode occured an year ago and you have tested negetive on two occasions it is unlikely for you to have got infected during that episode.

We have been suggested by a relative to take him to a mental/psychiatric hospital for proper treatment. Please advise. Regards PB","Doctor":"Hi Pankaj, Welcome to Healthcare Magic and thanks for your question... Firstly, the symptoms which your father is having definitely requires immediate attention. The reason is not only could he get himself into trouble, but he also poses a serious threat to others around him. Secondly, such recent changes in behaviour or personality can often be a consequence of a brain pathology, and thus needs prompt evaluation. Disorders involving the 'frontal lobe' of the brain, like frontal lobe dementia, vascular problems, etc. are typically known to cause such kind of disinhibited behaviour. So, I would strongly advice you to take him to a psychiatrist, who would be able to assess him further and initiate appropriate management. There are medication which can supress such disinhibited and abnormal behaviour, but he needs a thorough and proper evaluation before that. Therefore, please do not delay further and take him to a psychiatrist ASAP. All the best. - Dr. Jonas Sundarakumar Consultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"Hello...  I need your help...

Firstly, it is a good thing that you are able to have an insight about your problems and your current emotional state. I would appreciate you for gathering the initiative to seek help despite feeling low and dejected.From the description that you have given me, you seem to be going through a depression. The depression also seems to be causing you significant social and occupational disturbances. Hence it is quite important that you seek professional help at the earliest. I would suggest that you have a consultation with a psychiatrist who would be able to assess you in detail and advice you the appropriate management plan. There are various treatment options available - medication, psychological / talking therapies, etc. Personally, I feel that since you seem to be having significant interpersonal difficulties also, you may benefit from psychological therapy, in addition to medication. It is also important to keep talking to and sharing your feelings with someone close to you, so that, in times when you are unable to think clearly or lack motivation or initiative, they will be able to guide you.Wish you all the best.- Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"hello sir/madam, I am a 16 year old student from india. i have an problem. i have lost my concentartion during past month and due to this i also cannot concentrate on my studies and other activities such as playing, listning , watching movies etc. please just tell me the rootcause of the problem.. this problem occured with me suddenly i shall be very thankfull to you.","Doctor":"Hi Deepak, Welcome to Heathcare Magic and thanks for your question... From your brief description, I understand that you have been suddenly having diffifulty in concentration and feeling disinterested in your normally enjoyable activities. Since you have mentioned that it has been sudden, it is important to know if there have been any recent changes in your personal circumstances or social environment or if you are in the midst of a stressful situation. Excessive stress and difficulty in coping is a common reason to feel disinterested and detached from studies and other pleasurable things. There is also a possibility that you may be going through a depression, in case you have other symptoms like negative thoughts, feeling low, reduced energy, poor sleep / appetite, etc. My advice to you would be to talk to and share your feelings with someone close to you, especially if there is something bothering you. In such situations, it is also important to try not to isolate yourself or spend a lot of time in solitude, as it can worsen your symptoms. If you find that your symptoms are severe or worsening or affecting your day-to-day functioning, then you need to seek professional help, probably from a psychiatrist.

Appropriate counselling and observation should be enough to help her further and keep a watch for relapse of symptoms.

Clobazam is also an anti-epileptic medication which is usually used as an adjunct to other medication in case of resistant seizures, especially of the complex partial type. It is sometimes used as an anti-anxiety medication also. Nexito (Escitalopram) is an anti-depressant medication.Now, your difficulty in concentration could be due to different reasons. Recurrent seizures, epsecially if you are skipping medicines often, can be one reason. The anti-epileptic medication, especially as you are on a combination, can sometimes have side effects like concentration and memory difficulties, drowsiness, etc. It is also likely that you may be having some depressive symptoms, which may be the reason you doctor has put you on an anti-depressant. Depression and stress can also be a cause for your difficulty in concentration.What I would suggest is that you should be absolutely regular on your medication and never skip a dose. Also, discuss with your doctor about your problem, to see if any dose adjustments are required - may be, shifting a majority of your doses to the night. If you are feeling very stressed out or depressed, then it would help to talk to someone, may be a psychiatrist, and to learn relaxation / stress management techniques.

Thanks for your question...Sudden bouts of anxiety which come in episodes is most likely to be panic attacks, and you may be suffering from a Panic Disorder. During these panic attacks one can feel shaky, dizzy, have a rapid heart beat, sweating, chocking, feel that there is something bad going to happen to them or even feel like they are going to die. Since these attacks typically come 'out-of-the-blue', you may not be able to predict an attack and hence may not feel anxious just prior to an attack.Usually, the period between these attacks is relatively symptom-free. However, sometimes, people can experience some amount of anxiety after or inbetween these attacks, which is predominantly due to a fear of getting another attack. This is called 'anticipatory anxiety'. This may be the reason why you experience anxiety after such attacks.Regarding your question about the relation to PCOS, more than half the women who have PCOS have obesity.

He sometimes becomes very violent with other family members , even parents. Sometimes he insists for things which are quite impossible for that he shouts and creates nuisance up to such a level that there is no way left except beating him. Kindly suggest how to deal with child.Give the answer for free","Doctor":"Hello Mr. Srivastava, Thanks for writing in. Violent behaviour in children is a complex issue and it is possible, that apart from just growing up, your child has certain issues that need to be addressed. In some children, violence is an expression of their anxiety while for some it is a way of getting things done. Do not judge your child without trying to understand what is causing his symptoms. Lend a patient ear and try and reason things out with him. Also, adolescents typically get angry when you treat them like children. So treat him like an adult and have a reasonable conversation with him. Talk to him about his issues in a non threatening way. Beating up the child will not serve any purpose and will only create more tension between you and your son. If you are unable to speak with him, please see a psychiatrist so that this issue can be dealt with. Its important to get it treated right now as violent children can become violent adults as well. A lot of parents still need to learn that their dreams may not be their children's dreams and that their children have a life and a wish of their own. If you support him and hold him responsible for his action, it would be a better strategy. Remember to praise him whenever he does something good. Also, keep him away from violent serials, videos and movies. Hope this helps. Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi, my uncle has started having hallucinations (seeing people) and he can be persistent in that they are there. Now I noticed this when he started taken flucoxycilian which he takes when ever he has infection. Could this be the cause? Currently being prescribed a anxiolytic to help him with his hallucinations Also he is on concuction of other medications for diabetes , angina, Parkinson s, pain killers, constipations relief. Thank you","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your question... From your description, I infer that your uncle is having transient visual hallucinations. Now, Flucloxacillin is not known to cause any hallucinations or psychiatric symptoms. However anti-parkinsonian medication are well known to cause psychotic symptoms including hallucinations. The other aspect to consider is that since he is on a cocktail of medicaton, interactions between medication can occur and this can sometimes lead to erratic levels of a particular drug, thus increasing the risk for side effects. Moreover, in elderly persons, who have multiple medical complications and who are on multiple medication, delirium should also be considered as a differential diagnosis. (symptoms of delirium include confusion, disorientation, disturbance in the sleep-wake cycle and hallucinations) As regards the treatment, anxiolytics are not the specific treatment of choice for hallucinations. He may need to be started on anti-psychotics, but again, this has to be on a low dose and given with caution, because anti-psychotics have a risk of worsening his Parkinson's symptoms. I would suggest that you take him for a consultation with a Psychiatrist, who would be able to make a detailed assessment and advice appropriate treatment.

I am now taking paxil and have been for two days and am meeting with a therapist on monday. Im wondering if you have any suggestions or advice?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your question...Many substances of abuse, like alcohol, marijuana coccaine, etc. are associated with different psychiatric problems. You have not mentioned if you are still continuing to take marijuana or if you have started again recently after quitting. If so, then it is likely that your current psychiatric problems are related to it. If, on the other hand, you have developed the current depressive symptoms while you have been clean since the last episode, then you may be having a recurrent depressive disorder. It is also important to understand if your personal and social circumstances are causing you stress, since stress can be a precipitating or perpetuating factor for depression.It is a good thing that you are aware of your problems and are seeking appropriate help for the same. I hope that you have been started on Paxil only on advise of a doctor. It is now important that you continue medication regularly and have periodic reviews to monitor your progress. Also, as anti-depressant medication usually take a few weeks to bring about their full effect, you have to be patient and continue them regularly without stopping them pre-maturely. Since you seem to be having recurrent symptoms, your doctor may advise to continue medication for a longer duration this time.Psychological therapy can definitely improve the outcome in depressive disorders and often, a combination of medication and therapy yields best results. So, do go for regular therapy sessions as advised and stay completely off marijuana or any other substance of abuse.All the best.- Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"I have a weird sleeping pattern.

Thanks for your question...The symptoms which you have described, i.e. feeling low, inability to experience pleasure, negative thoughts, social withdrawal, irritability, crying spells, poor sleep, etc. are indicative of depression. You have to clarify how long you have been experiencing these symptoms and whether you are going through any major stress. Whatever may be the cause, it is important that you get help because you seem to be going through significant distress and suffering. But often, when we feel so low and disinterested, we don't feel like seeking help and everything simply seems pointless. So, it is important be cautious of this and not refrain from getting help. One good way out is to keep talking and sharing your feelings with someone close, so that they would be able to motivate and guide you when you don't feel the initiative.Help is available in different ways...

I decided to try taking 5-HTP supplements with it in the morning to see if it would help me out more. The next day I did not take it but I noticed a strange rash that looks almost like poison ivy, but, I have had to contact with poison ivy. They are raised bumps that itch sometimes, but, not THAT bad. They started on my right arm and I noticed them today on my left thumb . What could this be and what should I do?","Doctor":"Hi Nikole, Welcome to Healthcare Magic and thanks for your question... Firstly, I hope that you are taking the mentioned psychiatric medication only on advice of a psychiatrist. I'm also not sure whether the psychiatric diagnoses which you have mentioned are self-made or made after a proper assessment by a psychiatrist. The reason is because there seems to be a discrepancy between you diagnosis and the type of medication you are on. You have mentioned that you have a bipolar disorder, but you are not on a mood stabilizer. Also, you have mentioned that you have OCD, but again you don't seem to be on the appropriate medication. Risperidal is an anti-psychotic medication and Wellbutrin is an anti-depressant medication. So, please clarify and discuss about your medication with a psychiatrist. 5-HTP supplements are non-prescription, off-label medication which may be useful in depression and anxiety, but there is no clear and scientifically proven data or evidence for it. Moreover, they are NOT advised for people who are already taking anti-depressant or other psychiatric medication because that can result in side effects (sometimes a dangerous adverse effect called \\"serotonin syndrome\\") If your rash has developed following the starting of these supplements, then there is a strong likelihood that it may be related. Itching and rashes can sometimes be part of a serotonin syndrome also. My advise would be to STOP the 5-HT supplements and consult your doctor for further evaluation and advice. All the best. - Dr. Jonas Sundarakumar Consultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"I need help. I am so tired all the time. I have energy. Things I used to love just don t interest me anymore. NOTHING makes me happy. The only emotions I can feel are angry or overwhelming sadness. I know it sounds like depression , but I am on antidepressents. They upped my dosage to the max, changed it, but no other seems to work. 200mg of Zoloft USED to work, but now if it IS working, it s what s keeping me alive. I want to be happy. Please, can you help me be happy again?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your question...Though many people respond well to anti-depressant medication, there will be a proportion of people who will respond only partially or will have a poor response to the initial treatment. Zoloft (Sertraine) belongs to a class of anti-depressants called SSRIs and SSRIs are in fact, the first-line medication recommended for depression. A dosage of 200mg is definitely an adequate dosage of Sertraline.Now, you have mentioned that your anti-depressant has already been changed (and I hope that you have recieved an adequate dosage and duration of your previous antidepressant as well). Considering this, I think you must be suffering from what is called \\"Treatment-Resistant Depression\\". Now, don't get alarmed by that word as it does not imply that there is no treatment option available. It just means that this particular proportion of people need a special way of approach and management.The managenent approach first involves investigating for any causes for treatment resistance... e.g. certain medical causes, like thyroid problems, certain vitamin deficiencies, etc. Further treatment options include giving a combination of anti-depressants, augmenting your antidepressant with other psychiatric medication like an anti-psychotic or a mood-stabilizer, thyroxine supplementation, etc. Combining intensive psychological therapies (such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy - CBT) with medication often gives good results. Ongoing stress can definitely be a perpetuating factor for depression and make things worse. Hence, addressing this and enhancing your coping skills is an important part of treatment. Sometimes, if medication and psychotherapy fail, Electro-convulsive Therapy (ECT) can also be used as an option.So, don't get dejected or give up hope. There are plenty of options available to tackle your 'resistant' depression. Just manage to stay afloat till your doctor is able to find a suitable form of treatment. This can take some time because each option must be systematically tried before writing it off and often anti-depressant medication can take a few weeks to bring about their full potential. So keep having periodic reviews with your doctor, keep talking to someone close to you regularly and try to keep yourself engaged in some sort of activity. (Activity sheduling i.e. planning and carrying out regular and timed activities and assignments may be a useful technique to tackle your amotivation and lack of initiative)All the best.- Dr.Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"i cannot put intrest in studies and i dont have sleep and also i dont have intrest to go to college because i cont understand class,and my mind is full of absence.this type of things happend from three months from joining in new college aftre diploma into btech.before this i am a well student regarding my studies and all other activities. 15 days ago i have suffered from maleriya and taking treatment also.","Doctor":"Hello Your problem seems to associated with difficulty to adjust to new environment.

My question is, can your sinus cause a chemical imbalance in the brain? And, I also would like to know if I do not take these medicines except on an as needed basis, is this jeopardy of causes my situation to worsen in time?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your question...Depressive disorders are caused due to certain neuro-chemical imbalances in the brain (notably, decreased levels of the neuro-chemicals - Serotonin and Nor-epinephrine) But, there is no relation between a 'sinus' problem and such neuro-chemical imbalances.Zoloft (Sertraline) is an anti-depressant medication and Xanax (Alprazolam) is an anti-anxiety medication. Anxiety symptoms often co-exist with depression and share a similar neuro-chemical basis.I hope that you have been started on these medication after a detailed evaluation by a psychiatrist. Now, please remember that anti-depressant medication have to be taken REGULARLY for an adequate duration of time (usually, for at least of 4 - 6 months). They are NOT meant to be taken on a \\"as needed\\" basis. The reasons are:1) anti-depressants take some time (at least 2 to 3 weeks) to reach adequate and steady levels in the body and bring about their effects, and hence a regular dosage is essential.2) if they are not taken for an adequate duration or stopped prematurely, then there is high risk of relapse / recurrence of your depressive symptoms. (Even when you have completed an adequate duration of treatment, the dosage has to be gradually reduced and then stopped, rather than stopping it abruptly)3) if you take medication irregularly, then your depression will not resolve fully and you may be later on required to take a different class of anti-depressant or a higher dosage or combination of medication.Therefore, PLEASE DO TAKE YOUR MEDICATION REGULARLY and have regular reviews with your doctor to discuss your progress / improvement. And do not stop medication abruptly or alter doages on your own.All the best.- Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"sir for how much time a bipolar disorder patient should take lithium tablets so that he should not triggered to manic episodes again n again n should stable like a normal person with regular routine","Doctor":"Unfortunately, bipolar disorder must be treated at all times for the duration of the patient's life.

Thanks for your question... The symptoms you describe of feeling disconnected from the world, as if you are in a dream and not in reality are suggestive of 'depersonalization' - which is a kind of psychological symptom. It is often associated with stress / anxiety and can be also part of a psychological disorder called dissociative disorder. The other symptoms such as palpitations, difficulty in breathing, chest tightness can also be anxiety-related. Now, I understand and fully agree with you that your symptoms are quite real and quite distressing indeed. I presume that you have had a medical examination and assessment to rule out any serious medical problems, and that is the reason your doctor is not suspecting any major medical causes for your symptoms. But you should be also open to the fact that these symptoms can be due to a psychological cause. There is a close link between our mind and body, and sometimes, psychological problems such as underlying anxiety can manifest as bodily symptoms. I strongly suggest that you have a consultation with a psychiatrist and discuss your current problems. He / she would be able to assess you in detail and suggest an appropriate management plan. And remember, just because you are seeing a psychiatrist, it doesn't mean that your physical symptoms will be ignored and you won't get any medical attention. Psychiatrists are also medical doctors with sufficient clinical skills to detect and treat medical problems, if any are present.

My mother s behaviour is not well now days. she getting fear at night and she telling as she hearing some one s voices and they scolding to her and asking to leave this world. I tried to convey her nothing is avaialble here u be cool but she is not controlling her self and behaving as enemy with us. we all are getting tensed with this situation. Kindly guide me how to go out from this situation.","Doctor":"Hi Anil Sagari, Welcome to Healthcare Magic and thanks for your question... Irrational fear, false beliefs, paranoid ideas, hearing voices, etc. are indicative of a type of psychiatric problem called 'psychosis'. Now, 'psychosis' can be due to various psychiatric illnesses or sometimes, due to medical causes also. Such psychiatric illnesses may include delusional disorder, severe depressive disorder, schizophrenia or late-stage dementia. Sometimes, sudden onset of psychosis in an elderly person can be due to a primary medical cause or a brain pathology. Certain medication like steroids, can also result in the development of psychotic symptoms. You need to take her to a psychiatrist who will be able to assess her in detail to determine the probable cause for these psychotic symptoms. If he suspects any medical cause or brain pathology, then she may have to undergo a few tests and maybe, a brain scan to detect any such causes. Treatment will also depend on the nature of the cause. For example, if she has a primary medical pathology, then that has to be treated first. If her psychosis is part of a depressive disorder, then she may require anti-depressants, in addition to the treatment for the psychotic symptoms. If it is part of a delusional disorder or schizophrenia, then anti-psychotic medication would be the primary line of treatment.

In the meantime my doctor gave me one final script of Xanax (60 pills , 20 days worth) and told me to ween myself off with this last prescription.

Xanax is used to treat anxiety and panic attacks as you have been being treated for in the past.  Xanax is highly addictive too and is one of the many prescription drugs that are sold on the street. I hope that the doctor gave you a written way to \\"wean\\" yourself off of the Xanax as just stopping the medication \\"cold turkey\\" can cause serious complications.  I would advise that you call your doctor's office and find out the name of the behavior health specialist that they want you to see.  I would personally call this specialist to tell them about your medication situation and see if they can get you an appointment before your medication is gone. You can also try calling your doctor's office to see if they will give you another prescription for the Xanax until you can see the specialist.  However, your primary care doctor may not agree to do that for you.  I hope that you can get the help that you need.

He has recently told me he hums and talks to himself while at school and alone - he seems worried about it and says he is mad. He has not yet hit puberty either and is small for his age say around 12 year old size.","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your question... With the limited information which you have given, I reckon that some symptoms (such as repeated skin picking, repeated touching, stroking of the hair) may indicative of \\"compulsive\\" behaviour. \\"Compulsions\\" are repetitive, unwanted acts or rituals or behaviour which the person is aware of doing but is unable to control, thus resulting in distress. Compulsions can exist alone or may often be associated with underlying \\"obsessions\\" (which are repetitive, unwanted thoughts, ideas or mental images) as part of a disorder called Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). You need to elaborate more on his other behaviour, for example, the humming and talking to himself. Such symptoms, in childhood, can be due to a variety of causes (they could even be some kind of obsessive / compulsive symptoms, especially because your son is well aware of them and is distressed by them). What I would strongly advice you to do is to get a consultation with a Child Psychiatrist, who would be able to assess your son in detail and advise the appropriate management plan. Please do not hesitate or delay as it would only be putting your son through more unnecessary suffering and distress.

With various medications, she feels better then and from July 2011, doctor prescribed medications of LONAZEP 0.25 (0-0-1) and OLEANZ PLUS (0-0-1) for one year... As of now (May 2012), in the last 10 months, though there was NO side-effects noticed, But, in the last 2 weeks or so, she is finding it difficult to concentrate much on routines, not showing interest in anything , feels sleepy always, change in food habits , tend to eat more sweets, etc.... I told the doctor last week, he told me to reduce LONAZEP 0.25 tab to 1/2 at night for a month and 1/4 tab to later one month and discontine from July........ Is there any side effects of the LONAZAP further.. We are based in India...","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your question... Oleanz Plus is a combination medication which contains Olanzapine 5 mg (which is given for 'psychosis') and Fluoxetine 20mg (which is given for depression). Lonazep is a medication given for sleep disturbance and anxiety. Though you have not mentioned the initial diagnosis made at the time of starting the medication, I am presuming that she must have suffered from depressive and psychotic symptoms, which must have been the reason she was put on that particular combination. Now, you have mentioned that there were no side effects noticed so far with these medication. It is therefore very unlikely that she is suddenly having side effects of Lonazep after being on that medication for about 10 months. Moreover, 0.25mg is a minimal dose and is unlikely to suddenly cause all these symptoms. The symptoms which she is experiencing, i.e. difficulty in concentrating, lack of interest, lethargy, excessive sleep, increased appetite, etc. may be depressive symptoms. I would suspect that she may be having a relapse of her depression. I think you should discuss this with your doctor, so that he can assess her in detail to see if she is actually having a relapse of her previous symptoms. I think it is okay to taper down the dose of Lonazep, because sedative medication are usually advised only for short periods and can have an addictive potential. Nevertheless, I strongly feel that she needs detailed assessment and further observation in order to be given the correct treatment.

Prozac (Fluoxetine) is an anti-depressant, which belongs to a class called SSRIs and SSRIs are in fact, the first-line medication recommended for depression.

Please Give me good suggestion.","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your question...I understand that it can be very distressing to deal with a family member who is addicted to alcohol and who refuses to take any steps to change himself. It is also very difficult to stop any habit or addiction without the motivation and co-operation of the person. Also, most people who abuse alcohol or any other substance have already been told enough number of times by their relatives and friends to stop or cut down the habit. But remember, the very definition of 'addiction' implies that the person has lost control over the substance and is unable to stop or control its use, despite knowing that it can cause him / her harmful consequences.Now, at the same time, this does not mean that there is no way out. There are a lot of people who have sought help and have been able to quit / control alcohol. One of the key factors in success is to get the person motivated. Merely telling the person repeatedly to stop usually does little good.I would suggest that the most practical way is to get him to see a doctor whenever you find an opportunity. He may not be willing to see a doctor for his drinking problem, but may be willing to get help for a physical or medical problem, for example stomach pain, vomiting, poor appetite, etc. Once you get him to see the doctor, then that can be used as an opportunity by the doctor to discuss his drinking problem and motivate him to see a psychiatrist for further help.Once the psychiatrist establishes a good rapport with him, he can gradually win his confidence. In a skilled and professional manner, he is made to understand his situation and realize that it is time for change. His motivation is gradually enhanced and he is taught skills how to prevent relapses and how to adjust / modify his lifestyle accordingly. This process is called Motivational Enhancement and if done professionally by a therapist, can give good and lasting results.In addition, there are medication which can help - medication which can ease the withdrawal symptoms when he stops alcohol, medication for his psychiatric symptoms such as suspiciousness and medication which can even help reduce the 'craving' i.e. the urge or desire to keep taking the substance.All the best.- Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"Dear sir, my wife is mentally retarded after 2nd delivery of baby girl , 1st one is boy of 4 years. After delevry my mother expired on 19th march 2012 after one month of delevery. from that day my wife get shocked & now she feeling that every one of relatives haarace her for making realize her responcibilies & plans against her. I vising psychiatrist in Kolhapur. She takes tablets around 10 to 15 day & suddenly she stops for current 4 days. Pls suggests.","Doctor":"Hi Atul, Welcome to Healthcare Magic and thanks for your question... Firstly, I would like to make a correction... I think you mean that your wife is having a mental health problem, and not 'mentally retarded'. You have mentioned that her psychological problems started after her 2nd delivery. Now, nearly half the mothers can develop mild emotional changes and problems following delivery, which are temporary and self-limiting. But a small percentage of them can go on to develop more serious and persistent problems which require treatment. I think your wife may be suffering from a post-partum depression or psychosis. Having false beliefs, unrealistic fears and suspicions may be indicative of a post-partum psychosis. Moreover, she has also had to deal with a major stressor due to the death of your mother, which may have been a precipitating factor for developing her psychiatric problem. It is good that you have taken her to a psychiatrist for help. However, it is also very important to continue medication regularly, because it is both essential for recovery and for preventing relapse of symptoms. I think you should take up the responsibility of ensuring that she takes medication everyday, because when people are going through psychiatric problems, they often don't feel that medication is necessary or going to help them. If she is refusing medication completely or being very unco-operative, then you should discuss further options with your psychiatrist. All the best. - Dr. Jonas Sundarakumar Consultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"Hello, 6 months ago I had a manic depressive episode. I was put on Wellbutrin 300mg/day, it has worked well however I am feeling much better now and am starting to get back into social life activities. Being 18 and living in an apartment with 4 others we tend to enjoy drinking. My roomates smoke cannabis too however my phycologist told me that cannabis will depress my mood and flush out the Wellbutrin. However I do enjoy drinking and have been drinking about 4 times a week heavily. Sometimes blackouts occur, but drinking is what I enjoy to do sometimes. Of course my health is number one. What health risks are on the line when it comes to heavy drinking and Wellbutrin,, besides blackouts.","Doctor":"Hi Karl,Welcome to Healthcare Magic and thanks for your question...Wellbutrin is an anti-depressant medication given for depressive disorders. You have mentioned that you had a 'manic-depressive episode' six months back... I'm not sure what you mean by that - I'm guessing that you probably suffered from a depressive episode (maybe a Bipolar Depression), which is why you have been put on an anti-depressant.Now, most substances of abuse - cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, etc. can definitely interfere with psychiatric medication. This is because both of them act on the brain and hence they can interfere with each other's levels and effects. Cannabis, alcohol, etc. can reduce the absorption of such medication or hamper their action or sometimes even potentiate side effects.Secondly, these substances can independently influence and alter your mood / emotional state and thereby can sometimes, worsen the mood disorder itself. Sometimes heavy abuse can also cause new psychiatric problems. Alcohol definitely has effects on the mood and excessive use can even lead to psychotic symptoms (like hearing voices, seeing strange things, fears, false beliefs, etc.)I would strongly suggest that you control your drinking, especially because you already have a mood disorder and as you are on psychiatric medication. If you are finding it difficult to control your drinking habit, please don't hesitate to ask your doctor for help / suggestions.Wish you all the best.- Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"I am 14 years old and I think I m depressed, when I look at myself I wonder why i even bother because life doesn t feel worth getting up in the morning for and I would rather be dead than carry on. I look at the future and instead of seeing a way out, I just see a load of closed doors. I can t handle my life anymore, the slightest thing makes me want to cry and never get up again, and I feel stressed all the time and speak to people in ways that normally I wouldn t. I kind of distance myself from people because I think they won t understand. I don t feel any motivation anymore to do anything constructive or worthwhile, because it all seems so pointless.","Doctor":"Hi Joseph, Welcome to Healthcare Magic and thanks for your question... I can understand how difficult and distressing it must be to going through such feelings. From the picture you have given, I think you are definitely in the midst of a depression. Feeling low, lack of motivation, social withdrawal, negative thoughts, bleak views about the future, feeling worthless and that life is not worth living, etc. are all symptoms of depression. Often, when we are depressed, our thoughts and attitudes can get clouded due to the depression and we don't feel like even seeking help, as everything seems pointless and a mere waste. It is a positive thing that you have a good insight about your feelings and are able to recognize that you may be going through depression. Now, it is very important to seek help for this, without hesitating or postponing. I would suggest that you first talk to someone close to you... may be your parents or relatives ...and let them know what you are going through. You will also need professional help from a psychiatrist who would be able to assess you in detail and treat you appropriately. There are various options available - talking therapies, medication, etc. and you will be able to come out of this soon.

I'm sorry to hear that you have been having a difficult time, esp. with regards to completing your studies. Firstly, the very fact that you have realized that you are having difficulties coping up and have seeked help means that you have taken the first step in solving your problems. I understand that it can be quite dejecting to keep failing repeatedly in something and sometimes this can give an impression that all is lost and that there is no hope. And that feeling can often sap our confidence and leave us with a negative view about anything and everything. It's like seeing the future wearing dark glasses... everything will appear only dark! What I usually advise my patients is to look only at the 'here and now' and not keep brooding about the past or using it as a yardstick to predict the future. So, firstly get yourself together and say: Okay, this is the situation I am in... it may be a difficult situation... but what I'm going to do is look forward and find ways to solve this... rather than saying: I have failed so many times before, so I don't think I can succeed. This attitude will give you enough confidence to face any problems that may come your way and if your confidence is high, then your performance is also going to be better. Also, try to avoid any stressors which may be preoccupying you and hindering your ability to concentrate. It is also important to talk to someone when you're feeling down and low - it may be a relative or close friend or if necessary, a counsellor or a psychiatrist. I'm sure you'll do well.

Trizyne - S - 1 tab in the night 3. In case if he has any sudden problem 1/4 tab. of Revitriol (0.5 mg) Wanted to know he can take the Revitrol tab 1/4 for a week (till his Dr. comes back) When ever he takes this tablet he feels good.","Doctor":"Hi Vishakha,Welcome to Healthcare Magic and thanks for your question...Hearing non-existent noises / voices (in medical terms known as 'hallucinations') is indicative of 'psychosis', which is a particular type of psychiatric disorder.The current combination of medication which he is taking, already has an anti-psychotic medication i.e. Trizyne S (Trifluoperazine). In addition, he is also on a mood-stabilizing medication i.e. Divalproex.Though you have mentioned the diagnosis as 'depression', he is not on any anti-depressant medication currently. But remember, the word 'depression' can often used in a non-specific manner by many people, and I'm guessing that he may actually be suffering from a 'psychotic disorder'.RIVOTRIL (I presume, not 'Revetriol') is a sedative medication and is used for sleep disturbances and sometimes, to calm down the patient.My opinion is that if he is having psychotic symptoms, it is advisable to treat that specifically (probably by increasing the anti-psychotic medication), rather than merely keep giving him a sedative. Of course, this has to be done only on consultaion with a psychiatrist. I would suggest that if you are able to contact him over phone or see his colleague for a quick review, that would be a better idea.All the best.- Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"My mother in law has MS.

He is being treated with antibiotics and surgery is in the future to remove the aortic graft and do a new graft when the infection is more under control. He is showing signs of an altered mental status over the last 3-4 days. The CT done so far is normal. Doctors have said the staph infection is in his bloodstream. My question is: can the staph infect his brain and, if so, would that show on a CT scan? thank you.","Doctor":"Dear edavis, Thanks for posting here. The staphylococcus has the potential to enter the brain if already circulating in the blood stream, and it can lead to infection of the meninges (the membranes covering our brains). This is called bacterial meningitis. Meningitis caused by staph can be  a serous  and one must remain concerned and alert to prevent this from progress. However, in your case it is not clear whether the altered mental staus is because of meningitis or something else. To confirm please ask your clinician to do a CSF fluid (fluid taken from spinal cord through a needle) culture, as this would give you the proper diagnosis. CT scan can show inflammed meninges in such  case, but it can be missed sometimes in earlier stages. Your husband must be on staph specific antibniotics, if not please ask your clinicians to do as fast as possible as correct antibiotics wi help him improve faster. Do well.

Like I listen but it goes right through my ear and out the other.","Doctor":"Hi Michael,Welcome to Healthcare Magic and thanks for your question...Having difficulty in paying attention or staying focussed in a task can be due to various reasons. One of the common reasons is underlying stress. Often, when the mind is preoccupied with stressful or worrying thoughts, it can be difficult to stay focussed on the task at hand and can sometimes lead to mistakes and poor performance as well. Sometimes lack of proper planning and poor time management can also result in stress and thereby impair performance.However, if in addition to the symptoms which you have mentioned, if you are experiencing low mood, lack of interest, lack of energy, negative thoughts, poor sleep or poor appetite, then it may be indicative of depression, in which case, you may need to consult your doctor.I would suggest that you try to avoid any stressors which may be bothering you. You can also share your distress with a close friend or relative, as that would make you feel less burdened. Maybe, you can take a break and spend time just relaxing and unwinding. You can also try relaxation exercises like deep breathing or meditation / yoga. A better planning of your time and activities can also make you feel more relaxed.And if at any point in time you feel that things are getting out of hand or you are finding it difficult to cope, please do not hesitate to seek professional help straightaway.Wish you all the best.-Dr. Jonas Sundarakumar Consultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"dear sir, my brother is suffering from strange disease .his behaviou is abnormal.he does the work as told by us or drives vehicle.but he sometimes have differnt mood .he thinks one of our relative is creating problem in his path.he dislikes him and abuses him.he sleeps a lot.doesnt earn.he is poor in studies hence didnt get job anywhere.he is now thinking guilty for not studuing in childhood.his age is now 30.he is not social or doent have any friend.he feels guilty that due to negligence in studies in childhood he is facing this day.","Doctor":"hi welcome to healthcaremagic take him to a psychiatrist and he requires a psychological rehabilitation at the earliest hoping to find your brother get back into mainstream regards"},{"Patient":"Hi my wife is on cipralex 5 mg and oleanz 5 mg once in night daily from past 7 years.. does she have to continue taking these medicines rest of her life? Also for a brief period her dose was reduced to 2.5 mg and she again went to depression again. so we reverted back to 5mg. will these medication be taken all her life any other alternate?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your question... The duration of treatment for depression usually depends on the number and severity of the episodes and whether there have been any relapses after stopping medication. If the initial episode has been severe or prolonged or if she has had more than 2 episodes or if she has a strong family history of depression, then she may have to take medication for a longer duration. It is also important to see if she has any predisposing factors for a recurrent depression like underlying thyroid abnormalities, certain vitamin deficiencies, etc. and treat them appropriately. In your wife's situation, since you have mentioned that there has been a clear relapse of symptoms on reducing the dosage of mediaction, I think that  it is advisable to continue medication for a longer duration. 5mg of Cipralex is the minimum effective dosage of that medication for depression, and it is a relatively safe drug with minimal side effects. However, you can discuss with your psychiatrist if she needs to be continued on Oleanz (which is an anti-psychotic medication and is given only when there are 'psychotic' symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, etc.), in addition to the depressive symptoms.

How can this be prevented or what can i do to stop this from happening. I also notice i tremble very little even though im not nervous. This has been going for a very long time now.","Doctor":"Hi and Welcome to Healthcare Magic... Thanks for your question. From your question I gather that you become excessively nervous and have trembling of your hands, especially during social situations. So, in other words, you seem to be having an \\"anxiety\\" problem... Generally, anxiety can manifest itself in two ways: 1) psychological... i.e. feeling nervous, tensed, unable to relax, etc. and 2) somatic... i.e. bodily symptoms like trembling of hands, rapid beating of the heart, sweating, etc.Now, it is important to know whether your anxiety is confined ONLY to social situations or whether you keep experiencing some anxiety most of the time and are unable to relax completely. If your anxiety is only confined to social situations and if you are feeling well and relaxed during other times, then you most likely are having \\"Social Anxiety\\". Having some amount of anxiety is normal but it becomes abnormal if... it is either excessive or if it affects your normal functioning...So, if you feel that your anxiety is present too often or too much or is interfering with your functioning or performance, then you may be having an anxiety disorder and you need help.Therapy for anxiety disorders is usually of two types: 1) medication and 2) psychological therapies like behaviour therapies, talking therapies, etc. This choice would be based on the severity of your symptoms, the availability of a good therapist and of course, your personal choice as well. Often, relaxation techniques such as breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, yoga, etc. can help a lot in reducing anxiety symptoms.You also mentioned that you have mild trembling even when you are not nervous. Some people can have a mild basal tremor which is called an \\"essential tremor\\", which is generally harmless and does not need any intervention unless it is disabling. I would suggest that you consult a psychiatrist locally, so that he / she would be able to assess you in detail to find out what type and how severe your anxiety is and whether you need any medication or any other therapy for the same.Please feel free to clarify any doubts that you have...Wish you all the best.Regards,Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"My mother is suffering from Depression and Panic Attack.

My wife is a BAMS doctor.My father is a retired person from government service. I am the only son. Soon after my mother s expire i started Alcoholic consumption. I got edicted to it. Then my family took me to a Psychiatrist . They put me tablet like Libruim, Nexito, Dizone( Disulfiram ). The prescribed tablet i am taking from 2 years. Past from 2 years i have no alcoholic consumption at all. But to be frank i chew tobacco. Now thing is when i started taking the prescribed tablets, i was working in Priya cement. I was feeling good in work and confident. In Priya cement i worked for 1 and half years. I am MBA finance. When i was in Priya cement i got a offer from Onida company for the post of Accounts officer. There when i joined i was ok for ten days, and then they didn t give me any training. I was over pressurized. Than my hands started shaking, my head was totaly struck. I was mentally upset. Whenever i used to see office documents and cash, i used to get nervous. Lots of negetive things started in my mind (Like attemting suicide )lack of interest in my life. I donot know when i was in Priya cement , i was confident and interest and soon i joined onida company, this case happened like this. So soon i resigned from Onida company. Right from past 1 year iam not in a job.When i resigned from Onida company for month i was uncomfortable( like attemting suicide, hands where shaking, lots of interest in life). Now iam getting state government appointment. I want to ask whether again the same thing will happen which happened in onida company? Now at present iam ok. Now my hands are shaking where iam getting a state government offer. Also every seconds my mind will be fluctating and fructrasting regarding my interest in life. So please tell me what are the causes for my case. Please note iam in tobacco habit. Sometimes i get confidence, sometimes i don t. So look into my case and awaiting for your valuable solution. Regards, Abhishek","Doctor":"HI, Welcome to Health care Magic. I have gone through your query. I am really glad to know that you have stopped stopped taking alcohol. Congratulations for getting a government job Coming to your problem , based on the symptoms you have mentioned it could be due to Panic or anxiety disorder. It is just the environment and the work pressure at the place where you worked before( onida company) that made you feel insecure . This insecurity leads to anxiety and panic attacks where you feel very nervous about even small things thinking too much about the consequences. You absolutely normal. You need not worry about the same being repeated at State government job. You can happily take up the offer. You dont even need medication. Just forget about your life at onida company. If you dont leave that , that keeps bugging your mind. Be confident and just say to yourself that everything is going to be OK. As you have mentioned that your wife is a doctor, just share all your problems with her. Try to meditate. Just because you were over pressurized in the previous job , it doesn't mean that you face the same kind of challenge everywhere you work. One more thing i would like like to advice you is regarding tobacco chewing. Please stop chewing tobacco as i would take a toll on your health. Try Nicorette chewing gums. Chew a gum whenever you feel like chewing tobacco. As you have stopped alcohol i think i wont be difficult to get rid of this addiction as well. You don't need any medicines at this stage. What is you need is a bit of counselling and a quality time with your family( they will always stand by you at all times). Stay positive and you life will definitely be beautiful. Wish you a healthy life. Take care"},{"Patient":"Hi my name is XXXXX, I am 23 years old. I am suffering from severe depressionand anxiety.

Two groups of mood disorders are broadly recognized; the division is based on whether the person has ever had a manic or hypomanic episode. Thus, there are depressive disorders, of which the best-known and most researched is major depressive disorder (MDD) commonly called clinical depression or major depression, and bipolar disorder (BD), formerly known as manic depression and characterized by intermittent episodes of mania or hypomania, usually interlaced with depressive episodes. However, there are also forms of depression of MDD and BD that are less severe and are known as dysthymic disorder(MDD) and cyclothymic disorder for (BD). the drug prescribed to you is Valproic acid,which is a good mood stabilizing agent.follow your doctor advice for course of treatment,weight gain is a side effect seen with this drug ,however i advise you to consult your doctor again than stopping the drug on self. hope i replied your query. team -hcm"},{"Patient":"iam XXXXX.iam suffering with mental disbalance since 9yrs.i cant control my mind because the negative feelings are coming continuesly.please give a good solution for this problem thank you.","Doctor":"Engage yourself in the following activities. 1.

From my child hood onwards i have a problem with shyness , Over Self conscious. Now i have fear of public speaking,blushing, anxiety ,lip shivering etc... I think am more active mentally than physically, because if am seeing someone then i ll guess myself ,what the other person is thinking about me and I ll act on that guess eg: I ll guess he/she is thinking badly about my standing position,my laugh etc etc..and I ll feel uncomfortable with that. This same is happening on all other daily activities. Because of these problems,Am very bad in mingling with friends and other social circles. My medical school life also getting distracted because of this,Am not even able to ask a doubt to my teacher even if am alone with teacher,if am asking a doubt I ll think for many minutes like what she ll think about me,what if my language is bad ,what if my question is bad etc etc... Also sometimes I ll have a fear or am afraid to ask something to someone, I have good patience,but if i get angry and saying something ,then my lip will shiver, Blushing on my face etc. Am making my own thoughts about what other will think of me. Because of all this I can t walk in public in a relaxed state,my mind will always be in working state.If am talking in a group who are not too close to me,then my lips will start to shiver, uncomfortable etc because during the talk my mind will be working on others like where are they focusing,are they focusing my talk,lip movement etc..are they laughing about me etc.... Am only good with my few too close friends.. because of the above problem,I only have few friends,I ll always be at my home ,I won t go out like others.. In summary i can say, I have self consciousness , fear, Blushing, anxiety, Nervousness , Panic etc.. Doc, Is there any ways to change all this ? Am very sad in medical school because of the above issues, Am very much like to perform on some topics on my class,but I ll hide from these stuffs ..","Doctor":"hello . i read your query. since you are a medical student you yourself can see and admit the solution of the fear........thats is only and only to be courageous enough to throw away them all........i know you must have tried lot and wud have failed to do so. but always remember that in this world' the people sees in you what YOU shows''.    whenever you meet some new person and start becoming conscious .....just think that he will observe your fear only if you show him ( by your body language, lip shivering etc) try to control that immediate  change of behavior. one more thing you can ask your own self......even after allllll...........if the opposite person dont like your speech, or question, or presentation.....then what will be the result?? nothing....no one is going to hold you in jail.....never be afraid of the result......never fear to try. if you fail then try better and stronger.  you just need some self motivation. you can try some personality development coaching if you want. no need to go to psychiatrist. need to do self evaluation. there must be some activity which u are never afraid of, which u r confident of....try to involve in them to built up confidence. hope this helps you.

So, I am not going to attempt to puzzle this out. I will state, there are certain medications (prescription and illegal) that can induce these symptoms.  Also, if our brain's chemistry is not balanced, you may experience these types of symptoms.  You are giving me descriptions of paranoia along with auditory and tactile hallucinations.  Have you attempted to change your sleep routine?  Have you attempted to sleep in a different location (both within your home and outside of your home)? Are you a very spiritual-based person?  Have you attempted to enlist help from your local clergy? No family physician should make you so uncomfortable that you cannot confide in him/her.  If you do not trust your own physician, see another.  I believe you could benefit from seeing a therapist in addition to a clergyman. I'm trying to address your problem from two points - medically and spiritually.  If this is a medical problem, the sooner you find out and begin the correct medications, the quicker the symptoms will abate.  If this is a spiritual situation, I hope you have a clergyman that is willing to help you.  Attempt to speak to a catholic priest.

This will help rule out other causes like a slow growing tumor or other intracranial pathology like Normal pressure hydrocephalus or a subdural hematoma(although the last two are less likely).The commonest cause of Dementia is Alzheimers Disease while other causes are Frontotemporal dementia,Dementia with Lewy bodies,Vascular dementia etc.Hope this helps.

I think I have not enjoyed the life as others do.and I am not able to make friends....I have noone to share my feelings.........what to do 2) From 3 years, my eyes are brimmed with tears and I becomme emotional most of the time I go out of the home for some work to deal with people .....while actually there is no reason to cry.....this also happens when I see someone crying in TV shows or in reality. or when I didn t llike something or when someone other than parents argues with me . 3) I have to think some things forcefully and repeatedly...........such as thoughts of abusive language about some respectable person come in my mind spontaneously and unwantedly and then I have to ask God for forgive me and about long live of that person.......since I have never abused anyone ....... but I have no control on the thoughts coming to my mind and therefore I have to ask God to forgive me. and thoughts such as about wishing God health and long live of my family members. I have gradually developed this problem from about 9 years when I first time saw human death in reality (of my father s brother). As a result, today I have lost concentration in studies and not able to do my project work. 4) I lost my attention while riding or driving due to unwanted thoughts and has no confidence of driving or riding , therefore I have to go by using publc transport and wait for that. While my younger brother who is 6 years younger than me goes every where on vehicle and enjoys with his friends . This is developing feelings of hopelessness and inferiority complex in me. 5) I have lost my will power and I don t study even if I know it is necessary and I scratch my face unwantedly due to this. Hence, my face now has spots which further lowers my self confidence. 6) I am feeling that due to forced thinking, my ability to understand complex things is decreasing . And I take more time in doing tasks which other people complete in less time. 7) I didn t feel fresh (as I felt before 10 years) , no matter how many hours I sleep. All day I feel sleepy. All these things have affected my life severely . I don t understand what to do. Sometimes I feel that my life will go waste. Please help me since my father has died of cancer 3 years ago and I am the elder son and I have to support my family . Nobody is able to understand my problems and they say that I have no problem .I know that I am able to achieve a lot in my life if I get rid of all these problems.","Doctor":"Hi Mayank, Thanks for writing in. I do understand your predicament. Your entire history is suggestive of an anxiety disorder which is leading to the symptoms you are currently experiencing. This commonly occurs when we experience a lot of stress due to some reasons and we cannot take the stress any longer. The fact that you need to support your family adds to the stress. The following measures will help: a.     Identify what you really want in your life and make them your long term goals b.     Decide the best path to achieve these goals and break the journey into small, achievable goals c.     Congratulate yourself or treat yourself whenever you achieve one of these small goals d.     Start with setting down to achieve 1 goal at a time. Once you’re done, start with the 2nd one and go on. e.     Whenever you feel you can’t do it, take a  few deep breaths and start over again. f.     Pranayama and yoga will help you a lot and will help treat the anxiety that you are currently experiencing. g.     Give yourself a strong message that if you cant do it, nobody else can. Try this for 2 weeks and see if it helps.

Apart from that psychological disorders like schizophrenia, mood and personality disorders , obsessive compulsive disorders commonly cause such behavourial problems which are beyond the control of your mind.You may or may not have insight about your condition and hence will face difficulty in controlling your emotions and actions.Once such problems are diagnosed appropriate treatment with medicines and behaviour therapy can help one lead a normal life. Its like any other medical illness, if you have fever, pain etc you consult a physician ,don't you?.Similarly for anxiety, depression etc you should not hesitate to consult a doctor as its not your fault that you are suffering from it . In your case, since you have attempted suicide once, it is very important that you consult a therapist or  psychiatrist for   appropriate management.Infact its best if you confide in your parents or someone close to you so that they can help you in seeking right treatment.Meanwhile you should try to cultivate a positive attitude towards life as you have a long and beautiful journey of life ahead.

This is the third or fourth winter that it happens. I am feeling like my heart is bearing very hard and eventually this causes a feeling of tenseness or tightness on the left side of my chest which then starts to radiate even into my arm and the left side of my back. This usually goes away in the spring and I feel fine the rest of the year. I had my heart checked ( EKG , stress test) and nothing unusual was found (although this checkup was done in the fall when I was not feeling the palpitations). The palpitations seem to get worse when I am feeling stress or anxiety . I am a 35 year old male, nonsmoker, normal weight, try to exercise on a regular basis. I am going to get this checked out by a doctor but just wanted to get an opinion on what this could be. Thanks.

However, it is advisable to put in place an individualized plan of management (especially for OCD and anxiety) which includes not only medicines, but also non-pharmacological methods like behaviour therapy and relaxation techniques. Continuing Klonopin at high doses for long duartion should be avoided as it can cause dependence. Discuss with your psychiatrist about your preferences and the most bothersome symptoms which you want him to target first. This will help in setting up priorities after which problems can be dealt with accordingly."},{"Patient":"Respected doctor, I am an MBBS doctor going to pursue MD .I have gone through a divorce and my second marriage like my first my husband is having affair with another woman.I have a copy of their chat.Now my problem is that I am extremely irritable and humiliated .I getting easily angry and sometimes I feel like crying .Is it depression what should i do?","Doctor":"Dear Madam The adverse condition you went and going through is really very difficult to tackle with to most of us.

Avoidance keeps social anxiety disorder going.Avoidance leads to more problemsWhile avoiding nerve-wracking situations may help you feel better in the short term, it prevents you from becoming more comfortable in social situations and learning how to cope. In fact, the more you avoid a feared social situation, the more frightening it becomes.Avoidance may also prevent you from doing things you’d like to do or reaching certain goals. For example, a fear of speaking up may prevent you from sharing your ideas at work, standing out in the classroom, or making new friends.Challenging social anxiety one step at a timeWhile it may seem impossible to overcome a feared social situation, you can do it by taking it one small step at a time. The key is to start with a situation that you can handle and gradually work your way up to more challenging situations, building your confidence and coping skills as you move up the “anxiety ladder.”For example, if socializing with strangers makes you anxious, you might start by accompanying an outgoing friend to a party. Once you’re comfortable with that step, you might try introducing yourself to one new person, and so on.I wish it helps you"},{"Patient":"MY WIFE S ELDER SISTER IS PSHYCATRIST PATIENT MORE OR LESS SIX YEARS.

Even if it s something that never would happen, I think it s real until I jolt awake. Please, I need an answer. I m starting to get scared by this.","Doctor":"Exact reason for Why we dreams is still unknown, but frequent & extremely vivid dreams can be manifestation underlying psychological turmoil. Many psychiatric illness can have early manifestation of extremely vivid dreams of fearful or strange nature. Depression, Anxiety, Primary sleep disorders etc. are major psychiatric illness presenting most of the time with vivid dreams only. It can be due to side effect of many over the counter medication used for different reason.

To begin with, how do you know that you have OCPD? Is it a self diagnosis or have you been diagnosed by a mental health professional? The rest of my answer is valid only if you have been diagnosed by a psychiatrist/psychologist. A personality disorder is, by definition, a very ingrained part of an individual's personality. Except in some specific situations, medications are not of much help. However, psychotherapy such as Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) can be very helpful. For psychotherapy to be successful, there are 2 minimum requirements - an acceptance of the problem, and a desire to do the hard work that is required in therapy. In my opinion, you will benefit from psychotherapy. I recommend you consult a good psychologist or a psychiatrist who does therapy, and take it up from there. Take care.

Ever since then people say and sometimes I feel that my behavior changed drastically. I tried talking about it with some of my close friends and their advice was to move on and completely forget about that incident. I have desperately tried that but it doesn t seem to happen. I just want to be close with my friends and every time I do something, I mess it up badly and regret my action after wards. I have also started feeling that my friends became irritated because of my behavior and stopped talking the way they used to. Whenever I feel lonely, I try talking with some of my friends but they don t pick up the call and this makes me feel very bad. It s just that I don t know what to do and I question myself a lot of times before doing something and I continuously feel guilty and bad.

I had diarrhea and vomitting for about 7 days and lost 7lb in weight. I started having muscle spasms and pain, so bad that I couldn t do anything for myself. Bloods showed inflammation, raised white cells and auto immune. I was referred to a rheumatologist who retook bloods which came back normal. I have a history of depression and the rheumatologist said my problems were mood related. My other symtoms are night sweats , flushing, fainting , involuntary limb and head movements. I have had occasional episodes of vomitting dark blood and I am now constantly constipated and my stools are very dark. I asked for a second opinion and the new rheumatologist seemed to listen and assured me she would get to the bottom of things. Turned out she knew the original rheumatologist and also gave a diagnosis of mood related problems. Although my bloods showed i was positive for coeliac disease but that this was probably a red herring. She also mentioned carcinoid because of the flushing and sweating but that it s very rare and highly unlikely. She said she had done all she could as a specialist and would not be carrying out anymore investigation. She said she would write to my General Practitioner and recommend Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. I really feel that because of my history of depression that I haven t been taken seriously.

It is a normal human nature. What is required is to learn to control our anger. The first step is to realize that our emotional response is not correct, for which we repent later. Our anger and irritation increases when we have a very stress full situation.Try to do some meditation, learn to smile with every one whether we like that person or not. Smile does not cost us any thing and we do not loose any thing but the gain from it is tremendous.

I hope you are aware of the policy that we cannot diagnose online. But I can give you some ideas to think about. Your symptoms can be part of a depressive disorder. It could either be Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar Disorder. But you may need to think beyond depression. Features of adult ADD (attention deficit disorder) can present like depression. However, these are hypotheses. Your actual diagnosis can be given only by a mental health professional who can interview you and evaluate the symptoms. It is important to figure out if these problems are recent. And if so, you need to see if there are any particular stress factors associated. You may need to work on relationship issues, especially with your parents and your beliefs about marriage. This can be effectively done in psychotherapy sessions. You can look up Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) or Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT). Hope this helps. Take care.

I’ve never been very good in school, but yet i do have very strong good qualities that i excel in, i m not sure if it s some sort of concentration issue, but in school if i wasn t interested in something i would just drift off and day dream, or even trying to read a book is difficult for me because it has to be extremely quiet in a room and it helps if no one is in it at all or i get easily distracted..","Doctor":"Hello, I appreciate your writing in this forum to try and get a better understanding of yourself. Many of the symptoms you have enlisted are quite normal. Most of us have social anxiety to varying extents - some have less anxiety than you do, while some have more. So, when does it become an illness? For symptoms such as these which fall on a continuum, abnormality/illness is determined on the basis of how much trouble the symptoms are causing you. If your symptoms are significantly impacting your functioning in an important domain (e.g. social, interpersonal, work etc), then it can be considered a disorder and be treated. From your description, you most likely do not have Social Anxiety Disorder; your symptoms represent a slightly more extreme variation of normal. In any case, even if it is not a disorder, an improvement in these features would be of benefit to you. Psychotherapy is the best solution in this case. You will certainly benefit from Cognitive Behaviour Therapy or Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy. However, psychotherapy requires hard work and commitment; you have to decide if an improvement in these symptoms would be worth putting in all the hard work. Finally, let me reiterate - some amount of social anxiety is very common, so you are not alone. The fact that the anxiety has gotten better with age is reassuring. Warm regards, Dr. Saifuddin Kharawala MBBS, DPM"},{"Patient":"Hello sir, my bladder head is not coming out while erection, bladder fore skin is preventing it from coming out.i have this problem since childhood.Will this cause any problem while having sex.even I can t masturbate as it cause pain by skin which is stoping my bladder head?Plz help me","Doctor":"Hi, You have to consult a urologist and get evaluated.

Thank you for sharing the details of your problem. Fluvoxamine is probably helping you by suppressing the obsessive nature of the thoughts. But the fact is that you may still need to work on your thoughts. The best addition you can make to the current treatment regime is that of Psychotherapy. Cognitive Therapy is immense potential in treating Body Dysmorphic Disorder. The disorder is eventually nothing but your thoughts about self. And there are probably a lot of irrational beliefs hidden under the surface thoughts of \\"looking feminine\\". Going in for Psychotherapy can help you explore those core beliefs and thoughts, modify them so that they do not create the emotional disturbances, and lead a much happier life. It might take care of the other problems such as the ED. Hope this helps.

Homeopathy can take care of various symptoms of depression. Extreme cases of depression or the cases where the patients are on high doses of the conventional medicines for a long time (drug dependency) may not find good results using homeopathy. Homeopathy medicines address the root cause of the disease and hence prevent the relapse and recurrence of the condition. Last but not the least, homeopathy medicines are absolutely free from any side-effects as opposed to most of conventional medicines like anti-depressants and anxiolytics. good luck"},{"Patient":"Hello, I m a 24 year old male and I ve always been a fairly competent and intelligent person. However as I ve matured I have started to realize things about myself. Firstly, I have a limited memory of my childhood. When a person asks me what I was like as a kid I often find it difficult to offer an answer mostly because, with exception to a few notable events, I can t remember what I was like or other things that happened to me as a child. Secondly, I often can t hold my attention very well. I get easily distracted or I will go off on tangents in the middle of conversations. I always have the urge to spit things out as they come to me for fear of forgetting them in 10 minutes when the current conversation is over. Lastly, I often forget things quickly. I will forget things like where I submitted an application, or what homework is due next week, and I will even forget entire conversations with people. It s very common for me to tell people the same story or same information many times before it clicks in my head that I already told them. I m concerned about my mental health. I ve always been good in school and very personable but I fear that if this all continues it will start to degrade my quality of life and affect my relationships. It has crossed my mind that I may have ADD but to my knowledge there is no history of this in my family. The exception to that is that as a child my brother had ADHD . Please help me figure this out.

Yes, it could be a panic attack; some of your symptoms are certainly suggestive of a panic attack. However a panic disorder is diagnosed only after ruling out other medical causes of the symptoms. In your case, there could be an endocrine (hormonal) or cardiac cause of your symptoms, or it could be something else. It will require assessment by a medical specialist and some investigations before an organic cause can either be diagnosed or ruled out. Regards, Saif"},{"Patient":"I am a 27 year-old female. I used to poop or pee in home-made diapers for both fun and curosity when I was a teen, but I quit it many years ago because I thought it was a messy as well as morally bad behavior. After that, I occasionally dreamed of this act suffering all the time I was asleep. My problem is that the rate of these dreams has noticeably increased within last 2 years. In addition, I have found that I have a great desire to watch videos on the internet in which people are peeing or pooping in their pants or diapers. This stimulates me to the extent that I want to piss myself and I struggle a lot to control my urine. Since I haven t had any sexual experience, I can t realize whether this is sexual or fun or an addiction. 1) Would you please tell me how to recognize the type of my behavior among the three afformentioned ones, i.e. sexual, fun, addiction? Am I an AB or a DL or none? 2) Is this a psychologic problem? How can I cure it anyway? 3) Does this have anything to do with my desire to act like boys when I was a child and a teenage and I still lack some of female skills such as behaving seducingly?","Doctor":"Welcome to Healthcare Magic Good Day You probably have a prediliction to an unnatural sexual fantasy. It could be related to the terms Watersports and Skat. Not that I am hinting on this but psychological influences are implicated in such situations. There are a few articles based on the Freud's theories of the infantile mind, which may interest you. Have a read when you like, just for interest. Nothing to be worried about unless these thoughts trouble you. Nothing to worry about your 'seduction' skills, as and when you enter a relationship it should manifest appropriately.

OCD is usually a chronic illness, which means that it does not get cured completely. With medicines, it can be brought in control (like Diabetes or Hypertension), but during stressful situations the symptoms may return. You seem to be facing some stress at home and at work; probably this stress has triggered another episode of OCD.Another, though less likely, possibility is that you are currently having an anxiety disorder other than OCD. A confirmed diagnosis would require a face-to-face consultation.It is very likely that you will benefit from the same medicines that had helped you earlier. I recommend you visit a psychiatrist for a face-to-face evaluation and consider restarting those earlier medicines. More importantly, please do not stop the medicines on your own in future.Regards,Dr. Saifuddin KharawalaMBBS, DPM"},{"Patient":"hi i am 34 years old my fiancee is 33 we had a son in 1999 he is 11 now but i have been on methadone since 2002 before i was addicted to lortab our son was born 3 months premature and had cleft lip and palate i am nervous about having another kid since i am on methadone does methadone cause problems like birth defects if the man is takin it","Doctor":"Hello, Risk of birth defects is always there in men & women taking methadone or opioids during the reproductive stage. The risk gets higher when women take it. Both the partners should avoid any kind of addictions if they are planning for a baby. It is important to maintain the quality of the sperm & egg for a healthy conception. Congenital birth defects may be irreversible & a challenge for the baby. Birth defects like cleft palate, oral clefts, atrial or ventricular septal defects, club foot, premature birth, low birth weight, miscarriage have been reported in research studies. If your son has cleft lip or palate let him be examined, it can be made better by surgery. If you are planning for a second bay, both the partners should stay away from addictions if any.

Ok, it all started once when i was taking a shower, i almost faint because of the steam. This happened in november, and i could be fine in school until december, although i had some weird feelings which were related to the fear. Well, this fear wasnt that big, but when i finished school (december, i live in south america) i started to think: Anything can happen anytime, i better take care of my body and i started to overprotect it, like a hypocondriac, i felt some days i couldnt breath , one night, i really couldnt breath, i couldnt move, i was sweating, i was shaking, but yet, i dont know why i didnt ask for help. Ok so i managed to fell asleep and when i woke up i didnt have any of the sypmtoms just a little bit of nerviosism. After this i felt good for 1 week, when it started again, the feeling that i couldnt breath, so i told my mom and she took me to a doctor, he examinated me and said my heart and lungs were ok, very well, i was so happy it wasnt something physical but i told my dad, and instead of saying Thats great son!, he just told me But i dont think its that, i think its because you spend too much time on the computer This saddened me. Ok, i kept with my live until one day, my feelings returned, but this time it was in the morning, couldnt breath, sweating, etc. And my parents were crying because they said Oh how can we help him, we do not have money That worried me and the symptoms got much worse, we had to go to urgency, the medic who first examinated me, told me my problem was in my mind, and just to be sure, i got torax x-rays and an ECG because i had some discomfort in the left armpit. Both exams were ok, and i went home. Since then i felt better, but other symptoms appared, this time, weird feelings when i stood from a chair, like a pressure going up from my chest , it dissapeared in 3 seconds but it was discomfortable, i also had some discomfort at the sides of the forehead, i couldnt stand up sometimes. The worst of all is that my parents didnt believe me, they thought i was creating all this because i wanted, AND I WAS ON VACATION, why would i do that? But they kept not believing me, i didnt know how to act, if i showed a sign of my discomfort my parents would ground me. Some time happened and those symptoms dissapeared: the feelings on the sides of the forehead and the pressure going up. Some days later, i started to get like a vacuum on my heart zone, it was not pain, it didnt irradiate. I had some in my lyfe, like 1 per 2 years, and i didnt really care about it, but now i had 6 per DAY, and obviously, my parents were mad at me, but one night, i was shaking and sweating again, i could breath, but those heart sensations came every 15 minutes, and my mom was yelling at me that she didnt want me anymore to be her son, that because of me she had all her problems, and i didnt cry because i was worried about my heart, after 2 hours, my mom told me she would take me to the doctor. At the next day the doctor told me my problem could be intestinal, so i had a panendoscopy, which said i had gastritis , duodenitis, and the helycobacter pyrali, i started an antibiotic treatment, and the bacter dissapeared, all good there, but now i have other symptoms BUT, i assume my problem is my mind, i know im overprotecting my body with every thing i feel, i recognize it and im with a psychologist , im getting over it, but yet, i have some feelings and i attribute them to diseases. I have panic attacks and anxiety crisis, and im taking clonazepam for it. So please, to stay calm, can you answer this please? -Whenever i try to stand, it takes me a while, because i feel like enough blood was not getting to my eye inmediatly, maybe it not that, but i feel weird everytime i stand up, when im waking up i need to sit for 30 seconds before standing up. -Weird feelings in my hands, when im really nervous, and sometimes i get them too when im not nervous but not as big. When i press and rub my arms, i get this tingling in my hands -I know the bacter is over but sometimes i still feel discomfort in the area above the heart, like on my shoulder , my medic told me they were gases but i dont believe it that much, i know its not the heart, but it scares me -I ve had palpations for a long time, when i feel palpations i dont feel my heart pumping faster, i just feel it, mostly when i stop breathing when i want to really focus on something, thats when i feel it. - Most of the times after i wake up, i touch my chest zone and i feel my heart pumping fast, i dont hear or feel the palpations, just when i touch my chest, i feel my heart is pumping fast, with some breathing exercises i calm it down, but it scares me, if i didnt touch my chest, i wouldnt know my heart is pumping faster, its weird. -Recently ive been getting some discomfort in my back neck, its not pain, could this be stress? P.S I ve been recently diagnosed with astigmatism . And i really need help, i cant do my normal activities, i cant, all these feelings are destroying my life, please tell me what to do Im 16 years old, male. As my medical historial, i ve just had random bronchitis , but nothing more. My mom suffers from Osteoarthritis and instetinal problems, and my dad suffers from asthma .","Doctor":"Hi Your problem is panic attacks. and i am feeling you are not getting the right therapy. i really wanna help you. which medicines and doses are you taking right now?

I had a foot infection leading to the amputation of toes and debridement of my left foot. Prior to a below the knee amputation, I had a full leg by-pass which was successful, and did not need the second amputation, which was BRILLIANT :). However, during the bypass procedure, I woke up and, although I have no memory of this mid-operation awakening, I was subsequently visited by my anaesthetist explaining to me what had happened and asking me if I was experiencing any problems. At the time, I was so uncomfortable from the procedure, I felt nothing unusual. I have now been home for almost a month and have an almost overwhelming and unpleasant smell of antiseptic in my nose 24/7, and I am inclined to weep embarrassingly at any movie on TV. On the one hand this is funny and weird, on the other it is embarrassing and unpleasant.

Apparently your uncle is showing those signs. This usually occurs in a period of intoxication (excessive drinking leading to abnormality) rather than withdrawal syndrom (abnormalities occuring when drinking stopped abruptly after the body is dependent on it) Also, yes an alcohol dependent can have seizures both in intoxication as well as in withdrawal. Also, if he is producing more Iron, that physical cause can also lead to seizures. There are many other reasons, physically, why an alochol dependant person can have seizures like vitamin deficiency, low blood sugar etc. Also, loss of short term memory could be an indicator of impending dementia (memory loss) called alcohol dementia....again there are many reasons why the memory, of a person dependent on alcohol, is not right. Also, there is no use stopping drinking just like that, having been dependant on it for so long.....it has to be done either slowly with gradual reduction in dose of alcohol or with cover of many medication if stopped sudenly. It can sometimes be fatal if stopped suddently without support of medication LET ME END BY SAYING...IT IS HIGH TIME YOUR UNCLE GOT PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT OF EITHER ADDICTION PSYCHIATRIST OR DURG&ALCOHOL TEAM IN YOUR LOCAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. I would think your twin brother might be having other causes if he has the same symptoms unless, at 18 years of age, he is allready as dependant on alcohol as your uncle.

From what you are describing, it seems this has gone too far and is causing significant inter personal problems between you two. The first thing to do, I suggest, is for you to talk to him about this. This would not only start getting the process of getting help but also will let you know his reaction to getting help. Any kind of help offered will obviously work with the hard work of the actual people involved and hence this is very important. Inter-personal therapy appears to be a good form of talking therapy for you too but before anythign of this sort is sought out, please have a preliminary assessment by a mental health professional to see if there is any need for you both to seek help or is it that it may be you that may be overly sensitive. Sorry fro suggesting this but a competent professional has to look at all angles of a problem.

As a child his parents were awful and he began drinking and using pot at age 8. He used those two substances until age 32 when for 6 months he used meth. During his alcohol and pot use he was a productive person. He had married my sister, worked full-time and was a jewel - when he wasn't high. He honestly has a heart of gold. Well, my sister turned him in with the meth because his personality changed with it. He spent 2 months in jail and since that day nearly 20 years ago has been clean. My brother helped him start his own business and he was very successful and doing well. Then about 5 years ago he had his first manic episode . Then he was diagnosed with Hep C and we all found out that when he was using meth, even though he was using my sister's needles for diabetes , he shared one back and forth with his druggie friend who had recently died. At the time of his diagnosis he was not referred to a liver specialist and nothing was done for treatment. Then his mental illness took hold and he was forced to give up his business and he went on disability and Medicare. Eighteen months ago Ron had open-heart surgery to try to repair IHSS (congental). During that process they discovered the Hep C had progressed severely and they were shocked that his doctor hadn't ever referred him to a liver specialist. It took another year to be able to begin any kind of treatment due to the heart problems. They finally started treatment last Sept and after 2 weeks his body started shutting down and they stopped treatment. He was in the hospital at that time and they added another pain med that made him psychotic . He was never violent and never hurt anyone but ran from the hospital in the middle of the night after removing his tubing (in his hospital gown). He had hospital staff chasing him and the police finally found this 6'2\\" guy in a dumpster crying in fear. After a couple days he was back to himself but since that time his doctors have treated him like he is crazy. They told him after that first attempt at treatment that he wasn't able to handle treatment, was too far gone and was terminal. He was given 8-12 months to live. He now sees a pain specialist to manage pain and is on a maintenance drug (the generic of which is \\" ama something\\" sorry). My sister and he are both resigned to his death. They adopted a little boy after Ron became clean and sober and Christopher is now 8. Ron is a jewel. We live in Boise ID and I am feeling desperate to find him some additional medical help and answers. His genotype is 1a. Isn't there someone that can help him, or something that can be done?

However even sadder is the face that people who do receive treatment for it mainly in the form of interferon might not improve at all. If the patient like Ron who looks to be in decompensated liver cirrhosis wont even qualify for the interferon treatment. At Ron's stage symptomatic treatment is all that is aimed at including anti Hepatic encephalopathy measures.

The behaviours and thinking patterns could be because of many reasons. He needs a thorough assessment to see if there is a problem and it can be helped or not. A reality check though.....these kind of long standing patterns of behaviours and thinking (I am guessing that they are long standing) will take a long time to \\"change\\" as they are originally formed because of their early expereiences. So please do not any miracles to happen in a ziffy...it will take a long time and the rate of change will be slow. Also, the change, if at all it happens, will happen only with the co-operation of your dad. It would mean that he would need to believe that there is a need for him to change. If that realisation is there, half the battle is already won and if not, then there is a very hard task ahead for him as well as for his carers who want him to change i.e family like you. Both medicines and talking therapies may help, if there is a specific problem found after assessment but the actual treatment would depend on your and your dad's choice, availability of particular treatment in your area etc etc. Hope this helps. Good luck to both of you"},{"Patient":"I keep thinking about dying all the time it really scares me why do i do it ?? im really happy in general and only 26 ... is it just a phase does any1 else do this?","Doctor":"Hello. It appears to me that you are wondering why you have thoughts about dying when you are not depressed and are happy in general. You might have to describe your thoughts about dying in more details - 1) Do these thoughts intrude into your mind even when you don;t want them? 2) Since when do you have this problem? 3) Have you ever been diagnosed with Depression, or had similar thoughts in the past? 4) What are the exact thoughts? Do you visualize or imagine how you will die or attempt self harm? If you do not have symptoms such as sadness of mood, loss of interest, sleep disturbances, irritability, etc., you may not be depressed. Take care.

I blocked it out of my memory until after I as 30. I have raised two normal, healthy adult married sons. I am now a 58 year old man who still suffers from feelings of being completely inadequate, unmanly, unmasculine and have rarely felt like I was one of the guys. I knew the moment that it happened that I was pathetic because I compared my physical size at that age to a full grown man. I have at times craved being with a man so much that I have had sex with them, only to feel a thousand times more depressed and pathetic even to the point of suicide . I lift weights, swim, and look fantastic. I have a full beard and have no effeminate characteristics. But inside I feel worthless, just as I did that night when I as ten years old. I ve taken every antidepressant available. I ve talked with counselors who only changed the subject when I told them I as molested. I ve struggled over whether I m gay, but I love having sex with my wife. This has ruled all of my life. I ve prayed and continue to pray for help. Maybe someone has something to say besides a simple hang in there or I ll pray for you or accept it that you are gay . I d like some healing , not platitudes.","Doctor":"This is extremely helpful largely because you have taken me seriously and didn't just dismiss me because I haven't been able to put this behind me.  I suppose I haven't known the difference between counselors and psychotherapiests.  My insurance is changing this month, so I'll look into that as soon as it takes effect.  I remember vividly that when he had me place my little hand around his penis, I was struck immediately at how huge it was and how it was surrounded by hair.  I was only ten and didn't know anything about what happened when a boy grew up.  So, I was only acquainted with my child-sized penis without any pubic hair.  I couldn't put my hand all the way around it and I was simply amazed at how big he was. He was many years older than me. And then my mind immediately focused on how very small I was and how I didn't have any hair.  I felt weak, small and that I wasn't a real guy.  I knew in that moment that I was a worthless piece of shit and had no basis to believe that I would ever be anything else except a worthless piece of shit.  So, even when puberty arrived, and it arrived late, I compared myself to the strongest and biggest boys in the locker room, always realizing again that I was worthless.  I developed a fetish over body hair and facial hair, since I didn't develope very much and it seemed that all of the boys I wished I was like were hairy.  My beard came in extremely late ... late 20's.  I never had any confidence to play sports and always believed that no girls would want me.  I didn't marry until I was 28 and only then did I stop being a virgin, except that I had sex many times with other guys out of fear and intimidation about women.  I feared greatly that my wife would compare my penis to other men she had been with and still think that she probably wishes she was with one of her former lovers.  Realistically, I'm taller than average, much better looking than average, far better shape than average and have at least an average sized penis.  But all of those facts are swamped by that event and the subsequent events so many years ago.  My father never told me he was proud of me and hardly ever spent any time with me.  He never taught me how to play any sports or encouraged me in any way towards anything that would build me up.  My mother smothered me and acted and talked like I was helpless.  Today, I seem to crave having someone tell me that I'm good at something.  Any kind of compliment sends me over the top.  I crave the attention of \\"manly men\\".  I work out and swim almost every day, but all along hope that some \\"real\\" guy will be my friend.  Most pop-shrinks would simply label me as gay and tell me to leave my wife and find a lover.  But I don't think that is really at the heart of it all.  I have a massive hole in my heart from the damage done and by the lack of any real nurturing by my father.  I just don't know if there is any resolution to this.  Is my misery my lot in life or is there any possibility of anything better?  How can psychotherapy change how I view myself?"},{"Patient":"mymother repeats her own sentences 7/8 times till she dont get satisfaction what is the disease my mother repeats her own sentences 7/8 times till she dont get satisfaction what is the disease","Doctor":"Hi!

Is that a problem? If so is it a physicaly problem or physcological?","Doctor":"Thanks for your query to HealthcareMagic.Based on your description, it appears that when you tend to get angry, you hyperventilate (increase in the number of breaths per minute with your breaths becoming short and quick) . Your feeling of strong tingly numbness throughout the body could possibly be due to hyperventilation. Some of the other common symptoms which people usually report with this are- dryness of mouth, tremors of hand, sweating in the palm and/forehead, palpitation,and giddiness.If you come to an understanding that you do tend to hyperventilate when angry, do the following-- Relaxation and breathing exercises. If you are into Yoga, Sawashana and Anulom-Vilom can be handy.- Anger management can be done through meditation. It appears that you might be into meditation as you seem to suppress your anger more than other people.

I don t know what is going on PLEASE HELP ME! =[ *tears* i over eat. i over sleep","Doctor":"Dear Linika, . Please don't blame your self for your condition. Our body constitution is genetically determined, even before we are born and there is limitation to what we can do to alter it. We have a center in the brain called satiety center, which determines when we should be feeling hungry. In kids like you, this center does not know when to stop and this makes us constantly hungry and this in turn adds to our weight. There are millions of kids like you all over the world and you are not the only one having this problem. What makes a difference is the STRONG WILL to limit food intake specially the ones we like most such as ice-creams, chocolates, deep fried items etc. It would be healthy if you could replace these things with fruits and vegetables and make special effort to move out and play and interact with your friends and if possible go for regular swimming. Even if you cannot follow all or some of these advise don't worry, but kindly do not skip classes in the school as they are extremely important in our life. Wishing you all the best."},{"Patient":"On an average sunny day i am tired, uninterested, calm, depressed. I don't care to do much more than the average and i am all around just living the day out.

This may or may not be true in this case, but then, how good or bad the person's quality of life during sunny days needs to be assessed. You may require a consultation with psychiatrist to assess your positive and negative symptoms that you experience on normal days to arrive at a diagnosis. Perhaps you are completely normal, or may be suffering from a mild depression that wanes off when its rainy and pleasant.."},{"Patient":"Hi all, My brother is having a psycological problem.

Anger is a natural reaction. In teenage and early twenties, it is quite common to get angry at even minor provocations. It is only with age, experience and maturity that we get control of our anger. The very fact that you wish to control your outbursts of anger is an excellent beginning.  Where there is a Will, there is certainly a Way. Whenever you feel angry, just turn away from the situation and try not to speak out. If you remain silent, the other person cannot continue to instigate you for long. Best way to control anger is through silence and not to respond to the provocations at all. By practicing silence you will soon appreciate your inner peace of mind and satisfaction, in avoiding an uncomfortable situation.

Based on your description, it seems that you are suffering as long as you can remember. So, there is no definite timeline of onset of your problems. To me, it appears that you might be suffering from mix of depression and anxiety which may be in the background of your personality (possibly shy, reserved, socially anxious). Alternatively, you might be suffering from low grade of depression (dysthymia). However, it will be helpful to rule out some medical condition which may cause or make your symptoms get worse such as thyroid problem, heart related conditions, medications for bronchial asthma such as theophylline etc. Once your family physician or local doctor has ruled out any medical condition which explains your problem, you can look for psychological help. You can start with self help programs- regular exercise, regular sleep routine, giving up tobacco, alcohol, tea, coffee (etc), meditation (if you like) and stress-reduction techniques. If symptoms doesn't improve, see your psychiatrist. You may require medication or psychotherapy or combination of both depending upon the assessment.

Dear, psychological problems are difficult to diagnose & treat. For example, in your case, antidepressants are not having good effects completely even after 2 months. I think your psychiatrist might had discussed this with you but again you need to be emphasized. In most cases, its your willpower & internal resistance which will help you. Most psychotropic drugs have delayed therapeutic effects. Antidepressants start their effect after 3-4 weeks and full effects take still longer. Meanwhile, side effects of a drug may cause insomnia (sleep problem) as in your case and may lead to non- or poor compliance. An antidepressant is usually evaluated for 8-12 weeks at full doses before stopping, if not having effect. I think you discuss your problem with your psychiatrist again-- you might require dose adjustment as well as short term addition of an anti-anxiety drug. Good luck."},{"Patient":"I was wondering if I was suffering from Schizophrenia, because I exhibit symptoms and behavior that I know just aren't normal.

I ve try lots of time but i can . I have difficle menstruation. I eat raw rice all dat long if i dont eat i can t sleep i even have get insomnia problems. the think is that i want to stop but how ?","Doctor":"Hi Vila, Thanks for trusting HealthCareMagic with your query. Your problem seems to be a very rare kind of addiction. Based on the information provided, it seems your are motivated to give up this addiction as you appear to understand the fact that it is hurting your body physically. It seems that you are struggling psychologically as well. I guess first and foremost, you should get yourself checked physically as raw rice can cause some physical issues and some of the problems of menstruation could be due to other unrelated/related issues. An opinion from physician or gynecologist might be helpful. Next comes the issue of addiction. I suppose one method could be to use Exposure and response prevention strategy. The basic principle would be to expose you to raw rice which will possibly induce the desire to eat it and then have someone stop you from eating it. During this process, you might experience significant restlessness and anxiety. If you are motivated enough and know relaxation techniques, try to be in this situation for approximately 90 minutes or when you feel your anxiety is wearing off without any additional help. You will realize that gradually the intensity of your craving is reducing and after sometimes start doing it yourself. You can take the help of a clinical psychologist in this process. The role of medication would be very limited. However, I believe consulting a psychiatrist to explore other psychological issues (if any) can be of further benefit. Hope this will be of some help.

It can be very distressing for the patient and confusing for the doctor, more so, when all the relevant investigations are normal.

A mother can go through the apparently traumatic child birth without much problem, while at other times, she may not be able to tolerate even a small injection.

Pachygyria was considered as a less severe form of agyria-pachygyria complex and had a broader spectrum of clinical features than agyria . In many cases, agyria and pachygyria coexist in the same patient. Although some of these disorders have a genetic basis, the cause of the migrational arrest is still unknown. Seizure and development delay are the most common presentations. These patients are always retarded in motor or intellectual function. The advent of CT and MRI have made the diagnosis of agyria-pachygyria during life possible. In addition to neuroimaging studies, EEG abnormalities are also helpful in the diagnosis of agyria-pachygyria These abnormalities in agyria-pachygyria described previously including generalized high amplitude fast activity, high amplitude sharp- and slow-wave complexes and an alternating pattern consisting of bursts of sharp waves alternating with periods of electrocerebral depression.

I appreciate your ability to analyse yourself so well and being able to pinpoint the problem area. It definitely is a step towards health living when we are able to realise our difficult areas and are willing to work on them. People working in the IT industry often have emotional difficulties due to their work routine , spending more time with the machine than with people and staying away from home when on projects..Its wonderful that you spend time excercising as its a good way to burn out ones agressive energies literally .. How long have you been having these symptoms...sleeplessness, lack of impulse control and anger issues ...Issues related to work and perfomance as you have mentioned as in expecting fast results and dealing with small faliures or setbacks could be personality based difficulties..I suggest you meet a clinical psychologist for a thorough assessment of your situation to identify if its resulting because of your traits or situation and if its a diagnosable condition like a depressive dsiorder or anxiety disorder. You may not require medication if your assessment shows the need for lifestyle and behaviour modification like anger and stress management but if there is a diagnosable condition then you may require medication which would assist you in seeking solutions to your difficulties. Please do let me know how you followed up on your case from here on... some tips: 1) recognise the physical signs your body shows before you get angry like feeling tension or faster breathing and remove yourself from the situation, drink a glass of water or go and wash your face...that would give you time to rethink 2) maintain good sleep hygine as in try and sleep at the same time everyday and stop watching tv or reading atleast 30 min before lying on ur bed..you could listen to soothing instrumental music..drink warm milk or take bath before going to bed. 3) Continue with your excercises and definitelu go in for a assessment with a psychologist All the Best Regards Smriti Sawhney clinical Psychologist RCI Reg no A-12344"},{"Patient":"Sir my wife is a psychiatric patient 5 times in 15 years try to commit suicide .4times she try to do murder also .

Usually there is some neurological injury that causes Dysarthria. Speech Therapy and Voice Treatments are usually the treatments of choice. If the cause of dysarthria is some temporary neurological deficit, then it makes sense to treat that deficit primarily. There are newer techniques and devices available these days. One example is the use of communication devices which help synthesize speech. You will get more information about this relevant to your area if you speak with a Speech Therapist. Hope this helps.

Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello Jay, You COULD be suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and these homicidal thoughts could be obsessions. In OCD, such obsessive thoughts are not uncommon; they are always intrusive and cause a lot of distress. Such thoughts occur as a result of chemical imbalance in the brain, hence you may be getting them despite having no intention to hurt anybody. Remember that getting the thoughts does not automatically mean that you will do something wrong. Is this the first time something like this is happening? Are you feeling an impulse to act out on the thoughts? Do you hear any voices (that other people cannot hear)? With more information, I can offer a more certain diagnosis, but OCD does seem likely. Whether this is OCD or something else, it can be treated. Please obtain a face-to-face psychiatric consultation as soon as possible.

My father in law is 73 years old and staying GK Delhi alonge with his wife aged 69.will you please tell me what is the problem with him and how it can be cured as the earliest? ajay agarwal","Doctor":"Dear Mr Agarwal, From the description here, it seems your father-in-law may be showing signs of Dementia (most probably Alzheimer's Disease) as well as BPSD (Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia). Dementia is a progressive condition of the brain. It involves loss of functions of a number of important brain areas and there is an over all reduction in the size of the brain, too. You may need to consult a Neurologist and a Psychiatrist. The combined approach will help him with the symptoms of Dementia as well as the behavioral problems. The clinical evaluation will help you and the doctors understand the severity of the condition and diagnose any additional problems. As mentioned above, Dementia is a progressive condition. This means the damage to the nerve cells in his brain (central nervous system) will be on going. There are a few medicines that can help him slow down the progress of the illness, but it is expected to progress further. You may need to make arrangements for a caretaker for him, as his wife is also aged, and may not be able to take care of him alone. It has been a common observation that the caretakers of Dementia and BPSD patients show signs of burn-out frequently. I hope this helps a bit. And I wish you good luck with the process. Please let us know if you need more help. Take care.

It is clear that you have been worrying a lot, and the rapid beating of the heart and increased BP could be related to anxiety itself. There are three points that are important here - 1. You felt better after the doctor gave you medicines for tension. What was the name of the medicine? Why did you stop taking it? 2. What exactly were the 'balance ear problems' for which the doctor gave you an injection? 3. Is it correct that your menses stopped after you began treatment from the psychiatrist? I find this a bit surprising because medicines used to treat anxiety do not affect menses, but some other medicines do. What medicines were you prescribed? In my opinion, you do not seem to have any serious problem. Please provide more details so I can try to help further.

Please tell how i get rid this thing.","Doctor":"Hello. Clonotril needs to be tapered off gradually. One should not abruptly stop using this drug, as it can lead to withdrawal effects, as you might have experienced. You can take two tablets of 0.5mg each to start with. And if you break each tablet into 4 parts, there will be a total of 8 parts of 0.125mg each. Now, a safe plan is to reduce one part every 4 days, or you can plan to reduce two parts every 7 days. At this pace, you will be able to taper off Clonotril over 4 weeks. If you want, you can extend the taper period from 4 weeks to 6 weeks. Another method for the taper is to combine Clonotril with Diazepam (Calmpose/Valium), reduce Clonotril first, and then reduce Diazepam gradually. For this, you will have to discuss with your doctor and get it prescribed. You can choose either of the plans. But the idea is to gradually reduce the dose of Clonotril so that the body gets used to less and less amounts of the drug and there are no withdrawal effect. Hope this helps.

Based on your symptoms, you may need to consider a few things in addition to a possible hormone imbalance. Four and a half months is a significant duration now. And if these bouts of crying are affecting your life in a significant way, you could consider the possibility of a Depressive Disorder. And the depression can come from hormonal imbalance including thyroid hormones, stress, significant life events or idiopathic (without an identifiable cause). You may also have to check whether this is a seasonal occurrence (Seasonal Affective Disorder). Low functioning thyroid gland can lead to a condition called Hypothyroidism, which presents as sadness, lethargy, weight gain, etc. With Estrogen increase, we usually expect some physical changes in addition to the mood changes. Physical changes include bloating, headaches (common), swelling of hands and feet, etc. Over all, if sadness of mood is not your primary symptoms, you may be able to say that there could be a physical reason for your symptoms. You may have to visit your GP and get some blood work done. Hope this helps.

Sometimes I get urges to just start crying for no reason and I get suddenly tense and anxious about small things before realising nothings wrong. My general low mood comes and goes, sometimes I forget about it for a while but then it comes back.

I read your detail written and I just came to the conclusion that you have severe anxiety with obssesive compulsive disorder. First thing I would like to tell there is no relation with all this thing with your delivery period. When a lady is getting normal pain then she will deliver the child normally. that time the doctor cut the peritonial portion as because to prevent the uneven laceration at the time baby head coming out with a force. a little cut will make the way better. it is called episiotomy i.e. incision of perinial portion to prevent lacerated injury from the birth. it is quite normal. the clot inside the woomb never make such sereous complication. a clot in a blood vessles can make any harm ful health issue by blocking . it is not like any clot inside uterus after delivery will give you any complication. so  dont be panic at all. if you would like can consult to any psichiatric for further consultation. if you would like for any alternative system of treatment for your anxiety and OCD then homeopathy is best."},{"Patient":"why do i act crazy on the odd occassion then feel depressed for long periods afterwards?

Weather he is suffering from depression or not depends on various symptoms like how is his sleep, appetite, mood, energy levels, attention concentration etc etc etc......he will need a full psychiatric assessment. From what you have explained, it seems he will not consult a psychiatrist. The following are the options in no particular order of preference 1. Keep trying to make him see the sense in going for an assessment so that \\"both of you could be assessed\\"...make sure that he understands you are suffering as well and may be if he comes there may be something that you may change in how you are etc etc etc....trying anything not to make him think its only him. Keep at it for long and atleast to get rid of your \\"nagging\\" he may come once......but I dont see much long term benefit in this. 2. consult a general physician...both of you...who knows and deals with psychiatric problems...that may be more acceptable to your husband 3. ask him if he would be ok to talk to a psychiatrist online....there are expert specialist services available on this site where you can have a psychaitrist consult via chat and that may reduce the stigma even further to your husband. Keep insisting that it is for both of your assessment...which truly it should be....and then only for an initial assessment keep talking to him about not just medicines that help but also talking therapies...or better use counselling rather than therapies word...to make it more palatable to him Finally, in some countries, there is still a practise of covert administration of medication...i.e giving medicine without someone's knowledge. This will depend on the legalities involved and the best practise of that country. Hope this helps. Good Luck to both of you."},{"Patient":"What is the best way to Relax or get rid of stress?

But before you go and see a psychiatrist, please go and see a good physician to rule out physical causes of insomnia. If there are no stresses in life and there are no environmental conditions like noise or heat in the room or light coming from outside, or you doing stimulating things like video games etc during nights or taking stimulants like tea/coffe/coke/smoking/stimualnt drugs like cocaine etc, then there is no reason why you should be having such a severe isnomnia, except that you may primary insomnia (i.e insomnia which is not secondary to any other reason) for which you may need extensive (and yes expensive as well) sleep tests. If you are able to keep yourself safer, than no problem in trying out any system of medication to see if it helps as some of allopathic sleeping medication like alprazolam (alprax). daizepam, temazepam etc are all highly addictive. But if you need quick solution so that you can be safe, given the fact that you are already having suicidal thoughts, please go first to a physician and if that does not help in few days, go for a psychiatric consultation. Please ask one of your family members to hold all medications and other dangerous thigns with which you can hurt yourself under lock and key and if necessary, if the thoughts are so severe, for them to be with you day and night so that you can be kept safe till you are ok again. This will be needed only for a short period of time, as I am sure that you will recover with two - three nights of good sleep.

This is just an educated guess since the antidepressant compund in SJW has not been isolated so we don't know if that has withdrawal symptoms if stopped suddenly but I think this should be a ok enough guess. It could also be due to unresolved pain symptoms and hence if the pain is chronic and sub clinical you would probably not feel it so severe to go for pain killers but would be so irritating as to make you feel irritable and angry and moody....here I speak both from personal experience of chronic pain and as a professional. I would suggest you check out with your doctor first about interactions of SJW with your current drugs. If you are a female, then we know for sure that it interacts with the pill. There may be other unknown interactions also.

Anxiety is always about fear and hence you need to know what is the fear about. Also you say you have this only when your daughter is away but also say that you are constantly worrying. If both of these are true, then that means you are having what we call \\"anticipatory anxiety\\" i.e you are worried thinking about the anxiety you are going to have once you are alone. Behavioural activation...i.e keeping yourself busy with lot of activity is one of the best self help methods that helps depressed people but here your problem appears to be mainly worry/anxiety. I would suggest that you follow the recommendations in the above two replies,if your problems are not too severe/not having much effect on your social/family/occupational life and you are not too distressed. Yoga/meditation might also help. But if the severity is high/its affecting your life too much/if you are too distressed, please contact a psychiatrist for appropriate assessment and treatment.

I was perfectly fine that night, I was with my sister, I remember everything that happened, it was all just fine. When I woke up in the morning, I noticed a few freaky things happened, that I did in my sleep (I sleep walk occasionally). But it kinda freaked me out for some reason, I don t know why. My sister is sick with a chest cold so she is in bed sleeping. I start to feel VERY VERY depressed,. for no reason at all. I usually get very depressed during the winter , but this was EXTREME, like, it jsut popped out of nowhere, like BAM! And it scared me! I ran to wake up my sister, almost in tears , asking her to help me, and I was depressed for no reason, and its getting really bad. She told me to go watch some TV to get my mind of it. I did, but then, my mind started to wander, and I started thinking I was going crazy, and I was gonna loose it, I then started getting all hot and feverish, and my heart was beating really fast, and I was pacing around, crying, and I was just scared of loosing my mind. Because If i loose my mind I cant go to school anymore, Ill loose my friends, my relationship wont work out, and ill loose everything I have. Then the anxiety attack finally settled in. My brother came in, and said he always gets them, but sense it was my first, and I did all that stuff yesterday it was severe. he gave me his anxiety medication, thats suppose to relax your body and make you fall asleep. My body was definitely relaxed, couldn t keep my eyes open, but I was just laying there, crying, complaining about how I m going nutts. After a few hours it ended. But now, 3 days later, (I m very sick now, with the chest cold) every time I think about the attack, my temperature rises and my heart beat accelerates, and I begin feeling VERY depressed, like I m about to snap. Once again. Now, I m just VERY scared, and fear for my mental health. I don t want to loose my mind. Please, please help. One more thing, the night before the attack, I spoke to my sister about my childhood traumas.

If you want to know how you can minimize psychological effects of masturbation, you have to first clear any doubts in your mind about the widespread myth that masturbation is bad for physical health. Once you are able to reduce the anxiety about any bad physical effects, you will be able to focus on working on the anxiety related to any psychological concerns. Irrespective of age, false information about effects of masturbation can lead to unnecessary anxiety. First of all, you need to work on any guilt related to masturbation. There is no reason you should harbor the guilt. If you are not causing any trouble to anyone in the society, masturbation is a natural process. You also need to avoid attaching too much pleasure feelings to masturbation, as it may lead to a few problems in sexual performance in future. The problems are not related to any physical weakness. They are due to the habitual pleasure seeking via masturbation. I hope this reply helps you a bit. Please write back if you need more information.

Decrease sensation of the penis - can be due to infection, diabetes, spinal injury, recent masturbation 2. Stress due to work or family related, night duties 3. Depression 4. Varicocele 5.

To you the experiences are real. That is all that matters. 60% of people hear voices or see things that others can not experience atleast once in their life. This is a proven fact. The only difference is that your experiences are persisting for long time and are troubling you. The best thing to do is to get professional help. It could be that the most simple thing could be  the answer to your problem, like talking about stress that you are experiencing at home or at school or with friends, or stopping the occasional pot or marijuana that you may be doing or whatever. I am just guessing all the simple things that could help you with these things apart from the notion that you are going crazy. Do consult a psychiatrist. There are lots of reversible causes that may cause experiences like these. And we can help in all of them. Half the battle is already won that you are seeking help for the experiences.

If you have shivering because of any physical condition such as fever, you need to see a physician for diagnosis and treatment. Shivering could also mean tremors, muscle twitches or jerks.

I always had some kind of problems from my childhood and i consult a psychologist after then a psychiatrist at the age of 18-20 [i cannot recall the exact year]. I easily forget and i am unable to understand what is happening with me, like what is real and what is unreal. I used to think i have extra ordinary powers, like i can fly, some kind of power releasing from my eyes or body and a problem staring eyes. I stared at a woman in a feast at a church, i was unable to take my eyes from her, my brain was so free-zed and some friends helped me, pushed me to get out from that place. I saw a flash light when i close and open my eyes, like when we take picture using a camera. I was unable to move my body, unable to move my legs or hands to get away my eyes from her. I was cursed for that, nobody understood what was happening with me. I was staring at all woman and suddenly i heard a voice asking me to suicide . I wanted to jump in front of train and suicide but somehow i reach a meditation center, i spent few days there. I felt like i am St.George and i still have many thoughts like that. After a few days i start to stare at both woman and men, i stare at legs, i still cant help myself, so i don t appear in any public places. I tried to wear sunglasses but nothing helped me. I always hear people talking to me, i see them like i watching a movie, i talk to them continuously all day and night. I had frightening dreams while taking pills . Some times they curse me and ask me to suicide. I consult another doctor and he said it is something F20 psychosis . What is it? Is it anything related to schizophrenia? I am still having the problem for last 10 or more years, hearing voices of people, i see them, staring problem and also i see objects that are not really there. Like i see someone standing in a place but when i ask to my friends if you see him, they say they don t see it. l was unable to continue my education because i was unable to concentrate when i hear people talking to me, asking me to run out from the class rooms, also staring at people to their private parts or legs was a big problem as society doesn t accept it and many stay away from me. I was alone and i was isolated, i am working from home for a living, i am unable to understand whats happening with me, what is real and what is unreal. At present i am taking Sizodon Plus[Resperidone and Trihexyphenidyl Hydrochloride Tablets] before i took Palido OD 6 [paliperidone extended tablets]. Also, i took many other medicines, but nothing is helping me. Can anyone help me to know whats happening with my eyes? Is it anything related to schizophrenia?

This code is used in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) version 10. Your symptoms do suggest that you are suffering from Schizophrenia. Your eyes are not the problem, but the thoughts, delusion and hallucination make it appear as if there is some problem with the eyes.

So, he is always busy in his phone and laptop, but many times he sees some movies, songs etc., in laptop till night 12 or 1 am, And for some reasons he now started to fight and he is in depression , he pinpoints others for that in some other way........ my kids are getting worried because of this and me too","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand you are under a lot of stress at present. When one partner doesn't appear to be fulfilling his share of responsibility in the family, the other partner is bound to feel the extra pressure of managing the house and the kids. And so, the situation does appear difficult. Your husband is probably under some stress himself. If he is watching movies and listening to songs late in the night, he is obviously worrying about something, and the movies and songs are acting as a temporary escape from the worries. He may in fact be depressed, as mentioned by you. Getting irritate often and on little matters is a common finding when a person is depressed. Apart from your husband's possible depression, you also need to consider relationship issues. The communication between you and your husband may not be going that well these days. That's why, frequent arguments and fights can erupt when each other's comments are misinterpreted due to a break down in communication. Hence, you should handle this problem from two aspects - 1) Your husband's possible depression and stress, and 2) The relationship. For things to improve, you need to talk. Both of you need to acknowledge that there is a problem somewhere. And if you can do that, the next step would be to find out what you can do to correct the situation. But for that to happen, both of you should decide \\"together\\" that you want to improve the relationship and take care of any stressful matters. In other words, both of you should set a \\"common goal\\". There is no sense in blaming each other for what is happening now. Blaming will not help you solve the problem anyways. Also, you must also acknowledge that even you might be a little depressed or stressed out. And it is possible that the arguments and fights are the responsibility of both of you. Talk to you husband and tell him that you want things to improve. Ask him if he can devote some time, let's say an hour or two, so that both can discuss the matter and decide what to do about it. I am sure he will agree. Please let me know what you think. There is no quick solution, but there is definitely a way out. You just need to decide together as a team.

Hope I have not confused you more! One word of caution though on Internet and self diagnosis....... believe me, diagnosis is definitely not just about ticking a check list of criteria. You can probably tick weather you have some biological symptoms like lack of appetite, disturbed sleep etc but when it comes to qualitative symptoms like anhedonia, blunted affect, tangential thinking etc etc etc.....you better leave these to professionals. Experience does count for something, in every profession. Hope you take my answer in the right spirit.

Doing yoga may help you to calm yourself so that you are not so sensitive/emotional to events that are disturbing you (like your friend's affecting you) Mindfulness sessions help by changing the way you think/react emotionally to events/people/relations/happenings in the world. Anger management or Aggression control courses help you to change your behaviour in many ways for ex channelling your emotions constructively etc CBT (cognitive behaviour therapy) can help you by making you think about your thoughts, feelings, actions an their interrelationships Hobbies like music or physical exercises like cycling help you feel happy in yourselves there by diverting your anger Breathing techniques help you by stopping you from acting on the intensse surge of emotion/anger that you feel when faced with events, thus stopping you from \\"behaving\\" or acting on emotions at their height and giving you time to think clearly.

If you have tolerated and benifitted from it for two years and now are unable to get it, then first evaluate the need to continue it. If your psychiatrist feels you still need an antidepressant two years after being well, then ask him if he could change it to any other available SSRI type antidepressants. This may help as all of them act in the same way. If stopping it is thought to be the best option to take, DO NOT STOP SUDDENLY.

I wonder what you would do knowing a \\"virginity test\\"? Perform it on a girl to be your wife/partner/girlfriend? Will she agree? What kind of a relation will that be that starts on a test which breaks the very trust on which both of you are going to start a relation on? Why can you not ask about what you are worried direct, if that's so much important to you? And if you think the answer will not be truthful, how can you trust her with your life? Think about not just one step Farhan, think about the next 10-12 steps, not only yours, but also the other person's. Is this how you want your most closest relative in this world and life to remember how you started a relation? With utter lack of trust? I hope this atleast starts a train of thought in your mind.

I am experiencing lack of energy and would like to reduce my dosage to 5mg per day to reduce the side effect. Would this have an adverse effect?","Doctor":"Hi Escitalopram (Lexapro) is one of the SSRI group of drugs which have tiredness as one of the side effects. But, majority of the patients these are transient i.e they go away if you continue to take the tablets, usually in 2-3 weeks of time. So, I generally advice my patients to try and tolerate the side effects till the side effects go away, if possible. This is because a. one week is very small period for the anxiety to be helped with and b. you may need more than the 10mg dose. If the side effects are not tolerable, then you may go down to 5mg and wait the 3-4 weeks and then increase it to 10mg and so on. This helps to reduce the side effect burden but prolongs the treatment period. Finally the aim is to achieve the \\"therepeutic dose\\" i.e the dose which helps your symptoms/problems with as least a problematic journey as possible. So, yes you can cut it down to 5mg but do it under your psychiatrist's guidance please. Good Luck"},{"Patient":"Hello. I eat my own hair follicles and pieces of dead skin on my scalp.

You can also use baking soda, but dissolve only Â¼ teaspoon. 3.Eat small portions of raw condiments such as clove and cinnamon. Doing so can give you temporarily relief from metallic taste. 4.When you brush your teeth, make sure to brush the tongue area.

These are what we call as \\"psychosocial perpetuating factors\\" So, if your social/functional/occupational life is being disturbed by this excessive crying or it is causing distress to either you or your family.............then you need to seek help.

Unless this has been a repetitive pattern of behaviour on your part when the mental health team are entitled to do what you are doing since the tablets, as you might well know by now, can be mis-utilised.

It would be considered best practise in the western or developed world to use the rating scale but again an experienced clinician might need none. Based on the fact that you are able to process information quite well (differential diagnoses like OCD etc being mentioned), communicate so well in written language etc suggests to me that it might not be you who has been diagnosed with the Asperger's syndrome but someone related to you.

Specially things which is not under my control and thoughts which worry me ?","Doctor":"The usual and best remedy for this is in the past....read only those books that you are interested in i.e do not take up studies which you are not interested in and most of the times, this helps. But if your studies are in the field that you are interested in (which differs from the field that you may have chosen for a variety number of other reasons) and still this is affecting you, then you need to find out why you are thinking of so many other things this could be due  to social problems (like not having enough money to feed the family whilst spending time instead of earning a livelihood) which could/could not be helped by you or due to psychological problems (lack of attention is a common feature in many of the mental health problems like depression, psychosis, mania etc) So, finally it will be upto you to decide what is the cause of you lack of focus and act accordingly. Apparently, yoga and meditation help to increase focus and concentration so you may try them."},{"Patient":"I think I may have an an EDNOS eating disorder..

From the brief history you have given it seems you do have a eating problem....your age, your apparent intelligence (15 years old self diagnosing with EDNOS), your gender, your life phase transition/maturation problems, all seem to support this......but weather they are significant enough or broad enough to be given a diagnostic label needs a thorough history taking.

I ve become very short-tempered, I get irritated very quickly, I ve also become too lethargic than ever, I ve lost interest in almost everything, except food.

But, if you are not getting enough sleep because of working night shifts and doing household work during the days, then it could be simply because of this....it could be the way your body reminding you that it is chronically not getting enough recharge. If this is the case a simple shift in your priorities during day time or a shift in the working times if this is possible, can help you.

There are many reasons why you could be experiencing these things and as the medical student above has answered schizophrenia is one but only one of the many reasons. The most common reason, if this is a experience which is not repeating again and again,and if this is occuring just before or after sleep, is something which occurs in many \\"normal\\" people...called hypnogogic or hypnopompic hallucinations...our jargon for these experiences. Other reasons could be doing illicit drugs like cannabis cocaine etc, going through a severe bereavement (where very near or dear ones have died--though in your case it does not look like it) or having depression or mania or severe stress etc. Again, the advice is GO SEE A PSYCHIATRIST"},{"Patient":"Gud Morning, I want to know the why am I losing appetite, distaste for food, hair-loss and unexplained bruises.

It makes our social interactions poor. Evaluate yourself what makes you feel inferior. Personal reason like, overweight, not looking good, feeling that you are unattractive might make you feel inferior. You may feel that people are thinking you unattractive. Do not think you have poor image. Talk to the close people and discuss your feeling. They might suggest whether your feelings are right or wrong.  Do not expect to be perfect and be thankful to the GOs with what He has given. There are plenty of books on personality growth and especially on how to improve self esteem. These are helpful. You can even get Psychologist help and discuss your feeling and he/she will motivate and you tell you the tips.

I have been on antibiotics before although it keeps coming back. I am currently really worried about it because I cough up alot of phlem. It always feel asif I have to clean my throat. I also had a lump on my inner thigh For wich I got antibiotics as well as medication to thin my blood. Since the antibiotics the lump has gone down. The swelling is down and the redness is gone. It doesnt hurt as much and the pain is going away. A couple of months ago I started having severe pain in my upper right back shoulder. Went to the GP quit a couple of times although they felt that there was nothing wrong with me. Did only regular check ups and blood tests. Since then I went to a Phisiotherapist and that really helped alot. The pain in my back is much better. I sometimes feel as if i am paranoid and stressed out about everything. I constantly worry about my health. I drink garlic everynight and cinnamon every morning. If i feel a tingle in my body I stress about it. I dont know if some of my conditions and symptoms are commonly just because i think about it all day. For example, i know i have bad sinusses and a constant drip but when I cough up phlem it feels like I start to think that maybe I have lung cancer.

Try some relaxation techniques like Yoga, meditation, and deep breathing exercises. Dealing with worries is also one technique; like learning postponing worries, and learning to accept uncertainty in your life. If nothing works there are some medications which reduce sympathetic activity, like propranolol.

It’s a good practice, helps to calm your mind and release happy and stress bursting enzymes. Having 2 to 3 times a week is not an issue, more than that is also not an issue, but needs adequate nutrition and exercise which will be difficult to fulfil. Ways to reduce Masturbation 1. Sex education 2. Physical exercises 3. Sleep adjustment 4. Quality of sleep 5. Healthy and balanced diet 6. Programming for leisure time 7. Development of spirituality 8.

I have read so many negative things about BPD and relationships. Is there hope for our relationship or will i continue to hurt her? I am scared to lose her but dont want to hurt her over and over again.","Doctor":"in BPD there will be intense infactuation and attraction toward the the opposite sex quiet frequently and there will be feeling alone and not cared by others. and this fact lead to extramarital relationship. there is recurrent thought of suicide, and impulsivity. but there are positive aspect like you can be centre of attraction easily and. if work is involved with sensation ,you can do it in better way. main thing you have to take care is to channelise your energy, and keep yourself busy and dont let negative thing creep into your mind."},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety along with minor OCD . I am on anti-depressants and they work ok, however things always get worse after I masterbate. Whenever I ejaculate, I always notice a great increase in my anxiety and in my depression. And the increase usually lasts a couple of day before I get back to normal. I see a therapist but have been too embarrased to ask. How is my ejaculating making things worse, I have often wondered if I have a chemical or hormonal imbalance..","Doctor":"During ejaculation sympathetic system is active. It is a normal process which happens to everybody. It is the same system which makes you run when you see a snake or when a dog is chasing you. So your heart beat increases and your breathing also becomes faster. Palpitations are a normal reaction during the climax of the sexual cycle (during ejaculation). When you worry about the palpitations then the anxiety increases. (That is because palpitations are a sign of anxiety and you are anxious about the anxiety itself). You end-up in an endless loop of increasing anxiety and palpitations. So next time you get palpitations, just tell yourself, \\"This is a normal reaction\\" and observe the heart beat closely - you will find that it immediately slows down."},{"Patient":"Do people slip back into depression after they are taken off an anti-depressant?

Head banging can also develop as a sleep ritual if the head banging occurs as the child falls asleep. Treating childhood habits that do not interfere with everyday functioning is often unnecessary because many habits remit spontaneously over time. However, if the habit is causing the child and/or family members distress, social isolation, or physical injury, a therapeutic intervention may be required. Behavior therapy is the mainstay in the treatment for children with habit behaviors. Effective behavioral therapies for habits include the following:   Habit reversal: This is the most consistently effective way to treat presenting habits in children because of its brevity, immediacy, efficacy, durability, flexibility, and consistency.

Sexual drive, like other basic drives for food, water, safety, etc., is recurrent and tends to occupy the person's mind till it is satisfied. Since social sanctions, health risks and emotional hazards all militate against sexual activity with another person before marriage, the most common way out is through masturbation. This gives relief, but only for the time being. Like other drives/appetites, this also crops up anew after some time and demands to be attended to and satisfied. While masturbation, even when repeated and regular,is no way equal to sex with another person, it definitely slakes sexual the thirst for sex on a periodical basis. This is a great help, as it allows to person not only to keep his sexual activity from going out of control, but also allows him to concentrate on his routine life and carry out his work without undue distraction. Preoccupation with sex, especially concerning someone you have so much contact with for several years without full sexual activity, is quite natural.

Every one born in this world begins with biryh and ends with death. The duration of the life is dependent on the life style you live. A healthy environment will usually give you a long life. Ageing is also a process which can be controlled to a certain extent by your habits and life style. One who has healthy habits, does regular exercise. eats healthy food , avoids all intoxicants like alcohol, smoking and chewing tobacco will be able to delay the process of ageing but cannot avoid it. Someone in your family or friends must have died prematurely and that may be due to some comon disease like diabetes, or heart attack or cancer and this must have affected you.

While black seed is widely used as a cure for many ailments, its interactions with most medications have not yet been fully studied. Black seed (nigella sativa) is known to lower blood pressure, so combining it with Lisinopril is something to be tested extremely carefully first. I suggest that as you continue taking your recommended dose of Lisinopril, you should keep track of your blood pressure measuring. If the measurements you get are not satisfactory, then you can try and add very low amounts (like half a teacup per day) of the boiled black seed and see if and how much it affects your blood pressure. Keeping a diary with all the BP measurements for easier comparison is a good way to do this. And of course, making amends to your diet, exercise regime and lifestyle is quintessential.

I can't say , without asking more questions, as to why your hair roots pain. Is there any swelling or infection at the site of hair roots visible? Any boils, any exudate? Just to assess in case any infection is there. Any dandruff? Any excessive use of chemicals, styling creams, frequent change of shampoos, any harsh procedures on hair.Any of these should be controlled to minimum limits or not to be done. High protein diet and vit c will help a lot.HCM is there to help you. First if all stop using soap and shampoo on hair for sometime. Use Fuller's earth ( called multani mitti in South Asia) to wash hair. Let dry. Rinse with plain water. Let hair dry. If you get Neeli Bhringyadi Hair Oil ( Ayurveda) somehow you can get a lot of benefits. It's not very common. Second priority is Amla oil ( hair oil prepared with Indian gooseberry), 3rd priority is Almond oil, 4th priority is any vegetable oil/ coconut oil/ Himalya's anti hair fall oil.When hair are dried, massage hair roots/ hair gently with fingers for long periods. Then do hot fomentation by covering head with towel dipped in hot water and squeezed. Be careful while dipping and squeezing towel in HOT water. Let it cool naturally.Rinse hair after 2-3 hrs or after overnight, with plain water. If can't tolerate the odour of oils, may use mild herbal shampoo from Himalya (anti hair fall) preferably. Also use gentle protein conditioner. All the above may be done at least once a week. Initially weak hair may fall in excess, which otherwise would also fall, but do not worry.Orally embic powder should be taken but its not so palatable. May take Amla capsule thrice a day to give strength to hair roots.Hope it helps you."},{"Patient":"I had sex with my bf on 27th May.. I tk emergency contraceptive pills on 28th May..

In the morning, remove the garlic clove and throw it in the toilet.One night's treatment may be enough to kill the infection.Continue one or two days until all itchiness is gone.You can also eat yoghurt as this has proven to be effective in such cases.Since your genital area is inflammed and  painful, sitting in warm water (in a bathtub or sitz bath, not a hot tub) may help. Or instead, you may try putting a cool, damp cloth on the area. Do not rub to try to relieve itching.Use loose cotton cloth undergarments.Hope the suggestions give could be useful in eradicating the infection."},{"Patient":"what can i do here at hom to stop the tetany in my fingers and toes? very painful and cant sleep, what could be causing this? never mind should have known, doctors are all about the money and ths is not in my budget, wow wouldn t it be a better world if you put your God given talents to use to actually help people in need?","Doctor":"This involuntary muscle movement and spasm can be eased by hot water bath or dipping the related part in hot water( prefer mixed with salt) for hot fomentation.

Terrible experience.  Met an OBGYN who recommended testing my hormones and told  me to get off of the Zoloft after one week.  Unfortunately hormones came out normal but we decided to try natural progesterone the second half of my menstural cycle.  Started at 15mg.  Second month they increased it to 30mg.  The month when I started the increased dose I started having intrustive thoughts about myself and my kids.  My other symptoms were cloudy thinking, tired, feeling claustrophobic, impatient with others.  I used the 30mg dose until January or February 2011 until I started feeling more sensitive vaginally and on my breasts.  It was a very uncomfortable feeling so I decreased my dose back down to 15mg.  Intrusive thoughts have improved and was seeing a behavioral therapist for awhile who treated me for depression.  I stay at home with my kids and have for 3 years. I met with a Naturopath MD in July 2011 because I was afraid of using an antidepressant again after my experience with Zoloft.  She put me on some tinctures to balance out my hormones, not add any and also a tincture for Adrenal fatigue.  I have felt better but the intrusive thoughts have not disappeared.  It varies month to month but typically happens around the same time of the month.  If it's truly all hormonal then I guess I have to take one month at a time, but I do not like it.  What else can it be? and what naturally can I do about it?

If it is viral then salt water gargles, lozenges and drinking plenty of water will help. If it is bacterial like strep you will need antibiotics. Unfortunately you must see a physician to make the diagnosis. Since you have asthma it is definitely safer to see a doctor and not try home remedies.

Doctor, did I tear a muscle, if so how do I treat it @ home?when can I continue my weight lifting? Thanks","Doctor":"Hello,This is Dr. Papaqako asnwering your question.Most probably you have a muscle strain. If I was your caring doctor, I would recommend:1) Apply ice the first 2 days, then heat locally. 2) Take pain killers regularly for 5-7 days (For example Ibuprofen 400-600 mg every 8 hours).3) Apply an analgesic gel topically for about 3-4 times/day.It will need some days so you wont have much pain. Start moving gradually for as much as you dont have pain. Total immobilization is not recommended. When pain do not bother you anymore start moving the arm in all movements that the other arm does, so it wont remain stiff.Complete healing, and you being able to start your weight lifting, will need 4-6 weeks.Hope this helps,Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr. I am a 38 year old mother of 2 who has suffered from hemmorhoids during my pregnancies and since.

This helps to improve blood circulation. Have warm foods like jaggery which are also a source of iron. If non-vegetarian, have meat and chicken preferrably with lots of black pepper which makes it spicy and increases body heat. Keep yourself warm and sleep well at night. Disturbed night sleep also causes irregular cycles. Stay active throughout the day and avoid worrying too much as it will increase stress.

In the second case, you may burn the moles by applying locally chemical topical agents, burning to the doctor with different methods, or if they are really spread trying even oral therapy.I would not recommend applying home remedies that might not only not work, but also cause damage to the skin around the mole, which might leave a permanent scar.

If it is only bruising and swelling without any underlying bony injury, it should gradually heal up in 5-7 days. Applying magnessium sulphate powder packed into a thin cloth pouch and wrapping it over the area would help in reducing the swelling or oedema as fast as possible.

Usually, you're instructed to wash the site, soak it for up to 20 minutes, gently remove dead tissue with a pumice stone or emery board, and apply the solution or patch. Patches are usually changed every 48 hours. Liquid applications are generally used twice a day. Treatment might take weeks.Duct tape can be used to treat plantar warts. Please use this by covering the wart with silver duct tape for six days, soaking the wart in water, gently removing dead tissue with a pumice stone or emery board, and then leaving the wart exposed for about 12 hours. You repeat the process until the wart is gone."},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with hypertension and have begun treatment. I don t like it I would rather use natural methods but it was very high and is now come down to 160/75-80. can I also help by exercising more and losing weight. and is there something I can eat to help this condition. is is curable?","Doctor":"Once hypertension has been diagnosed, there is no cure unfortunately but  you can control it through proper diet, exercise, stress management and drugs. If you are overweight then yes losing weight will surely bring down your blood pressure. Exercise when done regularly will also help in controlling BP and having a well-balanced diet which includes plenty of fruits and vegetables as they are good sources of potassium in our diet also helps to lower BP. Cut down on fat intake from butter, clarified butter, milk cream, margarine and fatty meats if non-vegetarian. Choose lean meat, fish chicken and eggwhites.Choose refined vegetable oil for cooking such as olive oil, canola, rice bran oil etc and limit its intake to not more than 3-4 tsp in a day per person.Include low fat milk/curd and cheese. Avoid processed cheese as it is rich in sodium. Cut down on your intake of salt which raises BP. You can do this by following:1. Limit salt intake to not more than 5 gm or 1 leveled teaspoon per day.Add salt to foods after cooking to retain the flavour. This way you can also control the amount of salt that you take in.2. Avoid salt preserved foods like ketchups, sauces, pickles, processed, canned and packaged foods like ready-to-eat meals, chips, salted biscuits, salted nuts etc.3. Use lemon, vinegar, black pepper and herbs for seasoning and flavour instead of salt.4. Read food labels of packaged foods for sodium content/salt content and avoid highly salted ones.Try to de stress by meditation, do some deep breathing exercises in fresh air which will help in reducing stress and lower BP as well.Alcohol and smoking also raises BP so steer clear of such habits."},{"Patient":"Hi my 17month year old boy is having blood stains in his diaper.before 2 days of this incident I noticed a swlling of his penis.now I think he is having pain while urinating for sometime.we consulted the doctor&gave his urine for testing,but it wil ta 24 hours to get the result.doctor didn't gave any medicine right now.can you give any solution for this?is there any home remedy?","Doctor":"Hello17  months old child passing urine with pain and you also notice a swelling when he urinate .As this is  now a day very common and the reason is narrow  opening of urethra.As I have noted in my so many patient that there is narrowing opening on the prepuce , due to this narrowing ,passing of urine causes pain and also blood in few cases .In my opinion you should consult a surgeon and get his opinion.When such type of patient visit I open this with the help of forceps .This is known as paraphimosis , however treatment depend on concerning doctor .2nd reason of such painful urination may be urinary tract infection ( urine culture report is awaiting ).No home remedy ,just consult a surgeon and it is a matter of 1/2 hour .Hope this will help you."},{"Patient":"I have irregular menstruation for past 10 years. periods came 3 months once nowadays.

If cold feels better, may as well.-- Analgesic creams, 3-4 times a day, locally are proved to be very beneficial.-- If all these measures do not relive pain completely and it still stops you from doing daily activity, then you should start using medications: Paracetamol 500mg every 4 hours, or Ibuprofen 400mg every 6 hours.

Getting regular exercise like walking and drinking enough water is also helpful. Have him try walking more often for shorter distances if he is getting too tired after 1 kilometer. Eating a diet with lots of fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains is healthy. Avoiding salt is good for the kidneys too. Salt is often very high in processed and canned foods so avoid them when possible.

Since, you are pregnant, you must take great care not to stay in unhygienic surroundings. You did a good thing by moving out. If you are having vomiting then it must be brought under control first through medications prescribed by your doctor. Avoid strongly flavoured foods like cabbage, onions etc. which may make you feel nauseous. Have a glass of lemon water with sugar or suck on lemon slices when you feel uneasy due to vomiting sensation. For diarrhoea, make sure you do not get dehydrated. Prepare home made ORS or Oral Rehydration Solution by adding a teaspoon of sugar and a pinch of salt to a glass (200 ml) of boiled and cooled water. Take this solution every 2 hours if you have persistent diarrhoea. Have dry toast, cooked rice, ripe bananas and applesauce for controlling diarrhoea. Do not drink milk as it can worsen diarrhoea. Instead go for curd or buttermilk which is helpful in treating diarrhoea. Drink plenty of fluids like glucose water, lemon water with sugar, freshly squeezed fruit juices prepared at home in a hygienic manner. Avoid any fried or spicy food, harsh fibrous fruits and vegetables. You can have potatoes but do not have any raw foods till diarrhoea is well in control. Take care and get yourself treated by a physician as soon as possible."},{"Patient":"I ve had black spots on my tongue for years and no its not birthmark or it wasn t there when I was born.please help!!any treatment or home remedies?

The normal Hb is above 12 gm/dl. So you have a very significant anemia. Raising the Hb to normal levels with only iron rich food would take a long time and should not be the only way as with a pregnancy, the Hb will come down further and you and your baby would be at risk. If you cannot tolerate oral iron, injectable iron preparations are available. If your doctor feels that your Hb has to be raised immediately, there is the option of  packed cell transfusion. It is usually not required.Also you should see a doctor who will check you causes of loss of blood like excessive menstrual flow or loss in the motion.

From your description you are hypothyroid. There really is no natural way to increase your thyroid levels. To help get your thyroid levels back to normal you may take additional iodine and selenium supplements. But to bring your TSH back to normal you must take thyroid replacement therapy. Without taking thyroid replacement medication you can run the risk of severe edema and heart problems. I do not recommend that you try any natural replacement therapies, instead seek medical attention to start you on thyroid replacement Hope I answered your medical question.

Mix the ingredients well and apply to your face after washing it. Leave the application on your face till it dries up and then wash off with cold water. Your skin will become smooth, glowing and fairer too. It is a natural and effective way to make your skin fairer and glowing. Milk cream will remove dryness and hence, imparts a glow to the face. You can use it frequently. You can also mix rose water with glycerine and apply to face for an even skin tone. Rub a slice of tomato all over your face and leave it till it becomes dry.

I request you to guide me on the diet.","Doctor":"Try to control your diet by avoiding simple sugars, sweetened beverages, fruit juices, sweets, soft drinks etc. Have a fibre rich diet as it will help to prevent spikes in blood glucose. Include fresh fruits and raw vegetables as salads, green leafy vegetables like spinach, fenugreek leaves, amaranth leaves.Reduce oil in cooking to not more than 3-4 tsp in a day for one person.Have whole grain cereals like whole wheat chapati, brown rice, partly milled rice or parboiled rice, oats and oat bran, broken wheat porridge or dalia (unsweetened).limit intake of white rice, refined flours like maida (white flour) or suji (semolina) and its products like noodles, buns, bakery items etc.Limit intake of fried and fatty foods (nuts and dried fruits). Control portion sizes to prevent high blood glucose. Stay physically active and try to reduce stress as stress also raises blood sugar.

She is very hyperactive.  She hits the children in her school.  We keep getting lot of complains from the school.  Other children do not want to play with her as she get angry very quickly. I would like to know if I give her home made ghee from butter, will this help her to calm down?","Doctor":"Hello,          Your grand daughter needs behavioural change. She needs psychotherapy so that she can learn to control her anger and behave appropriately in social situations. Do not encourage this kind of behaviour. Is she prone to temper tantrums also? Talk to her in a gentle but firm manner when she is angry, disruptive or abusive. Do not pamper her or give in to her demands. Make sure the home environment is peaceful. Is there any one in your family who is aggressive or controlling by nature? Children often imitate behaviour that they see at home. The entire family must try to discipline her. It will be better if you consult a psychotherapist who will guide you how to deal with difficult children. Hope this will help you to solve your problem. Giving ghee or butter will not really help in this situation."},{"Patient":"I am a self employed, 48 year old black male.  At the age of 28 I started treatment for borderline hypertension.  Several years ago I developed diarriha which has stayed for months at a time broken only by a day or less. I also had bladder problems and urinated at least 4 time during sleep hours.  I have been feeling extremely ill for over 24 months. It started suddenly one day when I noted what felt like a tight band around my right wrist.  My hand would later became a bit numb, but that sensation would subside.  After a few weeks, the tight band sensation seemed to migrate up into my left elbow and the weakness continued.  After the elbow, the weakness moved up to my shoulder and caused what I can only describe as a nearly useless left arm.  it was very weakened and I was not able to lift or get much use from it.  This would go on to last for several weeks.  During this period I was bothered by the weakness, and assumed it was something of a pinched nerve.    However,since I am a right hander, I simply used that dominate hand while waiting for the issue with the left hand to subside.  The numbness in the left arm and hand lasted for more than two weeks.  Just as suddenly the arm issue had arrived it disappeared.  Nearly a month later the same numbness appeared to begin in my right arm.  But, after a few days of the tight band feeling on my wrist, it was gone.  Several days later, I began to feel what I described at the time as a slight twisting sensation in my left testicle.  That light sensation soon became a full blown twisting feeling in the right testicle and up into the lower right abdominal area.  On the second day, the pain in those areas was unbearable and I found myself in an emergency clinic.  I was advised to alternate ice and heat on my groin area. Since no swelling was observed I was told it was ok... given advil and sent home.  Over the course of the next several weeks I began to be extremely fatigued.  I could only function for approximately 2 hours in the early day.  No amount of sleep or rest changed that exhaustion.  The exhaustion was soon followed by what I would later come to describe as almost hourly hotflashes.   These hot flashes initially the hotflashes were in my face and shoulders.  However, they soon spread to my shoulders, chest, and arms.  Additionally, I began to feel very mentally slowed.  My memory was seemingly failing and my abilities to complete my normally routine tasks became a true challenge.  During these early days I was treated by my private doctor who advised me that I appeared yellowish... and might be anemic.  He also informed me that my prostate was very enlarged...Complete blood panels would come to show that I had high lymphocytes, low neutrophils, low platelets, low testosterone, lowered liver and kidney functioning.   Except for liver and kidney tests, These results would remain constant for the next two years testing each 60 days.  Additionally, the tests would show very low vitamin D and Potassium for the entire period. After exhausting my financial resources, I was left to seek care and answers at the local VA hospital.  After repeating the tests, the VA doctors continue to find those same results.  Throughout this period, I have experienced night sweat from light to extremely heavy.  The VA Doctors started tellng me there is no signs of lupis.  They say prolonged diarriha may be irritable bowel and the hot flashes and pain in my right testicle and right groin may be in my mind. In approximately May 2011, I began to experience painful nodes in my neck and under my chin.   Ocassionally, they would be swollen but most often just a bit painful.  This was soon followed by a loss or change in my vocal quality.   Soon, that same pain had spread to my upper chest just below the clavacles.  That was followed by pain and soft puffiness in the clavacle spaces.  Nothing can be felt there but soft puffy swelling... like a soft balloon on each side.   Additionally,  I have started having intense pain in my achilles tendons and hand tendons.The doctor ignores my thyroid questions because my TSH is within some expected ranges.  All tests are negative for infection however, I feel horrible. Although those statements about these issues being in my mind have eased since the discovery of the varicocele and hydrocele in my right testicle.  After nearly 18 months of the same complaints and symptoms... an ultra sound completed at my insistence would finally show the varicocele as cause of the pain. In August 2011, i was rushed to the hospital with a fever of 105 degrees.  No infection was found and the fever was listed as a fever of unknown origin.  After several IVs and a dose of potassium, I was sent home with a fever of 101.   Over the course of the next few months the following symptoms have come for differing durations: Nausea , vomitting , headaches,  strong abdominal pains, aching and painful joints (knees, elbows, wrists, ankles and shoulders. Additionally,  pain on the right side lower  back.  Sometimes my bones hurt, a sharp, shooting, electrical shock which starts in upper left chest and shoots to left knee.Please note that many of these symptoms seem to cycle in groups.   ie Headache with nausea and vomitting,  testicle pain with lower abomin pain, etc...   Cycles last for as little as 24 hours and as much as 4 weeks. This list of symptoms is not complete, as some were not included because they may not have repeated in over a month. After 2 years, multiple tests and several rounds of antbiotics, I remain sick and getting worse,with no idea of what is causing all these symptoms.   Can someone please give me information or point me in the right direction. Any information or guidance is very appreciated. Sent from T-Mobile G2 with Google","Doctor":"Hello, You have a history of borderline hypertension, on & off numbness of the arms & hands, nausea, vomiting, headache, varicocele & hydrocoele. You are suggested to get physically examined for hypertension & get treated for it. Hypertension can be the root cause that triggers many of your symptoms. Maintain a normal blood pressure level. You can do thins with the help of antihypertensive (calcium channel blockers, thiazide diuretics, Ace inhibiors, etc) medications under a doctor. You can maintain it by regulating your diet. Avoid alcohol & addictions if any. Avoid red meat, trans fat, full-fat dairy, butter, etc. Since you have symptoms of nausea, abdominal discomfort, indigestion; get liver function tests done. A sick liver will cause fatigue, exhaustion & weakness. Get treated at the earliest. Take boiled homemade food. Take food that is easily digestible in small amounts 4-5 times a day, take veggies, soups, ORS & juice to keep yourself well hydrated. Hydrocele if left untreated will cause blocked blood flow to the testicle causing severe scrotal, pain, swelling or testicular torsion. Untreated varicocele may cause infertility due to low sperm production & decreased sperm quality. Get physically examined & treated. You may require a minor surgery. Numbness that you are experiencing is indicative of some developing Peripheral Neuropathy. If you are diabetic control your blood sugar levels to avoid worsening of the symptoms. Take food rich in vitamin B6, B12, folic acid along with minerals(calcium, magnesium, zinc, etc). You can also take vitamin supplements. If required get Nerve Conduction test & Nerve biopsy done. Do regular exercises. Stay away from stress. It looks like you have neglected your health immensely, its time to take care of yourself. Do not panic have patience, get treated. Slowly your symptoms will go away. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

We re both IV drug users, and she has a pretty significantly sized abscess right above her groin. (Ive been told this is a particularly risky area to have one.) She s gassed it almost a week. Yesterday it burst and began draining on its own, and she felt better right away because of the release of pressure. We both thought she might be able to avoid the hospital at that point. But,this morning what was a small hole yesterday has turned into a LARGE wound! I am EXTREMELY concerned, it s a long (over an inch) and slightly wide (width of a pinky finger) hole right above the vagina in the crease next to her thigh...The swelling has gone down but the wound is jaggedy, red and irritated. Still leaking out some pus and a yellowish translucent liquid, resembling pizza grease. Looked inside the hole it seems to be pretty deep...There is also a black hole in there that looks like it leads further in, more infection I m guessing? She won t agree to go to the hospital because she s worried about being admitted and stuck there for five days (this happened to me the time I had an abscess.) She is also apprehensive because we ve both known IV drug users who we re treated VERY VEER POORLY by physicians.

Multani mitti face packs can be safely used everyday to control oil secretion also. You can also prepare a face pack at home by mixing turmeric powder(make sure it is pure), sandalwood powder and besan (gram flour).

Is she having colicky pain, cramps or bloating sensation. Does she have normal bowel movements? Sometimes children have colic or stomach ache due to gas formation. This can also be a possible cause for discomfort. Make sure not to give beans, onions, or any gas forming food. If she has pain in stomach soon after ingesting food, then it could be due to gas. You can give gripe water to the child to relieve discomfort and rub a small amount of asafoetida (hing in hindi) after roasting it on gas flame. Cool down to a suitable temperature and rub it around the navel. You can dissolve asafoetida in mustard oil and rub it around the navel to relieve gas and strengthen baby's abdominal muscles too. You can also give buttermilk with added carom seeds powder (ajwain in hindi) and black salt to relieve stomach discomfort. Hope this will be helpful in solving your problem."},{"Patient":"Have a little stomach ache , nd kind of semi lose motions since yesterday , day before I had chocolate shake in which I put expired chocolate Hershey s sauce I had one meftal spsas in aftrnokn today , Nd now again feeling discomfort in stomach Shall I have it again ?

Also, from past month there are some pimples on my scalp which are very painful. I had lots of dandruff earlier. I am 31 yr old female. Thank you","Doctor":"The best home remedy for dandruff is application of curd on the scalp for atleast 15-20 minutes before you wash off with a shampoo. I don't know if you are an Indian or not, but herbal shampoos are the best for rejuvenating hair. Shampoos with Shikakai, amla, brahmi etc herbs help in promoting hair growth and keep them healthy as well. Your dandruff problem might have been responsible for alopecia. So, first you need to treat dandruff and only then can you prevent hairfall. Keep your scalp clean by washing it regularly, atleast twice a week, Cover your hair when you step out in the sun. In warm weather when there is alot of sweating, wash your hair often with a mild herbal shampoo. You can even try aloe vera shampoo. Aloe vera is useful for treating skin and scalp related problems including dandruff. It might be useful for boils that you have developed on your scalp. Don't worry and try to de stress as stress also affects your hair growth. Maintain good personal hygiene. Change your pillow cover everytime you wash your hair and clean your comb often. Do not share your comb with anyone. Have a well-balanced diet including protein rich foods like eggs, milk and curd, non-vegetarian foods like chicken, fish and mutton, if you are a non-vegetarian. Include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet and be active. Physical activity helps in improving blood circulation. Also massage your scalp with a herbal hair oil before you shampoo. Massaging your scalp helps to increase blood circulation stimulating the hair follicles. I hope you will benefit from my advice."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am twelve and I am afraid I have a bladder infection. I really dont want to though. I get constipation a lot sometimes and I feel like my bladder is not emptied every time I go to the bathroom. Please dont tell me to go to the doctor because I cant afford to. Is there a way to treat it naturally ? thanks","Doctor":"For treating constipation, you must eat a diet rich in fibre like fresh fruits such as apples, guava, pears, papaya all of which promote bowel function. Eat whole grain cereals like broken wheat porridge or dalia (hindi), whole wheat flour chapati, you can add wheat bran (commercially available) to foods like pancakes to increase fibre content. Avoid refined foods like maida and its products like bakery items viz. buns, biscuits, cakes and pastries. Limit intake of such foods and also junk foods like burger, pizza, noodles all of which are refined. if you want to have noodles, then add lots of vegetables to increase fibre content. Have vegetables in the form of raw salads like cucumber, tomatoes, onions, radish, carrots. You can add sprouted pulses and grams like green gram or whole moong and bengal gram or whole chana to salads to increase fibre as well as proteins. Drink plenty of fluids including water, coconut water, milk, bael fruit juice (helps to treat digestive disorders), buttermilk/lassi etc. Sleep well as lack of adequate sleep also leads to constipation and stay active throughout the day to enhance bowel movements. A glass of warm water with lemon and honey/sugar taken empty stomach early in the morning also stimulates bowel activity. Hope my advice will help you to relieve constipation."},{"Patient":"I want to stop myself from getting pregnant. My husband accidentally ejaculated inside me tonight it hasn't been 24 hrs after that.

Some specific soaps or solutions you may find in the pharmacies of your country that can be taken without prescription.--There is also increasing evidence that diets with a high glycaemic load and those containing a large amount of dairy of milk products can aggravate acne.

Do you have any other associated symptom viz., pain/itch/fever or any other? Are you suffering from Diabetes/ any other systemic problem/ Infection ?  As for as remedies is concerned, it depends mainly on the patient's symptoms.*An asymptomatic Bartholin's cyst may require no treatment,but * A symptomatic Bartholin's cysts require drainage.* A bartholin's cyst can transform into Bartholin's abscesses( which is a localized collection of pus that generally develops in response to infection under the skin typically painful). Unless spontaneous rupture occurs, an abscess rarely resolves on its own. Abscess is associated with fever/ various other symptoms.On whole if a Bartholin's cyst is small and does not cause any symptoms, it's better to leave it alone.

Coming to home remedies, it is possible to relieve discomfort (not definitive treatment) of a Bartholin’s cyst by following simple temporary methods.1. Take cold Shower instead of hot bath.2. Eat green vegetables viz., salads; fresh juices, fruits. 3. Drink plenty of water viz., minimal 8 glasses/day.4. Maintain proper Hygiene of genital area viz., Clean the affected area with soap and water.5. Then if pain in genital , take a SITZ bath(a warm, shallow bath with salt added that cleanses the space between the rectum and genital region) can be used for everyday personal hygiene & also it provide relief from pain or itching in the genital area.You can give a SITZ bath in your bathtub.

I noticed a swelling in the area between my anus and vagina, almost in the area where episiotomy was done during the delivery of my 2 children. Sometimes it gets bigger and gives rise to discomfort while passing motion. In fact, of late, i have even noticed that there is a pricking sensation and slight pain while defecating. Otherwise, I maintain good eating habits and pass motion everyday. Is there any home remedy for this?? I have not noticed any bleeding during defecating. Please help.","Doctor":"Greetings Madam.

Maintain proper Hygiene of genital area viz., Clean the affected area with soap and water. 5. Then if pain in anus, take a SITZ bath(a warm, shallow bath with salt added that cleanses the space between the rectum and genital region) can be used for everyday personal hygiene & also it provide relief from pain or itching in the genital area.You can give a sitz bath in your bathtub.  &Finally,Approximately 30-50% of people with an anal abscess(an infection happening inside your existing swelling which rupture) will develop an anal fistula(an abnormal or surgically made passage between a hollow or tubular organ and the body surface, or between two hollow or tubular organs).Around 80% of all anal fistulas develop from an infection already in the anus.Consult your Doctor if you feel uncomfortable in spite of above measure.Hope it helped you."},{"Patient":"Hello I am experiencing severe muscle cramps in my back and leg due to my inability to move certain parts of my body because of an injury that I have.

Permanent hair removal is a cosmetic treatment of removing hair almost permanently. You will need 4-8 sessions of 4-6 weeks apart. The skin needs to be not tanned, the hair not removed, shaved or taken off recently.You can remove the hair also using twisers, depilatory machines or creams.Although what I would recommend to do first, is to check the skin zone to the dermatologist. The hair is the skin, around your eyes is not common (except the eyebrows who can be removed by twisers) and it may come from a condition called Hirsutism, who may come from variations of some hormone levels in the body. From your description, looks like its hair in not a common place. So doing those labs and ruling out you don't need a medical treatment for it, other then cosmetic, should be the first step.Hope this helps,Regards."},{"Patient":"I get frequent cysts in the labia major and minora region sometimes before and sometimes after menustration.

Leafy vegetables like spinach (palak) and fenugreek leaves (methi), beans and lentils like masoor daal, chole, moong daal, toor daal, urad daal, rajma. Asparagus (Shatwar) and sesame seeds (til) are other good sources of iron. Grains like barley (jav), rice, semolina (sooji), bajra and maize (makai) can also be included. You could use combination of any of these sources to cook delicious iron rich recipes. If not, munch on dried fruits such as almonds (badaam), dried peaches or raisins (manuka). If you’re a non-vegetarian, meat and fish are the best sources of iron for you.2. If your haemoglobin count is low because your body is not producing sufficient red blood cells, then you could be deficient in folic acid, B complex vitamin that is required to make red blood cells. Sources of folic acid include lentils, dried beans, peas, Brussels sprouts (chota band gobi), banana, corn (makai), beets, pineapple and peanuts. (Note: If you are having more of Vitamin C sources then you’ll have to increase the intake of folic acid as well because Vitamin C causes excretion of folic acid from the body). 3. If you are deficient in iron you should avoid having calcium rich foods like milk and cheese. They block the absorption of iron. Don’t drink too much of coffee, tea and alcohol either.Hope you get idea from this and may it will helpful to you.Thanks & Regards,Gaurav Prajapati"},{"Patient":"Sir how can I stop my problem of night fall ... m too much stressed. ..

Thanks, Maisy","Doctor":"Thank you for the query.I would like to know your age and whether you suffer from any associated comorbidities like Diabetes mellitus, Hypertension or Thyroid dysfunction.As per the history provided, you are suffering from dry cough, bodyache, swollen glands, coryza and occasionally high grade fever (body overheating may imply that), for a period of 2 days. Your symptoms are more in favour of a viral infection. In a sunstroke you will get other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, severe cramps, dry skin, dizziness and severe headache. I would advise you to take bed rest for a few days and drink plenty of water and fluids (avoid alcohol). If your body gets overheated you can go for cold or tepid sponging. A nutritious diet is advisable, and if you are a smoker, you must abstain from smoking (this irritates your respiratory tract and aggravate your cough). If you have nasal congestion and throat irritation, steam inhalation may help. In case of severe bodyache, acetaminophen may be taken (after consulting your physician). Please monitor your urine output.If you develop any of the symptoms mentioned above or your symptoms do not subside in another couple of days, please consult your physician, since you may need a thorough physical check up and a course of antibiotics may be needed.Hope this helps you out."},{"Patient":"Hi what is the safest way to delay my period without using the pills.

There are certain protocols to be followed. If you find the result positive then approach a Gynecologist for help. There are pills available, but this can not be purchased/ consumed without a doctors guidance. Follow what he/she advises you to.Thirdly, Try  to relax. Stress delays period.

Please advice me if I need to do something at my home.","Doctor":"Thank you for the query.I would like to know your age, gender and whether you suffer from any associated comorbidities like Diabetes mellitus. I would also like to know what group of antibiotics were taken by you.As per the history, you are suffering from recurrent Urinary Tract Infection, with raised infection parameters (TLC-24000/mm3 and ESR-40). Recurrent UTI can occur due to a number of different causes in males and females. Uncontrolled Diabetes is an important cause for both genders, hence it is advisable to get your blood sugar screened (fasting and post prandial blood sugar). In elderly male patients prostatomegaly is an important cause, which can lead to recurrent UTI. In elderly female subjects, bladder neck obstruction (mainly age related) can cause raised residual urinary volume, which can again lead to recurrent UTI. A ultrasonography of kidney-ureter-bladder with assessment of residual urinary volume helps in this case.Inadequate antibiotic dosage for inadequate duration is another important cause of recurrent UTI. This can lead to emergence of drug resistant bacterial strains, which become difficult to treat. A urine for routine examination and culture is needed (though in all probabilities your culture may be negative since you have received multiple courses of antibiotics). I would advise you to consult your physician since you need a thorough check up and some specific investigations, as your infection parameters are raised (an intravenous course of high end antibiotics may well be required after assessment). It will be slightly difficult to manage your case at home, since you are not responding to oral antibiotics. Personal hygiene is very important for prevention of UTI (keep your private areas clean and dry) and plenty of oral fluid intake is advisable.Hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"I'm a virgin.

Vaginal candidiasis (yeast) is a common fungal infection in female subjects. Since you are having recurrent yeast infection, a blood sugar screening is advisable (Fasting and post prandial blood sugar). A routine urine examination may also be done.There is no home remedy for candidiasis as such. You must try to maintain hygiene and keep you private parts clean and dry. Local preparations like vaginal creams and ointments are available (Clotrimazole cream) which may be applied locally twice or thrice a day, with good results. If symptoms worsen or urinary tract symptoms like burning during urination develop, you must consult your physician for a thorough physical examination.Hope that helps you."},{"Patient":"I have had Gyno for about three years now after foolishly using a pro-hormone when I was younger, a mistake to say the least,do you know anything about the use of Turmeric root to combat the fat/tissue build up and/or any other possible remedies before surgery.

You should be fit in terms of BMR[basal metabolic rate], normal blood sugar and a normal blood pressure. Don't go by looks, few people have tendency to put weight and there are many reasons for same. So idea should be to treat the root cause, it can be hypothyroidism, cushing syndrome, hypothalamic causes or a genetic association. Any cause has to be treated to get rid of fat and then prevention off course is better than cure, so go for lots of fruits and salad along with workout at least three times a week if not daily. Treatment with orlistat has some effect as it lowers fat absorption and finally surgery should be the last resort.........tc care"},{"Patient":"hello, I have a 22 month old that I believe caught head lice at her daycare.

There is a different comb for lice extraction you have to buy that, it has crowded bristles to entangle the lice when you comb hair . This is how you can to some extant remove head lice but for complete removal you need to apply antilice shampoo as well as oil. If you don't remove all the lice, after a week or so nits will grow to become lice and cycle goes on.

The ophthalmologist told me my daughter has cylindrical number as high as -3.5 in both her eyes and will have to wear specs for the rest of her life. I was surprised as my daughter never ever complained of any vision problem to me. How bad is her vision? Should she wear her specs 24/7 (she has zero spherical number in both eyes) Are there natural therapies, yoga, exercises that can help her get rid of this cylindrical number? Thanks Christie","Doctor":"Hello Dear first of all don't worry ,many people have zero spherical number but still have to use glasses of high power ranging from-2 to -15 due to astigmatism of cornea or lens. So this is not unusual and one has to go for cylindrical number. Good on your part is that you have got your daughter's eye check-up in time. Your daughter needs to wear glasses all the time when awake otherwise no. can worsen and wearing them 24/7 will keep the no. constant. Important is go for regular eye check-up, look for any watering of eyes or any other symptoms and consult your ophthalmologist. Yoga and exercise are good anyways but cant help get rid of glasses, give her good diet rich in vitamin A and carotenoids...........tc care"},{"Patient":"I have a fairly large boil, about 2 inches wide and 1 inch long, that has gotten this big in only 3 days.
