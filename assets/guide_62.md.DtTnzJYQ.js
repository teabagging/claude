It will be better to elevate your hand above the heart level to avoid swelling. Mild to moderate sprains respond to  this method and you will get well soon after some wrist exercises.

This also can lock the knee at times which sometimes can be released by popping it. This needs to be diagnosed by an MRI and treated accordingly. Meanwhile, you need to avoid knee strain- squatting climbing more than a flight of stairs. You could exercise the knee muscles to keep the knee stable and strong. The ankle pain could be related to the fracture you had with an untreated ligament injury. This needs to be checked out too by an MRI.

I am finally working with about 75% of my kidneys again after about 2 years of suffering and near death. I was never put on dialysis for it. I was also told that I do not have any sort of cancer. They think I got it from having an almost complete sedentary lifestyle. I am also in a wheelchair due to my right knee needing to be replaced and having lymphedema in both legs. My thighs are the size of tree trunks. I have lost almost 200 pounds on my own in the last year and a half and I have found a gym that has equipment, classes and water aerobics for people in a chair. I am still however hovering at about 400 pounds. I do not ever want to go back to where I was, but I still need to lose over 200 pounds. Finally, my question is, do you think it would be ok to have the gastric sleeve surgery done? If so, after I am healed from that and well on my way to being done with the weight loss, do you know of any surgeons that would remove these huge sacks of hanging skin from the insides of my thighs left from the lymphedema?

The police method stands for -ProtectionOptimal LoadingIcingCompressionElevation Protecting the joint and preventing the injury from progressing would be a good idea. It would be a good idea to avoid exercise and avoid moving the arm too much. Optimal loading is a good way to promote blood flow to the area and this can help the arm and the elbow to heal quicker. This happens because the bad blood is cleared from the elbow and the good blood enters the area to promote healing. After this, many people find icing the area useful. Icing helps to reduce swelling over the area and promotes healing. Compression by using an elbow sleeve or a crepe bandage can be useful as well. Lastly, elevating the hand while sleeping can help to return blood to the heart. In case these do not help right away, some people find using over the counter painkillers can help.

When consulted the doctor, he ask me to take 3 tablets (Enzomac, Rantac and Movon) and also pshsiotherapy. Want to know the cause of knee pain","Doctor":"Hi, There are several reasons for pain in the knee. Pain that increases while standing and sitting for long periods of time may be seen with a muscle strain, muscle imbalances, or with osteoarthritis. It would be a good idea to check for swelling compared to the other side by looking at the knees in the mirror. If there is swelling, the following regimen can be attempted. POLICE is currently the best therapy to treat the symptoms and the underlying condition. POLICE stand for: - Protection - Optimal Loading - Ice - Compression - Elevation Protection involves preventing the knee from getting injured further. This is done by avoiding exercise, excessive standing, or excessive sitting. Optimal loading involves doing basic rehab exercises like static quad stretches, knee extensions, clam exercises, and knee slides. Post this, Icing the area for 15 mins every hour can help as well. Lastly, sleeping with raising the legs by placing a few pillows under the leg can help move blood flow to the heart as well. Some people may benefit from over the counter painkillers as well.

When this happens, a small swelling may start. This swelling can grow larger and continue to irritate the area. Many people find icing the area useful to help reduce the swelling. Usually, it is best to ice the area for about 15 mins every hour till the area of swelling and pain numbs and the pain reduces. In case this does not help, many people find using Over the Counter painkillers useful as well. However, if all these do not help, seeing a doctor for imaging may be needed.

I have no insurance so I only done the MRI on the left shoulder. My right shoulder has begun to have the same symptoms. My DR. has me taking anti-inflamatories and a blood thiner. He also wrote me out of work for six weeks to rest the joints. I have lost a lot of mobility in my left arm. I drive a flat bed tractor trailer and my work can be physically demanding while strapping and tarping my loads with tarps that weigh 130 lbs. My questions are will I fully recover and will I be able to return to my current job or will I need to find lighter work? Thanks in advance. Shane","Doctor":"Hi, There is very less chance that avascular necrosis will heal completely. In my opinion, continue physiotherapy, anti-inflammatory medicine when pain is unbearable. The only treatment is total arthroplasty of your shoulder joint. However, it is also not advisable to get arthroplasty at this young age. So in my opinion, continue as long as possible and in the future go for arthroplasty. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

If it has been persistent or even increasing for a few days, you need to visit your orthopedician. Depending upon the clinical findings they might ask you to get an MRI done, which shall help establish a diagnosis and in turn allow one to formulate a treatment plan.

I had a hysterectomy in Dec 2011 and I have been worried that something isn t right (may have slipped down again) so wondering if back pain could also be to do with this. For the past month my back pain has been getting worse. Thursday night I went out and my knees were extremely painful(sharp shooting pains) as well as sore lower back. So I came home and got warmed up but when I got up to go to bed my whole body was in pain. I didn t get to sleep till about 1.20am after taking panadol. I woke at 7am with extreme sharp pains in the left side of my head. I have had this before but not as bad. I was able to go back to sleep until 8.30 when I woke and was in extreme pain. I took panadol and a nausea tablet thinking it was a migraine but not really feeling sick. Also, light was ok for me where previously with migraine I can t stand the light. I couldn t go back to sleep and so I took a quetiapine (not on these atm but still have a couple in my medicine cabinet. I slept till 3.30pm. The rest of the day and night I am extremely fatigued, tearful and in pain and keep going hot and cold. The temparature is quite cold at present so I was surprised I got hot a couple of times. I went to bed at 10.30 and took an imovene as I couldn t sleep.

Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Even though your abdomen needs to be examined before coming to a diagnosis, from your history it seems that you have got either a UTI (urinary tract infection) or a calculi in the urinary tract obstructing the free flow of your urine. To rule out either of these, you might have to go for a urine routine/microscopic/culture sensitivity test, and an ultrasound of the abdomen. Till then, you might go for plenty of liquids orally, and an anti spasmodic drug if need be during the pain.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

When I put weight on it, shooting pains are caused and it feels like when you rip paper slowly, I have a lot of discomfort, what s wrong with my knee?","Doctor":"Hi, It sounds from the brief history that there is soft tissue physiological changes in the knee joint. As the age isn't mentioned I suspect to be above 35+ years. If that is the case then it should be early degenerative changes of the knee joint. An MRI is advised. Because swelling , pain, discomfort are the symptoms of the physiological changes. Due to this changes there will be weakness of the muscles and ligaments which will not be able to hold the knee joint in desired anatomical position leading to changes in the gait cycle as well. Post-MRI the conservative management can be helpful for reducing the symptoms. You can even try the exercises like - static hamstring, Static quadriceps, straight leg raise, ankle toe movements, hip muscle strengthening, abductors strengthening, abductors strengthening, icing for pain and swelling relief if you aren't diabetic. If diabetic then only hot water fermentation.

As you have done aerobics in the past this has helped improve the cardio respiratory functions and some lower limb muscle Strengthening.

Some days the pain is really bad and I can hardly move my head without severe pain, other days the pain is mild and it is uncomfortable to move my head. I have some kind of pain everyday from mild to severe and it hurts more when I move my head, for example, it hurts more when I move my right ear towards my right shoulder or if I turn my head to look in a certain direction. I can t see any pattern as to when the pain is more severe, it isn t worse after a particular activity or time of day. For example, yesterday the pain was mild and uncomfortable, today it was mild in the morning and has become moderate thoughout the day, these 2 days are my days off and I have not done anything strenuous. Sometimes if I massage my neck and shoulder area I can feel something move and make a dull clonking noise, this helps dull the pain slightly for a short period of time before going back to how it was before.

My first physiotherapist gave my some neck stretches to do and I have been doing them for about 1 year or more. The second more recent physiotherapist has told me there is nothing wrong with me and that the pain is something my brain had made up.

Usually, in myosotis, there is inflammation of the muscles and needs a proper graded exercise plan which can help avoid the fatigue to set in faster and improve the overall physiology of the muscles.

You should rest the injured part in the crepe bandage and immobilize it. Post which you can do some icing to reduce the pain. Take an x-ray to check for any bony injury.

It s not that bad, when compared to previous swelling issues but it is the longest - since about February. I did start a new desk job so I am sitting more.

But feet and ankles that stay swollen or are accompanied by other symptoms could signal a serious health problem. An injury to the foot or ankle can lead to swelling. The most common is a sprained ankle, which occurs when an injury or misstep causes the ligaments that hold the ankle in place to be stretched beyond their normal range. To reduce the swelling from a foot or ankle injury, rest to avoid walking on the injured ankle or foot, use ice packs, wrap the foot or ankle with a compression bandage, and elevate the foot on a stool or pillow.

A possible cause is lymphedema, is filtered through the lymph nodes, which trap and destroy unwanted substances, such as bacteria. When there is a problem with the vessels or lymph nodes, however, the fluid's movement can be blocked. Untreated, lymph buildup can impair wound healing and lead to infection and deformity.

Without more information it is not enough to determine the diagnosis. It could be a hematoma (bleeding in the tissues) or a swollen knee joint capsule. If it's in the back of the knee then it could be a Baker's cyst. Clinical examination (and perhaps fluid aspiration if there's any) would help to determine the diagnosis. Either an orthopedics specialist or your primary care physician can do that. Until then you can try to apply ice packs (not directly on the skin - wrap them with a towel) and perhaps use some painkillers starting with paracetamol (acetaminophen) and advancing to NSAID if paracetamol is not enough and there's no contraindication for NSAID.

I went to my Cardiologist last December and he performed, Echo, EKG, Blood Test, Ultrasound, and even checked my Carotid Artieries (for stroke)... All negative Today I have been expieriencing the following discomfort: pain in and around the collarbone (both sides), pain in and around both shoulderblades, tightness in front of upper chest, pain under my chin. Any suggestions? I also take an aspirin every morning... is that more harmful than helpful?","Doctor":"Hello, As I understand that this pain is muscular as most of the systemic reports have turned out to be negative. I will advise doing hot water fermentation to the neck and throat muscles along with upper back muscles. This will help the muscles to get relaxed. Also due to the tightness of the muscles of the respiratory system, the accessory muscles, sternocleidomastoid there will be trouble in the throat and jaw region. Hot water fermentation will help reduce the pain by relaxing the muscles. Also, do some simple stretching of the muscles of the throat. Post this, do stability exercise for the neck muscles and shoulder muscles. This will help reduce the joint compression and relieve the pain. The Trapezius muscle looks spasm and with hot water fermentation and gentle kneading massage, it will be helped. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I broke the tip of my right middle finger bone all the way across. When I went to urgent care at the beginning of May, they took an xray. I went to an orthopedic surgeon right away afterwards where the doctor applied a splint. I was supposed to keep it on for 6 weeks, but it was way too difficult, so I made another appointment. The same doctor removed the splint and recommended surgery to pin the bones together through my finger. It would take about an hour and I d be knocked out. I decided to get a second opinion and scheduled an appointment with a more senior doctor in the same practice. He reviewed another xray of the finger and gave me his take on the situation. His conclusion was that if this were him, he would not have the surgery. So, now after around two months since the injury, I m still in pain. My finger is still swollen and it is bent and slightly deformed. Every time I use this finger it hurts. Every day there s pain because anything I do with my hand involves putting pressure on the wound. The doctor s suggestion was to flex the tip of my finger, holding the majority of the finger, allowing the tip to be exercised. At work I just irritate the injury by typing the keyboard of my computer. Every time I write, open a door, lift my son, grab items, use silverware, tie a shoe, etc. it becomes painful. I don t know how to alleviate the pain and stop the swelling. What can I do? How can I prevent permanent damage? Should I see another doctor? Should I just accept the fact that it s never going to heal properly and the pain will continue? What other options do I have? I m tired of the non-stop dilemma I face consistently. Please help!!

Your pulse rate sounds lower side and pain in the left arm might be due to cardiac pathology. I am not saying it is because of it but I am trying to say that getting it checked it better because it might be due to even increase intra arterial blood pressure. If the blood pressure monitor shows the reading on the higher side than an ECG and an Echocardiogram is advised. Treatment will be accordingly. In case the blood pressure and ECG is normal than we have to look for the nerve pathology as there might be a pain at times in the upper limb due to the nerve entrapment.

It s hurts where it connects my ankle to my foot and swelled up (no change in color) for no reason known, toes begin to feel hot. Why? do I need to go to the doctor and get x-rays?","Doctor":"Hello, As you get hot spells than check the uric acid along with the x-ray. Because during an increase in the uric acid levels there will be a burning sensation of the foot. Also, do some icing and use compression bandage. This should help ease little. In case icing at the foot doesn't help then do icing for the lower back. This will provide the anaesthetic effect to the nerves and stop the pain sensation. If uric acid found high then need medication for the same. In case the uric acid and x-ray come negative then we should suspect the nerve root entrapment in the lumbar spine. This may even lead to disruption in sensory functions of the nerve. Get a proper examination and lab assessment so we get a diagnosis and treatment should be accordingly.

You can check by performing the leg raising test (where you lie on your back and try to raise both your legs without bending your knees) to check.

Since there is breathing difficulties I feel there is a respiratory system pathology due to the work-related factors. Since the inspiration and expiration abilities are lowered in will advise you to look for CPAP machine with oxygen saturation machine. In fact BiPAP will be far better. This will help your pulmonary system to function close to normal and also will help the lungs fill the air. As due to the pathology there is less ability of the alveoli and needs a correction. Medicine is symptomatic and along with that a bipap machine with oxygen saturation would do good. Also try pulmonary rehabilitation under guided physiotherapist . as this will help you improve the lung capacities and help you ease of dyspnea. Its a matter of good pulmonary rehabilitation training. In my clinical experience of 12 years most patients with respiratory complications have responded well to pulmonary rehabilitation. Using of the cpap bipap and oxygen saturation is totally dependent upon the clinical findings and this machines can be used at home for large number of hours to improve the overall function of the respiratory system.

The side effects listed concerns me. Your comments would be appreciated","Doctor":"Hello, Yes, the medicine provided is right for gout. Since you have a past medical history of Diabetes the healing will be slow. Also warfarin is added to the reduction in the medical effects of the colchicine. I will advice you to undergo geriatric rehabilitation program which consists of general exercise which helps the overall muscle strength and also improve the circulation in the blood vessels. Also doing exercises for the foot like keeping in warm water and picking up marbles with toes will be useful. Use taping for the foot to avoid gout pressure effects on the Ligaments. Most cases I have seen in the past 12 years of clinical practice are helped better with the combination of exercise and medicine. As medicines are symptomatic relievers and never advised for long term use its exercise which helps to cut down the side effects of the medicine in some cases. Doubting the physician for the prescription of medicine isn't the right thing to do.

Use the hot water bag wrapped in towel. This will provide deep heating effect. Continue this along with the medicines you are taking. And also keep the pillow underneath the knee. If you aren't diabetic than please use icing for the lower back region. This will provide the anaesthetic effect and reduce the sensory functions by which the pain will come down. As pain travels by the nerve, rather using a steroid shot it's better to use icing which is non invasive and no side effects. Wait and see if the knee is any better. If diabetic you can use hot water bag in the lower back which will slow down the sensory system by dilation effect. Once the pain comes down kindly try doing knee bending and extending. If that is possible you can possibly do some exercises like static Quadriceps and static hamstring to regain muscle strength. Kindly do on both sides the exercises so the strength is equivalent. In case you are able to perform extension and flexion of the knee, I think it's a ligament injury and we ended to take up the MRI to rule out this.

Could I have a fracture in my kneecap?","Doctor":"Hello, As you had a fall over the knee and there is a cut of the skinny area also, I don't think it will be a fracture, because if it was then there would have been no fracture because the knee cap bone is too strong to with stand such falls. But it's always good on a safer side to take up an x-ray. If x-ray reveals fracture than the limb will be made immobilized using knee brace in hairline fracture but if it's a displaced fracture then treated accordingly.

Could you please suggest me a better way to get rid of it? I also would like to know, is there any non-surgical/Ayurvedic treatment available on this osteophytes?","Doctor":"Hello, Sorry to hear about your father. As age is important to make a decision on anything about osteophytes which is missing in history. Coming to osteophytes, there is only a surgical removal decision taken if the osteophytes are making some neurological compromise and disabling symptoms. If none of this are present the surgical excision will not be look for. Also, doing surgery might not be as simple as understood, since the osteophytes will be too close the spinal nerves and may lead to major complications so avoiding the surgical part will be better as per me. Medicine are symptomatic and they act as a supporting be treatment the rest healing is done by the body itself. It's a great saying in medicine - body is a medicine of its own and it will heal on its own it's just need some support.  So let the body heal on its own rather putting the knife. Now since he is having back pain which is on a higher scale, I am sure he must be advised for some pain killers. Continue the painkillers and use the hot water fermentation along with lumbar brace. Wait and see if the symptoms come down. Once the pain levels are dropping begin the low-intensity exercises so that the muscles start getting activation to go the next level of strengthening and also support the skeletal system. Once the pain is again dropping thinking on a graded increase in the exercise will be good for better results. You can take the help of a physiotherapist for the exercise. He may even help with Therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy which will help the inflammation and pain to come down. In my clinical practice of over 12 years, most cases have responded well to a combination of medicine and physiotherapy.

Since it is understood that during lying in supine position there is a strain on what lumbar spine do the normal curvature of the lordosis will be having a strain on the nerve root via the strain of the para spinal muscles leading to nerve compression and pain over the hip. As soon as the pain starts you take the prone position by which the strain on the paraspinal muscles and lumbar spine is released and the relief is achieved. This is my understanding with respect to the history provided.

I ve not been doing any heavy tasks today","Doctor":"Hello, As I see there is a pain in the arm which is kind of shifting in nature and no strenuous activity this could be a nerve entrapment in the Cervical spine leading to the symptoms. It's speculation. so rule this out I will advise you to do some hot water fermentation to the neck and also some simple static neck exercises. Just watch if the pain is reducing. If it does we need to look for the pathology of the spinal column and also an MRI might be good to understand the pathology of the cervical spine. Usually, with the job profile, degenerative changes, there will be a thecal cord compression leading to symptoms.

As in certain position, it may be safe and certain position it may not be. Having deciding which position to take it totally depends upon your husband.

Over the course of time and rehab, I still suffer a tremendous amount of pain. It feels as if there s no cartilage in between the bones in my knee and that the bones are scrapping each other. What is happening?","Doctor":"Hello, As there is an injury of the knee and you feel no cartilage meaning there will be friction or bone touching feeling for you. If so, taking up an x-ray or MRI will be of choice. As the MRI is mainly for understanding the soft tissue injury like the ligaments and cartilages and x-ray for the bones we can figure out what is the status of the bone and soft tissues. Post which we can advise you exercise like - static Quadriceps, static hamstring, ankle toe movements, straight leg raise in supine and side lying. Also, a knee brace will be advised to act as a muscle supporter. Most cases will respond to exercise and conservative therapy.

MRI showed mild tib fib degenerative change and soft tissue swelling. Pain went away after numbing shot at ortho. Yesterday, two months later...hard lump about 1/2 inch side to side appeared above tib-fib. Tender, but not intense pain.","Doctor":"Hello, As you had the pain in the past taking to tibiofibular joint and took a steroid shot to reduce pain, with the medicine shot only the pain has subsided but the degeneration is still present. Every pain killers shot given it is advised to do some proper exercise for strengthening the muscle groups so that the degenerated joint do not take more stress and strain so the inflammation can be avoided as well. To make it simple that this lump is a kind of protective mechanism of the body to let you know that the joint is still in degenerative state and not healed. So kindly go slow. I will advise you to get an x-ray or MRI whatever is possible to see if you have at least not allowed the joint to damage. Once done, use crepe bandage or knee brace for now. This will help stabilize the joint. Post this do not water fermentation so that the muscles of the below knee get relaxed and any spasm there will come down by loosening the muscle fibres with a hot fermentation. Once done wait for 2 weeks to start the exercise. In the meantime don't allow more weight bearing. Once 2 weeks are over start simple static Quadriceps and static hamstring. Along with this do ankle toe movements. Continue the above exercise for at least 2-3 weeks for both the legs and wait for the strength to come. Once you find the strength is sufficient to take to next level of exercise I will say go with the balance board training. This will help to improve the imbalance correction in the muscles of the leg and less pressure will be applied to the tibiofibular joint. Continue this and follow this every alternate days even after the pain subsides. This will allow your degeneration to not proceed more. Hope I have answered your query.

It has been present for the past three days. It keeps me awake until I find a psosition that reduces the pain. Usually laying on my back with pillows under my right knee.","Doctor":"Hello, As you have this radiating pain it sounds to me the pathology of the lumbar spine and the nerve root entrapment.

Taking an MRI will be of good choice to understand the soft tissue abnormalities. Kindly do McKenzie maneuver as it will centralise the pain and use hot water fermentation after that. You can find about McKenzie maneuver online anywhere. Post the centralising of the pain do core stability and lumbar spinal muscle strengthening exercises.

Have you taken an MRI of the shoulder? If so what was the reports? if not then please do take it. I suspect this to be a rotator cuff injury. Because any injury happening to the shoulder with two muscle injury falls in the group. The rotator cuff muscles are weak. You need to workout behind it. Shoulder function can resume only when we have good range of motion in passive for all the movements and also if we overcome the pain. In fact, I should share one of the rotator cuff injury cases of mine. It was a case of 65 years old female with the above mentioned injury. No passive or active shoulder movements. But to overcome the problems, i use to make the muscle tire by active ROM exercises and no weights. Just gravity assisted and gravity resisted ones. In fact all the shoulder movements like - flexion, extension, rotation, abduction, adduction and circumduction. At the end of the 12th week, she had the best movements without any kind of pain and shoulder was much stronger than before. I will advise you to look for a competitive physiotherapist who can help you get the best outcome score. If left untreated it will lead to other pathologies which are not accepted.
