Raw eggs all have the same benefits as cooked eggs. However, protein absorption is lower from raw eggs, and the uptake of biotin may be prevented. Most concerning is the small risk of raw eggs contaminated with bacteria leading to Salmonella infection. Buying pasteurized eggs will lower your risk of infection. Raw or cooked eggs can be consumed. In case of more than 3 eggs, boiled egg white can be consumed.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Androcur contains Cyproterone which is an antiandrogen (affecting the secretion of hormones) and therefore may delay the period. On the other hand, Primolut is a synthetic progestin and functions as female hormone progesterone and is used to treat disorders related to menstruation and abnormal vaginal bleeding which may be due to hormonal imbalance in the body. If there is delay in period than expected then one may wait for up to a week and later can go for urine pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy.

Does it also block the iron from the food I eat? If so, how would I get the iron my body needs?","Doctor":"Hi,Yes, it may block the absorption of iron. St. John's wort may interfere with the absorption of the iron supplements as well as the iron present in the food if taken together.

I generally take tylenol ES(500mg)I take 2 pills every 4 hrs for herniated discs and thoracic outlet syndrome. I accidentally took 1500mg in one dose. Am I going to have liver damage? I don t exceed 4000mg in one day. Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi,Age, gender, purpose of taking tylenol, any associated illness or alcohol intake not mentioned. If taken in larger doses it may cause liver damage. For adults normal dose of tylenol is 325 mg to 1 gram orally every 4 to 6 hours.

WILL SHE BE OK???????","Doctor":"Hi,From the given history what I understood is that you gave 5 ml each of Crocin and Paracetamol syrup (amounting to 10 ml) to your 4 year old daughter. The oral dose of paracetamol for children aged 1 month to 18 years is 15 mg/kg per dose, to a maximum of 1 g per dose, every four to six hours, with a maximum of 60 mg/kg daily, without exceeding 4 g daily.Since each of Crocin and Paracetamol syrup contains 120 mg of Paracetamol /5 mL accordingly you have administered 240 mg of Paracetamol at once. 240 mg of Paracetamol is still within the normal dosage required for the children of 4 years. So, there is nothing to worry about its harmful effects. However, if she gets vomiting, abdominal pain or jaundice she must be suspected of Paracetamol toxicity which should be treated in the hospital.Hope I have answered your query.

Moreover, you are suffering from both, hypertension and diabetes.What I can tell you is that your blood is sweet (diabetes), sugar behaves like a strong oxidizing potential of cholesterol particles, making your cholesterol harmful from a quality point of view.So you risk tremendously to see your coronary vascular axes (cardiac muscle nutrition) limit the nutritional flow to the heart muscle and therefore you will have to undergo chest pain following this irrigation deficiency especially during any activities.So, you not only need to decrease your weight but you must absolutely stabilize your diabetes and hypertension.In the present context of the clinical symptoms that you feel, it seems to me also very urgent to make a thorough consultation with your cardiologist and to highlight the damage present at the coronary level in order to establish an adequate therapeutic regimen.best wishes"},{"Patient":"my sisiter is being injected with fertigyn 5000 but she is having very minimum bledding and the bleeding usuaaly stops after 2 days the color is brown. she after taking the injection has done pregnency test and it is showing positive. this week also after taking the injectin she is seeing the same spotting","Doctor":"HiFertigyn is given to support pregnancy, in case of pain or threatened abortion or any history of high risk pregnancy.It is given to prevent spotting.Ultrasound should be done to assess the presence of gestational sac and progress of pregnancy.Hope I have answered your query.

There are several medications you can try called SSRI's that can be used if the symptoms are very bad. Estrogen replacement can also be used,  but I do not personally recommend it as it has been found to increase the risk of cancer and stroke. Another cause of night sweats is an underlying infection,  but you mention you had blood tests already ( at least a CBC should have been done to rule out infection).

Whereas the Plan-B (emergency contraceptive pill) contains 1.5 mg of progestogen which is commonly used within 72 hours after unprotected sex.So, if you want to use Marvelon as an effective alternative to Plan-B, you need to take multiple pills of Marvelon to approximate the 1.5 mg of Progesterone found in Plan-B. This amounts to overdose of hormones which can cause severe vomiting, breast tenderness, abdominal cramps, headache, tiredness and abnormal/irregular vaginal bleeding.

What is this?","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you so much for your question. Itchy on labia can be from vaginal discharge from Mirena IUD. Vaginal discharge is abnormal when it occurs with the following symptoms: Itching of the vagina or the area around vagina, redness, pain, or swelling around the vagina, discharge that is foamy, greenish-yellow, or has blood in it, discharge that smells bad, pain when urinating or having sex, pain in the lower part of the belly, fever.Different conditions can cause abnormal vaginal discharge. The most common causes are: An infection in the vagina, cervix or uterus, a reaction to something in the vagina that a woman forgot to take out, such as a tampon or condom, a reaction to a soap or other product that was in the vagina, changes in the body that occur after menopause.You should not treat abnormal vaginal discharge by yourself. Treating yourself can cause your symptoms to get worse. If you have abnormal vaginal discharge, see a doctor so that he or she can figure out the cause. Your doctor will talk with you and do an exam. He or she will also take a sample of your vaginal discharge, and do lab tests on the sample to look for an infection. The treatment will depend on the cause of the abnormal vaginal discharge. For example, different vaginal infections are treated with different medicines. If you have a vaginal infection, your doctor will  want to figure out what type of infection you have so that he or she can treat it with the right medicine. If it caused by certain types of infections, your sex partner will also need to see a doctor for treatment.Sometimes you can help prevent abnormal vaginal discharge by using warm water and unscented non-soap cleanser to wash your vulva ( the vulva is the area of skin around the outside of the vagina), taking baths in plain warm water, and not using scented bath products, not using sprays or powders on your vagina, not douching (douching is when a woman puts a liquid inside her vagina to rinse it out, not wiping with baby wipes or scented toiler paper after you use the toilet.Hope I have answered your question.

I was prescribed 50mg vyvanse for ADHD and started taking it yesterday ( at the recommended half dose.) I have had a migraine for 24 hours .... Is there a possibility the vyvanse is causing the migraine? Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi, Vyvanse is unlikely to cause migraines. Vyvanse (amphetamine derivative) commonly prescribed to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Its most common side effects include decreased appetite, insomnia, dry mouth, feeling irritable or anxious, dizziness, nausea or vomiting. The exact cause of migraines is not known. There are certain triggers such as lack of sleep, skipping a meal, caffeine or alcohol, and being under stress, sensory stimulation like unusually bright lights, loud noises, or strong smells, hormonal changes or while on birth control pills may also cause recurring migraines. Avoid those triggers and consult your treating doctor if there is no relief. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Whereas Nexito (Escitalopram) is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor commonly prescribed in the treatment of depression and generalized anxiety disorders. Taking Nexito along with Libotyp can increase the risk of a serious condition called the serotonin syndrome characterized by confusion, hallucination, seizure, increased heart rate and blood pressure, fever, excessive sweating, blurred vision, muscle stiffness, tremor, imbalance, stomach cramp, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. In its severe form it may result in coma and even death. So, it is not advisable to take Nexito while on Librotyp. It is not advisable to reduce the dose of Librotyp without consulting your treating doctor. So, dose can be gradually reduced under his supervision if he thinks it to be necessary.

Is the above all true.?if true how does premolut n works in these cases .Kindly give me a detailed explanation of what premolut n does with our hormones in these three cases?","Doctor":"Hi, Progesterone is a female sex hormone produced by the corpus luteum in the ovary following ovulation each month. It helps thicken the lining of the uterus to prepare for a fertilized egg and thus maintain the menstrual cycle and early stages of pregnancy. Primolut-N (Norethisterone) is a synthetic and potent progesterone hormone that stops uterine bleeding. At the time before a period, the level of progesterone falls and this causes the lining of the uterus to be shed as menstrual period. By taking Primolut-N tablets the levels of progesterone are kept artificially high, and so the period does not start and the period gets delayed. Primolut-N is also helpful in inducing (starting) the period by taking it at particular days throughout the cycle. Period will start two or three days after you stop taking the drug. So, it mimics like the natural female sex hormone progesterone and manipulates or modifies its action as explained above. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Less than two months afterwards I developed a bad skin rash/hives on my face, neck and arms. I consulted several doctors who could not give me an exact cause, and when asked about my new birth control pill being a cause they all adamantly said it would not. Ever since then I have had serious skin problems. Exzema runs in my family, but my skin reactions are way worse producing rashes around my eyes, mouth and face, which I have never experienced before. I have stopped wearing makeup and only use 100% natural skin products. I had allergy testing done as well, which came back completely negative so they diagnosed me with non-allergic rhinitis (which hormones do play a large role in) -- but the skin rashes still continue. Could this be a result from the pill (I m now taking Apri, with the same issues) and is there another option I can choose to minimize my severe skin reactions? The rashes do appear worse shortly before I start my period and especially when I m in the heat/sun. Any type of product or clothing seem to trigger a reaction, no matter how careful I am.","Doctor":"Hello, It is very less likely related to the consumption of birth control pill. Your allergy tests have come negative as well. As you mentioned you have a family history of eczema and its not necessary that the symptoms appear exactly similar to anyone else in the family. You also mentioned that exposure to sun or heat makes it worse, it's an allergic reaction as your skin is very sensitive. You can use a sunscreen lotion with your dermatologist's advice for better protection. I would suggest you visit an immunologist/rheumatologist regarding this. There might be a need for some blood tests to be done to see if the reason is autoimmune. Once it's clear, treating the underlying cause will be easy and the symptoms will eventually go away.

In fact Drotin itself is an antispasmodic which should help in reducing pain. Martinor is typically used for irregular uterine bleeding. The pain is likely because of the bleeding that you are currently having. If this persists for long or the pain is extreme I would suggest you visit your doctor for the same.

Virgin coconut oil (VCO) is claimed to be effective in the treatment of hair fall as it helps your hair grow longer, thicker, and faster. Wait for at least 2 to 4 hours after applying 2% minoxidil on the affected area of the scalp and allow it to dry completely to ensure its maximum effectiveness.  Then you may use VCO.

GERD occurs when stomach contents move back into the throat. This may cause  a burning sensation in the chest  known as heartburn.Once cardiac condition has  been excluded , the most common cause of chest pain  is GERD.I would like to say that treatment of GERD  is done according to the following guidelinesPatients are often prescribed a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) also called a PPI trial(eg omeprazole). They must be taken at least 30-60 minutes before breakfast.If the patient responds, the treatment can be continued for at least 8 weeks.For patients not responding to a PPI(as in your case) alone  a combination of PPI with  Levosulpiride should be tried for 4 weeks.Low doses  from the class of drugs known as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are used in patients not responding to PPI'S and levosulpiride cobination.These medications are felt to produce their favorable effect by reducing pain transmission from the esophagus to the brain. The two most commonly used agents are imipramine and trazodone.For patients not responding to either acid inhibition trial or TCA , esophageal motility testing (a study done to evaluate the muscle contractions of the swallowing pipe) may be done to look for other uncommon causes of chest pain such as achalasia. Esophageal achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder involving the smooth muscle layer of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), Achalasia is characterized by difficulty in swallowing, regurgitation, and sometimes severe chest pain and burning sensation.A peptic ulcer are one of the most important cause of dizziness,chest heaviness and explains all your symptoms.its not your heart its because of gastritis and ATT increases it"},{"Patient":"I have taken Devry tablet for 5 days (3 per day) I took the last tablet 5 days ago and have not yet got my periods.

Now the swelling has returned and this tim Furosemide not working at all. Feet and legs still swollen, hurts to walk, no weight loss even though I am urinating 2-4 times an hour. I don t know what s going on this time. I am taking meds, but I was taking the same meds before when the Furosemide worked the first time. What could it be, and what can I do that might help the Furosemide to be more aggressive on this swelling I have?","Doctor":"Hello, Well, lyrica and gabapentin  are from almost same class. you should increase dose of furosemide to 40mg once a day and you should restrict fluid intake(water+tea+ juices +any other drinkable item) to almost to 750 to 1000ml per day in total. Meanwhile, you should investigate for other causes of edema feet, like a TSH, Albumin levels, and an Echocardiogram and renal function tests.Hope I have answered your query.

Prior to beginning chemo. she experienced severe pain in her feet, then lower legs and now knees. She is taking a low dose of Prednisone which the doctor was hesitant to give her due to side effects but she finds a slight relief from it. She does not communicate well with her oncologist and her husband of 40 years appears to be in shock. She is suffering a great deal and her oncologist has prescribed Dilaudid which she takes at night but it does not address any real issue. Do you have any ideas which might offer her some relief?","Doctor":"Hello, I will suggest you to increase the dose of dilaudid. If still problem persists she can be offered nerve block for lower limb. Other than that you should work upon the exact cause of pain in her lower limb like you can do venous and arterial Doppler of lower limb and CPK levels. Once these tests and Doppler studies are done we can draw future course of action.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

The problem has grown with time. Last year in USG, ~100 mal PVR was found, the uroflowmetry was not good and in cystoscopy, the comment prostate grade I congested was made. Now I don t feel the intense burning feeling at the time of urination but a more often irritation is there, specially after the ejaculation (even in normal time). Recently in RUG the urethra is seen to be narrowed (in a small region under the prostate) and my doctor prescribed the following medicine to see the responce: Niftran 100 mg and Silodal (silodosin) 4 mg. Afetr taking them on the very first day, I noticed the semen become very much liquid during ejculation. Is it a severe side effect and will it continue?? Is there a great possibility of getting cured by these medication? What are the most common treatment to this? No infection was ever found in urine or semen. Thanks ... Rustam","Doctor":"Hello Dr Faisal here,I have read and understood your query, I will tell u that niftran and silodosin doesn't have any such side effect. semen keeps on changing its consistency depending on hydration status.semen is  initially well formed and liquefies with  passage of time(liquefaction time). these drugs will help you a little .Niftran is for infection and it has to be taken for 7 to 10 days. the other drug(silodal) is a urethral dilator and it will help you in a long run.  if it doesn't settle and it is making a lot of trouble only then you should undergo dilatation maneuvers surgically . but i will suggest you that if u can take it along, don't worry much about this problem.

This drug should not be given when there is suspicion for intestinal obstruction or gastrointestinal bleeding. Otherwise it shouldn't cause problems to a healthy individual.

The antihypertensive medications may cause hypotension or postural hypotension, so you should always check your blood pressure when you feel weak, dizzy or feel you're going to faint. The antiplatelet drug (loprin) may increase the risk for bleeding, so you should avoid injuries particulary of the head and you should always check your stool for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding (black stool). Finally the lipid-lowering drug may increase your blood sugar, may cause muscle aches and liver toxicity. Blood tests will reveal most of these disorders. I hope I've answered your question. Please let me know if you need further assistance.Kind Regards,Dr Panagiotis Zografakis,Internal Medicine Specialist"},{"Patient":"i have severe stomach pain under my left rib cage,i ate a rather large bag of honey roast cashews and peanuts last night,got up this morning with mild pain but has got worse during the day,is there any meds i can take for this as it s getting really uncomfortable .","Doctor":"Hello,treating stomach pain without a diagnosis is risky because this kind of pain can be caused by various serious and less serious disorders. I would suggest visiting your doctor for an assessment before trying anything. If you can't visit a doctor then trying an antacid may help if your symptoms are related to gastric irritation. The antacid may provide fast relief when acidity is the cause.I hope I've answered your question.

Coenzyme q10 is an antioxidant normally produced in our body and also available in many nutritional food sources. Chronic diseases and the aging process can reduce the body levels of coenzyme q and hence certain studies recommend supplementation of the same from outside. Although no known major drug interactions have been recorded between these two drugs, I would suggest to screen yourself for hypertension, increased cholesterol levels and ECG to assess cardiovascular risk since you have a strong family history. If cardiovascular risk is present consider the use of antiplatelets and statins after consultation and avoid danshen since it can interact with the above drugs. Hope I have answered your query.

Normally upon standing from lying position, cardiovascular regulation by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) prevents more than a 5–10mm Hg drop in SBP, increases DBP and increases the pulse rate by 10–25 beats per minute (bpm).Mild dehydration(dry mouth) can cause also symptoms of orthostatic hypotension,Take plenty of water  orally.In case of significant postural drop in BP,go for serum cortisol level at 0800 AM, to exclude adrenocortical insufficiency.Regards, Dr Tushar Kanti Biswas, Internal Medicine Specialist"},{"Patient":"My daughter has just been told she has systolic heart disease.

The pattern of consumption (speed, time frame and without food), affects risk too.sex can be done normally 72 hours  after cardioversion  but donot take  sildenafil or tadalafil as they increases blood supply to penis and hence supply to coronary artery is reducedthanks"},{"Patient":"Hay I have a problem with the pill am taking cerazette I have bin taking it for 2 mounts and I have just started my 3rd Packit and I have had epasoids of diearhea and I herd that it can stop the pill well long story short I had unpertected sex with my boyfriend and now am worried.","Doctor":"Hi, Oral contraceptive gets absorbed in the upper gastrointestinal tract rapidly &the inbuilt hormone starts acting.

We ascended to Kangding in China where we were sleeping at an altitude of 2700m for five nights. Over the first couple of days I had a slight headache only when we went on a walk during a day trip which took us to 3700m. But on the 4th night I felt nauseous and had a racing heart.

And we decided to shorten our trip, so returning to normal sea level heights yesterday. I am resting still today and the tightness of chest has subsided.

Each pack of Levlen ED contains 28 pills of which there are 21 hormone-containing pills ('beige' or active) and 7 hormone-free ('white' inactive) pills, to allow each monthly cycle to end with a withdrawal bleed. Ideally, you should start taking the combined pills on the first day of your period (day one of your menstrual cycle) you will be protected from pregnancy straight away. You will not need additional contraception. If you start the pill after the fifth day of your period, you will not be protected from pregnancy straight away and will need additional contraceptives such as condoms until you have taken the pill for seven days. It is okay to start taking the 'white or inactive pill' by mistake since you have taken the 'active or beige' pills later on. Continue to take a 'beige' pill at the same time each day until the pack is finished. Then take those six white or inactive pills  (during these days you will get a bleed). Start your next pack of pills on the eighth day, whether you are still bleeding or not. This should be the same day of the week as when you took your first pill. Hope I have answered your query.

Yasmin is a combined oral contraceptive pill that contains two different hormones viz. estrogen and progesterone. Taking these pills can cause hormonal balance which helps the yeast to grow. It is believed that the estrogen in birth control pills can cause the vagina to produce more sugars. These sugars feed the yeast already living in the vagina causing overgrowth and thus infection (vaginal thrush or candidiasis). It is a similar effect to that seen in pregnancy when estrogen levels rise naturally.

Obtain a copy of the report, and then we could analyze or translate it for you.  Echocardiograms take sonogram pictures of your heart.  They look at the chambers and valves and other structures in and near your heart, in a similar way that sonogram pictures are done on pregnant women to look at the structures of the developing fetus.  The sound waves also can be used to estimate the pressures in certain parts of your heart.  Being told you have \\"pressure\\" in your chest is only part of the story.  We all have \\"pressure readings\\" in our chests; the question is what is the number of that pressure reading, and is it normal or high or low.  I'm not sure what the statement \\"blood…also around my lungs\\" means.  Echocardiograms sometimes can also detect abnormal fluid collections around the heart or around the lungs.  These are called \\"effusions,\\" but we don't know just from looking at the Echo pictures whether they are composed of blood or water or pus, for instance.  So, I think the best thing for you to do is not to worry yet; just obtain a copy of the report so your doctor or I or one of us here can interpret it.\\"Blood in my heart chambers\\" means you are alive!

It can definitely cause the symptoms you described (which are more likely related to your thyroid problem then your parathyroid). If I saw you in clinic, I would prescribe a 'beta blocker' like Metoprolol or Carvedilol to control your symptoms and your blood pressure.I am not sure what to make of the red spots on your stomach. I would need to know how long they were there for, the pattern of distribution, are the itchy/painful... etc. If you are concerned about them, I would recommend that you speak to your primary care physician or a dermatologist about them.

I am currently taking 75mg of Cytalopram and multi-vitamin tablets..","Doctor":"Hi, Yes, a false-positive pregnancy test can occur with medications having hCG as well as certain other medications. Routine home pregnancy tests work by detecting the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in a urine sample. So, the intake of medications containing hCG can show a false positive pregnancy test.

Thanks so much, Worried grandmother to be","Doctor":"Hello, There is no documented harmful effects in either mother or in the growing baby. Pertussis vaccine is not available alone it is usually given in combination with tetanus and diphtheria vaccines (Tdap vaccine). Babies who get whooping cough can have serious complications such as pneumonia, convulsions, and brain damage. Hence it is very important for pregnant women to get vaccinated against pertussis ('whooping cough').

Please tell me can i take that tablet.does that tablet cause severe side effect?.I need baby naturally without any sideeffect doctor.Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello, Letroze (letrozole) is commonly prescribed as an infertility treatment especially in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) to conceive. Let me explain its mode of action so that you can get an insight about its possible side effects which are well tolerated. Letrozole works by inhibiting aromatase thereby suppressing estrogen production. Aromatase is an enzyme that is responsible for the production of estrogen in the body so when this enzyme is inhibited by the letrozole, estrogen levels are suppressed. This results in the brain and pituitary gland increasing the output of FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) which helps in ovulation (release of egg from the ovary). As far as the side effects are concerned, generally, it is well tolerated by most women however low estrogen levels can cause hot flashes, headaches, and breast tenderness. There is no documented evidence of any harmful effects on the growing baby. So, in view of the above you can take it safely as prescribed by your doctor for the treatment of infertility associated with PCOD. Hope I have answered your query.

A baby’s body and most internal organs are formed during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. It is mainly during this time that some medicines are known to cause birth defects. No studies have been done to establish its safety for the growing baby. However, if your symptoms cannot be controlled in any other way, the use of an antispasmodic in pregnancy might be considered. When deciding whether or not to take an antispasmodic during pregnancy it is important to weigh up the benefits of use against the known or possible risks, some of which will depend on how many weeks pregnant you are. You must consult your doctor to see what is right for you and your baby considering your symptoms of IBS. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Galvus (Vildagliptin) belongs to a class of drug known as DDP-4 inhibitors which works by blocking the breakdown of ‘incretin’ hormones in the body. These hormones are released after a meal and stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin. By increasing levels of incretin hormones in the blood, galvus stimulates the pancreas to produce more insulin when blood glucose levels are high. It is widely used either alone or along with other antidiabetic drugs like metformin in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The most common side effects of galvus include headache, nasopharyngitis, cough, constipation, dizziness, and increased sweating which gradually wean off over a period of time. The most common side effects of metformin include abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and very rarely a serious condition called 'lactic acidosis'. Every drug has its own side effects but it is not essential that everyone will get that. There are many drugs used for treating diabetes. But there is not a single drug which does not has its known side effects. If you are not comfortable with the side effects of galvus met you have to discuss with your doctor to prescribe an alternate effective but a safer medication for the control of your blood sugar.

She also has sinus tachycardia.","Doctor":"Hi,Suggestive of thyronorm overdose. Too much and too sudden an increase in thyronorm may cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism including increased heart rate (sinus tachycardia) which leads to increase in blood pressure. Thyronorm needs to be taken consistently daily, preferably on an empty stomach in the morning around the same time each day. If a drug is designed to be taken every 24 hours and the patient takes it every 48 hours, that means the drug will lose its effectiveness after 24 hours. The drug level in the blood will drop below therapeutic level, and once the patient takes the medication 48 hours later, the body will overcompensate for the sudden increase in dose and symptoms of hyperthyroidism will develop.

Surgery to close the hole will occur when the doctors feel she is old enough.  Her and her mother are the typical 'boy who cried wolf' complainers.

Finax (finasteride) acts by reducing the conversion of testosterone (male sex hormone) into its active form dihydrotestosterone. Dihydrotesterone is thought to be responsible for the development of alopecia (male baldness) hence finax is used to treat male baldness.Since dihydrotestosterone levels return to normal within 4 to 6 weeks after discontinuation of treatment with finax, hence, you will overcome erectile dysfunction 6 weeks after stopping the finax.

Height is normally determined by the genes and up to some extent by the environmental factors such as nutrition.The growth plates, or epiphyseal plates, are the areas of specialized cartilage near the end of your long bones. Increase in height is due to the lengthening of your long bones, as long as your growth plates are active or “open.”At puberty (around 16 years in females and 14 to 19 years in males) due to hormonal changes the growth plates close and thus the lengthening of bones stop. Even with a healthy diet, the height won’t increase after age 18 to 20. The efficacy of Gloxi Height Enhancement is not being established by any clinical study.Hope I have answered your query.

Different factors may contribute to this group of complications, such as arterial or venous mesenteric thrombosis or in an overwhelming majority of cases nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia.Proximal colon distension, in the absence of an obstructing cause, have been reported by multiples studies on cardiac surgery.

The appropriate therapy is decompression by colonoscopy or, if not effective or possible at all, a colostomy at the hepatic flexure may be required. Patients with paralytic ileus were successfully treated by enemas and nasogastric aspiration. In some cases, cholinergic drugs have been described to be helpful.the major life-threatening complication following open-heart surgery is intestinal ischemia which has a tremendously high mortality.

Then the amniotic fluid decreases to the end to reach a volume between 600 and 800 ml approximately.The flow of the amniotic fluid signals the rupture of the membrane, and the risk of premature delivery if the term of the pregnancy is not reached.When the amount of amniotic fluid is abnormally low compared to the term of pregnancy, it is called oligoamnios. During oligoamnios, infection rate is higher.The premature rupture of the membranes (rupture before the beginning of the work) concerns 5 to 10% of the pregnancies. Its risk factors are the same as those of spontaneous preterm birth with intact membranes. This patient received a punch on her abdomen, which caused a premature rupture of the membranes and then a loss of the entirety amniotic fluid then an oligoamnios was created, and during the 2 weeks before the hospitalization, there was infection of the genital and baby components and infection dissemination by haematogenous route Causing endocarditis.Sorry for your daughter and may god has his soul in peace."},{"Patient":"I am 22 yrs old and my weight is 65 kg I would prefer to take advice from the expert before using decdan as my younger brother is already using the tablet and his weight is 75 now.

Go see your doctor, and check your thyroid levels to make sure your Levoxyl dose is correct.  Too little can affect the hair and nails, too much can cause arrhythmias and heart fluttering.Alternatively, a common cause of toenails falling off is a fungal infection of the toenail beds.  If the blood work is normal, your regular doctor or a dermatologist would recognize if there is a fungal infection and treat you with the proper antibiotic pill or topical antibiotic cream.

I had a BP of 140/90 in a test taken about 6 months back and the doctor recommended I take Losartan 50 mg - which I've been taking every day.  I recently started running again (1-2 miles per day - every day) and my pulse is going very high (as high as 190s) within 1 mile.  Do I need beta blockers or ACE inhibitors instead of/in addition to Losar?","Doctor":"Your \\"maximum predicted heart rate,\\" the fastest your heart is expected to be able to go, is 220 minus your age, which is about 188.  If you jog or run, and your heart rate is going quickly up to 190, then it most likely is that, since you \\"recently started running again,\\" you may be accelerating to quickly than what your body is used to.  Doctors or physiologists call it \\"deconditioning,\\" others call it \\"being out of shape.\\"  It just means that you should either run at a slower pace or a shorter distance for a week or 2, and then gradually build it up.  As your body gets used to the regular running, your cardiovascular conditioning will improve, and your pulse will not rise as quickly; also, you will be able to run faster and farther before your pulse gets up to 190.  Generally, when we advise people on an exercise program, we recommend aiming for a heart rate of 75% of your age-predicted maximal heart rate--in your case at age 32, that would be about 141.  When we do stress tests, we aim for 85% of that maximal heart rate, which in your case would be around 160.  Just take your running pace more slowly or a shorter distance, and make sure you pre-hydrate before running.  Dehydration can make one's pulse more rapid with exercise.You do not need beta blockers to slow your heart, unless your doctor feels your resting heart rate is too fast.  Make sure you get your blood pressure checked again (6 months ago is too long ago, if you have a symptom of which you are not sure of its significance).

Is it true that after a length of time he will start having trouble again.  Male 73 5-9  weight 220. He now has been diagn with parkinsons and had a severe back surgery that keeps hm from bein mobile. Just wondering about the heart thing.","Doctor":"Yes, unfortunately heart disease is a chronic, lifelong, progressive, and often recurrent disease.  Having had bypass surgery corrects the blood flow at the time of surgery, but, over time, the same processes that caused fatty plaques to deposit in the walls of the original or \\"natural\\" arteries will continue to occur in the \\"bypass\\" arteries.  Some bypass arteries, transplanted veins, are more susceptible than others to this process.  Bypass arteries that used to be actual arteries (like the Left Internal Mammary Artery or \\"LIMA,\\" an artery that supplies blood to the muscles and structures of the chest wall, and can be re-directed in open heart surgery to feed the LAD--Left Anterior Descending Artery--at the front of the heart) will usually hold up better over time, but even these can eventually succumb to plaque formation.You mentioned that your husband is significantly obese and is very sedentary, which are factors that work against him avoiding further coronary artery disease.  It is often difficult for people with Parkinson's Disease and also with chronic severe back pain to get enough aerobic exercise safely, so I understand the difficulties he would have with this.A few questions I have for you are:  is he seeing a Cardiologist or a Primary Doctor on a regular basis?  Is he diabetic?  Is his cholesterol optimally controlled or not?  Is he on a statin drug (to lower cholesterol levels, and which have been proven to prevent MI's, cardiovascular deaths, and recurrent plaque formation in people who have had prior cardiac events or interventions)?  Does he smoke cigarettes?The answers to those questions above will be important in knowing whether your husband's medical situation is optimized to prevent the development of new arterial blockages in either his 12-year-old bypass arteries or even worsening disease of his natural arteries.  One way to find out if he has developed significant blockages in any of his heart's arteries, despite maybe  being unable to exercise or walk long or fast or far enough to develop angina would be to have a Nuclear Stress Test, in which his doctor would give him a medication in his IV that makes the heart think it is exercising, followed by a radioactive imaging agent that creates a picture of the blood flow in his heart.  That would tell us how his blood flows under exercise or stress conditions compared with his \\"natural\\" or \\"resting\\" state.  If his blood flow seems abnormal, his doctor might adjust his medications or might refer him for an angiogram to see whether and where and how severe the blocked arteries might be.  He wouldn't necessarily require a repeat open heart surgery if new blockages are confirmed, since the more common situation nowadays is that he could be treated with ballooning and/or stenting of his blocked artery if that is what would be discovered.  Good luck, and write back if we may be of further help to you, or if you have any further questions about anything I've said above."},{"Patient":"Hi, I started taking shelcal 500 since last week under doctor s prescription (since i was having severe leg pain for past one month).

When there are symptomatic heart diseases, the types of abnormalities are varied and include ST segment depression or elevation, flattening of the T wave, biphasic T waves, or T wave inversion. Significant ST segment depression usually means that there is significant diminution of the coronary blood flow conditioning myocardial ischemia but flow still exist (low blood flow) in the heart. Significant ST segment elevation means a total blood flow obstruction and there has been an acute infarction of heart muscle. ST segment changes without symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, exercise intolerance, …etc.) means absolutely nothing bad for your health, but should prompt further investigations. ST segment changes can range from being an important tool diagnosing underlying diseases to a variant of EKG normality, and may be seen in any lead of the electrocardiogram. Factors affecting the ST-T configuration may include, intrinsic myocardial disease (ischemia, infarction, myocarditis), Drugs (digoxin, quinidine, etc..), Ions electrolyte abnormalities, neurogenic factors (stroke, trauma, tumor, etc.), metabolic factors (diabetes, etc..), Atrial electric abnormalities (fast heart rates the atrial T wave may pull down the beginning of the ST segment), ventricular conduction abnormalities and rhythms originating in the ventricles.your cardiologist is right may this answer help you and best wishes."},{"Patient":"Good afternoon doctor , i was put on Warferin for life, i suffer extreme pain in my back and hipjoints i want to stop the warfiren and use Disprin cardio care as it says on the package it unclots the blood same as what warfein does. is it safe for me to do so?","Doctor":"Hello, I am not sure what Disprin cardio care is, but it sounds like it might be aspirin, in which case it would not be safe to replace your Warfarin with it.

They have been reluctant to say anything except, we cannot do anything more but keep her comfortable - but no outlook on how long she will have to suffer. Thanks!","Doctor":"hi and pleased to answer youHeart failure is a condition, a set of symptoms where the heart cannot provide the blood flow necessary for the needs to the body. Heart failure usually develops slowly after a heart damage, caused by a heart attack, excessive heart fatigue after years of untreated hypertension or valvulopathy. Symptoms of heart failure are not always obvious. In the early stages of heart failure, some people have no symptoms. Others may present symptoms such as fatigue or breathing difficulty due to old age. But sometimes the symptoms of heart failure are more obvious. Due to the inability of the heart to effectively feed your organs (such as the kidneys and the brain), you may experience a number of symptoms, such as: A breathing difficulty, swelling of the feet and legs, Lack of energy, feeling tired, sleeping difficulty at night due to breathing problems, swelling of the abdomen, loss of appetite. Some people are more likely than others to develop heart failure. No one can predict who will develop it, but there are known risk factors. Knowing the risk factors and consulting a doctor for early treatment is a good strategy for managing heart failure. Risk Factors for Heart Failure are: Hypertension, Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction), Valvar Abnormalities, Cardiomyopathy, Family History of Heart Failure, Diabetes. Your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, limit salt intake, lose weight or reduce stress levels. These changes can help alleviate some of the symptoms of heart failure and decrease the fatigue of your heart. Many medications are used to treat heart failure. Your doctor may prescribe ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, anticoagulants, and diuretics, among others. Generally, a combination of drugs is used. May be that the implantation of a cardiac device called a cardiac resynchronization device is indicated for you. It sends tiny electrical pulses to the lower chambers of your heart to help them beat in a more coordinated or \\"synchronized\\" way. This can help improve the pumping efficiency of the heart. Some people feel the need to meet other patients. Hospitals, health centers and local newspapers can provide information on patient associations or associations for the caregivers. During palliative care in heart failure three components are essential: palliative medical treatment of heart failure, education of the patient and his family, accompaniment by the doctor and the caregivers.During Palliative medical treatment two points are necessary to emphasize:- Optimal use of combination therapy: diuretics + IEC + beta blocker and ivabradine + spironolactone and / or ARAII, each stage of which reduces the death rate under optimal conditions of use by 30% (studies MERIT-HF, TRACE, SOLVD and SHIFT), insofar as it does not aggravate the patient's discomfort by hypotension, hyponatremia, bradycardia or asthenia.- The value of cardiological follow-up. Indeed, regardless of the stage of heart failure, adherence to treatment and patient education divide morbi-mortality by 2, according to the Mahler multicenter study. This emphasizes the importance of effective follow-up in the networking of a doctor-treating physician-cardiologist network. The education of the cardiac insufficiency is fundamental, because the patient must understand his treatment to grasp the importance of each medication; It should also be informed of the potential side effects of each therapeutic class, and the purchase of a quality scales and cuff tensiometer is necessary for home follow-up. At all stages of heart failure, physical activity is theoretically a necessary complement, but it will be gradually decreased, depending on the patient's exhaustion (reduced stair climbing, walking in a corridor, gymnastics, sometimes simple movements repeated in the chair or the bed, without objective performance).Relationships with the family are essential at this stage Sometimes it is the partner alone who ensures a watchful eye and participates in the monitoring of dyspnea and edema. It must be informed about the severity of the illness without worrying about it, train it in the monitoring of anticoagulant treatments, the use of nitrates or diuretics and the adaptation of a balanced diet and, stable as to the amount of salt. It must acquire a certain knowledge, the doctor and the care team being of course the guarantors of this learning, which must be adapted to each person, to each couple, according to the knowledge and the anxiety of each one. It is difficult to give a schema that will have to be adapted to the patient's sensitivity and to the experience of the disease. This participation of the entourage is fundamental, especially during outbreaks of heart failure. It makes possible treatments that the patient could no longer provide alone. It makes it possible to mobilize it, to ensure a hygiene of life and a dietetic which it is impossible to guarantee in the isolated patient. Rehabilitation, which could, before this palliative period, of course be carried out in specialized centers, is rather deleterious and exhausting in this context. It is at this stage that palliative care takes its place, but the mere evocation comes at first to offset the patient's vision of the long course of his illness sustained by the unrelenting hope of a prolonged life. The illusion of the omnipotence and endless mastery of this fragile heart is brutally thwarted by the reality of the patient's exhaustion and permanent dyspnea, and by the aggravation of edema. The work in collaboration with the generalist is essential here: adjustment of strategies and consistency of discourse, in order not to induce contradictions or misunderstandings. This is the time for the progressive release and taking of modalities - even injunctions! - previously usual in the patient: -     acceptance of decreased exercise, periods of decubitus, especially in the elderly patient;-     tolerance of deviations of diet, because it is necessary to privilege \\"feeding pleasure\\" (the salt cursed will restore taste!);-     decrease in biological controls, because the reduction of technical constraints is crucial for the quality of life in this period (this point is especially difficult for the prescriber ...);-     at the ultimate stage: use of small doses of morphine to slow tachypnea (starting with 3-5 mg orally, 2-4 times daily depending on symptom efficacy) and sedative to Doses important and regular in front of an anguish sometimes serious because it occurs while the subject is lucid;-     some particularly painful dyspneic situations, which the patient describes as unbearable, fall within the scope of the recommendations for progressive sedation for severe symptoms: these sedations are easier to perform in hospitals, but the involvement of an attentive generalist and Good team of nurses makes this strategy also possible at home;sometimes, patients with severe heart failure but \\"not letting go\\" remain both eager to live and desperate for their addiction; A hospitalization in a palliative care unit, where the intensity of relational support will facilitate the end of life, can then be justified. These patients present insoluble logistical difficulties to the acute services because their life spans far exceed the administrative possibilities of these services ... in terms of average length of stay. Palliative care units often see these patients who, after 3 or 4 weeks of precarious situation enameled by episodes of terminal dyspnea leading to an imminent death, stabilize and continue for months a minimalist life (bed-chair)! This time can sometimes give them the opportunity to move towards the gradual abandonment of activities that their bodies can no longer assume ... but in this context, we can guess all the work of accompaniment and psychological support necessary for these patients and Confronted with an incomprehensible prolongation of the patients slowed-down life. The desire for life that persists beyond this ineffective myocardium: that is the real delicate challenge, and which requires a great humility to accompany the great cardiac insufficiency.may this help you and best wishes."},{"Patient":"hi from 10 days my bleeding cant stop .so i want to use Novelon tablets from today onwards.In 1 pack 21 tablets r there this course will be going for 3 months .so give me advise how to use these tablets. give me reply asap.please understand my problem thank u","Doctor":"Most women will have a period around 2 to 4 weeks after stopping the pill, but this depends on you and what your cycle is normally like.

The diagnosis is suspected on the ECG and confirmed by ultrasound.Among the causes of left ventricular hypertrophy are age, intensive practice of one or more sports, obesity, prolonged hypertension.The seriousness of hypertension arises from its impact on a number of organs (target organs). The complications that can develop at their level explain the increased morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension. The heart is one of the main target organs, and one of the first consequences of elevated blood pressure (PA) is left ventricular hypertrophy (HVG). The heart adapts to high blood pressure by increasing the volume, resulting in an increase in oxygen consumption by the heart muscle. As a result, coronary vascularization may gradually become insufficient. Progressively, the diastolic function (see DIASTOLE) then systolic (see SYSTOLE) will alter. In addition, this increase in volume of the left ventricle may cause ventricular rhythm disturbances (ventricular extrasystole for example) and poor vascularization of the deep layers of the myocardium (risk of INFARCTUS).I advise you not to stop your antihypertensive treatment (keep it for life)To practice a hygiene of life with especially a diet without salt (look at the dash or dietetary approach to stop hypertension see  every day (45 minutes per 24 hours)And consult your cardio as quickly as possible.may this infos help youbest wishes"},{"Patient":"ben here i am coming off epilim after 42 yrs i did have epilepsy my neurologist says i dont have it eny more buti have pnes sieures in stead irealy dont know witch worse having epilepsy or the psycogenic non epilepic attacks the aed drug is epilim what a the withdral afects","Doctor":"Hi, If you're taking sodium valproate for epilepsy, do not stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor first.

What can I take?My age is 35, I'm female, I'm 5'4 and weigh about 212lbs","Doctor":"Thank you and very pleased to answer you.your body mass index or BMI is 36.126 kg/m2 Normal weight BMI IS under 25Class II Obesity BMI is equal or more than 35 and under 40. you are a Class II Obesity and you suffer from hypertension and depression.Obesity is a risk factor in high blood pressure, especially android obesity (i.e. an excess of abdominal adipose tissue). Weight gain in adulthood, particularly in the abdomen, is the consequence of several factors: age, hyperactivity of the sympathetic system, a change in energy yields, a bad reaction to stress, relative hyperphagia that can be caused by drug medicine or other circumstances, hyperinsulinemia, Insulin resistance, these factors being favorable to the increase in blood pressure. The obese have a higher blood mass whereas the renal flow remains stable, the ratio of renal flow / cardiac output is therefore lowered which leads to chronic renal ischemia (hypertension). It would appear from recent studies that abdominal fat develops intense metabolic activity, that is to say that it is the seat of a permanent turnover, which leads to an increased release of free fatty acids in the portal circulation, causing hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance. Moreover, it seems that during its metabolism this abdominal fat produces pathogenic substances, especially angiotensin II, especially at the time of digestion (angiotensin II: very important factor of arterial hypertension).Therefore, the obese hypertensive must imperatively lose about 10 to 15% of the starting weight, this gradually. It should be noted that every kilo eliminated causes a drop of 1.6 mm of mercury for the systolic and 1.3 mm of mercury for the diastolic.The adjuvant treatment consists of taking anti-angiotensin drugs, in particular the LOSARTAN which is an exclusive antagonist of angiotensin II receptors, and which also treats hypertension.Of course, angiotensin I inhibitors that inhibit the transformation of angiotensin I into angiotensin II, (example LISINOPRIL) which is responsible for arterial hypertension, retain their full value.Then I would change you Lisinopril to Losartan 50 once daily and I would like you to consult a dietician. For your depression treatment, some study incriminates paroxetine as a cause of obesity, but you can consult your pshychiatrist about possibility of changing it.Best wishes"},{"Patient":"I did the gastric bypass 3 years ago .6 months now i notice my face getting darker i dont know why . the rest of my body remain the same. i dont not stay out in the sun. i am taking all my vitamins also b12 vit. could too much vitamin cause only my face to go dark? or the vitamin D.","Doctor":"Hello,Over dose vitamins like vitamin A can cause skin pigmentation.

Infertility is defined as the inability of a couple to become pregnant after one year of unprotected intercourse in women under 35 years of age and after six months in women 35 or older. The ability of a couple to become pregnant depends on normal fertility in both the male and female partners. Because pregnancy requires normal fertility in both the male and female , health care providers routinely involve both partners in the evaluation.A women can have trouble getting pregnant for different reasons. Include: problem with ovulation. Ovulation is a time in a woman's monthly cycle when the ovary releases an egg into the fallopian tube. Women have the highest chance of getting pregnant if they have sex 1 to 2 days before ovulation or on the day of ovulation. It is 14 days before your last menstruation period. Problem with the uterus or fallopian tubes- for example, some women have scar tissue in their fallopian tube from past infection or surgery. Endometriosis- is a condition that can cause pain in the lower part of the belly.  Your doctor will talk with you an do an exam. He or she will do often do tests to try to figure out the cause of the problem. Plus, your partner might need to be tested too. But dont be surprised if your doctor can not tell you what is wrong. It's not  always possible to find out why a woman cannot get pregnant.For you have a problem with ovulation.The method of ovulation induction selected should be based upon the underlying cause of anovulation(no ovulation) and the efficacy, costs, risks, and potential complications associated with each method as they apply to the individual women. Option include: Weight modulation( keep your BMI in standard level), Clomiphene citrate, Metforming or other indulin-sensitizing agents, Gonadotropin therapy, Aromatase inhibitors, Laparoscopic ovarian diathermy, assisted reproductive technology..For your problem your doctor choose to use Metformin(benforce-m). Insulin resistance in commonly observed in women with PCOS. Correction of hyperinsulinemia with metformin has a beneficial effect in anovulatory women with PCOS because this leads to an increase in menstrual cyclicity and enhanced spontaneous ovulation. However, live birth rates are not as high as those achieved with clomiphene. A consensus group has recommended against the routine use of metformin for ovulation induction except in women with glucose intolerance. However, the addition, metformnin may provide additional metabolic effects that are beneficial for pregnancy. If you are overweight, losing weight might help you become pregnant.

The etiology and pathophysiological mechanisms leading to the formation of angiodysplasia are not yet fully understood. A hypothesis developed by Boley is the appearance with age of a chronic partial obstruction of the submucosal veins in connection with an increase in contractions of the muscular layer of the colon wall. Investigations leading to the diagnosis of angiodysplasias are closely related to the clinical presentation and severity of digestive bleeding. The development of endoscopy techniques and the quality of video endoscopes used, particularly in terms of image resolution, make endoscopy the first pathway for the diagnosis of angiodysplasias. Treatment is indicated when there is external bleeding or when the bleeding is occult, after eliminating any other cause of bleeding. Asymptomatic I mean non-haemorrhagic, angiodysplasias of incidental discovery should not be treated. The principle of argon plasma coagulation treatment is based on the simultaneous release of an electric current and a gas, argon, which in its ionized form will destroy, in a targeted way and without contact (3 to 5 mm Of distance), the superficial mucosa (0.5 to 3 mm deep), destruction done with an electric arc. It is the reference technique for the destruction of angiodysplasias, whatever the location. Electrocoagulation treatment, or coagulation of angiodysplasias with hot forceps, was performed in the 1980s but is no longer recommended because of the high risk of perforation.The patient also has anemia following recurrent bleeding, and therefore what explains the symptoms. However, treatment is not only based on transfusions, but also on argon plasma coagulation to stop hemorrhage. A recent retrospective study showed a significant reduction in transfusion requirements in all patients treated with argon plasma coagulation. However, hemorrhagic recurrence occurred in 42% of patients after an average follow-up of 4.5 years.In this patient, the anti-aggregation treatment for ischemic heart disease should not be interrupted because of the risk of harming her life expectancy.The heart procedure indications which formally require further anticoagulant treatment may lead discussions with the patient, the surgeon and the cardiologist about the indication of a segmental intestinal surgery.May this informations help youBest wishes"},{"Patient":"I am being treated for shingles...my dr gave me Valtrex...I am a 3 yr breast cancer survivor...is there anything else I can be prescribed ...it doesn t seem to be getting any better and is spreading down my arm where I had lymph node removal...thank you","Doctor":"Hello,Brivir (brivudine) is an alternative treatment option for shingles but you shouldn't take such a decision yourself.

The degree of stenosis is a primordial argument but it is not the only one. Even if coronary stenosis is considered significant (> 70%), the decision to perform coronary angioplasty should correlate to other factors: - The clinical status (chest pain) - electrical modification (st+ and st-) - enzymatic elevation - Evidence of myocardial ischemia provided by the upstream examinations and which often motivated coronary angiography (stress test, scintigraphy). The indications for coronary angioplasty have been widened by the effectiveness of anti-aggregation treatments (reduction of the risk of thrombosis) but also technical advances (in particular active stents). At present angioplasty is often an alternative to surgery. Decisions and discussions are made on a case-by-case basis to enable the patient to benefit from the best therapeutic option for myocardial revascularization. For complex cases (multi-truncular, diabetic ...), cardiological societies have developed decision-making tools such as EuroScore or Syntax Score. These scores make it possible to choose objectively the therapeutic option with the best \\"benefit-risk\\" for the patient.The risks associated with the prolonged antiaggregant combination associated with active stents lead them to prefer in many cases bare metal stents, which require only a much shorter anti-aggregation treatment.  Active stents are of interest only to selected patients, in case of monotroncle lesions with a high risk of restenosis with lesions more than 15 mm or diameter of the vessel reached  less than 3 mm or diabetes. or in the case of first instent-restenosis of a bare metal stent, total coronary occlusion, stenosis of left unprotected common core or multi-renal lesions with a high risk of restenosis, Angioplasty is preferred to surgery (CABG or Coronary artery bypass grafting) after medico-surgical discussion.I urge you to accept the suggested methode by your doctor"},{"Patient":"gudevening!! i get urine infection everytime i have unprotected sex... to cure it i take cital syrup!! i want to know how can i prevent these frequent urinary infections even after havin unprotected sex???

Your blood pressure is perfect but your lipid balance is quite high. You are not dieting and your weight and age and sex are missing from the information you provided in your question.

The kidneys are the dose-limiting organs for radiotherapy to upper abdominal cancers and during total body irradiation. The incidence of radiotherapy-associated kidney injury is likely under-reported owing to its long latency and because the toxicity is often attributed to more common causes of kidney injury.

On the other hand, the plan B pill may cause your menstruation to be one week earlier or one week later, so you may have your periods when you do not expect them.

Then there are some antibiotics we know are bad and ones which are far less likely to be bad. the difference is how much they interact with our stuff rather than the germs stuff. Tetracycline not only somewhat has the same effect on us (but less) than with the germ BUT it also binds to bone/teeth. It's bad.

Methadone is both the worst and the best. It was removed from the market in the US (well, large sized pills of it) when it became the most lethal opiate many years ago. IT is associated with a 90%+ lowering death rate when addicts go on it instead of heroin/fentanyl. I really really need to get the word out on my research. Suboxone has double the rate of failure. It has likely double the rate of getting off drugs. Basically, getting off drugs is an aversion to bad stuff happening and a faster failure rate speeds up the process. So, to get someone off drugs, have them fail and have them not die. oh, wait, wrong order have them not die but have them fail. SO, first, getting into a treatment program with methadone or Suboxone.

Should I see a Psychiatrist and get on a different medication since my body had been rejecting the effexor XR after a year and a half of taking it? The Effexor XR has caused an enlarged prostate as well as unstable hypertension.","Doctor":"Hello, Cannot say in your particular situation but I would say there is an important differentiation between withdrawal from medicine with new symptoms that are just with the withdrawal AND go away in days to week. OR resumption of the underlying condition that the medicine treated (which stays) or uncovering of other benefits the medicine did. So, with suboxone, people get less pain and 50% get a paradoxical increase in energy from the medicine. These benefits go away when the medicine isn't there. They will be exactly as tired and as achy as they would be without the medicine forever. Effexor is not generally associated with enlarged prostate nor blood pressure effects. Would these go away 3 to 5 days after the drug is stopped and the time the drug is not present? Doubtful. I cannot say in your particular case but some features to consider, if the prostate and hypertension stay whether or not there is a drug there, then those conditions are not so associated with the drug. If the \\"withdrawal\\" symptoms are exactly those that prompted someone to start a medicine, it is a reason to stay on the medicine. Hope I have answered your query.

Although the possibility of gaining weight while taking lithium is well known, this side effect does not affect everyone who takes the medication. Kidney damage due to lithium may include acute (sudden) or chronic (long-term) kidney disease and kidney cysts. The amount of kidney damage depends on how long you have been taking lithium.

I started taking SeroquelXR 50mg and the past two nights have been restless, BP went up to 151/110, had hallucinations, and had for about an hour deathly thoughts. I think these were all side effects from the medication and not the anxiety attacks that I m use to due to I ve never hallucinated or had any bad thoughts with the anxiety attacks. With the anxiety attacks my BP usually does go up, heart races, dry mouth, shortness of breath, and at times I start shaking. It last for a couple of hours and then I m just drained but otherwise fine. I don t like having any of these symptoms regardless if it is the medication or anxiety. What can I do?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern and would explain that your symptoms could be related to seroquel XR adverse effects. Seroquel is usually useful to treat hallucinations and agitations, but it may also cause the opposite (aggravate them). You should discuss with your psychiatrist on the above issues. You may need to switch to another antidepressant like (sertraline, venlafaxine or mirtazapine), which have not the same adverse effects as seroquel XR.

He went back to the doctor and was told that the antibotics were still in his system and that he would experience these symptoms until the body ridded itself of the medication.

Abortion, also know as pregnancy termination, is a medical procedure that is done to end pregnancy. There are 2 main ways to do an abortion: Medication abortion- you take pills to end pregnancy. This only works until 10 weeks into a pregnancy (that means 10 weeks after your last period). It is also sometimes called ''medical abortion''. Women who have a medication abortion need to take 2 separate medicines. Surgical abortion- a doctor uses surgical tools to end the pregnancy. This can be done in the first or second trimester. The procedure take 15 to 30 minutes, but most women spend a few hour at the clinic.Medical abortion, you will take a medicine called mifepristone. 1 to 2 days later, you will take another medicine. This one is called misoprostol. You can take second medicine at home. The medicines cause your body to end the pregnancy. It might take 4 to 6 hours after taking the second medicine for this to happen. When it does, you will bleed from you vagina. You might also see blood clots or piece of tissue. Common symptoms of medical abortion include pain and cramp in the lower abdomen after you take second medicine. This last for up to 6 hours. Bleeding from the vagina. bleeding can be very heavy for a few hours after you take misoprostol. Light bleeding might go on for a few weeks. There also fever, nausea , vomiting and diarrhea. In some cases, abortions do not work completely. in other words, they do not always get rid of all the pregnancy tissue. if that happens to you, you will need to have a procedure to remove any leftover tissu. Sign that an abortion was not complete include bleeding for more than 2 weeks after an abortion, not having a period in the first 6 weeks after an abortion.After medical abortion, your first period may longer than usual, because the treatment uses hormones that may impact your cycle length. This period can also be heavier as the body may have additional tissue to expel after the procedure. I recommend you to use pads during the first period after an abortion that allows the doctor to monitor the amount of blood you are losing. The second period after an abortion is likely to return to how an individual's periods were before. Some women may find that it takes two or three cycles for their periods to return to normal. if this does not happen, you should go to see your doctor. Etamsylate, no need in this case. You can wait and see. If you feel fatigue from heavy bleeding, you may need your doctor to reevaluate your condition. Hope I have answered your query.
