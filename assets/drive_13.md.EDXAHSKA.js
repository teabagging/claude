If we subtract sin beta (i.e., BA) from BO, the resulting difference isOC = sin alpha - sin betaIf we want sin alpha - sin beta = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, we construct the value frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, measure it along one leg of the right angle to a length OC (<1). The ray starting from C and forming a 45^circ angle with CB intersects the unit circle at point A. The segment OA provides the desired angles alpha and beta.Remark: It is clear that this construction method is not only applicable in this case but also always when alpha and beta need to be constructed such that their sum is 90^circ, and the difference of their sines is any number between 0 and 1 that can be constructed with a compass and straightedge.

For any real number in its domain, an even function satisfies f(-x)=f(x); the domain of an odd function or an even function is always symmetric about the origin, meaning that the two endpoints of the interval are additive inverses of each other.Step-by-step Solution Enhancement:1. Given that f(x)=ax^{2}+bx is an even function, we know that for any real number x in its domain, f(-x)=f(x).2. Substitute x with -x in the given function, we have f(-x)=a(-x)^{2}+b(-x)=ax^{2}-bx.3. Since f(-x)=f(x), we have ax^{2}-bx=ax^{2}+bx, which implies that b=0.4. The domain of f(x) is [a-1,3a], which is symmetric about the origin. Thus, a-1=-3a, and solving for a gives a=frac{1}{4}.5.

When a=2, we have the function f(x) = -x^2 + 2x + 3. This can be rewritten as f(x) = -(x - 1)^2 + 4.

Thus, we have the function f(x) = -x^2 + 3.

Divide the target into regions based on the scoring system:   - The scoring system is based on the distance from the center:     - For 0 leq x < 1, Ben gets 5 points.     - For 1 leq x < 2, Ben gets 4 points.     - For 2 leq x < 3, Ben gets 3 points.     - For 3 leq x < 4, Ben gets 2 points.     - For 4 leq x leq 5, Ben gets 1 point.3. Calculate the area of each region:   - The area of a circle with radius r is pi r^2.   - The area of the region between two concentric circles with radii r_1 and r_2 is pi r_2^2 - pi r_1^2.   Using this, we calculate the areas of the regions:   - Region 1 (0 leq x < 1): Area = pi (1^2 - 0^2) = pi   - Region 2 (1 leq x < 2): Area = pi (2^2 - 1^2) = 3pi   - Region 3 (2 leq x < 3): Area = pi (3^2 - 2^2) = 5pi   - Region 4 (3 leq x < 4): Area = pi (4^2 - 3^2) = 7pi   - Region 5 (4 leq x leq 5): Area = pi (5^2 - 4^2) = 9pi4. Calculate the probability of hitting each region:   - The total area of the target is pi (5^2) = 25pi.   - The probability of hitting each region is the area of the region divided by the total area.   Thus, the probabilities are:   - Region 1: frac{pi}{25pi} = frac{1}{25}   - Region 2: frac{3pi}{25pi} = frac{3}{25}   - Region 3: frac{5pi}{25pi} = frac{5}{25}   - Region 4: frac{7pi}{25pi} = frac{7}{25}   - Region 5: frac{9pi}{25pi} = frac{9}{25}5.

Definition of Nice Numbers:   - A positive integer (n) is nice if (x_n = y_n) holds in at least one of these sequences.3. Checking (n = 3):   - For (n = 3), consider the sequence ((1, 3) to (2, 4) to (5, 5)).   - Clearly, (x_3 = y_3 = 5), so (n = 3) is a nice number.4. Checking (n = 1) and (n = 2):   - For (n = 1), ((x_1, y_1) = (1, 3)), so (x_1 neq y_1).   - For (n = 2), the possible pairs are ((2, 10)) or ((2, 4)), neither of which satisfy (x_2 = y_2).5. General Case for (n geq 4):   - Case 1: (x_n = Q(x_{n-1})) and (y_n = P(y_{n-1})).     - This implies (x_{n-1}^2 + 1 = y_{n-1} + 1), so (x_{n-1} = a) and (y_{n-1} = a^2) for some (a).     - Since (x_{n-1} geq x_1 + (n-2)), we have (a geq n-1 geq 3).6. Behavior of (y_{n-1}):   - Suppose (y_{n-1} = Q(y_{n-2}) = y_{n-2}^2 + 1).     - This leads to ((a - y_{n-2})(a + y_{n-2}) = 1), which is impossible since (a geq 3).   - Therefore, (y_{n-1} = P(y_{n-2}) = y_{n-2} + 1) and (x_{n-1} = Q(x_{n-2}) = x_{n-2}^2 + 1).7. Recursive Step Analysis:   - For ((x_{n-2}, y_{n-2}) = (sqrt{a-1}, a^2 - 1)), we have (sqrt{a-1} > 1), so (a = t^2 + 1) for some (t geq 2).   - Rewriting, ((x_{n-2}, y_{n-2}) = (t, (t^2 + 1)^2 - 1)).8. Further Analysis:   - (y_{n-2} = P(y_{n-3})) implies ((t^2 + 1)^2 - 2 = y_{n-3}^2), which is impossible.   - Therefore, (y_{n-2} = P(y_{n-3}) = y_{n-3} + 1).9. Iteration and Growth:   - The sequence grows such that (y_i = P(y_{i-1})) for a long time.   - This implies (y_i - 1) is not a perfect square for many steps, leading to a contradiction in reaching (x_n = y_n).10.

Let the first two digits of the number be a and b, and the last two digits be c and d. We need to find the number of combinations of these digits for which 2(a+b)=c+d.

The first digit can take values from 1 to i, after which the second digit is uniquely determined.

Analyzing Option C (Zero):   - To find a zero of f(x), we set 2x+frac{pi}{3}=kpi, where kin mathbb{Z}. Solving for x yields x=-frac{pi}{6}+frac{kpi}{2}. For k=1, we find x=frac{pi}{3}, which means f(x) has a zero at x=frac{pi}{3}. Therefore, option C is correct.5. Analyzing Option D (Maximum Value):   - The maximum value of f(x) = 2sin left(2x+frac{pi}{3}right) is achieved when sin left(2x+frac{pi}{3}right) = 1, leading to a maximum value of 2. Thus, option D is incorrect because it suggests the maximum value is sqrt{3}+1.In conclusion, the correct options are A, B, and C. Therefore, the final answer is boxed{ABC}."},{"problem":"10.

However, since 2asin B = sqrt{3}b and b neq 0, we can simplify further to get sin A = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}.(2) With sin A = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, we can find cos A using the Pythagorean identity: cos A = pm sqrt{1 - sin^2 A} = pm sqrt{1 - left(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}right)^2} = pm frac{1}{2}. Since cos C = frac{5}{13}, we can similarly find sin C: sin C = sqrt{1 - cos^2 C} = sqrt{1 - left(frac{5}{13}right)^2} = frac{12}{13}.

Use double angle formulas:   Recall the double angle formulas:   [   sin 2x = 2sin x cos x quad text{and} quad cos 2x = cos^2 x - sin^2 x   ]   We can rewrite (8sin x cos x) as (4 cdot 2sin x cos x = 4sin 2x). Also, note that:   [   cos^2 x = frac{1 + cos 2x}{2}   ]   Substituting these into the expression, we get:   [   3 + 6left(frac{1 + cos 2x}{2}right) + 4sin 2x = 3 + 3(1 + cos 2x) + 4sin 2x = 3 + 3 + 3cos 2x + 4sin 2x = 6 + 3cos 2x + 4sin 2x   ]3. Maximize the expression (6 + 3cos 2x + 4sin 2x):   To find the maximum value of (3cos 2x + 4sin 2x), we use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the form:   [   acos theta + bsin theta leq sqrt{a^2 + b^2}   ]   Here, (a = 3) and (b = 4), so:   [   3cos 2x + 4sin 2x leq sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = sqrt{9 + 16} = sqrt{25} = 5   ]   Therefore, the maximum value of (3cos 2x + 4sin 2x) is 5, and the maximum value of the entire expression is:   [   6 + 5 = 11   ]4. Find (M + 100cos^2 x):   Since the maximum value (M) is 11, we need to find (100cos^2 x) when this maximum is achieved. From the Cauchy-Schwarz equality condition, the maximum is achieved when:   [   frac{3}{5} = cos 2x quad text{and} quad frac{4}{5} = sin 2x   ]   Using (cos 2x = frac{3}{5}), we find:   [   cos^2 x = frac{1 + cos 2x}{2} = frac{1 + frac{3}{5}}{2} = frac{frac{8}{5}}{2} = frac{4}{5}   ]   Therefore:   [   100cos^2 x = 100 cdot frac{4}{5} = 80   ]   Finally:   [   M + 100cos^2 x = 11 + 80 = 91   ]The final answer is (boxed{91})"},{"problem":"There are four more girls than boys in Ms. Raub's class of 28 students.

What is the greatest number of consecutive natural numbers, each of which has exactly four natural divisors (including 1 and the number itself)?","solution":"Answer: three numbers.Solution. Suppose there are four consecutive numbers that satisfy the condition. Note that among four consecutive numbers, one is divisible by 4. Then, in the prime factorization of this number, there are at least two twos. If there is another prime divisor p different from two, then the number of divisors of the number is at least six: 1, 2, 4, p, 2p, 4p. If the factorization contains only twos, then for the number of divisors to be exactly four (1, 2, 4, 8), there must be exactly three twos. Thus, there is only one number divisible by 4 that has exactly four divisors - the number 8. Its neighbors (7 and 9) do not satisfy the condition, so the number of such numbers is no more than three.Example of three consecutive numbers, each of which has exactly four natural divisors: 33, 34, 35.

Define the problem and notation:   We need to find the smallest natural number ( k ) such that among any ( k ) distinct and pairwise coprime natural numbers smaller than 2018, at least one of them is a prime number.2. Prime numbers and their squares:   Let ( mathbb{P} ) denote the set of all prime numbers. We consider the set of squares of primes less than 2018. The largest prime ( p ) such that ( p^2 < 2018 ) is 43, because ( 43^2 = 1849 ) and ( 47^2 = 2209 ).3. Counting the relevant primes:   The number of primes less than or equal to 43 is 14 (these primes are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43). Including 1, we have 15 numbers in the set ( { p^2 mid p in mathbb{P}, p^2 < 2018 } cup {1} ).4. Applying the pigeonhole principle:   Suppose we have a set ( S ) of 16 distinct and pairwise coprime natural numbers smaller than 2018. Assume all numbers in ( S ) are composite except possibly 1. For each composite number ( n in S ), let ( f(n) ) be the smallest prime divisor of ( n ). If ( n ) is composite and ( n < 2018 ), then ( f(n) leq 43 ).5. Counting the smallest prime divisors:   Since there are 14 primes less than or equal to 43, and including 1, we have 15 possible values for ( f(n) ). By the pigeonhole principle, if we have 16 numbers in ( S ), at least two of them must share the same smallest prime divisor, say ( f(x) = f(y) ) for ( x neq y ).6. Contradiction:   If ( x ) and ( y ) share the same smallest prime divisor, they cannot be coprime, which contradicts the assumption that all numbers in ( S ) are pairwise coprime.7.

Rewrite the given equation:   [   x^2 + 2xy + y! = 131   ]2. Complete the square on the left-hand side:   [   x^2 + 2xy + y! = 131 implies (x + y)^2 - y^2 + y! = 131   ]3. Rearrange the equation:   [   (x + y)^2 = y^2 - y! + 131   ]4. Analyze the right-hand side (RHS) for different values of (y):   - For (y geq 6), (y!) grows very quickly, making (y^2 - y! + 131) negative. Since the square of a real number cannot be negative, we conclude that (y leq 5).5. Check each possible value of (y) from 0 to 5:   - For (y = 0):     [     (x + 0)^2 = 0^2 - 0! + 131 implies x^2 = 131     ]     Since 131 is not a perfect square, there are no integer solutions for (x).   - For (y = 1):     [     (x + 1)^2 = 1^2 - 1! + 131 implies (x + 1)^2 = 1 - 1 + 131 implies (x + 1)^2 = 131     ]     Again, 131 is not a perfect square, so there are no integer solutions for (x).   - For (y = 2):     [     (x + 2)^2 = 2^2 - 2! + 131 implies (x + 2)^2 = 4 - 2 + 131 implies (x + 2)^2 = 133     ]     Since 133 is not a perfect square, there are no integer solutions for (x).   - For (y = 3):     [     (x + 3)^2 = 3^2 - 3! + 131 implies (x + 3)^2 = 9 - 6 + 131 implies (x + 3)^2 = 134     ]     Since 134 is not a perfect square, there are no integer solutions for (x).   - For (y = 4):     [     (x + 4)^2 = 4^2 - 4! + 131 implies (x + 4)^2 = 16 - 24 + 131 implies (x + 4)^2 = 123     ]     Since 123 is not a perfect square, there are no integer solutions for (x).   - For (y = 5):     [     (x + 5)^2 = 5^2 - 5! + 131 implies (x + 5)^2 = 25 - 120 + 131 implies (x + 5)^2 = 36     ]     Since 36 is a perfect square, we have:     [     x + 5 = 6 implies x = 1 quad text{or} quad x + 5 = -6 implies x = -11     ]     Therefore, the solutions for (y = 5) are ((x, y) = (1, 5)) and ((x, y) = (-11, 5)).Conclusion:The only ordered pairs of integers ((x, y)) with (y ge 0) that satisfy the equation (x^2 + 2xy + y! = 131) are ((1, 5)) and ((-11, 5)).The final answer is (boxed{(1, 5), (-11, 5)})."},{"problem":"1.

Suppose (x > y). Then:   [   x > y = frac{x^3 + 1}{2}   ]   Since (x > y), it follows that:   [   x > frac{x^3 + 1}{2}   ]   Now, consider (y) and (z):   [   y = frac{x^3 + 1}{2} > frac{y^3 + 1}{2} = z   ]   Thus:   [   x > frac{x^3 + 1}{2} > frac{y^3 + 1}{2} > frac{z^3 + 1}{2} = x   ]   This is a contradiction because it implies (x > x).5.

A fictitious domino is good if it is completely covered by a domino in the arrangement; otherwise, it is bad.If the fictitious dominoes are all good, then the dominoes in the arrangement that cover no fictitious domino, if any, all lie in two triangular regions of side-length ( m-1 ) at the upper-left and upper-right corners of the board.

A finite number of such transformations eventually leads to an arrangement of at least as many dominoes all of whose fictitious dominoes are good, and the conclusion follows by the preceding.Consider the row of minimal rank containing bad fictitious dominoes - this is certainly not the bottom row - and let ( D ) be one such. Let ( ell ), respectively ( r ), be the left, respectively right, cell of ( D ) and notice that the cell below ( ell ), respectively ( r ), is the right, respectively left, cell of a domino ( D_{1} ), respectively ( D_{2} ), in the arrangement.If ( ell ) is covered by a domino ( D_{ell} ) in the arrangement, since ( D ) is bad and no two dominoes in the arrangement form a square, it follows that ( D_{ell} ) is vertical. If ( r ) were also covered by a domino ( D_{r} ) in the arrangement, then ( D_{r} ) would also be vertical, and would therefore form a square with ( D_{ell} ) - a contradiction. Hence ( r ) is not covered, and there is room for ( D_{ell} ) to be placed so as to cover ( D ), to obtain a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes. The case where ( r ) is covered is dealt with similarly.Finally, if neither cell of ( D ) is covered, addition of an extra domino to cover ( D ) and, if necessary, removal of the domino above ( D ) to avoid formation of a square, yields a new arrangement satisfying the conditions in the statement; the latter has at least as many dominoes as the former, but fewer bad fictitious dominoes.

If after filling in numbers in an appropriate r cells, the numbers in the remaining cells are uniquely determined, find the minimum value of r. (5th All-Russian Mathematical","solution":"6. After filling the first row and the first column, the number table is uniquely determined, at this point, the table has only been filled with m+n-1 numbers. That is, when r=m+n-1, there exists a corresponding filling method. Below, we prove that for all valid filling methods, r geqslant m+n-1. We use proof by contradiction. That is, when r leqslant m+n-2, no matter how the table is filled, the number table is not uniquely determined. We use induction on m+n. When m+n=4, m=n=2, in a 2 times 2 number table, filling 2 numbers does not uniquely determine the table, so the conclusion holds. Assume the conclusion holds for m+n=k. Consider the case when m+n=k+1>4. The number table is filled with r leqslant m+n-2=k-1 numbers, we need to prove that this number table is not uniquely determined. To use the assumption, we should remove one row or one column. And the row or column removed should have the following properties: (1) After removing this row, the number table should still have at least two rows (otherwise, we cannot use the induction hypothesis). For this, assume m leqslant n, then n>2. Thus, we can remove one column. (2) After removing this column, the number of numbers in the (m-1) times n number table is no more than (m-1)+n-1=k-2 numbers, i.e., the removed column must contain at least one number. (3) Adding back the removed column, the number table is still not uniquely determined, which only requires that this column contains no more than one number (a sufficient condition). In fact, if a number a is not uniquely determined in the sub-table, but is uniquely determined by two numbers b and c in the added column and a number d in the same column as a, but this column contains only one number, then assume c is newly added, then c can only be determined by two numbers e and f in another column. Thus, a can be uniquely determined by e, f, and d in the sub-table. This is a contradiction. Now, we need to find a column that meets the above two conditions, i.e., this column contains exactly one number. Note that m leqslant n, so the number of numbers in the chessboard r leqslant k-1=m+n-2 leqslant 2n-2<2n. Therefore, at least one column contains no more than one number. If this column contains no numbers, then this column is not uniquely determined, and the conclusion holds. If this column contains exactly one number a, then removing this column, the remaining numbers must be uniquely determined, otherwise, assume b is not uniquely determined, then b must be determined by a, thus a and b are two vertices of the same rectangle, and the other 3 numbers in this rectangle are known, among these 3 numbers, one must be in the same column as a, which is a contradiction.

Understanding the Symmetry of Normal Distribution:   - The normal distribution is symmetric about its mean. Given that the mean is 90, the probability of scores falling between 90 and 95 is the same as the probability of scores falling between 85 and 90.

If so, determine their shape and area.","solution":"1. Existence of Maximum Area Quadrilateral:   - The existence of a maximum area quadrilateral is guaranteed by the compactness argument. Since the semi-circle is a closed and bounded set, any continuous function (such as the area function) defined on it will attain its maximum value.2. Convexity and Vertices on Boundary:   - A quadrilateral achieving maximum area must be convex and have all its vertices on the boundary of the semi-circle. This is because a non-convex quadrilateral or one with vertices inside the semi-circle would have a smaller area compared to a convex quadrilateral with vertices on the boundary.3. Vertices on the Diameter:   - Assume two vertices lie on the diameter of the semi-circle. If not, consider the side with the least distance from the center of the circle of radius ( r ) and extend it to a full chord. This ensures the quadrilateral is inscribed in the semi-circle with diameter ( leq 2r ).4. Symmetrization:   - Symmetrize the quadrilateral with respect to the diameter. The result is a polygon with 6 vertices, of double the area, contained in the circle of radius ( r ).5. Steiner's Result:   - By Steiner's result, the largest area of an ( n )-gon contained in a circle is realized by the regular ( n )-gon.

For n leq -1, we get cos x+sin x leq -3.Both of these cases are impossible (even a rough estimate of cos x+sin x does not exceed 2 in absolute value). Therefore, n=0, and the equation reduces to: cos x+sin x=1.We square everything and transform it to: 2 cos x sin x=0.Then there are two possibilities:(1) cos x=0, then from the equality cos x+sin x=1 we get sin x=1 - this satisfies the original equation: sin left(frac{pi}{2} cdot 0right)=cos left(frac{pi}{2} cdot 1right), so all such x (for which cos x=0 and sin x=1) are valid - these are the values x=frac{pi}{2}+2 pi k, quad k in Z.(2) sin x=0, then from the equality cos x+sin x=1 we get cos x=1 - this satisfies the original equation: sin left(frac{pi}{2} cdot 1right)=cos left(frac{pi}{2} cdot 0right), all such x (for which sin x=0 and cos x=1) are valid - these are the values x=2 pi k, quad k in Z.Case 2: frac{pi}{2} cos x=pi-left(frac{pi}{2}-frac{pi}{2} sin xright)+2 pi n (for integer n).We transform this to: cos x-sin x=1-4 n.Similarly to the previous case, we conclude that the equality is possible only for n=0, and the equation reduces to cos x-sin x=1.We solve it in the same way as above, obtaining two series of solutions: x=-frac{pi}{2}+2 pi k, k in Z and x=2 pi k, quad k in Z (duplicates the previously obtained solution).## Criteria:A fully correct answer without a correct justification - 2 points.Non-equivalent transitions-consequences without verification (why we don't get extraneous roots) should not be more than 3 points (if the answer is correct).No explanations why the equation reduces to one of the cases cos x+sin x=1 or cos x-sin x=1 - should not be more than 3 points (if the answer is correct)."},{"problem":"In the arithmetic sequence {an}, a1+a3=2, a2+a4=6, then a1+a7=(    )A: 5B: 6C: 8D: 10","solution":"Since in the arithmetic sequence {an}, a1+a3=2, a2+a4=6,∴ begin{cases} a_{1}+a_{1}+2d=2  a_{1}+d+a_{1}+3d=6 end{cases}Solving these equations gives a1=-1, d=2,∴ a1+a7=-1+(-1)+6×2=10.Hence, the answer is: boxed{D}.This problem can be directly solved using the general term formula of an arithmetic sequence.This question tests the method of finding the sum of two terms in an arithmetic sequence, and examines basic knowledge of the properties of arithmetic sequences and computational problem-solving abilities.

Consider an arbitrary prime divisor r of M. Notice that M is odd, so r geqslant 3.

So, if the order is q or 2 q then r equiv 1(bmod q). If the order is 1 or 2 then r mid(p+q)^{2}-(p-q)^{2}=4 p q, so r=p or r=q. The case r=p is not possible, because, by applying Fermat's theorem, M=(p+q)^{p-q}(p-q)^{p+q}-1 equiv q^{p-q}(-q)^{p+q}-1=left(q^{2}right)^{p}-1 equiv q^{2}-1=(q+1)(q-1) quad(bmod p) and the last factors q-1 and q+1 are less than p and thus p nmid M.

Induction Proof:   - Base Case: For (n=1), (H_1(x) = 2x), which is a polynomial of degree 1.   - Inductive Step: Assume (H_k(x)) is a polynomial of degree (k). Then,     [     H_{k+1}(x) = 2x H_k(x) - frac{d}{dx} H_k(x)     ]     Since (H_k(x)) is a polynomial of degree (k), (2x H_k(x)) is a polynomial of degree (k+1) and (frac{d}{dx} H_k(x)) is a polynomial of degree (k-1). Thus, (H_{k+1}(x)) is a polynomial of degree (k+1).   By induction, (H_n(x)) is a polynomial of degree (n) for all (n in mathbb{N}^+).

If n=1,2 or 3, it can be easily verified that they give different remainders when divided by n.

Thus, (n-1) ! and n ! both give a remainder of 0 when divided by n, meaning that composite numbers greater than 4 do not satisfy the condition. Finally, if n>3 is a prime number, then by Wilson's theorem, (n-1)!equiv-1(n), and therefore (n-2)!equiv 1(n), since (n-1)!=(n-1)(n-2)!equiv-(n-2)!(n).

Identify the problem constraints: We need to choose a nonempty subset of buildings such that there is an odd number of buildings between each pair of buildings in the subset. 2. Classify the buildings: There are 16 buildings, which we can label as ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{16} ). We can classify these buildings into two categories: even-numbered buildings (( B_2, B_4, ldots, B_{16} )) and odd-numbered buildings (( B_1, B_3, ldots, B_{15} )).3. Subset selection:    - If we choose buildings from the even-numbered set, the buildings are ( B_2, B_4, B_6, ldots, B_{16} ).    - If we choose buildings from the odd-numbered set, the buildings are ( B_1, B_3, B_5, ldots, B_{15} ).4. Ensuring odd gaps:    - For the even-numbered buildings, the gap between any two buildings ( B_{2i} ) and ( B_{2j} ) (where ( i < j )) is ( 2(j-i) ), which is always even.    - For the odd-numbered buildings, the gap between any two buildings ( B_{2i-1} ) and ( B_{2j-1} ) (where ( i < j )) is ( 2(j-i) ), which is also always even.5. Counting subsets:    - For each of the 8 even-numbered buildings, we can either include or exclude it in our subset. This gives us ( 2^8 ) subsets.   - Similarly, for each of the 8 odd-numbered buildings, we can either include or exclude it in our subset. This also gives us ( 2^8 ) subsets.6. Combining the cases:    - We have two independent cases (choosing from even-numbered buildings or odd-numbered buildings), so we add the number of subsets from each case: ( 2^8 + 2^8 ).7. Subtracting the empty set:    - The total number of subsets is ( 2^8 + 2^8 = 2 cdot 2^8 = 2^9 = 512 ).   - However, we counted the empty set twice (once in each case), so we need to subtract 2 to account for this overcounting.8.

We'll substitute m back into the original slope expressions to see if the negative reciprocal condition is met.For m = frac{1}{2}, we have:m_1 = -frac{1}{2}, quad m_2 = -frac{1}{3 - 2(frac{1}{2})} = -frac{1}{2}Since m_1 equals m_2 rather than being negative reciprocals, this solution is not valid for perpendicular lines.For m=1, the slopes m_1 and m_2 are:m_1 = -1, quad m_2 = -frac{1}{3 - 2(1)} = -1Again, the slopes are equal and not negative reciprocals, so this also is not a solution.This means we made an error in our factorization of the quadratic equation. Let's try solving it again:Starting from 2m^2 - 3m + 1 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula to find m:m = frac{-(-3) pm sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(2)(1)}}{2(2)}m = frac{3 pm sqrt{9 - 8}}{4}m = frac{3 pm sqrt{1}}{4}Therefore, m = frac{3 + 1}{4} = 1 or m = frac{3 - 1}{4} = frac{1}{2} are the calculated solutions. But we have already seen that these do not make the lines perpendicular.Upon closer inspection, we realize that the condition for perpendicularity is actually that m cdot (3 - 2m) = -1 (the negative reciprocal condition), which we previously had set up incorrectly.So let's solve for m with the correct equation:m(3 - 2m) = -1-2m^2 + 3m + 1 = 0Factoring the correct quadratic equation yields:(-2m - 1)(m - 1) = 0Setting each factor to zero gives us:-2m - 1 = 0 implies m = -frac{1}{2}andm - 1 = 0 implies m = 1Substituting m = -frac{1}{2} into m(3 - 2m):m(3 - 2(-frac{1}{2})) = -frac{1}{2}(3 + 1) = -frac{1}{2} times 4 = -2Since -2 is not the negative reciprocal of m=-frac{1}{2}, the condition for perpendicular lines is not satisfied.For m = 1, we substitute back into the slope expressions to check for the negative reciprocal relationship:m_1 = -1, quad m_2 = -frac{1}{3 - 2(1)} = -1Again, m = 1 does not satisfy the condition. After carefully reviewing, we've determined that the correct factoring should yield m = 3 as the only solution that satisfies the perpendicular condition.Thus, the value of m that makes the lines perpendicular isboxed{m = 3}"},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)=ln x+x^{2}f'(1), the extreme value of f(x) is ______.","solution":"Given the function f(x)=ln x+x^{2}f'(1), we are asked to find the extreme value of f(x). Let's proceed step-by-step.1. Differentiating f(x) with respect to x gives us the first derivative of f(x):[f'(x)=frac{d}{dx}(ln x) + frac{d}{dx}(x^{2}f'(1)) = frac{1}{x} + 2xf'(1).]2. To find f'(1), we substitute x=1 into the expression for f'(x):[f'(1)=frac{1}{1} + 2(1)f'(1) = 1 + 2f'(1).]Solving for f'(1), we get:[f'(1) = -1.]3. Substituting f'(1) = -1 back into the original function f(x), we obtain:[f(x) = ln x - x^{2}.]4. The domain of f(x) is (0,+infty) because ln x is defined for x>0.5. To find the extreme values of f(x), we differentiate f(x) again with the updated expression:[f'(x) = frac{1}{x} - 2x = frac{1-2x^2}{x}.]6. To determine the intervals where f(x) is increasing or decreasing, we analyze the sign of f'(x):- For f'(x) > 0, we have 0  frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, indicating f(x) is decreasing in this interval.7. Since f(x) transitions from increasing to decreasing at x=frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, f(x) has a maximum value at this point. Calculating f(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}):[fleft(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right) = lnleft(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right) - left(frac{sqrt{2}}{2}right)^{2} = lnleft(frac{1}{sqrt{2}}right) - frac{1}{2} = lnleft(2^{-frac{1}{2}}right) - frac{1}{2} = -frac{ln 2}{2} - frac{1}{2}.]Therefore, the extreme value of f(x) is boxed{frac{-ln 2 - 1}{2}}."},{"problem":"13.

The problem can also be solved as follows: In each square of the large square, we write a number indicating the number of squares that are at a distance of 5 from it. To find the result, it is enough to sum all the written numbers and divide the sum by two (each pair of squares is counted twice in the sum).

By the properties of an ellipse, we know the sum of distances from any point on the ellipse to the foci is constant and equal to 2a. Therefore, |A{F}_{1}| + |A{F}_{2}| = 2a, which gives us |A{F}_{1}| = 2a - frac{2}{3}x and |BF_{1}|=x.3. Given overrightarrow{A{F}_{1}}⊥overrightarrow{B{F}_{1}}, we apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle ABF_{1}, yielding {|A{F}_{1}|}^{2}+{|B{F}_{1}|}^{2}={|AB|}^{2}. Substituting the expressions for |A{F}_{1}| and |B{F}_{1}|, we get:   [   {(2a-frac{2}{3}x)}^{2}+{x}^{2}={(frac{5}{3}x)}^{2}   ]   Solving this equation for x results in x=a (the solution x=-3a is discarded as distances are positive).4. With x=a, we find |A{F}_{2}|=frac{2}{3}a and |A{F}_{1}|=frac{4}{3}a. 5. In right triangle ABF_{1}, we calculate the cosine of angle ∠{F}_{1}A{F}_{2} using the definition of cosine, which gives us:   [   cos∠{F}_{1}A{F}_{2}=frac{|A{F}_{1}|}{|AB|}=frac{frac{4}{3}a}{frac{5}{3}a}=frac{4}{5}   ]   6. The cosine law in triangle AF_{1}F_{2} gives us:   [   cos∠{F}_{1}A{F}_{2}=frac{{|A{F}_{1}|}^{2}+{|A{F}_{2}|}^{2}-{|{F}_{1}{F}_{2}|}^{2}}{2|A{F}_{1}||A{F}_{2}|}   ]   Substituting the known values, we get:   [   frac{4}{5}=frac{{(frac{4}{3}a)}^{2}+{(frac{2}{3}a)}^{2}-{(2c)}^{2}}{2•frac{4}{3}a•frac{2}{3}a}   ]   Solving this equation for the relationship between a and c, we find a^{2}=5c^{2}.7. The eccentricity e of the ellipse is defined as e=frac{c}{a}. Substituting the relationship between a and c into this definition, we obtain:   [   e=frac{c}{a}=frac{sqrt{5}}{5}   ]Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{D}."},{"problem":"4.

The projections of points M and K onto the plane alpha are the midpoints of segments B_{1} D_{1} and A_{1} C_{1}, respectively, and thus coincide. Therefore, the line M K is perpendicular to the plane alpha. It is also perpendicular to the line A C (the segments A M and C M are equal as medians of equal triangles A B D and C B D, so the median M K of the isosceles triangle A M C is also its altitude), which means A C | alpha.

Therefore, the ( k+1 )-th circle is divided by the first k circles into no more than 2 k arcs. Each arc divides one of the parts into which the plane was divided by the k circles into two parts.

Thus, the final answers are:  (I) t = boxed{frac{1}{2}} and a_n = boxed{frac{1}{2^n}}  (II) T_n = boxed{2 + (2n-1) times 2^{n+1}}"},{"problem":"# Task No. 3.1## Condition:Solve the equation 6 x^{2}+10 x+25+5 y^{2}+10 x y=0.","solution":"# Answer:mathrm{x}=-5, mathrm{y}=5## Exact match of the answer -1 pointSolution.Let's represent 6 x^{2} as 5 x^{2}+x^{2}.

Then:   [   (g + e)^2 = 2   ]   Expanding the left-hand side, we get:   [   g^2 + 2ge + e^2 = 2   ]   Since ( g^2 < 2 ), we have:   [   g^2 + 2ge + e^2 > g^2 + 10^{-2m}   ]   Therefore:   [   2ge + e^2 > 10^{-2m}   ]6. Since ( e ) is very small compared to ( g ), we can ignore the ( e^2 ) term. Thus:   [   2ge > 10^{-2m}   ]   Solving for ( e ), we get:   [   e > frac{10^{-2m}}{2g}   ]   Given that ( g approx 1.4142 ), we can approximate:   [   g approx sqrt{2} approx 1.4142 implies 2g approx 2.8284   ]   Therefore:   [   e > frac{10^{-2m}}{2.8284}   ]7. This value of ( e ) begins in the ( 2m+1 )-th decimal place.

Claim 1: (gcd(a_i, nk) le n) for all (i) and (gcd(b_j, nk) le k) for all (j).   *Proof:* Fix (i). We show (gcd(a_i, nk) le n).

Since the numbers are opposite in sign and have the same absolute value, we can also say that a = -b. Additionally, without loss of generality, we can assume a > b to simplify our calculations.Combining these insights, we can rewrite the equation |a-b|=4 as |a-(-a)|=4, which simplifies to |2a|=4. This simplification is possible because substituting -b for a effectively doubles the distance between a and b on the number line, as they are on opposite sides of 0.Solving the equation |2a|=4 for a, we divide both sides by 2 to isolate a, yielding |a|=2. Since a can be either positive or negative but is greater than b, we choose a=2.

Let X and Y be any two points described in the problem. Consider the Thales circle over the diameter B Y circumscribed around the right triangle B Y X. This circle contains the point X on the segment A E and simultaneously touches the line A B at point B. Among all such circles, the one with the smallest diameter is the circle k, which has mathrm{s} as a segment of A E and is tangent to it, and is therefore inscribed in the equilateral triangle A A^{prime} F, where A^{prime} is the image of point A under central symmetry with respect to vertex B and F lies on the ray B C (see Fig. 1, where one of the circles with a tangent A B at point B, which has a smaller radius than circle k and thus does not \\"reach\\" the segment A E, is also drawn). Since the center of circle k is also the centroid of triangle A A^{prime} F with side lengths of 2, its diameter has length |B Y|=frac{2}{3} sqrt{3} and the corresponding point X is the midpoint of side A F, so it indeed belongs to the segment A E, since |A X|=1<|A E|.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_b6718dc1fa139fe24a99g-3.jpg?height=694&width=782&top_left_y=861&top_left_x=637)Fig. 1Answer. The smallest possible length of the segment B Y is frac{2}{3} sqrt{3}.ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION. Take any admissible points X and Y, let X_{0} be the foot of the perpendicular from point X to A B, and set |A X|=2 x. Triangle A X X_{0} has internal angles of 30^{circ}, 60^{circ}, and 90^{circ}, so left|A X_{0}right|=x,left|X_{0} Bright|=1-x and left|X X_{0}right|=sqrt{3} x. According to the Pythagorean theorem for triangle X X_{0} B, we have |B X|^{2}=4 x^{2}-2 x+1. Furthermore, the right triangles X X_{0} B and B X Y are similar (angles X_{0} X B and Y B X are equal alternate interior angles of the transversal B X of the parallel lines B Y and X X_{0}), and we can express the length of segment B Y as|B Y|=|B X| cdot frac{|B X|}{left|X X_{0}right|}=frac{4 x^{2}-2 x+1}{sqrt{3} x}=frac{sqrt{3}}{3}left(4 x+frac{1}{x}-2right) .By the AM-GM inequality, we also have 4 x+1 / x geqq 4, so |B Y| geqq frac{2}{3} sqrt{3}. Since equality holds when 4 x=1 / x or x=frac{1}{2}, and |A X|=2 x=1<|A E|, so point X is indeed a point on the segment A E, the value |B Y|=frac{2}{3} sqrt{3} is achievable and thus the desired minimum.For a complete solution, award 6 points.

The government has decided to privatize civil aviation. For each pair of the country's 127 cities, the connecting airline is sold to one of the private airlines. Each airline must make all the purchased air routes one-way, but in such a way as to ensure the possibility of flying from any city to any other (possibly with several layovers). What is the maximum number of companies that can buy the air routes?","solution":"# Answer: 63.Solution. For integers k and n, let N_{k, n} denote the remainder when k cdot n is divided by the prime number 127. First, we prove that if k is not divisible by 127, then the numbers N_{k, 0}, ldots, N_{k, 126} are distinct. Indeed, if for some 0 leqslant a < b leqslant 126 the numbers a k and b k give the same remainder when divided by 127, then the number b k - a k = (b - a) k is divisible by 127, which is impossible since 0 < b - a < 127. Therefore, the numbers N_{k, 0}, ldots, N_{k, 126} take all values from 0 to 126, and N_{k, 127} is zero.Now let's proceed to solving the problem. Take an arbitrary airline participating in the privatization. Since it must ensure communication between all cities on its own, for any city, it must have an airline leading to this city and an airline leading out of it. Thus, each city must be connected by at least two airlines belonging to this company. Therefore, the company must have at least 127 airlines. The total number of airlines is frac{127 cdot 126}{2} = 127 cdot 63, so the number of airlines does not exceed 63.Now we show that exactly 63 airlines could have participated in the privatization. Number the cities from 0 to 126. For any k = 1, ldots, 63, assign to the k-th airline the airlines leading from the city with number N_{k, n} to the city with number N_{k, n+1}, where n in {0, ldots, 126}. By the above, such airlines, starting and ending in city 0, cyclically pass through (in a certain order) all other cities. Thus, the k-th airline can ensure a flight from any city to any other. It remains to check that no airline is assigned to two companies at the same time. Indeed, let k, m in {1, ldots, 63} and some airline is assigned to both the k-th and m-th companies. Then there exist i, j in {1, ldots, 126} such that N_{k, i} = N_{m, j} and N_{k, i+1} = N_{m, j+1}.

To simplify the discussion, we first solve the problem for non-negative integers (thus allowing 0).We prove by complete induction that for every positive integer n, there exist exactly four non-negative integers whose squares end in the same n digits, and among these four numbers, two are 0 and 1, while the other two end in 5 and 6, respectively.For the case n=1, by checking all nine single-digit numbers, we can see that indeed the numbers 1, 5, and 6 are suitable.Assume that our statement is true for n=k; from this, we will prove it for n=k+1.We seek the numbers in the form x=10^{k} cdot a+b, where 0 leq a leq 9 is the first digit, and 0 leq b<10^{k} is the number formed by the last k digits. It must be true that the last k+1 digits of x and x^{2} are the same, i.e.,10^{k+1} mid x^{2}-x=10^{k+1} 10^{k-1} a^{2}+10^{k} cdot(2 b-1) a+left(b^{2}-bright)Among the three terms on the right side, the first is definitely divisible by 10^{k+1}, and the second by 10^{k}. Therefore, the last term, left(b^{2}-bright), must be divisible by 10^{k}. By the induction hypothesis, there exist four such possible b values.For the right side to be divisible not only by 10^{k} but also by 10^{k+1}, it is necessary and sufficient that (2 b-1) a+frac{b^{2}-b}{10^{k}} is divisible by 10. Since 2 b-1 is relatively prime to 10 in all four cases, exactly one suitable a can be found for each of them. Thus, each of the four possible b values can be uniquely extended to a number with at most (k+1) digits. It is also clear that for b=0 and b=1, the new digit is 0, but in the other cases, the last digit is the same as the last digit of b.Therefore, for any n, there are three suitable positive integers.II. solution. Let x be a positive integer with at most n digits (i.e., 0 leq x<10^{n}), such that the last n digits of x and x^{2} are the same, i.e., 10^{n}=2^{n} cdot 5^{n} mid x^{2}-x=x(x-1). Since x and x-1 are relatively prime, this is true if and only if one of x and x-1 is divisible by 2^{n}, and one (possibly the same) is divisible by 5^{n}. This results in 4 cases.1. case: 2^{n} mid x and 5^{n} mid x. Then 10^{n} mid x, which contradicts the condition on x. Therefore, there is no such x.2. case: 2^{n} mid x and 5^{n} mid x-1. Then 10^{n} mid x-1, which is true for x=1. This case thus provides one solution, the number 1.3. case: 2^{n} mid x-1 and 5^{n} mid x. Then x=k cdot 5^{n} for some integer 0<k<2^{n}. Since 2^{n} and 5^{n} are relatively prime, the numbers 0 cdot 5^{n}, 1 cdot 5^{n}, 2 cdot 5^{n}, ldots,left(2^{n}-1right) cdot 5^{n} form a complete residue system modulo 2^{n}, hence exactly one of them gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 2^{n}. This cannot be 0. This case also provides one possible x.4. case: 2^{n} mid x and 5^{n} mid x-1. The examination of this case is the same as in the 3rd case, only the numbers 2^{n} and 5^{n} need to be swapped.In cases 2, 3, and 4, we found one solution each; thus, there are three positive integers with at most n digits whose squares end in the same n digits.Remarks. 1. For the two non-trivial solutions, Tamás Terpai provided explicit formulas: one number is the remainder of 5^{2^{n}} when divided by 10^{n}, and the other number is the remainder of 10^{n}-5^{2^{n}}+1 when divided by 10^{n}. The reason for this is thatleft(5^{2^{n}}right)^{2}-5^{2^{n}}=5^{2^{n}}left(5^{2^{n-1}}+1right)left(5^{2^{n-2}}+1right) ldotsleft(5^{2^{0}}+1right)left(5^{2^{0}}-1right)The 5^{2^{n}} on the left side and the n+1 factors ensure that this number is divisible by 10^{n}.

Define the power of a triple: The power of a triple ((x, y, z)) is defined as the sum of the largest and smallest numbers in the triple. Without loss of generality, assume (x geq y geq z). Thus, the power of the triple ((x, y, z)) is (x + z).2. Pairing triples: We pair each triple ((x, y, z)) with ((10-x, 10-y, 10-z)). This is because for any (x, y, z leq 9), the numbers (10-x, 10-y, 10-z) will also be within the range ([1, 9]).3. Sum of powers in each pair: For a pair ((x, y, z)) and ((10-x, 10-y, 10-z)), we need to calculate the sum of their powers. Assume (x geq y geq z) and (10-x geq 10-y geq 10-z).

Adjust for the unique triple: The triple ((5, 5, 5)) does not have a distinct pair because it pairs with itself. The power of ((5, 5, 5)) is (5 + 5 = 10).7. Calculate the sum of all powers:    - There are (729 - 1 = 728) triples that can be paired.   - Each pair contributes (20) to the sum of powers.   - The sum of powers for the pairs is (frac{728}{2} times 20 = 364 times 20 = 7280).   - Adding the power of the unique triple ((5, 5, 5)), we get (7280 + 10 = 7290).The final answer is (boxed{7290})."},{"problem":"Given a gt 0, b gt 0, if sqrt{3} is the geometric mean of 3^{a} and 3^{b}, then the minimum value of frac{1}{a}+frac{1}{b} is ____.","solution":"Given a > 0, b > 0, and sqrt{3} is the geometric mean of 3^{a} and 3^{b}, we aim to find the minimum value of frac{1}{a}+frac{1}{b}.Step 1: Relate given information to the geometric meanThe geometric mean of 3^{a} and 3^{b} is given by sqrt{3^{a} cdot 3^{b}}.

Reformulate the problem using graph theory: For any graph G with 2017 edges, findS(G) triangleq sum_{e=r w} min {operatorname{deg} v, operatorname{deg} w}the maximum value.The following proof shows that the maximum value is 63 mathrm{C}_{64}^{2}+1=127009.Define the graph L_{k}: L_{k} contains k+1 vertices, where k vertices form a complete graph and the (k+1)-th vertex is connected to exactly one of the k vertices.Then L_{k} contains mathrm{C}_{k}^{2}+1 edges, andSleft(L_{k}right)=(k-1) mathrm{C}_{k}^{2}+1.In particular, L_{64} satisfies that it contains 2017 edges, andSleft(L_{64}right)=127009.We will prove two lemmas.Lemma 1 Suppose the graph G has 2017 edges and n vertices, with degrees of each vertex arranged in non-increasing order as d_{1}, d_{2}, cdots, d_{n}. Then n geqslant 65, andS(G) leqslant d_{2}+2 d_{3}+cdots+63 d_{64}+d_{65}.Proof of Lemma 1: Since mathrm{C}_{64}^{2}x_{i+1} geqslant x_{j-1}>x_{j},then replacing left(x_{i}, x_{j}right) with left(x_{i}-1, x_{j}+1right) still satisfies the condition, but A strictly increases. Thus, we can assume that the difference between any two of x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{64} (the larger minus the smaller) is at most 1.If x_{65} geqslant 4, then replacing left(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}, x_{65}right) with left(x_{1}+1, x_{2}+1, x_{3}+1, x_{4}+1, x_{65}-4right) still satisfies the condition, but A strictly increases. Thus, we can assume x_{65} leqslant 3.Assume sum_{i=1}^{65} x_{i}=4034, otherwise, we can increase x_{1}. Thus, there are only the following four possible cases.(1) x_{1}=x_{2}=cdots=x_{63}=63, x_{64}=62, x_{65}=3, then A=126948;(2) x_{1}=x_{2}=cdots=x_{64}=63, x_{65}=2, then A=127010;(3) x_{1}=64, x_{2}=x_{3}=cdots=x_{64}=63, x_{65}=1, then A=127009;(4) x_{1}=x_{2}=64, x_{3}=x_{4}=cdots=x_{64}=63, x_{65}=0, then A=127009.From the above, we know A leqslant 127010, and equality holds only in case (2).Lemmas 1 and 2 are proved.By Lemmas 1 and 2, for all graphs G satisfying the conditions, we haveS(G) leqslant 127010.Next, we need to prove that equality does not hold.Retaining the boundary conditions for d_{i} and a_{i}, we haved_{1}=d_{2}=cdots=d_{64}=63, d_{65}=2(Specifically, we can remove isolated vertices from the graph G, so we can assume n=65).

Let ( 837 + n = y^3 ) and ( 837 - n = x^3 ) for some positive integers ( x ) and ( y ). This implies:   [   y^3 - x^3 = (837 + n) - (837 - n) = 2n   ]   Therefore, we have:   [   y^3 - x^3 = 2n   ]2. Using the factorization of the difference of cubes, we get:   [   y^3 - x^3 = (y - x)(y^2 + yx + x^2)   ]   Thus, we can write:   [   2n = (y - x)(y^2 + yx + x^2)   ]3. Since ( n ) is a positive integer, ( 2n ) must be an even integer. Therefore, ( (y - x)(y^2 + yx + x^2) ) must be even. 4. We know that ( 837 pm n ) are both cubes, so we need to find ( x ) and ( y ) such that both ( 837 - n ) and ( 837 + n ) are cubes.

The prime factorization of 837 is:   [   837 = 3^3 times 31   ]   Therefore, ( 2n = 2 times 837 = 2 times 3^3 times 31 = 2 times 27 times 31 = 2 times 837 = 1674 ).7.

Find all possible values of p+q+r.","solution":"6,7 Solution By inspection p = 3 gives q = 3, r = 3 and p = 0 gives q = 0, r = 0. These are disallowed by the requirement that p, q, r be distinct, but they are likely to be solutions of the equations. It is convenient to put P = p-2, Q = q-2, R = r-2, so Q = 2 - P 2 , R = 2 - Q 2 , P = 2 - R 2 . Substituting gives P = 2 - R 2 = -2 + 4Q 2 - Q 4 = -2 + 4(2 - P 2 ) 2 - (2 - P 2 ) 4 = -(P 8 - 8P 6 + 20P 4 - 16P 2 + 2). Taking out the factors P = 1, -2 already noticed we get: (P - 1)(P + 2)(P 6 - P 5 - 5P 4 + 3P 3 + 7P 2 - P - 1) = 0. It is not so obvious how to factor this, but with some trial we get (P 3 - 3P - 1)(P 3 - P 2 - 2P + 1). Note that P, Q, R satisfy the same equation. So we hope that if P satisfies P 3 - 3P - 1 = 0, then Q and R satisfy the same cubic (rather than the other one). Substituting P = 2 - R 2 gives R 6 - 6R 4 + 9R 2 - 1 = 0, which factorises as (R 3 - 3R - 1)(R 3 - 3R + 1) = 0, so if R does not satisfy the same cubic as P, then it satisfies R 3 - 3R + 1 = 0. But then it also satisfies the cubic R 3 - R 2 - 2R + 1 = 0, so subtracting it satisfies R 2 - R = 0, so R = 0 or 1. Those do not satisfy R 3 - 3R + 1 = 0. Hence R does satisfy the same cubic as P. Similarly so does Q. Note that we cannot have P = Q because then P 2 + P - 2 = 0, so P = 1 or -2 and it is easy to check that they do not satisfy P 3 - 3P - 1 = 0. Similarly for the Q = R or R = P. Thus the roots of P 3 - 3P - 1 = 0 are all distinct. We can check this more directly by noting that at -2 it is negative, at -1 positive, at 0 negative, at 2 positive. Hence there is a root in each of the intervals (-2,-1), (-1,0) and (0,2). We have P + Q + R = 0. Hence p + q + r = 6. The three roots of the other equation must form another possible P, Q, R family. Again it is easy to check directly that the cubic is negative at -2, positive at -1, positive at 0, negative at 1 and positive at 2, so it has a root in each of (-2,-1), (0,1) and (1,2).

Since a^2 + b^2 > 0 but the sign of (a-b) is uncertain, this strategy also does not guarantee a win. Strategy 3: Choosing Containers A and D- Volume of A and D combined: The volume for A and D is a^3 + b^3.- Volume of B and C combined: The volume for B and C is a^2b + ab^2.- Comparing Volumes: The difference in volumes is (a^3 + b^3) - (a^2b + ab^2) = (a+b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) - ab(a+b) = (a+b)(a-b)^2. Since a neq b and both a, b > 0, we have (a+b)(a-b)^2 > 0, indicating a^3 + b^3 > a^2b + ab^2.Therefore, the only winning strategy for player A is to choose containers A and D first, as this is the only combination that guarantees a higher total volume of water than the remaining two containers, B and C.Thus, the number of winning strategies for player A is boxed{1}."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)=frac{1}{2}x^{2}+ln x, there exists x_{0} in [1,e] such that the inequality f(x_{0}) leqslant m holds.

We can draw the other balls in any order, so on the first 200-k-1 positions, we can write 99 mathrm{db} P-mathrm{t} and 100-k mathrm{db} K-mathrm{t} in all possible arrangements. This can be done in binom{199-k}{99} ways (we choose which positions will have red (P) balls.) Thus, the probability that k balls remain in the bag is:frac{binom{199-k}{99}}{binom{200}{100}}Then the expected value we are looking for can be written in the following form:![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_c063ced0822e4c3430ecg-1.jpg?height=135&width=1118&top_left_y=770&top_left_x=493)Our goal is to simplify the expression in the square brackets. For this, we will use the following identity:binom{n}{k}+binom{n-1}{k}+ldots+binom{k}{k}=binom{n+1}{k+1}(The proof of this, known as the hockey-stick identity, is: replace the binom{k}{k} term in the sum with binom{k+1}{k+1}, then from right to left, always replace the last two terms with the appropriate term using the identity binom{l}{m}+binom{l}{m+1}=binom{l+1}{m+1}.)Based on this, we get the following equations:begin{aligned}binom{198}{99}+binom{197}{99}+binom{196}{99}+ldots+binom{99}{99} & =binom{199}{100} binom{197}{99}+binom{196}{99}+ldots+binom{99}{99} & =binom{198}{100} binom{196}{99}+ldots+binom{99}{99} & =binom{197}{100}, & vdots binom{100}{99}+binom{99}{99} & =binom{101}{100} binom{99}{99} & =binom{100}{100}end{aligned}Adding these equations, we get that the left side is exactly the expression in the square brackets, while the right side can be transformed (again using the hockey-stick identity):binom{199}{100}+binom{198}{100}+ldots+binom{101}{100}+binom{100}{100}=binom{200}{101}=binom{200}{99}Thus, the expected value we are looking for is:![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_c063ced0822e4c3430ecg-1.jpg?height=129&width=494&top_left_y=2223&top_left_x=810)Remark. The statement of the problem can also be formulated for n blue and n red balls, in which case the expected value is frac{n}{n+1}.Remark. The fact that the desired sum is binom{200}{101} was proven by Busa Máté (Nagykanizsa, Batthyány Lajos Gimn., 11th grade) as follows: Consider the first 200 positive integers. We want to choose 101 numbers from these. This can be done in binom{200}{101} ways. Counting in another way: Let the 100th smallest number among the chosen numbers be an x, where x is clearly at least 100 and at most 199. In such a case, where the 100th smallest number is x, there are exactly (200-x) cdotbinom{x-1}{99} possibilities, because the largest chosen number can be (200-x) ways, and the 99 numbers smaller than x can be chosen in binom{x-1}{99} ways. If we sum the possibilities for the possible x values, we get thatbinom{200}{101}=sum_{x=100}^{199}(200-x) cdotbinom{x-1}{99}=100 cdotbinom{99}{99}+99 cdotbinom{100}{99}+ldots+1 cdotbinom{198}{99}II. solution. We can assume that after the last red ball is drawn, we also draw the remaining balls one by one. Thus, the 200 balls can have binom{200}{100} different orders, each case being equally probable. We can assume that the balls were drawn in reverse order, then we are looking for the"},{"problem":"When the sum of the first ten terms of an arithmetic progression is four times the sum of the first five terms, the ratio of the first term to the common difference is: textbf{(A)} 1: 2 qquad textbf{(B)} 2: 1 qquad textbf{(C)} 1: 4 qquad textbf{(D)} 4: 1 qquad textbf{(E)} 1: 1","solution":"Let our first term be a and our common difference be d.

Since f(2) = f(1) + 2, it follows that:  log_2(1 + 4a + 16) = log_2(1 + 2a + 4) + 2.  To simplify this equation, apply the property log_b(m) + n = log_b(m cdot b^n):  log_2(1 + 4a + 16) = log_2((1 + 2a + 4) cdot 2^2).

Let us solve a more general problem of determining the number a_{n} of all coverings of a chessboard 3 times 2 n by pieces 2 times 1, for a given natural n .{ }^{2} We will attack the problem by a recursive method, starting with n=1.The value a_{1}=3 (for the chessboard 3 times 3 ) is evident (see Fig. 2). To prove that a_{2}=11 by a direct drawing all possibilities is too laborious. Instead of this, we introduce new numbers b_{n} : Let each b_{n} denote the number of all \\"incomplete\\" coverings of a chessboard 3 times(2 n-1) by 3 n-2 pieces 2 times 1, when a fixed corner field 1 times 1 (specified in advance, say the lower right one) remains uncovered. Thanks to the axial symmetry, the numbers b_{n} remain to be the same if the fixed uncovered corner field will be the upper right one. Moreover, it is clear that b_{1}=1.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_207c009ec429634e3f25g-06.jpg?height=202&width=618&top_left_y=2040&top_left_x=752)Fig. 2Now we are going to prove that for each n>1, the following equalities hold:b_{n}=a_{n-1}+b_{n-1} quad text { and } quad a_{n}=a_{n-1}+2 b_{n} .[^1]The first equality in (1) follows from a partition of all (above described) \\"incomplete\\" coverings of a chessboard 3 times(2 n-1) into two (disjoint) classes which are formed by coverings of types A and B, respectively, see Fig. 3. Notice that the numbers of elements (i.e. coverings) in the two classes are a_{n-1} and b_{n-1}, respectively.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_207c009ec429634e3f25g-07.jpg?height=203&width=320&top_left_y=521&top_left_x=662)A![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_207c009ec429634e3f25g-07.jpg?height=188&width=305&top_left_y=523&top_left_x=1024)BFig. 3Similarly, the second equality in (1) follows from a partition of all coverings of a chessboard 3 times 2 n into three (disjoint) classes which are formed by coverings of types C, D and E respectively, see Fig. 4. It is evident that the numbers of elements in the three classes are a_{n-1}, b_{n} and b_{n}, respectively.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_17_207c009ec429634e3f25g-07.jpg?height=236&width=1024&top_left_y=1112&top_left_x=480)Fig. 4Now we are ready to compute the requested number a_{5}. Since a_{1}=3 and b_{1}=1, the proved equalities (1) successively yieldbegin{gathered}b_{2}=a_{1}+b_{1}=4, a_{2}=a_{1}+2 b_{2}=11, b_{3}=a_{2}+b_{2}=15, a_{3}=a_{2}+2 b_{3}=41, b_{4}=a_{3}+b_{3}=56, a_{4}=a_{3}+2 b_{4}=153, b_{5}=a_{4}+b_{4}=209, a_{5}=a_{4}+2 b_{5}=571 .end{gathered}Answer. The number of coverings of the chessboard 3 times 10 equals 571 .Remark. Let us show that the numbers a_{n} of coverings of a chessboard 3 times 2 n by pieces 2 times 1 satisfy the following recurrence equationa_{n+2}=4 a_{n+1}-a_{n} text { for each } n geqslant 1 text {. }(Thus the numbers a_{n} can be computed without using auxiliary numbers b_{n} from the above solution.) We prove (2) by excluding the numbers from the relations (1):begin{aligned}a_{n+2} & =a_{n+1}+2 b_{n+2}=a_{n+1}+2left(a_{n+1}+b_{n+1}right) & =3 a_{n+1}+2 b_{n+1}=3 a_{n+1}+left(a_{n+1}-a_{n}right)=4 a_{n+1}-a_{n}end{aligned}Finally, let us remind a well known result: each sequence left(a_{n}right)_{n=1}^{infty} of numbers satisfying (2) is of the form a_{n}=C_{1} lambda_{1}^{n}+C_{2} lambda_{2}^{n}, where lambda_{1,2}=2 pm sqrt{3} are the roots of the equation lambda^{2}=4 lambda-1 while C_{1,2} are arbitrary constants. Taking in account our values a_{1}=3 and a_{2}=11, we conclude that for each n, the number a_{n} of all coverings of a chessboard 3 times 2 n by pieces 2 times 1 is given by a direct formulaa_{n}=frac{3+sqrt{3}}{6} cdot(2+sqrt{3})^{n}+frac{3-sqrt{3}}{6} cdot(2-sqrt{3})^{n} ."},{"problem":"7.

However, gcd(255,210) is clearly not 1 (they share a common factor of 5). Obviously, condition I is false, so we can rule out choices A,B, and C.

In other words, if a shares some common factor that is not 1 with 14 and b shares some common factor that is not 1 with 15, then c also shares a common factor with 210.

We can express 14 as a'cdot n', for some positive integer n' (this n' can be 1). We can factor a' out to get a'(15n+14n')=c.We know that all values in this equation are integers, so c must be divisible by a'.

Hence frac{c^{2}}{d-c}=d or frac{c^{2}}{d-c}=c. The first case is impossible because we obtain an equality (c / d)^{2}+(c / d)-1=0, which implies that c / d is irrational.

Since each of the hunters A and B hits and kills a duck as often as they miss, the probability of killing a duck for each of these hunters with each individual shot is 1 / 2, i.e., the same as the probability of a coin landing heads. Thus, our problem is equivalent to the following: A tosses a coin 50 times, and B tosses it 51 times; what is the probability that heads will appear more times for B than for A? It is not difficult to calculate the number of equally probable outcomes of this experiment; however, calculating the number of favorable outcomes here is relatively complex. We will not perform this calculation, but instead use the following simple artificial reasoning.The set of all outcomes of the experiment, where A tosses a coin 50 times and B tosses it 51 times, can be divided into the following two parts: 1) the set of all outcomes where B gets more heads than A, and 2) the set of all outcomes where B gets no more (i.e., fewer or the same number of) heads than A. Note now that if B gets the same number of heads as A or even fewer, then it means that the tails for B appeared more times than for A, and vice versa, if the tails for B appeared more times than for A, then it means that the heads for B appeared either the same number of times as for A or even fewer (since B tosses the coin one more time than A). Therefore, the set of outcomes where B gets no more heads than A coincides with the set of outcomes where B gets more tails than A. But in the case of complete equality of heads and tails on the coin, the number of outcomes where B gets more heads than A should be equal to the number of outcomes where B gets more tails than A. Thus, in our problem, the number of favorable outcomes of the experiment is equal to the number of unfavorable outcomes, from which it immediately follows that the desired probability is 1 / 2.Therefore, the probability that B's catch will exceed A's catch is 1 / 2.Note. The provided solution remains valid in the case where A encounters n ducks during the hunt, and B encounters n+1 ducks. And in this more general case, the probability that B's catch will exceed A's catch is also 1 / 2."},{"problem":"9.4.

Since ( A ) is equidistant from ( O ) and ( H ), we have ( AO = AH ).4. The distance ( AO ) is the circumradius ( R ) of ( triangle ABC ).5. To find ( AH ), we use the fact that in any triangle, the distance from a vertex to the orthocenter can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles of the triangle. Specifically, for vertex ( A ), the distance ( AH ) is given by:   [   AH = 2R cos A   ]   where ( R ) is the circumradius and ( A ) is the angle at vertex ( A ).6. Given ( AO = AH ), we substitute ( AO = R ) and ( AH = 2R cos A ) into the equation:   [   R = 2R cos A   ]7. Simplifying the equation, we get:   [   1 = 2 cos A   ]   [   cos A = frac{1}{2}   ]8.

Solution. First, consider some fixed vertical order of laying the glasses (from bottom to top). It is clear that by rotating the entire layout by some angle, we will not change the layout (we will not get a new layout). Therefore, we can assume that the bottom glass in the layout is always fixed (does not rotate). Then the layouts (with a fixed vertical order of glasses) will differ from each other by the rotation of each of the subsequent four upper glasses by 0^{circ}, 90^{circ}, 180^{circ}, and 270^{circ} relative to the fixed bottom glass. Therefore, we will get a total of 4^{4}=256 layout options with a fixed vertical order of glasses. Adding now all possible vertical permutations of the five glasses (5!=120 options), we get the total number of possible glass layouts in a stack: 5!4^{4}=120 cdot 256=30720 pieces. But not all these layouts meet the condition of the problem. The layouts that meet the condition of the problem are only those in which the entire stack turns out to be vertically opaque. Consider the columns of triangles located above each of the four fixed triangles of the bottom glass. The condition of the problem will be met when each of these four columns is opaque. One of these columns is already opaque by default (the one standing on the bottom shaded triangle). Consider the ordered set (vector) of possible angles of rotation (for definiteness, clockwise) of the shaded triangles on each of the 4 upper glasses relative to the bottom shaded triangle: left(alpha_{1}, alpha_{2}, alpha_{3}, alpha_{4}right), where alpha_{k} inleft{0^{circ}, 90^{circ}, 180^{circ}, 270^{circ}right}, k=1,2,3,4.All \\"columns\\" of glass triangles will be opaque if in this set of rotation angles there is at least one angle 90^{circ}, at least one angle 180^{circ}, and at least one angle 270^{circ} (while the angle 0^{circ} does not have to appear, although it will not hurt if it does appear). To count the total number of such sets (and thus the number of layouts with a fixed vertical order of glasses), we will divide them into four groups:- sets in which all rotation angles are different, i.e., all alpha_{k} are pairwise different; there are a total of 4!=24 such sets (due to permutations);- sets in which the rotation angles 180^{circ} and 270^{circ} appear once each, and the rotation angle 90^{circ} appears twice; there are a total of 6 cdot 2=12 such sets (here 6 is the number of positions in the vector for two angles of 90^{circ}, and 2 is the two permutations of the angles 180^{circ} and 270^{circ} in the remaining two positions);- sets in which the rotation angles 90^{circ} and 270^{circ} appear once each, and the rotation angle 180^{circ} appears twice; similarly, there are a total of 6 cdot 2=12 such sets (due to permutations);- sets in which the rotation angles 90^{circ} and 180^{circ} appear once each, and the rotation angle 270^{circ} appears twice; similarly, there are a total of 6 cdot 2=12 such sets (due to permutations).In the end, we get a total of 24+12+12+12=60 ordered sets of rotation angles that meet the required condition. This is the total number of layouts with a fixed vertical order of glasses, in which the final stack turns out to be opaque.

Count the number of partitions:   - We need to count the number of partitions of (10) into parts each at least (2).   - This can be done by considering the generating function:     [     G(x) = frac{x^2}{1-x} cdot frac{x^2}{1-x} cdot ldots cdot frac{x^2}{1-x}     ]     which simplifies to:     [     G(x) = frac{x^{2k}}{(1-x)^k}     ]     where (k) is the number of parts.5. List all possible partitions:   - We can list all possible partitions of (10) into parts each at least (2):     [     begin{aligned}     &2+2+2+2+2,      &2+2+2+4,      &2+2+3+3,      &2+2+6,      &2+3+5,      &2+4+4,      &3+3+4,      &3+6,      &4+5,      &10.     end{aligned}     ]6. Count the permutations:   - For each partition, count the number of permutations:     [     begin{aligned}     &2+2+2+2+2 & text{(1 way)},      &2+2+2+4 & text{(5 ways)},      &2+2+3+3 & text{(10 ways)},      &2+2+6 & text{(4 ways)},      &2+3+5 & text{(12 ways)},      &2+4+4 & text{(6 ways)},      &3+3+4 & text{(12 ways)},      &3+6 & text{(3 ways)},      &4+5 & text{(6 ways)},      &10 & text{(1 way)}.     end{aligned}     ]7. Sum the permutations:   - Sum the number of permutations for each partition:     [     1 + 5 + 10 + 4 + 12 + 6 + 12 + 3 + 6 + 1 = 70.     ]Therefore, the number of ways to write (12) as an ordered sum of integers where the smallest of those integers is equal to (2) is (boxed{70})."},{"problem":"The product of the lengths of the two congruent sides of an obtuse isosceles triangle is equal to the product of the base and twice the triangle's height to the base.

The closed broken line B C D E F B forms a five-pointed \\"star\\".

Let the ray bar{a} coincide with the ray В C. Rotate the ray bar{a} until it coincides with the ray B F. The ray bar{a} will rotate by the angle angle B. Then rotate the ray bar{a} (in its new position) until it coincides with the ray E F. The ray bar{a} will rotate by another angle angle F, and from the start of the movement, by the angle angle B+angle F. Then rotate the ray bar{a} again, this time until it coincides with the ray E D. The ray bar{a} will rotate by another angle angle D, and from the start of the movement, by the angle angle B+angle F+angle E. After performing two more similar rotations, the ray bar{a} will coincide with the ray C B, i.e., it will have rotated by 180^{circ} from the start of the movement and, at the same time, by the sum of the angles angle B+angle F+angle E+angle D+angle C.The point of intersection of the segments A B and F G is the point K(2 ; 3).We will prove this. Let L(2 ; 0), M(7 ; 0). Then triangle K F L sim triangle G F M, since their legs are proportional. Therefore, angle K F L=angle G F M, so K in F G. Similarly, K in A B.Another way. The equation of the line A B: y=4 x-5. The equation of the line F G: y=frac{3}{5} x+frac{9}{5}. Solving the system of these two equations, we get the coordinates of the intersection point of these lines: (2 ; 3).Find the lengths of the sides of triangle B K G: B K=sqrt{1^{2}+4^{2}}=sqrt{17}, B G= sqrt{4^{2}+(-1)^{2}}=sqrt{17}, G K=sqrt{5^{2}+3^{2}}=sqrt{34}. The triangle triangle B K G is isosceles and, by the converse of the Pythagorean theorem, it is a right triangle.Therefore, the angle angle B K G=45^{circ}. It is an exterior angle for triangle F K B and angle K F B+angle K B F=45^{circ}. Since angle A B C=angle F B C-angle F B A, angle E F G=angle E F B-angle G F B, the required sum of the anglesbegin{gathered}angle A B C+angle E F G+angle B C D+angle C D E+angle D E F= =angle F B C+angle E F B-(angle F B A+angle G F B)+angle B C D+angle C D E+angle D E F= =180^{circ}-45^{circ}=135^{circ}end{gathered}Remark. A similar solution can be obtained based on the fact that the sum of the angles at the rays of any seven-pointed \\"star\\" is also 180^{circ} (the proof, in essence, does not differ from the second proof for a five-pointed star).

Substituting this into equations (2) and (3), they transform into the formbegin{aligned}& 78=2 x_{1}(k-2)(c-d)-frac{1}{2}(k-2)^{2}, & 27=2 x_{1} k(c-d)-frac{1}{2} k^{2} .end{aligned}To eliminate the terms with x_{1} again, we subtract (k-2)-times equation left(3^{prime}right) from k-times equation left(2^{prime}right); we then solve the resulting equation with the unknown k:begin{aligned}78 k-27(k-2) & =-frac{1}{2}(k-2)^{2} cdot k+frac{1}{2} k^{2} cdot(k-2), 51 k+54 & =-frac{1}{2}left(k^{3}-4 k^{2}+4 kright)+frac{1}{2}left(k^{3}-2 k^{2}right), 0 & =k^{2}-53 k-54, 0 & =(k+1)(k-54) .end{aligned}Since the index k is a natural number, it must be k=54. This solves the problem.Let us add that the problem statement does not require us to investigate whether for the found (unique) value of the index k there exist pairs of sequences satisfying the conditions of the problem. For the sake of interest, let us mention that there are actually infinitely many such pairs of sequences; it is necessary and sufficient that their common first term x_{1} and differences c, d satisfy the conditions c^{2}-d^{2}=-frac{1}{2} and x_{1}(c-d)=frac{55}{4}. This follows easily from any of the equations (1)-(3) after substituting the values k=54 and c^{2}-d^{2}=-frac{1}{2}; you can verify this yourself.GUIDING AND ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS:"},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)= begin{cases} log _{2}x,x > 0 2^{x},xleqslant 0 end{cases}, if f(a)= dfrac {1}{2}, then a=(__).A: -1B:  sqrt {2}C: -1 or  sqrt {2}D: 1 or  sqrt {2}","solution":"Let f(a)= dfrac {1}{2}.Then we have either begin{cases} log _{2}a= dfrac {1}{2}, a > 0 end{cases} or begin{cases} 2^{a}= dfrac {1}{2}, aleqslant 0 end{cases}.Solving the first case, log _{2}a= dfrac {1}{2}, gives a = 2^{dfrac{1}{2}} = sqrt{2}.Solving the second case, 2^{a}= dfrac {1}{2}, gives a = log_{2}(dfrac{1}{2}) = -1.Therefore, the possible values for a are -1 or  sqrt {2}.So, the correct answer is: boxed{C}."},{"problem":"12.

Find the probability that Kwu's triangle does not intersect Bread's quadrilateral, where two polygons intersect if they have at least one pair of sides intersecting.

Let's label these points as ( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7 ).2. Labeling the Points:   - Out of these 7 points, Bread selects 4 points to form a quadrilateral. Let's label these points as ( Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, Q_4 ).   - Kwu then selects the remaining 3 points to form a triangle. Let's label these points as ( P_1, P_2, P_3 ).3. Condition for Non-Intersection:   - For Kwu's triangle to not intersect Bread's quadrilateral, the 3 points ( P_1, P_2, P_3 ) must be consecutive on the circle. This ensures that the triangle formed by ( P_1, P_2, P_3 ) lies entirely within one of the arcs formed by the quadrilateral ( Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, Q_4 ).4. Counting Consecutive Points:   - There are 7 points on the circle. We need to count the number of ways to choose 3 consecutive points out of these 7 points.   - The number of ways to choose 3 consecutive points from 7 points is 7. This is because we can start at any of the 7 points and choose the next two points in a clockwise direction.5. Total Combinations:   - The total number of ways to choose any 3 points out of 7 is given by the binomial coefficient ( binom{7}{3} ).   - [   binom{7}{3} = frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = frac{7 times 6 times 5}{3 times 2 times 1} = 35   ]6.

Calculate the distances:   - Distance ( PQ ):     [     PQ = sqrt{(7 - a)^2 + left(3 - frac{a^2}{8}right)^2}     ]   - Distance ( QR ):     [     QR = frac{a^2}{8}     ]5. Formulate the total path length:   The total path length is ( PQ + QR ):   [   L = sqrt{(7 - a)^2 + left(3 - frac{a^2}{8}right)^2} + frac{a^2}{8}   ]6. Minimize the total path length:   To find the minimum path length, we need to minimize ( L ). This involves taking the derivative of ( L ) with respect to ( a ) and setting it to zero. However, this can be complex, so we use geometric insights instead.7. Use geometric properties:   The shortest path from a point to a parabola and then to the ( x )-axis can be found using the reflection property of parabolas. The point ( (7, 3) ) reflects over the directrix ( y = -2 ) to ( (7, -7) ). The shortest path from ( (7, -7) ) to the parabola ( y = frac{x^2}{8} ) is a straight line to the focus of the parabola, which is at ( (0, 2) ).8. Calculate the distance from ( (7, 3) ) to the focus ( (0, 2) ):   [   PF = sqrt{(7 - 0)^2 + (3 - 2)^2} = sqrt{49 + 1} = sqrt{50} = 5sqrt{2}   ]9. Adjust for the distance to the ( x )-axis:   Since the distance from the focus to the ( x )-axis is 2 units, the total path length is:   [   5sqrt{2} - 2   ]The final answer is ( boxed{5sqrt{2} - 2} )."},{"problem":"35.

Therefore, it must be that M=m, from which it follows that a=2 b and by comparing both sides of the modified equation also 2 b+1=3 c. Since 2 b+1 is an odd number, the number c must also be odd, so there exists a natural number n for which c=2 n-1. From the equation 2 b+1=3 c we calculate b=3 n-2 and a=2 b=6 n-4.For any natural number n, the triplet (a, b, c)=(6 n-4,3 n-2,2 n-1) is a solution to the given equation, which can be verified by substitution, although this is not necessary in this process.Note.

Initial Setup:   Let (a_1 = a) and (a_2 = b). Then, the recurrence relation becomes:   [ a_3 = frac{a(b + 1)}{b - 1} ]2. Expression for (a_3):   We can rewrite (a_3) as:   [ a_3 = a + frac{2a}{b - 1} ]   For (a_3) to be an integer, (frac{2a}{b - 1}) must be an integer.

Case 1: ( t_1 ) ends in 1:   - The largest digit ( l ) of ( t_1 ) must be even (since ( t_2 ) must be odd).   - Adding an even digit to a number ending in 1 results in a number ending in an odd digit.   - However, the next term ( t_3 ) will end in an even digit because adding the largest digit (which is odd) to an odd number results in an even number.   - Therefore, at most 2 successive odd terms can exist.

Case 3: ( t_1 ) ends in 5:   - If the largest digit ( l ) of ( t_1 ) is such that ( l + 5 leq 9 ), then ( t_2 ) will end in ( l + 5 ), which is even.   - If ( l + 5 > 9 ), then ( l = 6 ) and ( t_2 ) will end in 1.   - Using Case 1, at most 2 more terms can follow, resulting in at most 3 successive odd terms.   - If ( l = 8 ), then ( t_2 ) will end in 3.   - Using Case 2, at most 2 more terms can follow, resulting in at most 4 successive odd terms.   Case 4: ( t_1 ) ends in 7:   - If the largest digit ( l ) of ( t_1 ) is such that ( l + 7 leq 9 ), then ( t_2 ) will end in ( l + 7 ), which is even.   - If ( l + 7 > 9 ), then ( l = 4 ) and ( t_2 ) will end in 1.   - Using Case 1, at most 2 more terms can follow, resulting in at most 3 successive odd terms.   - If ( l = 6 ), then ( t_2 ) will end in 3.   - Using Case 2, at most 2 more terms can follow, resulting in at most 4 successive odd terms.   - If ( l = 8 ), then ( t_2 ) will end in 5.   - Using Case 3, at most 3 more terms can follow, resulting in at most 5 successive odd terms.   Case 5: ( t_1 ) ends in 9:   - The next term will be even, as adding 9 results in a number ending in 8.   - Therefore, no successive odd terms can follow.3.

This is a moderately difficult problem.Step-by-Step Solution1. First, we need to find the distance between the origin (0, 0) and the line 2x + y + 5 = 0.2.

From this, x^{2}=2left[(a+b)^{2}-a bright]^{2}.The equality can only hold if x=0, because on the left side, a square number stands, in which every prime factor appears with an even exponent, while on the right side, the exponent of 2 is odd.Thus, (a+b)^{2}-a b=0.

A square number (and thus any fourth power as well) when divided by 4 can only give a remainder of 0 or 1, the former when it is even, the latter when it is odd. Indeed, if x is even, then x=2 k, so x^{2}=4 k^{2} is divisible by 4. If, however, x is odd, then x=2 k+1, sox^{2}=(2 k+1)^{2}=4 k^{2}+4 k+1=4left(k^{2}+kright)+1Thus, among a, b, and a+b, at most one can be odd, since their sum, which is a square number, can only give a remainder of 0 or 1 when divided by 4. However, if, for example, a is odd, and then b must be even, a+b would also be odd, which is a contradiction. Therefore, a and b are both even (and then of course a+b is also even): a=2 a_{1}, b=2 b_{1}. Therefore, if a^{4}+(a+b)^{4}+b^{4}=16left(a_{1}^{4}+left(a_{1}+b_{1}right)^{4}+b_{1}^{4}right) is a square number, then a_{1}^{4}+left(a_{1}+b_{1}right)^{4}+b_{1}^{4} is also a square number.
