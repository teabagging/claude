Angioplasty directly cant cause low blood pressure. but since he has got an angioplasty that means he has some heart issues which can cause low blood pressure. so again if he had symptoms like dizziness, feeling weak, loss of consciousness, sweating, then it is a matter of concern. Another factor here is that since he has underwent an angioplasty, he must be on blood pressure medications. some medications which keep the heart rate in control can also cause low blood pressure. So in short there are many factors that should be evaluated here. If he has another low blood pressure episode consider stopping or decreasing dose of one blood pressure medication. Also if the reading was from a home electronic BP monitor please get it checked. Alternatively you can also get your pressure checked with the same machine to check its accuracy.

There has not been any unusual stress excecess caffeine or any other issues causing stress.  I am very concerned.  Could this be a blockage or infection of the heart or possibly a lung issue causing the heart problems?","Doctor":"hello thanks for posting here.going by what you described primarily looks like a panic attack. EKG is not required at this point of time. once an anxiety factor is ruled out, and if she has similar complaints again then an EKG would be advisable l. another possibility is that  she has got arrhythmias which means irregular fast heart beats. these can lead to palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue etc. A blockage in the heart arteries seem unlikely in view of her young age. this may be due to some electric impulse conduction problems in the heart which can lead to fast heart beats. . also get her thyroid function tests done because thyroid abnormalities can cause palpitations and shortness of breath. wishing you good health"},{"Patient":"i have a lump on the side of my face, between my face and ear lobe.

First DVT that means blood clots in the veins which blocks the blood flow and increases the pressure inside the blood vessels. This leads to the leakage of the plasma into the tissues surrounding the veins causing swelling and pain. Second cause could be an expanding hematoma, means an injury to the one of your leg vessels thereby leaking blood into the surrounding tissues. Usually if this injury is not very severe, it heals spontaneously but as your blood pressure is high, it can interfere with the healing of the vessel and cause continuous leakage of blood.Now coming to high BP, but you are not having any symptoms! could be due to the fact that the high BP could have been there for quite a time so that your body has adapted to it. But still it needs to be evaluated and treated.With these possibilities, I would like to get an urgent ultrasonography and a colour Doppler of your right lower limb and treat accordingly.Simultaneously, to get a ultrasonography of the kidneys and renal Doppler to rule out the secondary causes of the high BP.

What are the physiological consequences of this defect?","Doctor":"hello thanks for posting here. transposition of great vessels or TGA is a condition where the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. In our body, the left ventricle supplies oxygenated blood via the aorta to the various organs of the body to provide oxygen for  them to function. the right ventricle receives all this deoxygenated blood back from the organs and then pumps it into the lungs through the pulmonary artery to oxygenate the blood again which is then again directed towards the left side of the heart and the cycle continues. in TGA, Since the connections are interchanged, the deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle goes into the aorta and hence the organs of the body receive deoxygenated blood. this leads to symptoms like breathlessness, bluish discoloration of skin, multiorgan dysfunction etc. similarly the oxygenated blood from the lungs goes to the left ventricle and then into the pulmonary artery again into the lung. so body doesnt receive oxygenated blood. when the fetus is inside the mother, there is a connection between the aorta and pulmonary artery which closes after birth . this duct is called ductus arteriosus which helps in mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood when fetus is inside the mother. in infants with TGA, it is necessary to keep this ductus arteriousus (DA) patent so that oxy- and deoxygenated blood can mix and thr infant receives some amount of oxygenated blood. So inorder to keep this duct patent some medications are given till corrective surgery is done. corrective surgeries basically reconnect the connections so as to supply oxygenared blood to organs and deoxygenated to lungs. Also know there are two forms of TGA, corrected and uncorrected. corrected is when there is transposition but left ventricle depsite being connected to pulmonary artery, the pulmonary artery further supplies the body organs. therefore corrected TGAs are normally asymptomatic and dont require surgery. Uncorrected TGAs are symptomatic and usually require corrective surgeries. i hope this solves your queries. It is very confusing initially to understand, I have used the best possible way to explain you. thank you"},{"Patient":"hi there can you help i have found a lump on my vagina in the pubic area boy freind said might be an ingrowing hair but i dont shave were the lump is it is also swollen and dosent movethe are is also red and hurts to touch pleas help never had one befor","Doctor":"hi.based from your description, yes, it could be folliculitis. this usually occurs after shaving or when a hair is accidentally pulled out and it gets infected. it could also be a cyst, or an inflammatory reaction which is starting to form an abscess. a consult with your gynecologist is best for clinical evaluation. medical and/or surgical management will be directed accordingly.hope this helps.good day!!~dr.kaye"},{"Patient":"Doc, my daughter fell off from BBQ in the park, stand on the grill but wasnt stable so she shoot down to the ground and bump her head; bruises in her forehead and lump; i have put ice after 5 mins of the accident. should I worry?

Please type your query here...My daughter was diagnosed with pulmonic stenosis never has had any problems with it she has a cardiac cath when she was 1 she is now 7 but the doctor said from having the cardiac cath it caused leakage but thats the nature of the beast as he put it after a cath I worry all the time about this.","Doctor":"Dear, first of all, please understand that pulmonary stenosis is basically the tightness of one of the valves on the right side of the heart and in your daughter's case, it seems to be by birth.You have mentioned that she underwent cardiac cath at the age of 1, but you didnot mention that only the cath study was done and what was the gradient at that time or the ballooning was also done.Now she is 7 years old and she never had any symptoms as per you (I presume she never had palpitations, loss of consciousness, chest pain, swelling feet or face, easy fatigability), so I would just do ECHO to look for the gradient across the pulmonary valve and then decide if the cardiac cath is required or not.Now coming to your worry about the leakage in  the valve. A tight valve is rigid and it doesn't close properly sometimes leading to leakage which can sometimes become worrisome and needs surgery. And ballooning of the tight valve can also lead to some leakage in the valve and this ballooning is done only if there is no leakage initially.I hope I have cleared your queries to some extent!!All the best"},{"Patient":"i have a bump the size of a nickel under my arm, its not red it dont itch, i read that people have \\"popped\\" them and fluid came out but mine is deep into my skin. i dont like going to doctors i just wanted to know what it could be. i am scared since i lost my father 4 months ago to a number of different cancers","Doctor":"hi.based from your description, it could be an enlarged or an inflamed lymph node especially if you had a recent infection in the upper respiratory tract. it could also be hidradenitis suppurativa, a common underarm infection, especially after shaving or plucking hair in the underarm. it is best if you have it clinically examined by a doctor, preferably a general surgeon. further diagnostics such as ultrasound and management (medical and/or surgical if indications are found) will be done accordingly.hope this helps.good day!!~dr.kaye"},{"Patient":"\\"i have a concern about 3 months ago i got a knot under my armpit and went to the doctor and he told me it was a boil.... and about a week ago my husband was n the hospital for the same knot under his armpit and this am i woke up with another one... when it poops its purple and has white stuff come in out of it","Doctor":"hi.it is best if you consult with a doctor, preferably a general surgeon, for medical and physical examination. based from your description, it could be hidradenitis suppurativa. these lesions usually occur on the underarm, especially after shaving or plucking and/or usage of deodorants with strong chemical contents. hair follicles get infected. inflammation and subsequent abscess formation occur.  medical (proper antibiotic regimen) and surgical (excision or incision and drainage) management will be directed accordingly.hope this helps.good day!!~dr.kaye"},{"Patient":"I'm 16.

Our primary then referred us to a general surgeon who removed the lump on 11/8.  The surgeon moved up his post-op visit because he felt that based on what he saw that he would be referring us to an oncologist.  However, the pathology came back benign.  The pathology reoprt did mention granulomas so we were referred to an infectious disease specialist who has run numerous tests all of which have been unremarkable except the c-reactive which was a little high.  I believe it was 9.  They did notice some nodules on his lungs for which we were referred to a pulmonary specialist who assured us that they were normal.  However, he did suggest that my husband obtain a ct of the abdomen and pelvis as the did notice some enlargement of the spleen.  About a week ago my husbands left elbow became swollen similar to the look of the axillary. Although he has no history of more than a cold in his 44 years, his father had non-hodgkins and his mother had a brain tumor.  They had about a 5 acre farm in which pesticides were used and I feel concerned that this could be related. At the present time he has little or no complaints.

Could the pathology have been wrong and should we seek a consult with an oncologist? Thank you for your time. Terri","Doctor":"Hi, dearI have gone through your question.

Eventhough, as you have 6 months with high levels of TG in blood, is advisable to start a treatment with fibrates. Fibrates are a class of medication that lowers blood triglyceride levels. I hope your trygliceride test is performed well, as it is strongly affected by diet and alcohol. The test should be performed at a fasting state and after 24 hours of alcohol-free time. You should eat a low fat meal the night before the test. Restrict food and fluid intake after midnight the night before the test.So if you have any doubt that the test is not performed promptly, please repeat it respecting the rules above mentioned. If the result is still high, than you should see an endocrinologist , in way to begin a treatment with fibrates. Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications. Otherwise please close and rate the answer.Kind Regards, Dr. Juarda"},{"Patient":"I have some lumps on my feet, on the top and under my big toe.

It was slightly irritated but I didn t think anything of it. Over the next several weeks, instead of going away, it got much bigger. Now it s about the size of a large pea. It was flesh colored for a while until I researched and found it was probably a dermatofibroma which could potentially be frozen off. I tried a few nitrogen freezing sessions on it and all I ve managed to do is destroy my skin and make the bump permanently red. It will sometimes itch and it hurts a lot when it s bumped (but it s also on the back of my boney hand). I am uninsured and have asked around and it apparently could cost about 750 to have it removed. Are there differentiating characteristics between dermatofibroma and nodular melanoma that I may use to narrow down how important this could be to remove? I tried the pinch test but the skin is so damaged it doesn t move over the bump. Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM.By the facts of your query,You neither have Dermatofibroma nor nodular melanoma on back of your left hand.Don't treat by self diagnosis,which could complicate a simple problem in to complex issue like yours.Nitrogen Freezing has made the skin on the lump fixed to the lump and has made its diagnosis little more difficult.In  my opinion you  seem to have-Ganglion Cyst of the Wrist dorsom.Its a benign condition and is a histiocytoma-hamartomatous cyst form the synovial lining of the small bone joints of the wrist.If hot fomentation/Cold compresses/Anti-inflammatory drugs don't reduce it,then I would suggest CT scan and planned Arthroscopic laser ablation,which reduces its recurrence chances,than a open surgical treatment from a Surgeon or Orthopedic endoscopic Surgeon.Hope this would help you to plan treatment with your doctor.Will appreciate hitting thanks and writing review comments to benefit needy patient visitors at HCM like you.Good day.Dr.Savaskar M.N.Senior Surgical Specialist.M.S.Genl-CVTS."},{"Patient":"A couple days ago I woke up with a bit of a sore throat and a headache and then had a low grade temp later that night.

I cnt tell if it grew or stayed the same size when I noticed it 2 nights ago, I only have pain nothing else except dizziness here n there","Doctor":"Hi Dear, Welcome to HCM. Understanding your concern. As per your query painful lump on the ear is mostly due to unripe Boil or the infection of the ear lobe. It could be enlarged lymph nodes , lymph nodes respond to infection/inflammation and eustachian tube salpingitis with throat infection. i would suggest you to dogargles with Listerine antiseptic mouth wash. Take a course of penicillin antibiotics + anti inflammatory medicines like paracetamol + diclofenac combination drugs for 3 to 5 days. Visit ENT specialist if symptoms keeps on persisting. Go for surgical excision if it is not treatable medicinally.Hope your concern has been resolved.Get Well Soon.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"Hi um I am 18 and a girl.

UMMm i have had a cold for the past 2 weeks mild tho. plz help me thank u.","Doctor":"Hi Dear,Welcome to HCM.Understanding your concern. As per your query red colored lump under the tongue can be due to injury to a minor salivary gland or its ducts leading to spillage of mucous into the adjacent soft tissues leading to formation of a lump. It can also be due to blockage of the duct of major salivary gland known as submandibular salivary gland due to crystalline deposits formed by the minerals present in the saliva. It could be canker sore or caused due to trauma from any food item. I would suggest you to consult a dentist and get evaluated for the exact cause of the lump. If it is due to salivary duct blockage it will resolve by digital manipulation and surgical excision. Laser ablation is another treatment option.Hope your concern has been resolved.Get Well Soon.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"I took a shower and while i was drying off i realized i had a large lump with bruisimg on the side of my calf.

My left groin area is slightly swollen and has been for 6 months. The swelling goes from the testi (which has been diagnosed with a spermatocile via an ultrasound), and extends approximately 3 along the line between the leg & abdomen. I ve been told it is not lymph nodes or a hernia. Sports does not affect the amount of swelling or cause pain. Near the testi, where the swelling starts, there is a small movable lump that can be pushed downward into the testi. I was wondering if that lump, which is normally found in the testi, up near the base of the penis, could be blocking some kind of fluid flow and causing the swelling? I ve had a couple of cat Scans before and am reluctant to have another one due to the radiation.","Doctor":"hi.it is best if you consult with a urologist with regards to your spermatocoele as it might be progressing. you will not be exposed to any radiation on ultrasonographic examination. further diagnostic modalities and management will be directed accordingly.hope this helps.good day!!~dr.kaye"},{"Patient":"I have severe headaches every so often.

The most probable reason of this lump is Bartholin cyst. This is a benign lesion which appears due to vagina gland obstruction. As the gland is obstructed, it becomes inflamed.

Gynecologist should do that.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with SDS, high vTach and low Brac Tach in 2005 after being on Vioxx for a long period of time.

The exhaustion could be simply due to age or there might be underlying medical problem. If you feel it's not just age related,  Anemia usually presents with such symptom. Or any problem in your pacemaker could affect the pumping capacity of your heart leading to less supply of blood to organs. Hence the early exhaustion. I recommend you to get a thorough medical examination done."},{"Patient":"hi i have had a light black lump on my arm that suddenly appeared about 2 years ago, just lately is has started to feel a bit sore so i scratched it and alot of blood pus came out of it, it has started to hurt a bit more and theres a white bit in the middle which when i tried to pick out was attached to a long white stick. it is also weeping now. just wondered if its something i should be worried about","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.From your description it seems to be a sebaceus cyst.

But very close to connection of my ribs).  It doesn't hurt if I put some pressure on the lump, but sometimes the lump gives me increadible pain.  Sharp reoccuring intense stabbing pains that give me a shock about once every minute or two.  Strangely though, even when it gives me these painful shocks, it still doesn't hurt if I press down on it with reasonable force.  I think it probably has something to due with my heartburn (I get that pretty bad to the point I'm almost sure I've got acid reflux).  Sometimes I can just take a lot of antacids and the pain subsides (albeit not very quickly at all), but I'm worried that maybe this lump is something that's not supposed to be there.  It's a fairly prominent lump -- if I suck in my stomach as far as I can then I can kind of see the outline of it (and I'm 6'' 190lbs, kinda fat in my midsection).  It seems symetrical and oval shapped with the longer axis running vertically with diameter about 1 inch.  It's smaller axis runs horizontally with diameter about a half of an inch.  There's no specific trigger to it, but I find that some foods can cause the pain to get worse (salty foods it seems).  I know that you'll probably just say \\"Go to a Doctor, lumps can be serious\\", but I guess what I'm wondering is if other people have heard of having lumps there, or could this be what an ulcer feels like?","Doctor":"Hi,Dear,Thanks for your query to HCM virtual Clinic.I studied your query in all the details put forth by you.I understood your health concerns about the  chest lump.Cause of the health problems you queried-After reviewing the details of your query,In my opinion the lump seems to be Costo-Chondritis which is simultaneously associated with GERD,which you have(Gastro-Esophagel Reflux Disease) and labelled it as Acid refulx.Thus the overlap of the reflux acidity with chest pain,has confused you about this twin health problem with you.Remedy -If I would have been attending there,I would advise-Tab Proton Pump Inhibitors(like Proton-D) once a day at 6 pm.-Reduce on spicy / fried diet-Voltaren Gel locally x as the lump is not painful on pressure, and would take care of the Costo-Chondritis locally.-Hot formentation  locally,-Infrared Heat with your doctorAs I don't have any direct photo of the lump / or not many details from you, I would advise you to consult surgeon/or Ortho Surgeon.Hence I would advise you to consult ER Ortho-Surgeon,who would differentiate from other possible causes for the lump in that area.

But directly thinking about lung cancer at this age should not be your attitude, despite the history of smoking. And its always better to rule out the causes rather than thinking on it. please do a chest x ray, an EKG, fasting and post prandial blood sugars, BP, complete blood count. this would give you a fair idea. further course can be decided after the reports. stay positive, eat healthy, avoid smoking. rule out diabetes also. wishing you good health"},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor I am  a 33 year old male with a small movable lump half the size of  a pea located just above my Adams apple just a bit to the left.

I have a clean medical history. No issues or allergys. Heart disease does trun in my family. But I have no heart issues. Anyway my problem is on my forehead. I always had a slight what I would describe as a slight soft fatty tissue under my skin under my hairline the size of a penny. It was not noticebale except to me really. This created a small soft bump. Not really a problem physically or appearnce wise. Recently I got a haircut and couple people asked me if I bumped my head. I had not but they noticed the bump. I figured it was because of my shorter hair they noticed the bump. Well 2 weeks ago I noticed the area was inflamed & reddish. I assumed it was an acne eruption or I got a chemical reation to something at work. I treated area with heat pad & ice along with some cortizone cream. The skin broke and now their is a soft tissue that protrudes up slightly. It does not hurt when I press down but creates a bump and is reddish. I treated it with iodine and hydrogen peroxid. It is not infected. Just seems like what I thought maybe was a small cyst is on my forehead. I rubbed the cortizone cream on the wound whch is size of a penny. The wound is not really healing after over 2 weeks. It s not an open wound. Just the skin is very rawish looking and pink. When I rub on the sac like cysts it feels tough like cartliage rather than skin. I am going to see my primary care doctor a board certified internist. I was curious based on my description what you thought it might be and if in your opinion with proper care. That I might be able to get my forehead looking like it used to be. As for now I am walking around with a regular sized bandage on my forehead which is kinda embarrassing. As I said it s not bleeding, nor does it hurt. Just looks like I have a sore that has not healed on my forehead. My thinking is it s a cyst of some kind that needs either antibiotics or possible removal. As I said it s size of a penny. If it were not on my forehaed I would not be as concrned as I am. It s worrying me that I am permanently going to be disfigured or something. Thank You-----Tim In Indianapolis.","Doctor":"hi, tim.if you're not experiencing any other symptomatology, yes, it's most probably a cyst, a fibroma or even a lipoma based from your description. and the definitive treatment for that is surgery or excision biopsy. if you're concerned aesthetically, you could opt for a plastic surgery consult. but it's a surgery that could easily be done by a general surgeon as well. usually, the surgeon will cut along the lines of your skin, as minimal as possible, to remove the cyst. after the surgery, inflammation will be observed. but few days after, it will resolved and heal accordingly.hope this helps.good day!!~dr.kaye"},{"Patient":"My 15 year old son has a lump about the size of a quarter on the top of his forearm. it has two small black dots in the center of it.

However since you also said you gave birth 6 months ago it is also important to know whether you are still lactating/breast feeding, which can also cause the lumps/tenderness/soreness.  If you have lumps on your breast, i suggest you get a breast ultrasound to rule out any masses (which could be due to cysts, milk ducts, etc).  For now, you can place warm compress over the painful areas for 15 minutes to decrease the swelling, and take the medicine prescribed to you, while you are scheduling for further diagnostic exam."},{"Patient":"I bump my leg against the edge of a table (lower part) about a week ago and now there is a knot in that area and it has started to hurt real bad.

Should I be worried?","Doctor":"hello! your lump could be due to blood pooling (hematoma) on the area where you got stabbed that is why there is also discoloration/bruising.  There are also a lot of nerve endings in the hand, and the swelling in the area could cause the tingling.  I suggest you just placed a warm compress around the area if the accident is more than 24hours already (an ice compress will help if it is less than 24hours).  You can also take over the counter anti inflammatory medications if you are not allergic to it.  If it persist despite of these tips, you need to set an appointment with a physician to thoroughly examine the lump."},{"Patient":"My son has large lump on side of shin (inwards lower leg front), resulting from kick while wrestling in school match.

How long until the fluid from this type of injury goes away?","Doctor":"hello! usually the fluid in your son's case is due to blood pooling (hematoma).  The fluid takes about 2-4 weeks before it completely resolves.  the complication of not taking out the fluid is infection.  I suggest you place warm compress in the area for 15mins, 3x/day, to help the fluid soften and be absorbed by the body.  if it persist and gets red, consult your doctor, it might be an infection already."},{"Patient":"I have found a round moveable lump the size of a large pea near the nipple.

Lumps over the breast can be due to several reasons, but majority of lumps is due to the female hormones (estrogen).  Most lumps are still benign, however, to rule it out a complete breast exam, plus an ultrasound will help the physician to see whether your lump needs a biopsy or not.  personally, i don't request a mammogram for patients who are low risk under 40y/o, hence an ultrasound will suffice for now."},{"Patient":"I think I have a swollen lymph node in-between my arm pit and my breast.

Any ideas of what this could be?  Should I be concerned?  Thanks.","Doctor":"hello!  since you are breastfeeding it could be a milk lump.  I suggest you place a warm compress over the area for 15minutes 3x/day to soften the lumo and pump out milk regularly.  if it persist, you need to see a physician for a complete breast exam."},{"Patient":"My heart will start to beat really fast and it will feel like when i breath it is inhaled through a filter. at times i fell hot, but not really if that makes sense at all. sometimes i get pain that isn t a constant. sometimes its just in the chest. sometimes its through the neck also. sometimes the pain is feeling like sinus pain as well. and sometimes my whole body. i can move freely and rarely get to the point where i feel like shouldn t move. In a sense to me it sounds like a heart attack, but i have had this problem randomly (maybe 3-5 times a year) its a god aweful feeling. i can remember first experiencing this when i was about 8 or 10 (earliest memory of it) just walking outside. other times its after a bike ride, running, or just doing daily things. its not always an active attack, it does happen when im not doing anything at all too.","Doctor":"helloplease be assured that these are all your subjective feelings. heart attacks are acute conditions where you get chest pain or back pain or hand pain.. with each heart attack, some part of the heart muscle dies. so the heart pumping function also decreases. i dont think thats the case in you. believe me  having 3-5 heart attacks a year is quite unlikely in your case. these are just some vague pains arising out of hyperacidity which you then stress on, which in turn increase your subjective feelings. take a course of antacids pantoprazole 40 mg twice a day before food for 7 days and then once a day for 14 days. thank you"},{"Patient":"Periodically I develop a very painful lump between my right hip bone and naval.

Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hi,Dear thanks for  the query to HCM virtual Clinic.I studied your query in all the details put forth by you.I understood your health concerns.The problem of  the painful lump occurs repeatedly between navel and right hip bone,but the exact location whether below in groin or at the level of the navel is not clear from your query and would like to know from you.Constipation or loose motions exists before the painful lump develops.This indicates that the associated increased intra-abdominal pressure presses the intestinal and mesenteric tissue in the Hernial pouch between navel and right hip bone-that is through the weakness in the spigelian line,thus causing PARTIAL OBSTRUCTION OF TH SPEGELIAN HERNIA.This obstructed hernia gets relieved after taking laxatives which relieves the obstruction and that painful lump vanishes in 12 hours.Associated pain and nausea with the painful lump indicates it to be obstructed intestinal hernial contents.Cause of the health problems you queried-With the above explanation you are quite clear about cause of your health problem and it is due to Obstructd Spigelian hernia on right side.Other possibilities as obstructed Inguinal hernia/ indirect type  and or / Femoral hernia,needs to be ruled out,for which I would advise you to consult ER Surgeon,as I have very limited information from your query.Treatment-Treatment of the painful lump would depend on the location of the lump, which would be decided by ER surgeon and hence he would treat it by repair of the obstructed hernia,depending on whether it is Spigelian / indirect inguinal / femoral hernia , by planned surgery.Hope this would resolve your query with full satisfaction and would help you to plan your treatment with your doctor.Welcome for any further query in this regard to ME by direct question at HCM.Write excellent review  and hit thanks, to narrate your experience ,which would improve my rating for many other visitor's to HCM.Wishing you fast recovery.Have a good day.Dr.Savaskar M.N.Senior Surgical Consultant.M.S.Genl-CVTS"},{"Patient":"I had a small scrotal abcess drained today.

When tongue becomes larger than normal, it will press onto your teeth. This tends to cause indentations. There can be many reasons for indentations like Swollen tongue , which could be due to  allergies, some disease and conditions such as amyloidosis, hypothyroidism, tongue cancer, canker sores, scarlet fever and  angioedema . If light test doesn't show anything then there is nothing to panic . The lumps you mention in query are probably due to canker sore due to frictional trauma . These usually go away in few days without any treatment . Do betadine rinses , speak less so that your tongue doesn't get hurt and  do hydrogen peroxide rinses mix with equal amount of water twice a day . If condition persist then consult oral pathologist for proper evaluation . Hope your concern has been resolved.Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"I have a lump just under the scrotum area kind of in the crevis nest to the leg.

Should i return to the dentist?","Doctor":"Hi Dear, Understanding your concern. As per your hard lump on lip is because of proliferation of blood vessels in that area. Actually the probable cause of  lump on lip is mucocoele or mucous cyst .Mucocoele are usually the result of trauma in the mouth, which injures the tiny salivary ducts inside of the lip. Injury or rupture of these microscopic excretory ducts leads to an accumulation of mucus inside of the connective tissue of the lip. Lip biting or the sucking action drawing the mucous membranes of the lower lip between the teeth are thought to be common causes. I would suggest you to consult oral surgeon for proper examination . Doctor may order biopsy of cyst to rule out causes like cancer or lipoma . Doctor may prescribe anti inflammatory medicines along with antibiotics .

What can you suggest?","Doctor":"Hi Dear ,Understanding your concern.As per your query you have multiple lipomas around 20- 25 on each arm which is a pure benign condition and need not to worry much about it. A lipoma is a slow-growing, fatty lump that's most often situated between your skin and the underlying muscle layer. A lipoma is n't cancer and usually is harmless. Treatment generally is not  necessary, but if the lipoma bothers you, is painful or is growing, you may want to have it removed. You most likely have the diagnosis of familial lipomatosis as you said your father had the same. Treatment can include simple excision, endoscopic removal, or liposuction if large. Liposuction, whether laser Liposuction or traditional will leave some of the lipoma cells behind which over time will probably recur though it may take years. So consult surgeon for proper examination and treatment . Applying Apple Cider Vinegar and turmeric powder will help in reducing the size of lipoma .Hope your concern has been resolved.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"my dr sead i had celluliteous  in my legs i took a lot of antibiotics but now i have hard bumps in my legs that hurt to the touch i lost my job and no longer have insurance can u help me and tell me how to get rid of this ..and one more thing my feet still swell and hold fluid on a regular basic... but they end up going down after i elevate them for a while","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.Read and understood your query and concerns.It says you had cellulitis means infection/inflammation of hte legs.The resultant infection must have caused the lumps to appear and stay as there might not have has any proper treatment.

I would advise in such a situation the following:- Get clinical evaluation and examination done to know the cause of all such problems like varicose veins or so. - Color doppler examination of the lower limbs - Routine tests of blood including that for sugar, kidney function. - Ultrasonography of the lower abdomen to find out any possible obstruction agent to the lymphatics or venous return. - Get started on proper treatment with appropriate medicines as per the findings of clinical evaluation and investigations ."},{"Patient":"my doctor is going to do a vulvar biopsy because of what he says are abnormal skin changes I have very dark area around vulva and some lumps but no pain or itch I am 54 and have had complete hysterectomy what are reasons for this color of skin change?","Doctor":"Hi,Dear thanks for the query to HCM virtual clinic.I studied your query in full details.I understood your health concerns.With whatever details are given by you,the dark are around vulva-points to melanoma of the vulva with malignant changes,as indicated from your doctor for which he has planned biopsy.The change in the color of the vulval skin in itself is ominous sign of cancer at this age.Remedy-Would depend on the HPR report-If it comes as benign naevus-simple excision biopsy would get rid of the worry you have.If it turns out to be malignant,then you need to consult Onco-surgeon who would treat it with your gynec doctor.Hope this would help you to get rid of the anxiety with this query.Welcome to HCM in this regard by any further query.Have a good health and early recovery.Dr.Savaskar M.N.Senior Surgical Consultant."},{"Patient":"Hello, I am thirty five and was diagnosed with copd a year and a half ago.

I m tiered of feeling fobbed off. I have so many problems at 22 it can t be nothing.. So I will try and make this as short as possible.. I m 22 5ft2 and 9.1/2 stone and have 2 children under 3 years old.. For a few months now I have been experiencing a lot of pain in my knee and hip joints. Mainly on the right side. Its effecting sleep and my mobility. I did go to the accident and emergency and without taking any tests (bloods x-rays etc) the doctor (who was also a student) told me it was sciatica and has me on zapain/codine/paracetamol. The pain hasn t got any better. Whilst the doctor was tending to me she asked to see my knee but couldn t because of. The fact I had skinny jeans on.. She asked if there was any lumps or swelling.. As for the swelling that s not an issue but 2 days ago I noticed a little red spot. Well it was a spot to start with. Its red, sore when I kneel down and tender to touch and is now around about the size of a 5p coin. That s only the start of it for the past say 7-9 weeks I have been experiencing extremely bad stomach pains and follows through to my lower back. I have been going to the toilet more frequent than normal (no pain when I wee or poo) but my number 2 are loose and pale there is blood a majority of the time but I had a termination last january and had the contraceptive implant placed and have been bleeding since with the odd breaks, the blood in the toliet isn t consistent with the amount that s on my pad. For example my pad would have a few spots and when I go to the toilet for a number 2 (which has increased to around 3 times a day, but blood isn t in the toilet after every time I go) the water will be scarlet red, fresh blood and when I wipe there is hardly blood from my period but when I press the paper on my anus the fresh red blood is there. (This does not happen all the time but frequent enough for me to take notice that it isn t coming from my period) I don t strain when I m on the toilet, it just literally falls out. Its gotten to a point now where I m losing sleep. My appetite is fine.. I m still eating the same but probably smaller amounts as I m getting fuller quicker than I used to the pain is more situated around the left lower side of the abdomine but sometimes goes to the right. I know my body and I know something isn t right.. I just can t go to my docs because every time I do I never get any real tests. I also suffer with chest pains I have had ECG, echo scans, blood tests and all have come back fine. I suffer with a low blood pressure and anemia too. I am registered with a walk in centre and when I do eventaully get an appointment I m in and out in 5 mins and feel they never pay attention.. I have beens asking for months for them to sort out physiotherapy for the sciatia I have been diagnosed with and I m still waiting, if that s even what it is. I know something isn t right.. Can you help me? Is it something I need to get checked? Is there any specific tests I can ask to be done to put my mind at rest about the larger medical problems?

The lump is soft, she has no pain from it and has had no symptoms. Her dentist has recommended a biopsy which of course is now concerning us. As it has been there so long i do not think it can be anything serious. What are your comments please? From Miss K.","Doctor":"Hi Dear, There definitely seems to be a lot going on in your mouth. ulceration on the tongue as in your case need proper medical evaluation..Once you have noticed a lump in the tongue , one thing is for sure that it is not a normal part of the body.The probable causes can be:Foreign body granulomaBenign lump of the muscles Cancer Infection in the cut This can be ascertained only by a clinical examination, FNAC or Excision biopsy.I would advise the excisional biopsy for 2 reasons1. You get rid of the lump and 2. you get a histo-pathological diagnosis to be certain what the disease is and carry on further treatment if needed. MRI sometimes may help in diagnosis. So i would suggest you to consult oral pathologist for proper diagnosis and treatmentHope your concern has been resolved.Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

I had 4+ CABGs and a mitral valve replacement (mechanical St Judes) in 2001 at age 47. It was found during surgery that i had already had a HA. I take many meds daily, plus coumadin. I had a small stroke 2 yrs ago that took my hearing. I have recently started having some dizzy spells. One made me fall a couple weeks ago, as I was struggling in the woods in an entanglement. I seem to have the dizziness, upon overexertion, or simply sitting. Is this something I need to have cardio check out for me, as my next appmnt is not until November? Thank you so much. Lu","Doctor":"hello i have gone through your complaints and noted your history.  Mitral valve problems cause the left upper chamber heart to enlarge and produce some rhythm disturbances. most common is atrial fibrillation which means irregular fast impulses from upper chamber of the heart. this irregular heart rate may cause dizziness due to irregular supply of blood to the brain. this also can lead to formation of clot in the upper chamber of heart which may dislodge into the brain and cause a stroke. but since you are on coumadin thats less likely. another cause would be low blood pressure - hypotension. i dont know your ejection fraction from your 2 d echo but i suppose it would be less-  in view of your history of 4 CABGs,  and MVR. this may lead to low blood pressure and giddiness.. I would also like to confirm if the valve is functioning well because its 10 years since then. A stenosed or narrow valve can also lead to dizziness spells. i want you to do an EKG, 2D echo and holter monitoring if rhythm disturbances on EKG. Further course of action can be decided after that. if above tests are inconclusive CT BRAIN should be done. wishing you good healththank you"},{"Patient":"Hi im a 25 year old female.I get a bump in the middle of my bottom lip from time to time.

I have been diagnosed with hypertension. The reading I was diagnosed with was around 160/80 when I was 21 years old. I was run through a series of tests which found nothing abnormal with me aside from elevated triglycerides which I was able to control after I took up exercise and reduced my weight by 16 lbs. I was put on Inderal 40mg b.i.d. This medication brought my bp down to 130/80 with a pulse of 72. However I suffered many side effects. Being a student I found it difficult to concentrate or sleep well, I also had nightmares,insomnia and memory loss. So I was switched to Atenolol 50mg which also caused me insomnia and memory loss but was not as bad as Inderal. Over a period of a few months of weight loss and exercise I came to 25mg of Atenolol at which time my Bp was 132/76. But due to the side effects I was switched to Diltiazem CD 120mg. This medication caused no side effects at first but over a period of a few weeks I developed negative moods, a severe headache similar to a migraine 24 by 7, rashes on my forehead, weakness and lethargy, flushing and feeling warm and a warm sensation in the chest area. So I switched back to 12.5mg atenolol. I have tried four drugs till now (propranolol, atenolol, amlodipine and diltiazem), all of which caused adverse effects in me. My doctor insists that these drugs are correct for me and I should make a choice between diltiazem or atenolol. So I stuck with Atenolol 12.5mg which still causes me embarrassing memory lapses and has reduced my academic performance greatly. My question is that since my diastolic bp has always remained normal and only my systolic Bp is elevated, does this mean I have the arteries of an old person? Is it absolutely necessary for a person my age to take medications and if so are there no alternatives with lesser side effects?","Doctor":"since you are young, your BP can be well under control with diet weight loss and exercises. but since your doctor has stqrted you on bp medications there must be some indications. you can try telmisartan 20 to 40 mg depending on your blodd pressure. but still i would encourage you to concentrate on diet, lifestyle and weight loss.. also have u donr a renal artery doppler or CT abdomen for adrenal tumour.. or get urine tested for VMA."},{"Patient":"I currently have a lump in my right earlobe, near where the lobe meets the neck.

Some palpitations are just benign but some may be associated with fatal arrhythmias especially that you felt like you are about to have a heart attack. With these possible causes, I would greatly recommend a check-up with a doctor for appropriate examination to check for the rhythm of your heartbeat, as well as for work-up to rule out any other causes of your palpitations.

Resting HR of about 62 bpm, BP of 118/72.  Never smoke/drink/do drugs.  I have been a swimmer, scuba diver, and volleyball player for years.  My mother is 60 and hypertensive; my father is 58 and had a triple angioplasty at 47. Both of my parents live very stressful, sedentary lifestyles, are overweight, and have a history of poor health choices (poor diets, exercise, smoking, etc).  None of my grandparents had a history of heart problems (living into their mid-80's or later...I'm suggesting environment not genetics). Over the past 10 years I have had an extremely high level of anxiety (spouse blindness, lawsuits, self-employment, foreclosure, bankruptcy, etc).  About 4 years ago I began having panic attacks off and on for a span of several months.  For the past 2 years I have had palpitations in my chest that I am consciously aware of (to me, they seemed to occur around 5 times a day).  They seem worse when I feel any anxiety-especially when I consciously think about the palpitations...it is as if they scare me into having more of them.  When I was routinely exercising on the ellipticals at the YMCA, as recently as a year ago, it seemed that I had a lower number of these palpitations that I was consciously aware of.  Two FP (family practice) doctors dismissed them as a benign, transient irregular heartbeat, presumed congenital or caffeine induced.  A third doctor sent had me wear a 24-hour Holter monitor. The Holter monitor showed a 5-beat V-Tach (5 beats at a .10 sec interval).  The timing seemed to correspond with the time I awoke to a brand-new alarm clock that my wife had purchased.  The new alarm literally woke me with a jump. (I can't guarantee that the times were identical, but they were notably close). The Holter monitor also showed a number of transient PVC's.  I should note that for the time I wore the monitor, I basically sat around the house or slept, as I didn't want to cause any problems with the test (and felt reasonably limited wearing the monitor and leads).  I didn't feel any real undue anxiety, but was consciously aware of 4 PVC's during the test.  (I am waiting for the report to show how many I actually had). The doctor called me on a Sunday morning with the news of the V-Tach and told me to get to the ER at the U/T Medical Center asap as this was potentially life threatening.  (I had worn the Holter from 3 pm Friday to noon or so on Saturday). At the ER, they took a blood sample (Troponin 0.00%), 2 chest xrays (negative), normal potassium, normal magnesium, normal T3 & T4...basically ruled out metabolic causes, infection, or other disease state.  I was on a 12-lead EKG for about 7 1/2 hours.  Although I felt somewhere around 300 (or more) PVC's, the EKG did not register a V-Tach event.  4 doctors told me I would probably need an ICD and that the V-Tachs could kill me.  The cardiologist finally came in and told me that he thought this was probably benign and wanted to run more tests as an outpatient, and promptly discharged me from the hospital. 2 days later, I took an echo and a treadmill stress test.  During the echo, the technician saw what she believed to be a very slight mitral valve prolapse (MVP)...the test also showed some regurgitation.  She thought both were so minor that she wasn't sure if the cardiologist would even call it MVP w/regurg.  There was no sign of myopathy-all measurements looked to be in range.  I also took the stress test.  It took 9 1/2 minutes of exercise (increasing incline and pace at 3 minute intervals) to get my BP and HR where they wanted them to be.  I stayed on the machine until 10.25 minutes had passed and the tech was satisfied.  (I felt entirely capable of going another 10 minutes, but I had already reached their target rates and I was starting to sweat a bit and breathe heavier...not Heavy, just heavier than normal breathing).  The test registered 4 couplets and a 3 beat V-Tach near the end of the test.  I should note here that my anxiety was also high during the test, as I knew fully why I was being tested and felt grave concern when I was the youngest person in the waiting room by probably 20-25 years. I was placed on 25 mg of Metoprolol XR and 81 mg of children's aspirin per day.  (I should note that my cholesterol 2 1/2 yrs ago was 157, LDL was 56 and HDL was 39.  I have also used one 14-day course of OTC Prevacid for Reflux in each of the past 2 years, and drink less than 4 cups of coffee/Pepsi per week...typically I drink skim milk or water...I've had no caffeinated drinks in a week now). The 1st day in the ER, I felt in excess of 300 PVC's.  The EKG alarm kept going off for the PVCs, and every time it went off, my anxiety shot up and I would have several more (I'm having a few now as I write about this!)...they were worst when I first received the phone call telling me to go right to the ER, and again when I was first told that I would probably need an ICD...The next 2 days the number of PVCs was under 100, and then for 3 days it was below 50.  Today (day 6), I would put that number at closer to 20.  I don't know if the medication is doing anything, since I am still well above the number I normally am aware of in a day, but my anxiety about this situation is pretty high. The cardiologist called and wants to do an angiogram and place stents immediately if he finds any blockages.  He also wants to take all of those results and send them on to an electrophysiologist to see if I am a candidate for an ICD, RF ablation, or medicinal therapy. A friend, who is an FP, thought it would be best to raise my dose of Metoprolol a bit (to 50 mg), add a low dose of Prozac to keep my anxiety down, and keep me on the aspirin as well.  He also thinks they should do a \\"calcium scoring\\" test and an HsCRP (High sensitivity CRP), along with a Lipomed to evaluate the liklihood of my having a blockage without doing an angiogram at this point.  His point was that he thought it better that if the other tests were negative, they should treat me with the meds for a good 4-6 months and then re-test/re-evaluate at that time before running off and doing an angiogram now.  He does think that this entire situation is probably much ado about nothing, and could potentially self-resolve with proper medicinal treatment and good diet and exercise habits. The FP I am currently seeing (I just relocated to another state, 650 miles from home), as well as the cardiologist, both want me to get the angiogram and stenting as necessary. I am very conflicted and frankly, scared.  I certainly want to do what is best.  There are possible complications with an angiogram.  The 10-year mortality for patients receiving a stent seems to run about 33%....a very big number in my opinion. So I want to know: 1) Do the V-Tachs I've described seem terrible? (One of my professors is an FP and he cited a study done in Philadelphia where they strapped Holter monitors on med students for 48 hrs and found that over 80% of them had a minimum of a 4 beat V-tach in that time frame.  Another FP professor suggested that if you put Holter monitors on our entire class of med students before an exam, that at least 1/3 would register V-Tachs. 2) Can anxiety induce PVC's and V-Tachs? 3) Does a medicinal approach with follow up testing seem prudent at this point? 4) Is an angiogram necessary or wise at this point?... 5) If they do an angiogram, can I/should I insist that they do not place any stents? 6) Can you comment on life expectency for stent recipients? 7) Do the calcium scoring and HsCRP tests have diagnostic merit over an angiogram given my other history, signs, and symptoms? 8) If those alternate tests look good, is it fair to skip the angiogram and move on to an electrophysiologist for EP testing and possible RF ablation? 9) Can you comment on the efficacy of RF ablation relative to V-Tachs and PVCs? 10) Can you comment on life expectancy if an ICD is necessary? 11) If an ICD isn't necessary at this time, are there diagnostic criteria I need to be aware of and watching to know when I am at a level of substantially elevated risk? 12) Is there any reasonable chance that the combination of medicinal treatment and (possibly) RF ablation may either eliminate the V-Tachs and PVCs or at least be a successful means of postponing an ICD for another 5-10 years? 13) I saw a presentation by a researcher from UW-Madison that indicated they were having some success regrowing cardiac tissue in MI patients from stem cells that were being taken from the patient themselves.  Is this a potential future cure for V-Tachs (say, within the next 10-20 years)? 14) Is there a chance that years of anxiety has allowed for some level of heart remodeling that makes me more suscptible to an epinephrine surge, and if so is there any chance to undo that change? 15) I am on state-sponsored health care insurance.  Do you have any idea what \\"level\\" or type of ICD they would allow?  I understande there are a number of different types.  To that end, is there a brand/model you would recommend and why? 16) If I were your patient, how would you advise me to proceed? Thank-you in advance for your time and consideration.  I greatly appreciate your insight as an objective expert.","Doctor":"helloi have gone through your query and history. you seem to be well versed with medical terminologies as well as diseases and hence it would be easy for you to understand. going by what you have described you have a concerning number of ectopics and vtach along with couplets. but you did not have any grave symptoms like fainting or cardiac arrests either in your day to day life or while you were on the  treadmill machine which you excercised for 10 mins (good effort tolerance). so i would want you to continue with the beta blocker drug you are on.. regarding increasing the dosage or not depends on your heart rate and number of ectopics you have after being on metoprolol.. but i guess 25 mg will suffice. there is no indication of Icd Implantation at present. regarding the angiogram i feel that you should undergo your angiogram and place stents in the same settings if necessary. Hs CRP and calcium scoring will not help you much.. if both come out to be positive you would still need an angiogram as an final answer which will add to your anxiety.. if both come as negative, you will still think why u have these palpitations and do i have any coronary artery blocks and again add to your anxiety! so going forward with an angiogram and getting an answer to whether you have  coronary artery disease is what i would go ahead with. also as i said your frequent arrhythmias can be of concern, you must undergo an EP study which can be done in the same sitting with an angiogram. a combined approach with coronary angiohram and EP study can decrease a majority of your concerns. it will give you answers whether you really need stents or ICD, or medical management. my gut feeling is you will do good with medicines.. but still we need to be sure.. please go ahead with an angiogram plus EP study. regarding your query with life expectancy with stents .. peiple with stents have a good life expectancy. stents remain patent for 10-15 years . life expectancy is euwally good with ICDs. you also need a small dose on anti anxiety medications to relieve ur anxiety..

Just to quickly explain, i used to be pretty overweight when i was about 15-16, i am 20 at the moment,  i lost all the weight at about 17 and have been very healthy since. during the time i was obese i gained alot of scarring and stretch marks over my body, i have ever since assumed that the stretch mark like marks on my shoulders, close to my armits.. are in fact stretch marks. However I have just now for the first time read about Hidradenitis Supprativa since i have a small black pimple like (slightly hard) bump in the middle of my pubic area. After reading more, i realised that the scarring on my inner thighs is likely also a cause of Hidradenitis Supprativa and not just a rash which caused this as i thought previously. After reading more about Hidradenitis Supprativa I have become extremely concerned as i read that these things i thought were just stretch marks will eventually burst with puss and become extremely painfull, if i am reading correct information. Currently i have luckily no pain at all, only slight itching on this bump in my pubic area which is why i stumbled on this in the first palce, however im reading about people in alot of pain. Pls tell me what you can, do i have Hidradenitis Supprativa? will i get more symptoms and will they becoem painfull? as i mentioned i have had alll these things for a few years alreadz but always thought it was because i used to be overweight, it never really botehred or hurt me at all, besides the obvious (visually). never any discomfort since. The visual bothers me less, i care about being healthy and these things becoming painful, i do not understand why this would be fine for atleast 3 years and all of a sudden become very painful and my stretch mark like things would burst?? please let me know what you can, thank you very much!","Doctor":"Hello,Treatment of black pubic lumps-You mostly have keratitis with acne in a pubic area with blackheads due to excess keratin blocking the follicles, and not hidradenitis suppurativa and you have stretch marks due to old overweight condition you had.
