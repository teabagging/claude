So you should get evaluated for the same. As you mentioned TMT effort tolerance is good. But what is more important in a treadmill test is whether it is positive or negative. A positive treadmill test increases the possibility of heart blockages. An negative stress test implies no detectable blockages in the heart. Please also do a 2d echo to see the contractile function of the heart, the valves and the flow between the valves. Please specify the treadmill result, and do a 2d echo. If treadmill is negative and 2d echo is normal then you need not worry about it. If either treadmill is positive or 2d echo shows regional wall motion abnormality, you should visit your cardiologist and get an angiography done.Wishing you good health.

Some patients get anxious when they visit the doctor and their readings get high because of the anxiety . This is called white coat hypertension. But we must ascertain whether you have high BP when you are doing your normal activities also. For this I recommend an ambulatory BP monitoeing. In this test, a machine is attahlched around your waist with a cuff around your arm which records BP at specific intervals throughout the day while you go around your normal activities. This way you will be able to know whether you have high BP when you ate doing your daily activities. Please do an ambulatory BP monitoring and revert back with the results. wishing you good health .

I am pretty sure while on admission, they have run some essential tests including liver function (which often is considered as routine test) but in case it has not been done, I am sure your partner's doctors are better placed to know why it has been excluded.

If you're overweight or obese, reduce the number of calories you eat each day and increase your physical activity in order to lose weight. Aim to lose 1 or 2 pounds a week.Choose a healthy diet. Eat a healthy diet that's rich in fruits and vegetables. Reduce the amount of saturated fat in your diet and instead select healthy unsaturated fats, such as those found in fish, olive oil and nuts. Include whole grains in your diet, such as whole-wheat breads and brown rice.Exercise and be more active. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week. Incorporate more activity in your day. For instance, take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walk instead of taking short trips in your car.Lower your cholesterol.

Found in ultrasound stones direct the treatment for its removal. However even if the gallstones are present, do not have to give pain. The source of pain can be stomach.

It gives exactly same pain as gallstones (upper right pain radiating to the back). I suggest you to visit your doctor again. Abdominal ultrasound, blood work and liver tests (AST,ALT,GGTP,AP) should be done at first. If GGTP will be elevated or stones in the bile ducts, ERCP procedure will help with your pains.If no stones, gastroscopy should be next.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"Enter Your question here...can gallbladder sludge and gallstones cause ur body to retain toxins.

Doctors will recommend treatment if there are signs that the virus is beginning to cause damage or if the viral load is high.The medications in current use for chronic hepatitis B include the interferons and nucleoside/nucleotide analogues.Medications can reduce the number of viruses in the body and may be able to eliminate the virus from the bloodstream. If you do not have advanced liver disease you do not need to follow a special diet for hepatitis B. Patients with very advanced liver disease may require a special low-protein diet to minimize damage to the brain, called hepatic encephalopathy. This type of diet is usually used along with other treatments under the care of a specialist. Most people with hepatitis B should just ensure they eat normal, healthy foods.You should completely avoid consuming any alcohol or drugs that are potentially poisonous to the liver, such as Tylenol and many prescription drugs.Keep in touch with your doctor."},{"Patient":"My mother had a cypher stent placed in her artery. She did not have a heart attack but her artery had collapsed and they caught it before anything more serious happened. She is very concerned that her life is shortened and is worrying that her life will be drastically decreased as multiple people she has known died within seven years of a stent procedure. She is getting very stressed about this because she cannot get an answer about her mortality rate, I want her to stop stressing as obviously its not good for her, so please advise if her mortality rate is effected in anyway due to the circumstnce.","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HCM Angioplasty or stent implantation is a very reliable treatment for heart blockages. Now a days with the drug eluting stent the chances of stent narrowing again or not being accepted by the body has decreased significantly. The cypher stent is a drug eluting stent. Drug eluting stents usually remain patent for 10-12 years. With regular check ups with ECG, 2 d echo and stress test any possible complications can be diagnosed and avoided. Also a lot depends on the pumping function of the heart. If the person has sustained a heart attack earlier and the heart pumping function (LVEF) had decreased, then the life expectancy goes downm But this is due to the damage caused by the attack and not because of the stent placement. People with decreased pumping function and with stents also do well if proper precautions are taken and medications are taken regularly. In my practice I have seen people with stents doing well even after 40 years requiring no additional procedures except routine tests and check angiographies every 10 years. So please stop worrying about the life expectancy. It is quite good. One of the indications of putting in a stent is to improve the quality of life and expectancy. She should be compliant on her medications and regular brisk walking or cycling with diet restrictions.A health check up should be done every one year with ECG, 2d echo and a stress test.Wishing her good healthRegards."},{"Patient":"I have untreated Hashimotos disease.

I know that is possible and he said I would have to be off the offender for several months to determine what is the cause. He does not want me to take any new medications or supplements.

It is therefore possible that you may autoimmune hepatitis. This may account for persistently raised liver enzymes.Thyroid hormone replacement therapy for hashimoto's does not ordinarily raise liver enzymes.

Recently, I was hospitalized for a GI bleed and it was discovered that my creatinine level was 31 and potassium level was high.  The reduced my fluid medication, I was taking 100 mg of spriolactone they cut it to 50 mg.  They kept my Lasix the same 40 mg a day.  Now my fluid retention is bad legs (calf's and thighs) and stomach are swollen.  I am having a hard time bending down to tie my shoes and breathing is difficult.  I may need to have stomach drained, a procedure I hate but will endure if need be.  Any ideas?","Doctor":"Dear Friend,You had cirrhosis and when you had upper gi bleed , you developed a kidney involvement too. Seems to be a part of Hepato-renal syndrome , i am assuming that your previous kidney functions were normal.You have a ascitis ,it requires diagnostic evaluation to see for any infection in fluid.You should be cautious about using spironolactone as it can cause hyperkalemia.Your increased edema can be because of your deteriorating renal functions, i hope you have a good urine output.You need to build up protein in your blood (provided you don't have albuminuria) , if you should never be constipated.You need to get re-evaluation of your kidney functions , and diuretic dose adjustment is required.Stay Healthy"},{"Patient":"Hello. I had my gallbladder removed a couple years ago. Everything had been fine until the past few months. I've had a few episodes of what feels like a gallbladder attack.

Very intense pain. I had an ultrasound and apparently the tubes are fine. Any advice on what to do? I'm in pain & worried.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for the query to H.C.M. Forum.In my opinion may be due to .1 Hepatomegaly i.e.enlargement of liver , as you mentioned that pain is in right shoulder blade .As there is a phrenic nerve which supply diaphragm and shoulder joint , so any irritation in the diaphragm also develop pain in shoulder joint.Diagnosis can be confirmed by ultrasound of liver.2 Pleural rub or friction may be the next reason , diagnosis can be confirmed by X ray chest .3 Old surgical  wound may be the reason of this pain , so consult a surgeon ( operating ) and get his opinion .In my opinion consult physician and get his opinion as physical examination is very important .Good luck.Dr. HET"},{"Patient":"I am 72, female, not taking any drugs except occasionally pain medication for my osteoarthritis. I keep feeling dizzy on and off and my BP, when I am now feeling quite unwell, is 143/85, with 88 pulse. Is this okay or should I consult a doctor. In the past, I have had sudden BP rates of over 210/110 etc - thus happened about 4 times last year.","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HCM Your symptoms of dizziness, readings of high BP and four times history of very high BP suggests that you have been suffering from high blood pressure for a long time. With your last 4 episodes of 210/110 known as accelerated hypertension, its unusual that the doctor has not started you on BP medications. Or either you took them for a short while and then stopped. Your BP remains consistently high and your symptoms are due to high BP. Such high BP can cause target organ damage which includes the heart, brain, kidney and the eye among other organs. The sudden BP rise to 210/110 can also cause am artery to rupture in the brain and cuase life threatening stroke. Long standing high BP can also cause heart chamber enlatgement, kidney disease leading to kidney failure and retina detachment of the eye. You must be started on medications for high BP .

Gallbladder sludge is a mixture of bile, mucous,and cholesterol, and calcium based particles.

Thank you for asking.aside from all other issues your concern for gallbladder removal is un necessary. Many patients are advised to get rid of gall bladder. Gall bladder function is to just store bile an ingredient which comes from liver and stored in gall bladder for usage of fat digestion. so maximum trouble after gall bladder removal would be to unable to eat fatty foods in excess. so in stead of taking 3 large meal 5 small meals in a day would be recommended or low fat diet would be all your mother need. Stones once slipped to common bile ducts can be a disaster then, so it is better to go electively for its removal with minimal invasion.Good LuckS Khan"},{"Patient":"i had poleo 62 years before::100% disability in both lower limbs.now for 3 years i have faced sevior  dm ,ht, hepatitis[2] nonalcoholic cirrhosis.earlier i lived normal life. no strain sustainable due to low haemoglobin[9]i have stopped using callipers.health is getting deteriorated i feel daily activities tiresome.your advice to make routine life sustainable is solicited                   YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hello!

Liver enzymes and fat levels may not go to normal levels and that too so quickly. Liver enzymes are usually elevated due to Liver cell injury due to various causes. I would advice you to take all your necessary precautions for Diet, Alcohol, exercises, medications and repeat your tests after 6 months. If your levels remain elevated, or increases, then you must go for other investigations.

I'm afraid to take 2 pills at night as she instructed as I already have liver damage and am afraid my sugar will go to low. Should I take the two pills? Will the blisters go away?","Doctor":"Hi there,Thanks for your query.Firstly, Metformin has brought down your blood sugar to within desirable range, though the morning (empty stomach) blood sugar is still high. There is thus, a need of increasing the dose of metformin; or, addition of another drug.Metformin is detoxified and thrown out of the body predominantly by the kidneys. Hence, mild liver damage in not a contraindication of stopping metformin.Lastly, it is probably a coincidence that you developed blisters on the hand after you started metformin. These blisters are probably viral and need a course of anti-viral agents.Consult your doctor and apprise him of my opinion. I am certain that he will agree with me, order required tests, and- based on the reports-  will prescribe suitable/modified treatment as advised.In case of any further queries, revert back to me THROUGH DIRECT PREMIUM QUERY (Paid), addressed to me personally.

Like every medicine they can irritate stomach causing stomach ache. Usually it is nothing serious, however if it starts recurring, some diagnostics is necessary.Swollen gallbladder should rather get better after antibiotics.

My results were: AST-26, ALT-21, ALK-108, /ilirubin, total-.05, Bilirubin, Direct-.04, Albumin-4.0, Total Protein-6.7 and GGTP-177. He did not mention these results but I saw the lab marked the GGTP as being high. I do not drink and I was wondering if this is too high. I was also put on Pravastatin 40mg daily due to high cholesterol (241 total and 31 HDL; triglyceride was high at 262 down from 491). Thank you Brian Marsh","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for using Healthcaremagic,You are having high Lipid levels and taking statin(Pravastatin), your cholesterol and triglyceride are still high you should take care of diet and take your treatmentregularly.Your GGPT level is high which is commonly high in damage due to alcohol but this is not only one cause of high level of GGPT.The enzyme is present in liver and pancreas hence it can rise in hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver tumors,myocardial infarction, heavy or chronic alcohol use, pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis and viral infections such as Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus (CMV).There are few drugs which can increase the level of GGPT like dialantin, Phenobarbital. In fact Cholesterol lowering drugs can decrease the level of GGPT.Please discuss with your physician regarding the cause if necessary get your CT scan abdomen and pancreatic enzymes is amylase,s. Lipase.Hope this information Helps.Take care.Good Luck.Dr. Akhilesh Dubey M.D"},{"Patient":"I had my gallbladder removed in 2003. I have been having a lot of pain in that area pretty much ever since.

After laparoscopy this adhesions are usually minor and do not cause any problems. However it is possible that in your case, some adhesions impede bowels movements and cause partial bowels obstruction.The other possible reason is some bacterial infection due to antibiotics usage (if there were any antibiotics used during or after the surgery).I suggest you to have stool test done. Also liver tests (AST,ALT,GGTP,AP), bilirubin level and amylase should be checked.Next step is abdominal CT with oral contrast (enteroclysis). And finally if nothing will be found, you should consider with your surgeon diagnostic laparoscopy.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

Welcome to HCM. Your BP is slightly on the higher side but not a emergency situation. Blood pressure varies over different times of the day. So the above readings when though high, are acceptable. Please follow a salt restricted diet and continue taking your mediations. regarding the chest discomfort you should get yourselves evaluated. I recommend a ECG and a stress test which records your ECG continually while you walk on a treadmill. This will help evaluate the presence of heart disease. Please do the above tests and revert back.

Recently some one told me to take statin to lower down my cholesterol. I took it for ten days and when I went for tests my ALT was again 110 only a little less. I need to drop it down within a week what should I do? As I have to go for tests again next week.","Doctor":"Hi, If your doctor did not prescribe statin, I suggest not to take it anymore without prescription. Harms you will get at this young age will be more than benefits. Next, please be patient. It will take up to 3 months after you apply changes in your lifestyle and diet to see improvement. So, I advise to wait for other 3 months before taking the tests again, then, you will see the difference. Always consult your doctor!All the best!Dr.Alba"},{"Patient":"My daughter was diagnosed with a rare metabolic disorder through a newborn screening called MCAD.

After a heart attack, the muscles of the corresponding area of the heart get damaged. The body activated is compensatory processes to make up for this damage. But it ends up remodelling the heart structure leading to enlargement and dilatation of the heart. Drugs like ramipril and cardiocor inhibit this remodelling of the heart and hence are prescribed in your case and not for high blood pressure. Additionally drugs of cardiocor group slow down the heart rate. This increases the filling of the heart during relaxing phase thereby increasing the amount of blood pumped by the heart in the contracting phase. So these medicines are started for benefit of the heart and not blood pressure. You have to continue taking them for long term duration. At some point your doctor may keep you on only one of these drugs. at least one of them will continue for life long. Wishing you good health.

I have had various tests including endoscopy and series of other tests that did not show source of my illness. I was told I had low iron content. Upon my insistence, I recently had an ultra-sound exam of my gallbladder, which showed presence of very large gallstones. My daily symptoms include: 1.     I wake up every morning in sweats, with high fever all over my neck, arms and chest area. I fill very weak and dizzy getting out of bed. 2.     I can only eat limited food type and amount a.     Breakfast include a cup to half cup plain oatmeal, no butter /oil or sugar b.     Lunch and dinner consist of rice, spinach and plain 3.     30 to 45 minutes after each meal my pains and suffering starts on the clock: burning sensation all over neck, arms and tongue; sweaty chest, heart racing, over all high temperature (fever), and sometimes headache. This pains and discomfort last for ~2 hours after each meal. 4.     The lack of clear diagnosis and treatment has resulted in mental and physical challenges that included depression and anxiety. I need help. 5.     At my last doctor’s visit, I was told the gallstone is not blocking the bail movement from the gallbladder to my intestine. How is that possible? The gallstones grow from a small size pebble to a size larger than the diameter of the bail canal. So it is logical to assume that there must be small ones that could block the canal. 6.     My aunt had exactly similar symptoms and her ultra-sound test showed presence of gallstones. Upon immediate removal of the gallbladder her illness completely stopped. 7.     HELP SOME BODY.","Doctor":"Hello,You seem to have developed cholecystitis also along with cholelithiasis.You must get a course of antibiotics and then go for removal of your gall bladder.Consult a surgeon and get the needful done.Get a CT abdomen also done.Thanks"},{"Patient":"Yes, I have RA and have been on Cimzia and Advil and for the first time in 4 years of taking biologics my liver enzymes are slightly elevated.

I had a sever itching at around 24 weeks and my gyane suggested me to take udilive 300 mg and to do a Liver function test . I went next day for LFT and results are Total bilirubin=0.6 mg/dl, SGOT 58 U/L, SGPT 91 U/L, Alkaline Phospatase 106. I took Udilive 300 mg tablet for a week and conducted LFT again with results total bilirubin: 0.37mg/dl, albumin:2.8, SGOT 63 U/L, SGPT 101 , alkaline phosphatase 132 U/L. My Gynae said to continue Udilive 300 mg thrice in day and conduct LFT after a month. If SGOT/SGPT results didnt improved then she has to put steriod injection and there are chances of preterm birth . Kindly please suggest what to do?","Doctor":"Hi my dear, According to the test results, you are suffering of gallbladder disease or stones; that's why your sgpt and sgot levels are raised and your doctor prescribed udilive. Udilive contains ursodesoxycholic acid used in problems of gall bladder (cholelytiasis, etc.). I suggest to follow your doctor's advise and wait for the up-coming results. Meanwhile, if the itching is not bearable and have other problems, please go immediately and consult your OG.You can ask your OG if you can use calamine lotion to ease itching. Calamine lotion is safe in pregnancy.

The overallsize appeared slightly decreased compared to the previous study currentlymeasuring a maximal transverse dimension of 1.2 cm compared to 1.6 cm onthe previous exam. There is suggestion of a cystic duct remnant which isnot optimally visualized due to motion artifact.

It started with vomit in morning after getting up and pukish feeling lasting up for whole day. I diagnosed for the reasons and went through tests as guided by a physician (SGPT,SGOT count was reported high) last year(2012) but nothing particular came out and my doctor advised that this might be due to anxiety/depression. I was advised to take Trika Plus 0.5 by one of our family doctor for sometime, which i took for 6 months. Last year i referred to one of renowned psychiatrist in town as i was not getting permanent relief, he then advised me to take Clonotril 0.25 (Clonazepam) , Prothiaden and Rexipra 10mg (Escitalopram). I am on above said 3 drugs for last 1.5 years and during this time my pukish feeling was fine but i turned out too lazy ,sleepy, inactive and also sometimes suicidal thoughts crossed my mind. Now from 4 months back,I reduced the dose of medicines slowly, but now when i m further trying to reduce Rexipra i am unable to do that and also my symptoms are returning back i.e. pukish feeling round the clock and vomit sometimes.

Problem started with a stitch like pain in my left side waist. Had some painful gas over the next week and took GasX.

After one hour the GasX worked and I did numerous huge burps which got rid of it. Nice! Gas kept coming back though at random times daily for the next few days until I went to the doctor. I also have a gallstone and am worried that my symptoms maybe related to that rather than the h pylori. How long does triple therapy take to start symptom relief? Should I carry on taking all these meds or have testing to determine the root cause of my symptoms? I m taking 1000mg amoxicillin, 20mg omeprezole and 500g clarithromycin twice daily. I have diarrhea (started today), original pain in left side waist still, and intermittent gas/bloating. I woke up with gas/indegestion this morning.

Antibiotics that you are using have side effects like gas , bloating etc. The antibiotics change your normal microbic flora of intestine. Diarrhea is another side effect of antibiotics ( amoxicilline, claritromicine) therapySo at this situation i would recommend you to start probiotics, take plenty of water, take tasectan and hydramine for diarrhea.The side effects of antibiotics can start even after the first dose.If this is not enough please consult gastroenetrologist and perform other exams like  abdominal ultrasound( related to your gallstone) ,  blood work , and fecal analysis.

You mentioned that he is on a brand with a number 4. So i presume he is on 4 drugs which is standard treatment for initial phase of TB. Besides isoniazid and rifampicin, i think he must also be receiving pyrazinamide and ethambutol. Now anti tubercular drugs are known to cause hepatitis. The elevated SGOT and SGPT levels of your husband are most likely due to drug induced hepatitis. In this situation your husband will be continued on ethambutol and the other 3 drugs will be stopped. Your doctor may add other anti tubercular drugs. His SGPT, SGOT and serum bilirubin should be repeated weekly and gradually these drugs can be restarted after his SGPT and SGOT levels come down.

Throughtout, her speech became slurred and now she does not know what year she is in, that i was born or anything. Her blood sugar levels were registering as HIGH on her machine reader and then 30.  What can be done? She is currently in hospital","Doctor":"hello Welcome to HCM .She is having disorientation due to DKA. DKA causes acidosis which affects major body processes including the functioning of he heart. She must be started on iv fluids, and continuous  insulin infusion for the DKA.  Insulin dose can be adjusted according to the sugar levels which should be monitored hourly. A 2d echo must be done to correlate with the changes in theECG. If the ECG suggest heart muscle damage then she has to be started on blood thinner medications and nitrates (drugs dilating heart vessels). Once her sugar levels are stable, acidosis is corrected and urine has no ketones, she can undergo an angiography. Sometimes DKA can also cause decreased pumping function of the heart. Patients with long standing diabetes do not have chest pain while having a heart attack. . So once she is stable she must undergo an angiography. Angiography will suggest If there are any blockages in the heart. Further treatment can be decided on basis of the results of the angiography.

Diagnosis can be confirmed by Upper G  I endoscopy . Try raising the head of you bed about 4 inches with blocks. It might also help to avoid  eating or drinking for 2 hours before you lie down.To help control stomach acid  one should  not drink alcohol or drinks with caffeine in them or eat chocolate or spicy or greasy foods. Gavison only help to some extent. But in your case symptoms are sever so you may need drugs like proton pump inhibitors.2 Indigestion may be the next reason , diagnosis can be confirmed by clinical history of illness by a physician, particularly after gallbladder removal.3 Tension or anxiety develops such type of symptoms .In my opinion consult a physician and get his opinion.

Your last report shows significant decrease in ALT but rise in bilirubin. This can happen in viral hepatitis. Bilirubin initially increases and it decreases after the ALT levels have decreased. In your case the symptoms have also improved. I would advice you to have your serum bilirubin and ALT rechecked after a week of the last test. If bilirubin is not showing a decreasing trend then you should consult a gastroenterologist for detailed evaluation. If there is significant decrease in bilirubin you need not worry, but just to be sure repeat the test weekly till the values are normal.         Though tobacco will not have effect on your current illness, it is best you give it up altogether.         Hope that helps.

It generates impulses and conducts it to the heart muscle so that the heart contracts effectively and rhythmically. However it doesn't take care of blockages in the heart of any. Chest pain and discomfort are symptoms of angina which may suggest there are blockages in the heart. Most cardiologists prefer to do an angiogram before pacemaker insertion to see for heart blockages. I don't know if it was done in your case. If an angiogram has been done and there were no blocks then you need not wish about this chest pain. You can take a course of antacids twice daily for 2 weeks.  If there were blockages at that time or the angiogram has not been done earlier, then you must proceed with a angiogram and stenting if required. Also since it have mentioned that pacemaker had to be adjusted several times it is a possibility the the pacemaker is pacing the diaphragm.

If your child has history of passing clay coloured stools you should immediately get an ultrasound abdomen done and consult a paediatric surgeon.

If the bilirubin is                   You are giving your child lactulose since the last 2 weeks for constipation. Has your doctor discussed the cause for constipation in your baby?  Lactulose can be given for a few days for constipation but not continuously and that too not three times a day. Please discuss this with your doctor and adjust the dose and duration accordingly. But more importantly what is the cause for his constipation. If your baby is breast fed then such severe constipation needs to be worked up for a cause. On the other hand formula feeding is known to cause constipation - please ensure you are using correct dilution and you can try changing the brand of formula which you are using.

My enzymes were so high, I coudn t eat, always throwing up. I had yellow skin and eyes. They said I had some kind of liver disease. All I could do was take a three months break to recover.

I have been having them for about a year now but recently i have been having  10 to 20 of them a day. It feels like a flip flop type of feeling in my chest when i have them. The doctor said i have an S2 physiological split. and ordered  a halter monitor. Is this bad? what do i expect after the halter monitopr is done?","Doctor":"helloWelcome to HCM.S2 split is as described is physiologic meaning a normal response of the body. It may increase during inspiration. It does not imply anything significant in your case. It is also found in people with high BP.Holter monitoring is procedure where they attach you with a small machine and some wires and send you home. This machine records your ECG as you go about your daily acitivities.. This will show the toe of missed beats you have, their character and if they can cause you problems. Once your readings are out, they will guideyou with the treatment.Most of the missed beats rewrite either no treatment or medical management. If the arrhythmias are found to be threatening then you may require a pacer decvice or a defibrillator. But since you have had no symptoms with the palpitations I suppose they are benign arrhtymias and do not require treatment. Wishing you good health.

And treatment is indicated, especially if you have liver inflammation on biopsy and/or high viral load. However, guidelines state that Hepatitis C should be treated irrespective of liver biopsy as Hep C is usually a chronic infection.Chronic Hepatitis C can cause Chronic liver disease, which has its wide spectrum of presentation. It can also cause Hepatocellular carcinoma.Recent guidelines suggest Ultrasound and Alpha Feto Protein survilleance regularly to detect hepatocellular carcinoma at an early stage.Look i am not saying you have all this. But Yes, you can have. So i would like to know, when was your Hep C infection detected and What treatment you were given for that.

I did have a \\"fatty cyst\\" detected by CT back in 2010, but no concerns were expressed by my doctor.  Last year I went to my doctor for the same symptoms and he told me my back needing adjusting after a urine culture came back negative.  I saw him again and stated I just didn't feel right...always feeling bloated, hard time with my weight, fatigue, etc.  He did some bloodwork and told me everything was \\"perfect\\".  When I saw him two weeks ago, the symptoms had onset approx. two weeks prior.  We did a urine C&S, which again came back negative, but I suggested possibly revisiting my liver with regard to the fatty cyst.  When he called to give me the results he said there wasnt any real change with the cyst and really didn't know what else to tell me except to maybe visit a gastro.  In the interim, I requested copies of my bloodwork from last year and the CT just done.  My ALT was elevated last year and he never mentioned it, even though there was record of a cyst and repeated complaints of flank pain.  Then I looked at the CT results and it actually stated my liver was enlarged and fatty and that the aformentioned cyst was now described as a hemangioma.  I am really upset and feel he dropped the ball.   Also I called his office twice last week requesting he order new labwork for me and I still have not received a return call.  I am really actually scared and stressed out about this.   Also I am having occasional pain in the left side in my back just below my ribcage as well.","Doctor":"Hello Friend, Thank you for posting your query through Healthcare magic.I can understand your concern and your reaction to those doctors who ignored your symptoms at the right moment when they could have prevented your disease from worsening to the present stage.First of all please understand that conventional medical specialists cannot prevent a disease from worsening because they want some material findings to interfere with. I am a Homoeopath and so will be sharing with you some different thoughts about your disease. You become sick because of your Miasms. This is a term we Homoeopaths use. This simply means a genetic disposition transferred through generations and you got it from your parents. This dynamic proneness for certain types of diseases are inborn. It is your life situations and  dynamically decided reactions that precipitate the disease. Now coming back to your query, you have not mentioned a single word about your MIND, because for the conventional medicine, mind is insignificant or they do not know the importance of MIND in the production of diseases. Man is both mind and body. How can we imagine health without considering one's mind and body together? Similarly how can we say that mind is not important in sickness. You gave a lot of information about investigations but what about your mind?As a Homoeopath, I can presume that you had a psychological conflict, something that you could not \\"digest\\", just before the development of the complaints in your abdomen. You kept it in your mind without resolving in the psychological level. There are centres in the brain corresponding to every emotion and every organ. The mind- brain- organ axis makes the disease; the location and type of disease is decided by one's MIASM.In your case, the liver is affected. The tendency to develop tumours is in your genetics. It started with small cyst, now developed to larger haemangioma. Your gastro enterologist can do nothing except cutting the tumour. Haemangioma is not a safe organ to be meddled with surgical interference. Since they have dropped the ball, I can take it up again, because we never treat your haemangioma, cyst or abdomen. We treat YOU and YOU only.We pay more importance to your genetic disposition to develop tumour, of course. But your life situations, your mental and physical reactions, your particular  psychological conflicts that precipitated the disease, your past history, family history, mental and physical make ups etc are most important while taking your case. A rightly chosen genetic constitutional remedy will cure your haemangioma without any surgery. Please do not imagine that cure is its total disappearance or that you will become healthy only by removing it. Understand that your body has innumerable defence mechanisms and even now you are 'almost' compromised with the tumour. The balance of uncompromising is manifested through your present pains and other discomforts. You have to get your psychological conflicts resolved in the psychological level itself. After taking the Homoeopathic remedy, once you stop getting pains and other discomforts, understand that you have started improving. Wait for days when your body will keep the haemangioma to a stage from where it started coming up. Let is take time. But you can ignore about it under Homoeopathic treatment. No need of any removal. Rather, I would advise you never go for any surgery.Either you can approach a very expert Homoeopathic physician or you can approach me by asking a direct premium question through Healthcare magic. I will then send to you a case taking format in which you will develop YOUR whole history and send it back to me. Then I will suggest your Miasmatic / genetic constitutional remedy which will cure YOU. With Best Wishes,Dr. C. J. Varghese,Homoeopath,drcjvarghese@gmail.com."},{"Patient":"Hello. About 3 to 4 months ago my fiancé was told he has Hepatitis C. His primary Doctor said it was active and sent him to this charity hospital in LA. I am extremely worried and concerned, as the process of even finding out the severity or start of treatment has not even begun. How quickly should treatment begin? They saw him in April and because he drank beer occasionally, they said he would have to wait 6 months. In May, he had an ultrasound done, but since its a charity hospital, he does not have any specific doctor assigned. The Radiology Dept said they were not allowed to give out results but seemed surprised that we were not yet contacted to start treatment. I can not get any answers, no one calls back to find out results or severity. I have only been told the following additional information: that treatment would not start until he has a psychiatrist due to side effects from treatment. I guess my question is how fast should treatment begin with Hep C? I feel this is going to slow and that the disease could be progressing inside his body . . . am I overreacting or on target? Also symptoms: is balance, bleeding easier, bruising easier, and unknown red bumps symptoms with this disease and its worsening; also memory issues. I am really trying to get a hold on what is happening with him and how fast and how hard I need to push to get this treatment going. Thank you in advance for your help and listening. All info and help so appreciated. AAAAA","Doctor":"hi, thanks for posing your worryi think he should do everything as fast as possible to start treatment since it is active.complications of hepatitis include liver failure, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, but early management prevents this. he should get some hepatoprotectors, avoid alcohol and drugs like paracetamol.he should also try  to consult a hepato-gastro-enterologist for further help.take care"},{"Patient":"My mother in law is 90 and has Cirrhosis of the Liver although she never drank much, most likely from pain meds for so many years, in any event, she has slurred speech today and does not feel well - she has a lot of swelling in her legs and in her feet, she is on Lasix which helps some, she also has Ascites, she is weak and losing weight, she has swallowing difficulties and is very thirsty all the time, but she keeps telling us she feels good, what do you think her prognosis is, how long do you think she has left and what should we expect in the weeks, months to come?

All other measures are palliative and only a liver transplant can restore her health and guarantee her a good quality of life. With her age and other diseases, this may prove very very difficult.How long she can live is a difficult answer.

What would have caused the numbness and how do I get relief from it?","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for the query,The sensation of pain is determined by the integrity of nerve transmission in the particular region. In case symptoms of numbness still persist, it is possible that some nerves might have been destroyed or traumatized during the procedure. It is  not rare however to experience this. I understand its difficult to manage this sensation after three months. It is not rare to obtain recovery even after a year.

He went to the doctor and they said it was just a chest pull. When he tried to shovel the following day, my mother told him not too because he could hurt his chest muscle and have heart damage. Is that true or is she just being a worry wart.","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HCM. Shoveling or any physical exercises can cause chest muscle pull but not damage to the heart muscles. The heart muscles are smooth muscle fibres which do not directly take part in any voluntary body activity. Moreover the heart is located safely inside the rib cage and damage to herat muscle while shoveling is not possible. Howvwr since shoveling is a physical exercise (like running or swimming), it increases the workload on the heart. the heart requires more blood supply during physical exertion and people with blockages in the heart can sustain chest pain due to lack of blood supply to the heart. So indirectly it can lead to chest pain if he has blockages in the heart. Do if he gets pain every time he shovels or runs or jogs, then he must get evaluated from the cardiac point of view. Also since he has just sustained a chest wall muscle pull, its adviced to rest and what your mother is asking is just out of concern. Wishing all of you good health. Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi.

It does not matter what amount of alcohol one takes, what matters it the individuals bodily capacity to tolerate it.

I started feeling light headed and queasy. I checked my BP and it is 116/59.  I am on Bystolic 5mg. and Benicar 40mg. daily.  This is not the first time I have experienced this feeling since being on these medications.  Do you think my BP is too low?  Maybe too low for me?","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HCM. Your BP of 116/59 is optimal and should not cause you these symptoms. Medications in the group of Bystolic also have an additional beneficial effect of lowering the heart rate. But in some percentage of population, the heart rate becomes too low with these medications. Hence I advice you to check tour heart rate and do a ECG. If the heart rate boh manually and on ECG are lower than 55 bystolic should be stopped and substituted for another medication. If heart rate is greater than 55 per minute then you must record you BP regularly to see if it drops too low. If BP remains low then bystolic can be speed. Wishing you good health.

They are separated in two groups:1. Fatty liver(FLD) caused by alcohol.2. Fatty liver(NAFLD) caused by metabolic syndrome.I think that you suffer from the second group of the disease that is fatty liver (NAFLD).The treatment of this disease is complex.First of all you need to make the following tests:1. Glycemic test for diabetes mellitus.2. Lipid test for blood fat(cholesterol, Low density lipoprotein(LDL), High density lipoprotein(HDL), tryglicerid)3. Check your blood pressure(BP).4. Function liver and transaminasa level.5. Ultrasound of liver.6. Magnetic resonance images (MRIs).If the result of glycemic test is positive you need to be treated for diabetes mellitus.If the result of lipid test is positive you should be treated for High cholesterol. As for the diet you need to eliminate: carbohydrates(white bread, pizza, fast food, pasta,etc), animal fat, egg yolk.Use a lot of vegetables, fruits.If you respect all those precautions you will reduce your weight gradually and this is very healthy for you.Best Wishes."},{"Patient":"I have elevAted ast and alt in the 170 range and are slowly going down the last four days .

I am slightly concerned","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HCM. Your heart rate is on the slightly higher range but requires no attention or treatment at the moment. I would have been able to help you better had you mentioned your age here.  Heart rate of less than 110 is acceptable. It is a because of a sedentary life style, that the heart is not accustomed to activity and tries to beat faster on minimal activity. Also since you have checked you pulse rate so frequently means you were anxious. Pluse rate can vary over the day from 60 to 110. At present no treatment is required.  However daily exercises especially cardio can help you bring this heart rate down.

Two weeks ago, I found somewhat light blood in the water and in my stool but thought maybe it was due to my period. But then the next time I had a bowel, which was a week later, the was blood there again. There was more this time and it concerned me. Since last week, I ve been feeling very dizzy and have really bad balance. I ve also lost a lot of color and am very, very pale when I m usually pretty blushed. I have an appetite , but when I take one bite, I feel it go down and I m immediately greeted with nausea. And even when I haven t eaten, I feel like throwing up. But I can t. Nothing comes and it s usually just a burp that feels like something will come up. My upper abdomen is really tender when touched and it feels like a tight pressure, if that makes sense. Somewhat more in the right side. My stomach also burns sometimes as well. Two days ago I felt like I had to go diarrhea and it burned as it came out and was just mush. When I wiped there were tiny black things on the toilet paper (not sure how to describe them, it freaked me out). I ve also unintentionally lost 12 or so pounds in the last two weeks, and now I m down to 98 lbs. There s a bad taste in my mouth, and I assume it s causing bad breath, and no matter how many times I brush my teeth it just comes back. I have a slight cough and it hurts my entire abdomen when I do cough. It feels tight, like someone is punching me in the upper abdomen. Occasionally I ll get a sharp pain in random places. I ve been to the ER twice in the last week for an IV, my blood work always comes back normal, and they just send me home. I feel like my nausea has gotten worse and worse, and I just don t know what to do anymore. It s like we go to the doctor and get the same tests done and get the same results. When I went to my primary doctor last week, I had a rectal exam done and they had found blood in my upper GI tract. But when I had a rectal in the ER last night, they found nothing. We ve been referred to have an appointment with a gastro specialist, and they have recommended an endoscopy, but I would just like to have another opinion now since every time I ve attempted to go to school for the last two weeks, I want to pass out or want to take a trip to the bathroom.

From my clinical experince I can tell that just by reducing wieght you can get rid of your -fatty liver, distended gall bladder, and possibly bulky uterus will also have improvement.  it would be wise to check your blood counts, thyroid, lipid levels, liver and kidney function, sugar and blood pressure. if there is an abnormality here, it needs to be treated.So, a visit to a physician or gynaecologist is a must. For weight reduction one can meet a dietician or simply start with:-- walking half hour twice a day, or join a gym to get a momentum!- eating right food, ie., avoiding all junk foods, oily foods completely for some time at least -reduce your sugar & starch / soda intake- take warm water with lemon in it four to five glasses per day- taking more of vegetables - go for corn flakes, sprouts, salads in breakfast.it must be looking like sooo... much to do, but take my words, you will get better with them and it is free of cost!Hope the reply helps youFeel free to ask more queriesDr. Manisha Gopal"},{"Patient":"I have hepaptitis c.

An ultrasound scan of the abdomen may be done to look for fatty liver.Lipitor which is used to treat high cholesterol can also damage liver and cause elevated ALT.High GGT alone may indicate alcohol intake. Along with other raised liver enzymes, it may indicate obstruction to bile flow which is not a feature of high cholesterol.I hope that answers your question.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, Doctor I just got my health check report back and it appears that I have a high level of GPT , which is 75 and from the lab report it says 0-50 is the normal range.

I dont think so. I think that liver damage is caused only by alcohol. this is the first reason to think of. thera flu is not proved to be harmful for liver in recommended dosage. hematuria is probably caused by something else. Most commonly kidney stone or uroinfection. I suggest to reduce alcohol intake and then check your liver enzymes to see is there improvement. Hematuria requires more detailed urologic work up.

It may only be a superficial infection and not necessarily gone inside the abdomen. The belly button area can get infected because of the sweat formation.

I eat lots of fruits, veggies and protein.  I have never taken steroids.  And I'm very healthy.  My doctor said that is a bit high.  Is she right?  Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to HCM. Your BP reading of 151/83 is definitely high. Blood pressure varies over the day and also depends on the type of activity, physical as well as mental that you have at the time of the reading. One high reading is not considered dangerous or worrisome. For a diagnosis of HIGH BP to be established, there must be at least three high BP readings one week apart at different times of the day. So as of now , even if the BP is high you need not worry. Please monitor you BP once every week for three weeks and then revert with the recordings. Since you are 31, yourblood vessels are still elastic and can contain variations in BP safely. Also continue with your exercise and diet which also have a beneficial effect on the BP. wishing you good health Regards"},{"Patient":"i was diagnosed with hepatitis on 28th september 2013 with the sgot and sgpt levels around 1500 and total bilirubin around 2.4, i went on a very restricted diet for 20 days, in which i had no salt, no oil and no turmeric in my food. i did a lft again after 1 month and the reports say sgot=93 sgpt=150 and total bilirubin is around 1.3. my query is how many days does it normally take to have no icterus, and can i satart eating a bit of oily food or should i wait for some more time.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for asking question on health care magicThere in no need to stop salt during hepatitis.Oily foods are disliked by the patients with liver disease, otherwise no restriction.You have to eat plenty of carbohydrates and oral glucose drink.

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. It is not uncommon to get low grade fever during the treatment of tuberculosis.

I would suggest you to continue your anti TB drugs once started. At the same time, get a LFT test of the blood.

A BP of 280/80 could have caused a blood vessel in the brain to rupture and may have lead to a stroke. Fortunately nothing like that happened.

She is on 4 medications for BP amlopress at and tazloc H contain two combination of medications each)  means she has got resistant hypertension. High BP usually affects target organs like brain, heart , kidneys and retina of the eye. She has to get these organs checked up. I recommend a 2 d echo and a ECG for cardiac evaluation.

I have recently been diagnosed with a fatty liver/nash and 2 focal nodular hyperplasia tumours in and on my liver. Both of these tumours relate to the left love one of which is on the outside edge and measures 5cm. I suffer with ruq pain and also intermittent chronic pain in my left upper quadrant which occasionally radiates to my left shoulder. My question is could this pain on my left side be a result of the nash and tumours in my left liver lobe ? Many thanks. Shaq.","Doctor":"Welcome to health care magic! I have read your question and found that you have a fatty liver with two focal nodular hyperplasias on left lobe. There is recurrent chronic pain in left upper quadrant, sometimes radiating to left shoulder. From the report you have provided, I can say that your guess is right. The pain in your left shoulder is due to these tumors on the ouer edge of left lobe +/_ fatty liver. I will try to expain it:- There is a nerve called : phrenic nerve, (right and left respectively) supplying the daiphragm and giving one assecory branch to respective shoulder joint. So, whenever the swellings of liver lobe/ or as it is already fatty, irritates the diaphragm (while breathjing etc.), there is pain in left qudrant and simultaneously pain in same sided shoulder. This kind of pain is known as \\"reffered pain\\", as there is no injury to shoulder per say!

Recently, I began bloating in my upper abdomen. I look pregnant. I had ultrasounds done and I have a sludgy gall bladder and 30% fatty liver. I also had tests done for ovarian cancer, but all clear. When I eat, it seems that nothing digests properly. I have this extremely full feeling in my stomach and can't eat. Today I had a green smoothie early, then some homemade vegetable soup, and later (around 2:00), two small clementines. I have not been able to eat anything since. My stomach is really bloated and so full feeling. It is like that more and more as the days are going by. Help!","Doctor":"Welcome to health care magic!I have gone through your question, and there are some important concerns: you have sludge in gall bladder, fatty liver, bloating abdomen due to which you can't eat adequately. You have test done for ovarian cancer which is normal.There is no other blood test like - lipid profile, thyroid, renal function test, which will be helpful in your treatment. From my clinical experience I would say that the bloating, and fullness of stomach are due to sludgy gall bladder.  Food is not digested properly when there is fatty liver, and sludge in gall bladder. there is difficulty in digesting fats and other important nutrient from food, even proteins. So, what ever small you eat makes you feel heavy and full.Had I been your doctor I would go for some some lipid reducing drugs and enzyme preparations to help digestion. I think you must consult a surgeon, as many times the sludgy gall bladder needs to be removed with surgery.  The sludge some times does slip in bile duct and can result in acute abdominal pain. I'm not trying to scare you but just informing you about the possiblities as you are having significant fullness and bloating.I want to tell you that it is not a serious illness. Had I been at your place , I would go for soft, non spicy, non-oily diet. Avoid food from outside unless it is thoroughly cooked. This does help in bloating. Small and frequent meals also help along with medicines. Please stop alcohol (if you take it!) completely as it aggraves the illness.I have seen antacids like Omeprazole 20mg twice a day, half hour before meals, give immediate relief. Syrups like Digene can be taken as and when required, about three four timesa day.  however, most importantly you should go and meet a doctor (preferably a surgeon).Hope the answer helps you. feel free to ask more queries.Dr. Manisha Gopal."},{"Patient":"Good afternoon.

The tissue responds to the hormones from your ovaries and bleeds once in a month like it happens in a menstrual cycle.

They are an indicator.Fatty liver disease can cause an increase in liver enzymes. This can progress to inflammation of the liver and , in some persons, severe liver impairment.To prevent the progression of fatty liver or to reverse any changes, you would need to change your diet, increase activity and may also require medications such as statins (used for high cholesterol).In terms of your diet, you would need to reduce the use of sodas and reduce your carbohydrate intake. A high carbohydrate diet has been linked to fatty liver.Your activity should be at least 150 minutes a week.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"For the last five days, I am experiencing pain in the lower left abdominal quadrant.

I have hypothyroid . I am taking Ursocol 300. At the begining I had no symptom, but before three weeks i had a decentry from that my whole abdominal pain is going on, I have IBS also not so serious. I took medicine for both but not get relieved from pain. Is it for acidity, IBS, Mucus or for liver? or food habit. I took lots of leafy vegetables. Kindly give your opinion how to reduce pain and fatty liver?y weight is 68 kg , height 5 feet 1 inch","Doctor":"Welcome to health acre magic!Fater reading your question there are some major points: elevated SGOT AND SGPT few months back, you are hypothyroid and have IBS, currently you are on urosodol. Three weeks ask you had dysentery for which you took treatment but still you suffer from pain in abdomen. Freom my clinical eerie nice I can say that the pain appears to be due to dysentery you had as prior to it you had no pain. Dysentry might have also aggravated your IBS, thereby increasing the discomfort. I think that taking another course of a good antibiotic which targets both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, an antacid and anti spasmodic would help you a lot. You should get an ultrasound abdomen done, along with blood counts and a complete lidrofile to get more clear picture. Fatty live can also cause some pain in abdomen. What you can start now to help yourself is that- avoid fatty and spicy food altogether, - eat small and frequent meals- prefer semisolid diet over full heavy meals-get adequate hydration by drinking enough water-you pear to be over weight for your height, doing regular walks will also be good to keep your self fit, and also be very good for IBSRemainng hungry only aggravates the situation by increasing the acid production.You have not mentioned that you take alcohol but still I want to say that if you do, please stop it as it will help your liver a lot.  What I find reading your case is that due to hypothyroidism, you may have increased lipids which can also cause fatty liver in your body.It would be good if you go for a fresh thyroid test done.

I have been experiencing aching mussels in my upper shoulders but this has gotten slighter better with passing time over the last week. Could my main factor be alcohol?

I am cutting out alcohol completely from my diet so in a month should i go and get re tested and see if my levels have changed? Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Thanks for writing in health care magic!I have read your question carefully and from my experience I can say that your elevated liver enzymes are mainly due to alcohol use. Although your enzyme level is not alarmingly high but surely quitting alcohol will go a long way to keep you healthy. Another reason of increase in liver enzymes can be amoxicillin, as almost all drugs are metabolised in liver, so, they cause some increase in enzymes. This is not to be taken seriously and they will go down on its own (as you have stopped amoxicillin and alcohol both). The muscle aches can be because of alcohol use, and it is already showing improvement since you stopped using it from past one week. If it comes back, one may need to look for other causes for this.Had I been at your place I would: 1.  go for an ultrasound abdomen to get a clear picture of liver condition 2. get blood test again after few weeks to check my AST/ALT levelsHope the answer helps you.Please feel free to ask more regarding this."},{"Patient":"Sir, My Haemoglobin is 10.58, Bilirubin 1, SGPT 53, SGOT 48..

Am I suffering from the liver damage? What is the stage and can the damage be reversible? And if yes How... Please advice","Doctor":"Welcome to HCM! I have gone through your question, from that the things that are bothering you ar slightly elevated liver enzymes, pain and swelling in ankles. But what I find more important is that ECG and ECHO findings, which suggest cardiac cause, most probably due to alcohol raleted cardiomyopathy. But it appears to be in its initial course. The liver enzymes are not the main concern as liver enzymes are almost fine, they are worrisome if they go more than three four times the normal range, which is not in your case. They should correct themselves as you have stopped alcohol altogether. So, liver appears to be less damaged, may be grade I and reversible. however, an ultrasound abdomen will give a confirming picture of its status.If I had been your doctor I would go for your Blood pressure recordings, an ultrasound abdomen, and complete renal function test to clarify the status of other organs. I would also like to know your serum proteins level, because some swelling can come in its deficiency too. In such cases some pain can occur with swelling as feet are the weight bearing areas of the body.From my experience I can say that you should maintain complete abstinence from liquor in any form as long as possible, preferably for life now, this will help your heart the most. You should cut down oil intake and go with a good protenitious diet, which will be helpful.

Thanks in advance","Doctor":"welcome to health care magic! Gall bladder surgeries are one of the most commonly performed surgeries these days, even on youngsters. it is usually done after ultrasound and blood tests which can tell in advance in most of the cases if there is an active infection going on. however, in my experience I have seen cases in which it is only during surgery case becomes clear enough. The condition which you have mentioned is one of acutely inflamed gall bladder, which is first tried with laparoscopy but because found difficult to access was later tried with open surgery. When the gall bladder is found acutely inflamed during surgery and especially if it is stuck to either liver or any other organ, it is usually not operated on. so, I think that your doctor has done the right thing. Such cases are preferably given time for few weeks to months for acute infection to settle down, under antibiotics and vigilance. They are later operated on after repeat investigations. Please maintain dietary restrictions and take the prescribed medicines, and it will help you. because your gall bladder is already stuck between liver and stomach, it is possibly have shrunk and has less possility of getting ruptured. regular supervision in between will keep you informed about the status of your gall bladder. keep in touch with your doctor. I can understand that it is difficult to undergo repeat surgery or wait for it, but in my experience I have seen such cases and they had successful outcome.

Thyroid dysfunction can lead to central nervous system dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmia and also high blood pressure. From the other hand, high blood pressure can lead to chronic changes of the arterial walls, causing thickening and narrowing of the blood vessels with an increased risk for stroke and heart attack. So, I would strongly encourage you to maintain your blood pressure under control. Some tips to maintain a normal blood pressure naturally would be: - reduce salt and caffeine intake- try to lose some pounds if you are overweight. - perform a lot of physical activity (yoga, walking, etc.).

If you try to meet your regular pace too soon, you may get sick again.It is important to eat well, Nausea and loss of appetite become worse as the day goes on. Try eating a substantial (but not heavy) meal in the morning and lighter meals later in the day.I recommend a high-calorie, protein-rich diet to people who have hepatitis. And such foods can be hard to eat when you feel nauseated. Try to have a balanced diet while eating foods that appeal to you.Avoid being dehydrated.Acetaminophen can make liver disease worse, especially if you continue to drink alcohol.You should avoid alcohol until your doctor feels that your liver is completely healed. This may take as long as 3 to 4 months.Hope this information helps you to get back to normal life.Take Care."},{"Patient":"I have recently started taking flomax for a bladder problem I have; i also take prevacid for stomach acid.  both have been taken regularly for 3-4 months now.  my recent liver function AST, ALT and bilirubin have take a jump from 6 months ago.

Hepatic side effects are very rare for Flomax ,only isolated instances of elevated liver function tests have been associated with the use of Flomax.

Really worried about my liver!","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to Health Care Magic Forum..Do not worry about liver.. You have to modify lifestyle as liver is regenerating one before it get damaged sooner..Fatty liver is a reversible condition where large vacuoles of triglyceride fat accumulate in liver cells via the process of steatosis.As the name suggests,it means the build-up of excess fat in the liver cells.It is mainly caused as a result of obesity .Fatty liver may cause no damage, but sometimes the excess fat leads to inflammation of the liver. An inflamed liver may become scarred and hardened over time. This condition, called cirrhosis, is serious and often leads to liver failure. In addition to losing weight gradually and safely(losing no more than one or two pounds a week), lowering triglycerides through diet or medications,diabetes control and eating healthy diet will help.I feel that you should get screened for Viral Hep B and C and autoimmune heapatitis also as both cause increased SGPT levels.  Continue taking Omnitrition and Niacin as it does not injure liver function.A consultation from a gastroenterologist or a hepatologist will be helpful.Hope I Provided Useful Information.Take Care."},{"Patient":"sir i m sharmistha das from kolkata my brother is rajib chakroborty suffering from hepatitis b near about 4 years ..he is now 18 years old.reffering doctor of SSKM hospital in west-bengal by avijit chowdhury.according to him rajib has HEPATITIS B VIRUS DNA QUANTITATIVE CHRONIC HEPATITIS B.now we want to visit with u for better result.we will go in vellore on 1 feb so we need an appointment from u ..if u fixed my appointment thn i will be vry glad to you..","Doctor":"Hello Sharmistha ,Welcome to Health Care Magic..I can give you link which takes you to online registration in vellore hospital so you can continue treatment for your brother in february. this is useful for furthur care for your brother."},{"Patient":"Hi,My father had gone through a Liver transplant surgery..almost 3 months back..i have been conducting all the required tests regularly like in 10 days...LFT, KFT, TAC etc. But From the last 20 days there is an increase(2-3 times) in his enzymes level...SGOT is now 65...SGPT is 71 and GGPT is 198.

After having chickenpox, the virus lies inactive in nerve tissue near your spinal cord and brain. Years later, the virus may reactivate as shingles.While it isn't a life-threatening condition, shingles can be very painful.Treatment with antiviral drugs is required only if the pain and rash occur near an eye to prevent permanent eye damage.You're 65 or older, which increases your risk of complications.You have a weakened immune system .The rash is widespread and very painful.Fatty liver can be controlled by diet and lifestyle changes.elevated ESR is nonspecific it merely denotes inflammation in the body. hope this will help.take care"},{"Patient":"i passed a stone though my pancrease,i have been in pain management four 15 years .had a morphine pump put in so i could keep working.they also give me oxycontin 20mg three times a day and oxycodone 15mg 6 times a day.the doctors all quit,now i see i nurse and the first thing she did was cut my breakthough meds in half gave me exalgo 8mg twice a day. i ended up in hospital with pain after 15 years.they have two offices and the owner is the only doctor there.before i left i asked her what she is treating me for and she told me she would have to look it up.asked for doctor has no openings.have to see nurse is this a proper proceedure.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.You need to undergo MRCP to evaluate the exact status of the pancreas.

Result was an ejection fraction of 9% at 30 minutes post sincalide, consistent with dysfunctional gallbladder and chronic cholecystitis. I was referred to a surgeon for removal of gallbladder. The surgeon ordered an ultrasound and found distended gallbladder with no stones. He advised against removal of gallbladder and ordered an endoscopic ultrasound which was performed two days ago. The results were normal, but now they want to follow-up with an MRI in 3 months. I am absolutely a non-drinker  , but my diet is not great. Also, I have iron deficiency anemia and my blood glucose level is somewhat elevated. I am on the brink of type 2 diabetes.  My primary care doc feels very strongly that the gallbladder should be removed, and I am very confused. The surgeon doesn't respect the HIDA Scan. He claims the test is unreliable because it can change on a daily basis. Is this true? Two of my three daughters have had their gallbladders removed. The oldest daughter had acute pancreatitis and had several ultrasounds, none of which showed stones, but did suggest sludge. She became very ill during her pregnancy and had to have gallbladder removed at 18 weeks pregnant. The second daughter had a somewhat different situation, and was found to have a non-functioning gallbladder, which was removed. Both daughters were seen by Cleveland Clinic surgeons, as was I.  I truly don't know who to believe, and the surgeon I consulted does not like to be questioned about his decisions. He has an excellent reputation, so I should probably follow his advice, but I don't want pancreatitis again. It was very painful and I was very sick for four days before I went to the ER. Couldn't take a deep breath or swallow without pain in the right upper abdomen and left lower back. Also had fever. Apparently the pancreatitis was in the tail of the pancreas. Help?","Doctor":"HIThank for asking to HCMI think you are more concerned about pancreatitis than cholecystitis, now these are the lesions of pancreas and gallbladder, if the sign and symptoms are server and chances of recurrent of infection is there then you really need surgery, both organ can be treated surgically in one session, discuss it with your surgeon, HIDA is nuclear scan the over all imaging study report entirely depend upon the expert nuclear radiologist or nuclear physicist (Medicine branch) else the reports are highly changeable in comparision with conventional imaging, have nice day."},{"Patient":"Hello, I'm 31 years old, i did 3 times SGPT test, the first time it was 88 , second 99 and 3rd time 126.In my test only the SGPT is high and all the other result are very gd, i drink slchool once or twice per month, but always before 15 days i dont drink alchool, i drink a lot of water, but i was so stresses at work for a while.

Warfarin is a blood thinner which is prescribed if a person has propensity to develop or has developed clots in the legs, in patients with irregular heart rate (AF) and in patients post valve replacement. I would be in a better position to help you had you provided the details.Coronary Angiogram is done to evaluate presence of blockages in the heart. On baisi of the findings of angiogram you may be suggested either medical management, or angioplasty or bypass surgery. Angioplasty can be done if there are short blockages on the arteries. It is a 1-3 HR procedure that can be done in the same sitting and the patient usually gets back on his legs on the next day. Bypass surgery is adviced when there are multiple widespread blockages involving the major arteries of the heart. Bypass surgery requires planning, patient preparation etc. Again it takes about 4 days to patient to be back on his legs and some 20 days to recover totally. But the long term results of bypass are very good. Since he is diabetic he has a tendency to develop heart blockages so be prepared for an angioplasty if suggested.

If doubt exists, you may have to go for a CT scan as well.With a history of gall stones in the past, I would also like to know if there is no fresh formation of stones/calculi in the common bile duct, which may give rise to such pain not getting relieved with medicines. This can also be diagnosed with the help of an abdominal ultrasound. If diagnoses, I would refer you to the emergency room of a hospital if the pain is severe enough to disrupt your daily activity. If the pain is mild, then I would refer you to a general surgeon/gastro enterological surgeon for further management.In the mean time, you can start with a proton pump inhibitor, a prokinetic drug, and a probiotic. In case the pain was due to hyper acidity, these drugs will give you relief. Also, I will advise you to stop consumption of alcohol and stop smoking if you do.

Aspirin and Advil are known to be toxic for liver, which manifests as raised ALT/AST levels.2.   Low platelet counts can either be a manifestation of ankylosing spondylosis or due to prolonged use of aspirin.3.

A diarrhea for past sex months signifies that your intestines are not accepting some kind of food you consume. There are many malabsorption syndromes like lactose intolerance and gluten enteropathy to name a few. May be you are intolerant to some of the components of your food which might be giving rise to such symptoms. This you have to know by hit and trial yourself by eliminating some of the components of your food one after the other and seeing if the symptoms are relieved or come back. Start omitting such food, and you will be ok.Apart from this, there could be some intestinal infestation, commonest of which is amebiasis in this part of the globe. So get your stool tested for ova and cyst and go to your family physician with the reports. If positive, an anti amoebic drug may completely relieve your symptoms.Hope this information helps you out.

The cardiologist says he probably had a 40% blockage and an unstable plaque event brought on a sudden major blockage. Excellent care avoided the big one but he suffered a procedural heart attack when the diagonal collapsed as a stent was put in place in the LAD. 1. Please clarify how the diagonal may have been lost. 2.Could one regain that 10% lost function? 3. What could be ongoing consequences? 4. Is his risk of another event now elevated? Thank you very much.","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HCM. The diagonal is a branch arising from the LAD. They may be single or multiple. It is a common complication during angioplasty of the LAD that the diagonal origin gets pinched off and the vessel shuts down. This causes lack of blood supply to the area supplied by the artery leading to heart muscle damage and a minor heart attack. The intensity depends on the diameter of the diagonal which varies from person to person. In some people its very small and its closing off doesn't cause a problem . It can be moderate or large sized also. Since heart muscle is damaged with the diagonal shutting off some amount of the hearts pumping function is lost. Usually since the diagonal supplies only a small portion of heart muscle, it does not lead to much drop in pumping function and in most of the cases the normal lv pumping function is achieved in about three months. It happens with about 10-15 % of patients undergoing an LAD angioplasty and does not have significant consequences. Also it does not raise the probabilities of further adverse events.

This disease makes you prone to create abdominal cysts which can get really big. Such large cyst can get infected and lead to serious blood infection. It may also be large enough to compress stomach or intestines and cause gastrointestinal symptoms.Bile ducts should be checked if there is no obstruction and in case of it, ERCP should be done.Please visit your doctor and ask about abdominal CT first.

However cramping and stool problems are more characteristic for bowels issues like partial bowels obstruction due to adhesions post appendectomy. Chronic bacterial infection is also possible.I suggest you to visit general surgeon. Consider abdominal CT with oral contrast (enterolcysis) to rule out partial bowels obstruction.

Am I severely at risk if I continue with my blood pressure at this level and occasionally the systoloc reading can br higher but yhe distoloc reading is rarely above 85?","Doctor":"hello Welcome to HCM. Your BP is definitely higher as documented by the 24 HR cuff and this reading of 166/86 and you must be started on medications. High blood pressure over a long time can cause target organ damage which includes heart disease, enlargement of chambers of the heart, brain stroke, kidney damage and damage to retina of the eye among others. Since you have been suffering from High BP for more than one year, it may have started gradually affecting your body . There are many other medications which lower the BP and do not cause a decrease in the pulse rate. You can be safely started on those medications. I recommend tab telmisartan 40 mg once daily in the morning. Please consult your primary doctor about this.

I've had 2 previous heart attacks and a moderate aortic leak.  I understand the ischemic colitis is caused by lack of blood flow to the colon.  What causes the lack of blood flow?  No doctor can answer that yet.","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HCM Ischemic colitis is caused due to obstruction to blood flow of the colon. Cholesterol deposition in the arteries of the body lead to narrowing of the arteries. This is called atherosclerosis. Some subjects have increased tendency to atherosclerosis which depends on genetics and environmental factors. This causes narrowing of the arteries leading to stagnation of blood at these sites and subsequent formation of clots. This causes you the attacks of ischemic colitis. In you case since you have suffered from two heart attacks, I suppose you have got high propensity to atherosclerosis, may be due to genetic factors and strong family history. Treatment is blood thinners like aspirin which I suppose you are already on. Usually two blood thinners are used on recurrent attacks of ischemic colitis and even in case of previous heart attacks. So ideally you must be on two blood thinners. If despite this you have episodes of ischemic colitis you must be on higher blood thinners like warfarin. However higher blood thinners have a potential of causing of causing bleeding elsewhere in the body. I hope I have answered your query satisfactorily.

Is there any reason for concern that my body is resistant to Cipro and that I have had a bladder infection for this long","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.Your doctor intends to inform you that the bacteria causing your bladder infection are resistant to ciprofloxacin. Nowadays due to increased prescribing of antibiotics, the same strain of bacteria which would have been killed by an antibiotic let us say 10 years back, has developed genetic mutation and resistance such that they are able to grow even in the presence of the antibiotic.In other words, the bacteria are becoming more powerful and your antibiotics need to be changed. This is becoming an increasingly common problem in hospitals and you need not worry. The solution to your problem lies in changing over to sensitive antibiotics on your urine culture report. Some of the highly specific antibiotics for urinary infections include nitrofurantoin and newer cephalosoprins. This will be decided by your doctor and you must complete the course for quick recovery.Hope thishelps"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have been having SVT's since falling pregnant with my first child in late 2004.  I cam off beta blockers in may last year and have had a few SVT's since then , but they have not required hospital treatment.  I have read that they can prove to befatal, is this true as my consultant said they were not fatal.  Can it be controlled by diet at all?","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HCM. Most SVTs usually are not life threatening. When there are accompanying complications like low BP,  previous heart disease then they may cause issues. But usually SVTs are not troublesome. There are no diet modifications that can prevent SVTs. They happen due to some improper circuit within the hearts conduction system. Medications like beta blockers do not cure SVT, the inhibit the trigger which leads to SVT. the keep the heart rate low so that SVTs sont occur. Since you are still getting them, I recommend you should be on a small dose of calaptin (calcium channel blocker) daily for your SVT. They have very less side effects and tolerate well by all patients. Another approach that is used for patients with low risk SVTs is to take a calaptin 120 mg SOS during the episodes. Since I have not examined you and seen your records, I would recommend the daily dosage of calaptin approach.

Hydatid cyst usually due to a parasite either from  pet dog or unripe salad . As you  mentioned only cyst so very difficult to say  something about the cause of cyst. Any how only liver biopsy will find out the exact cause, so consult a surgeon and get it done. Good luck. Dr. HET"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, I am Raha from Ghana.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome is a Functional gastrointestinal disorder and has no known organic cause.In many cases, you can control irritable bowel syndrome by managing your diet, lifestyle and stress.

I have had my gallbladder removed when I was 14 as I was reading the elevations could be due to blockage from gallstone in my bile ducts? Any help?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM.yes, but it is not likely that this blockage would happen after so many years. These findings can be elevated in any liver disease including viral hepatitis, cirrhosis or infections. Most common cause is fatty liver and it is treated by certain medicines and diet. you need to regulate your blood sugar and lipids. Avoid alcohol, fatty food, fried food, certain drugs and eat more fruit and vegetables. Regulate body mass. if there is fever and pain under right rib cage,you should do some tests to rule out cholangitis.  Wish you good health.

This pain is suggestive of a gall bladder disease. Findings suggestive of gall stones on an xray should prompt further testing to make sure the problem is well mapped out and addressed appropriately. Having normal stools, being able to eat anything don't mean you cannot have a gall bladder disease.I would not want to start speculating on different possible causes when something clearly abnormal has been identified.

The last couple of nights I have had MAJOR heart pulps, flip flops etc. Last night was the worst...lasted about 20-30 minutes without easing. I was finally able to fall asleep. This morning I woke up and my chest was sore (stiff feeling). I had my GP order a EKG and this time it showed some PVC. My doctor does not seem concerned. Told me to continue the Prilsec and start taking an asprin a day. This is not normal for me and starting to get worried I may have another night tonight like last night. What are your thoughts.","Doctor":"HelloWelcome to HCM. By Heart pulps, flip flops etc I suppose you are talking about palpitations. Palpitations can be caused by extra beats or VPCs. It can also be caused by thyroid abnormalities and anxiety. These are the three most important causes of palpitations. Other causes are also there but are not considered here. As you have described your ECG shows VPCs or extra beats. VPCs are usually incidental findings in many subjects and usually require no treatment. However if you are having symptoms like fainting, dizziness, breathlessness then they should be evaluated. Since you have not mentioned any of the above symptoms, I suppose they don't trouble you. Therefore I recommend you a thyroid profile. If you still have persistent nagging flip flops or palpitations, then a 24 HR Holter monitoring can be done. In this test a device and some wires are attached to your body (below your clothing) and you are sent home. The device constantly records your ECG while you do your normal day to day activities. After 24 hrs, the readings are checked. It will document the number of PVCs you have, their character,morphology and whether they are life threatening or can cause complications. Please do a thyroid profile and a Holter monitoring (only if persistent symptoms) and revert with results. Wishing you good health.

Constipation: Avoid constipation by giving him syrup lactulose and titrate it's dose to make 2-3 stools/ day4. Any infection: Check his WBC and if it is elevated give him antibiotics5.

The long term prognosis of angioplasty with 5 stents with preserved heart pumping function is good. But as you mentioned you must be checked up regularly every 6 months. The more the number of stents the higher is the risk of restenosis (stent narrowing). However since your body has adapted these stents for this long, I suppose the chances of restenosis are less. A stent usually remains patent for 10-15 years. I suppose you are undergoing a treadmill test or stress test every year which is very essential. Also, since you have completed more than 10 years with these stents, I recommend you go for a check angiography to see whether the stents are patent. Treadmill tests have a sensitivity of 67% , so some amount of heart blockages can get misdiagnosed. That is the reason i am asking for a invasive test. It is recommended for patients with more than 10 years with stents irrespective negative treadmill tests. Overall, the prognosis is good. wishing you good healthRegards"},{"Patient":"sir , my   liver  function  test report is, serum bilirubin(total)0.98mg/dl, serum conjugated 0.17mg/dl, serum unconjugated0.81mg/dl, serum g.p.t.(a.l.t)46u/l, serum g.o.t(a.s.t)35U/l, serum alkaline phosphate(37deg.ctemp.)94u/l, serum total protein 7.8g/dl, serum albumin4.6g/dl, serum globulin3.2g/dl, albumin:glbulin ratio 1.4, sir my question is  this report is normal or dangours for my health and what is the treatment soultion  recovery  from this type disease. my age is 31 , please give me the report as soon as in my mail","Doctor":"Hi.

Forum. Gallbladder is  enlarged but what is the reason of  gallbladder enlargement ,infection or stone?Cyst around ovaries can be cured by  CONSERVATIVE treatment (drugs), so consult a Gynecologist and get  his opinion. Stomach pain may be  due to Hyper acidity ( tension or stress).Diagnosis can be confirmed by upper  G I endoscopy . Try raising the head of your bed about 4 inches with blocks . It also might help to avoid eating or drinking for two hours before you lie down. To help control the stomach acid , one should not drink alcohol or drinks with caffeine in themor eat chocolates or greasy foods.Also take some antacid but  if symptoms are severe then you may need drugs like Proton Pump Inhibitors.

Alcohol is one of the most important toxic agent for liver, but it typically causes a rise in SGOT which is more than SGPT,usually SGOT is twice the SGPT and you have mentioned that your SGOT is 51 which suggests some other cause of high SGPT.Other important causes for elevated SGPT include viral hepatitis , fatty liver, certain hepatotoxic drugs, and autoimmune liver diseases. has your ultrasound shown fatty liver?  You can consult a Gastroenterologist who can help in determining the exact cause for your high SGPT.

Thanks for putting your query in HCM. I am a Gastroenterologist (DM).It suggest that you are suffering from fatty liver disease. I will advise to you get further tests like liver function tests (SGOT/SGPT, Serum bilirubin, serum albumin) and lipid profile. among medications take tablet ursodeoxycholic acid, cap evion and if you are overweight or obese then do regular exercise aerobic at least 30 minutes/ day so that your weight is optimized. Also take less fat in diet. Also if you take alcohol then please stop it. If on investigations lipid profile is deranged then it should also be treated accordingly. Also avoid analgesic belonging to NSAID group, take analgesic like tramadol. Also you should not take any hepatotoxic medications like moxikind, rather you should always consult your doctor before taking any medication.I hope I have answered your query and this will help you.

Cardiac arrhythmia cannot be excluded either. For this reason, I would recommend performing an ambulatory 24-48  hours ECG monitoring in order to examine your heart rhythm trends for a prolonged time and exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia. Some blood lab tests are needed too (complete blood count for anemia, thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction and blood electrolytes for possible imbalance). If all the above tests result normal, you should consider anxiety as the main cause underlying your complaints. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

The cause of the same depends on the reason why mitral valve repair was done . Generally the possibilities are 1) Higher lung pressure causing right valve leak , dilatation or decreased pumping 2) The repair has lived its time as its 7 years , and the disease might have progressed 3) Any new mitral disease 4) In previous era , tricuspid valve was not repaired even if it had moderate to severe disease considering its self healed after mitral repair.  So the same may have progressed 5) Fall in function of left beart post mitral repair .

They said today his SGPT was 80 ( it was 31 last wed), also said that US & xrays did not show any fluid or anything else. Said they saw a CT from almost a yr ago that showed he had mild fatty liver & suspicious of NASH. No one ever told us that then. Today they said yes it s there but did not recheck to see if it was worse & said as stated above that his SGPT was way high and may need to be rechecked in a week or 2 and maybe see a GI but thats all they said they could do. He feels really rotten, dont have the energy to get out of bed for more than 10 minutes, has been that way for almost 3 weeks, and now feels like he cant even get any help. Any suggestions? Could this potentially become life threatening?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query to H.C.M.  Forum. There was elevated level of W B C but the level as you mentioned ( 13 000 c mm) is not very high . This level may be due to any mild  degree infection. Prednisolone  in itself causes fluid retention ,so please mention the the  dosage of prednisolone took your husband. Now his sgpt level is high  80 I U ,however this raised level is not an alarming condition and not so specific . As you stated that your husband is bed ridden  and feeling so tiredness and even breathlessness, so evaluation of diagnosis is very important . Further you mentioned that ultrasound is  normal at  normal at this time . Further stated that there is no fluid in abdomen . I would like to say that there is a very serious disorder according to your stated history of illness . In my opinion please consult another physician and get his opinion as this time condition is not good. In early stage if NASH ( NONALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS) fatigue & weakness are most important symptoms. While further symptoms are weight gain and cirrhosis . So don't delay. Good luck.

The most common cause being nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Other causes include viral infections, liver toxic medications, autoimmune liver diseases, metabolic diseases of the liver. You must be aware of all these. Yes endometriosis can involve liver also. But it is very rare.

I do not really want to take blood pressure tablets. i just bought kalms this afternoon and started taking them. also drinking everyday half glass of beetroot with apple and carrot. am i in danger of having a heart attack or stroke?","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HCM.High BP over a long time definitely leads to damage of other organs called as target organs. The target organs include the heart, eye, kidney, brain. Uncontrolled high BP can cause rupture of the blood vessels supplying the brain and cause a stroke. It can also cause strain on the heart muscle since the heart pumps more vigorously leading to heart muscle enlargement and later symptoms of heart failure. It can cause damage to the retina of the eye, loss of vision and retinal detachment.It can cause damage to the kidney filtration membrane leading to protein loss, electrolyte imbalance and subsequent kidney failure. These are some of the important complications that can be caused by uncontrolled high BP over a long time. Except for a stroke, which can happen when BP is too high and some blood vessel in brain ruptures, other organ damages take a long standing high BP to happen. Your BP is high but not very high and the risk of complications at this point is unlikely. However if it continues to be high over a period of time, it will lead to complications. You can try diet modifications, restricting salt in diet, exercise etc to control your blood pressure. It will take around 3 months for these measures to take full effects. If despite these measures BP remains persistently higher, then you should be started on tablets. You should not rely on beetroot or apple or any other food only to control your blood pressure.Wishing you good health.

Alt from 21 to 19 to 18. All blood work is within normal range except platelets which are stable at 90-100.Should I be concerned with ast and alt getting clap to low range? My low platelets are due to enlarged spleen. Will my spleen ever reduce in size ?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.Splenomegaly is a common complication of cirrhosis. Many cirrhotics have platelet counts in the 60,000s. It is not something to worry about. And it doesn't need to be treated. You have plenty of platelets to properly clot your blood.Blood flows from the spleen...through the portal vein...then through the liver. Scar tissue in the liver (cirrhosis) can interfere with that blood flow, causing pressure to build up in the portal vein (portal hypertension), and the spleen to enlarge (splenomegaly). As the spleen enlarges, it traps platelets. (The amount of platelets in the bloodstream is reduced because the spleen is busy trapping them). So usually people with cirrhosis end up having a problem with portal hypertension and an enlarged spleen, and a reduced platelet count in the bloodstream. As time goes by, the liver may try to repair itself by growing new cells. If there is a lot of scar tissue already present the new cells grow between scar tissue (and result in abnormal nodules). The nodules and scar tissue further interfere with blood flow through the liver. So over time people with advanced cirrhosis can end up having a problem with more and more abnormal nodules and scar tissue forming which interferes even more with blood flow through the liver which makes the spleen continue to enlarge and the platelet count continue to drop.The splenomegaly is usually not reversible. Please go for regular medical follow up.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I am wondering if I should have a diagnosis of cholestatic liver disease .

Linda","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a term used to describe the accumulation of fat in the liver of people who drink little or no alcohol. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is common and, for most people, causes no signs and symptoms and no complications. But in some people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the fat that accumulates can cause inflammation and scarring in the liver. This more serious form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is sometimes called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. At its most severe, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease can progress to liver failure. Unfortunately, elevated AST and ALT values do not discriminate between the presence of simple steatosis or the more serious NASH. As a result, referral to a liver specialist (hepatologist) may be necessary to determine the presence and severity of NASH. The hepatologist may perform other blood tests. Liver X-rays including ultrasound or CT scans may be used to confirm the presence of fat in the liver but do not help determine more important features—the amount of inflammation or scarring. The definitive method to confirm both the presence and severity of NASH is to perform a liver biopsy. In this procedure, a very small sample of liver tissue is obtained by inserting a needle through the skin into the liver. The tissue is examined under the microscope to confirm the precise nature of NAFLD and its severity.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"i had my gallbladder removed Sept 2000 they did the 3 -4 small holes, since then i suffer with bouts of sever bloating , which stays mostly in my upper abdomen. i also have a lump just below my right breast that stays hard and fairly tender, but the rest of my upper abdomen and part of my lower swell up causing me to look as if i m 9 months pregnant.

Meanwhile you are doing good in maintaining a good diet but you need to make sure that you indulge in good amount of physical exercise as well.

Since your monitor shoes a raised pulse rate and as per your description it is irregular, I recommend you a ECG initially and if the ECG comes normal, then a 24 HR Holter monitoring should be done which records your ECG for 24 hrs while you go about your routine day to day activities. It will show whether you have any heart rhythm disturbances.Variable BP reading in 30 mins seem unlikely. Electronic monitors cannot be perfectly relied upon for BP recording. So I do not see the need to worry about the BP. Checking BP so frequently implies that you are anxious. Please stop worrying about your BP . Check it only once a week at variable times of the day.

As well as this, research has shown that the use of cannabis may suppress immune function and enhance the development of disease.  With this in mind, avoiding frequent use of cannabis is advised.  People who have hepatitis C and use cannabis everyday are more likely to have severe fibrosis which can then lead to cirrhosis of the liver.  If you have been diagnosed with hepatitis C, you may have heard that occasional or light use of cannabis has been shown to help some people deal with treatments and side-effects.  However, if you are considering using cannabis during treatment you should also be aware that it may do more harm than good and discuss it with your specialist.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"HI, MY BROTHER HAS LIVER DISEASE HE RETAINS LOTS OF FLUID NURSES MESURE THE AMOUNT OF URINE HE PUTS OUT  BUT AT TIMES HE HAS THE URGE TO URINATE AND CANT WAIT FOR THE NURSE TO GIVE HIM THE URINAL SO HE URINATER  ON THE BED .

I mentioned to my doctor on Monday that I had been havin gthe pain but thought it was from taking synthroid and she took me off it, but I am still having the pain periodically. AM I having or have had a aheart attack?","Doctor":"Hello welcome to HCM. your symptoms may suggest that they are of cardiac origin. However what you are suffering from may be angina which is a risk factor for a heart attack. It is unlikely that you have sustained a heart attack, but you are at the risk of having one. Thats why I suggest you to get a cardiac evaluation. Please do a ECG, 2d echo. ECG will show the heart's electrical activity and changes of angina. 2 d echo will show the pumping function of the heart, the structure of heart muscles, its valves and leak between the valves if present. This will give a indication whether you have already sustained a heart attack. If both ECG and 2 d echo are normal, you must do a treadmill test or stress test which requires you to walk on a treadmill while your ECG is continuously being monitored. This will predict of you have any blockages in the heart and predict if you are at the risk of a heart attack. Please do the above tests and revert with the results.

The remaining 50% are due to non-biliary causes. This is because upper abdominal pain and gallstones are both common but are not always related.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"My boyfriend has reoccurring bumps which look like pimples/ingrown hairs, they appear on his thigh and frequently in his nostril .. they get very red, swollen, agitated and painful.

The first hospital that we went to, told us that he has chronic heartburn which he does, then they gave us Omeprazole and Zofran to stop the vomiting. We went home later that night he started to vomit again, not even water would stay inside of him. I took him back to the hospital and they told us the same thing again. I took him home and watched him suffer. I decided that I could not watch him suffer anymore, so I took him to a Private hospital. The first hospital was public. The private hospital ran a bunch of tests and they determined that he has very bad ulcers and it is actually blocking his stomach. This is the reason why he cannot keep food down. They decided to put a tube inside of him in order to get the gastric acids out. My husband stopped vomiting and he is now sitting in the hospital with this tube. The second thing that they told us is that he has fistulas in his gallbladder and it is communicating with other organs. They told us that although he does not have an infection, this has to be fixed. They also told us that he is a very strange case because he is so young, he is 26 years old. They also told us that he has two foreign objects inside of him, then after the endoscopy they told us that it might be ulcers that calcified. They told us that they are not able to deal with his case and he has to be transferred. My husband has been waiting to be transferred for two days and the big hospital stated that they do not have a bed yet. My question is, are the doctors lying? Are they simply trying to run experiments on him because he is rare? Why won't they show us his Cat Scan?","Doctor":"HIthanks for your question.the doctors might be right(taking decisions based guidelines),not experimenting, some patients based on my experience can be complex.

Going by your description it is evident that your mother has sustained a heart attack in the inferior wall of the heart which is supplied by the RCA. The RCA which was blocked and caused he attack was attempted to be stented but was not possible due to chronic total occlusion or calcification. Because of the heart attack, the heart muscle in the inferior wall of the heart sustained damage, that's why the severe LV dysfunction. Since RCA could not be stented, there is only the option of medical management. Bypass surgery is done only if there is involvement of the LAD. So she has to be on medications like two blood thinners , cholesterol lowering medications, diuretics to decrease load on the heart and other medications like beta blockers which prevent the remodeling of the heart after a heart attack. She should do well if she is compliant on the medications. Since RCA could not be opened and the past of the heart supplied by the RCA is already damaged, there is no need to re attempt the stenting.

A treadmill test is used to predict whether there are blockages in the heart arteries. Many patients have a positive TMT with no symptoms. Hence they require further evaluation. Many of these patients who have no symptoms with a positive TMT do have underlying blockages in the heart. Some percentage of these are false positive. A thallium stress test is a more sensitive and reliable test than a TMT. so this implies that in your case TMT is false positive. So in future the TMT will always be positive and hence it is of no insignificance in false positive cases like u. For routine check up for heart blockages in your case a stress echo or dobutamine stress echo or a thallium stress test should be done rather than a plain TMT. At this point of time you need not worry about positive TMTs since they are going to persist.

And hospital visit is always needed as increased blood loss will leads to hypovolemic shock which is not an acceptable condition if the blood loss is no much then it is fine and you can wait for the change but if it is more you need to consult your treating doctor for sure.

I have been experiencing extreme pain in my left upper arm. So extreme it keeps me awake. I have been experiencing heartburn, some reflux and  pain in the upper right quandrant area under ribcage.  I am overweight, around 180 lbs. and 5' 2\\". I have telling myself I just need to loose weight.  Recently the pain in my arm has moved to my shoulder down towards my left breast area. I was scared it might be my heart. I went to the doctor and had an EKG.  It was normal. I had an ultrasound on my gallbladder.  It showed a polyp.  Then I had another scan on my gallbladder which took 2 hours, I had to lie perfectly still. I think it was called a hidascan where they intravenously put nuclear dye in to see how your gallbladder is functioning.  It came back normal. What could possibly be wrong with me?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query to H.C.M. Forum. As pain is on both sides left as well right. First of all we will discuss about the left side pain. The first possibility is of peptic ulcer disease or Hiatal hernia. Diagnosis can be confirmed by upper G I endoscopy. Try raising the head of your bed about 4 inches with blocks. It also might help to avoid eating or drinking 2 hours before you lie down. You should avoid alcohol , drinks with caffeine in them, chocolate or spicy or greasy food. Also take  some antacid but if symptoms are severe you might need drugs like proton pump inhibitor. Now on the right side as ultrasound shown polyp consult a surgeon and get his opinion as gallbladder disease is not good for fatty ( obese ) person. Try to reduce weight it will also help you. Good luck. Dr. HET"},{"Patient":"Hi","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for the query,I think you might need a more critical and in depth review. Liver function tests and screening for viral hepatitis could be useful. An abdominal ultrasound to get a good idea of the nature of the liver could be also very useful.

These are potential sources of fluids and since you are suffering from body fluid retention, it is best you avoid taking more until medical intervention can be done. Taking care of your liver cirrhosis can prove to be tough and you will have to get through a lot of treatment sessions just for temporary relief. You will have to exercise patience and acceptance of your condition. If you are having poor urination, then you might also be having an associated kidney diseases.

Activities that increase the heart rate increase the blood and oxygen requirement of the heart. So if the heart arteries already have blockages, then the sextra demand is not met and you may experience chest pain or discomfort.

The Dr. thought she had 3 cholesterol blocked arteries, with surgery-the Dr. said that she had 3 split arteries & blood had dried and formed blockages. What could have caused this problem?  She hasn't had any previoous problems.","Doctor":"Hello welcome to HCM. Atherosclerotic heart disease is a multifactorial disease affected by genetic and environmental factors. The risk factors for atherosclerotic heart disease are strong family history, obesity, smoking, male sex, blood ptessure, diabetes, age, improper diet and many others. A combination of these factors lead to deposition of cholesterol in the walls of the heart vessels causing them to narrow. Narrowing of the artery decreases blood supply to the heart and hence the patient gets chest pain. Narrowing of the arteries critically also leads to stagnation of blood cells called platelets causing clot formation which you are referring here to dried up blood. This can lead to a heart attack. A bypass surgery uses alternative grafts to bypass the blocks so that the blood of supply to the heart is restored.

Finding of fatty liver on ultrasound scan of abdomen is a very common finding now a days due to our dietary habits.

I am not sure if you take any alcoholic beverages, but you must stop it if you do. Rest of the management will depend after you being examined clinically and with the investigation reports.

Hope you are doing good. We often gain weight rapidly with out knowing it the cause could be eating habbits , limited physical activity and much more. Duromine tablets are not effective if you dont have control over your diet and do not physically active ( I mean enough exercise to burn fats). Advance re-search also shows that one of the cause of weight gain is not proper functioning of liver. But in your case i think don't blame the liver.          Let Me give you simple plan:                          If you burn 500 more calories than you eat every day for a week, you should lose about 1-2 pounds.If you want to lose weight faster, you'll need to eat less and exercise more.For instance, if you take in 1,050 to 1,200 calories a day, and exercise for one hour per day, you could lose 3-5 pounds in the first week, or more. Limiting salt and starches may also mean losing more weight at first -- but that's mostly fluids, not fat.When you reduce sodium and cut starches, you reduce fluids and fluid retention, which can result in up to 5 pounds of fluid loss when you get started. you did not mentioned your body weight and height with that could give you better idea that how much should you loose.

Other tests may be needed. You should discuss with your doctor on the above issues. Hope to have been helpful!Wishing all the best, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have a couple of questions.

I also see that your body mass index is about 37 (normal: 19 to 25). Obesity is directly linked to NAFLD and in this regard I will advise you to gradually reduce weight by adopting lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise. In contrast, rapid weight loss may worsen your condition. Liver ultrasound will help establish the diagnosis but liver biopsy is confirmatory. I will advise that you to consult your physician and have your condition examined. In addition I will advise taking insulin sensitizing drugs such as metformin and lipid lowering drugs such as statins. Again, I will encourage you to see your doctor for the same. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello DoctorMy mother has stone of size 5mm in gallbladder and she has asthma too. I want to be remove gallbladder stone but without open surgery.

My BP has been elevated even though I m on medicaiton for it, and my heart rate has elevated 20 points per minute.

Please type your query here...Hi  today when i got up i have had a recurring pain just above my right breast towards the middle of chest it comes and goes it is not a burning feeling just a pain i am concerned","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms are not typical of any cardiac disorders. Is the pain triggered by deep breathing or body movement? This could indicate a possible musculo-skeletal disorder. In such case Ibuprofen would help relieve the pain. Gastro-esophageal reflux is another possible cause of this symptomatology. For this reason, I would recommend trying taking Ibuprofen 400mg. If the pain still persists, I would recommend adding also omeprazole. But, in my opinion there is no need to perform any additional tests because your symptoms are not indicative of any serious medical disorder.

Off late, I haven't been able to have good sleep, lots of stress due to peculiar family circumstances.Please help.Thanks","Doctor":"Hello irfan. Thanks for posting at HCM. Your ECG says inferior wall ischemic changes which means that the lower part of the heart is struggling with its blood supply. It is possible that you have sustained a heart attack already. Since your sugars are low I suppose you are on medications for diabetes. Diabetics do not have symptoms of chest pain during a heart attack. You should definitely get checked up at the earliest. You have to see a cardiologist (heart specialist). You have to get a 2D echo done which will confirm the ECF findings if you really had a heart attack. If 2 d echo shows inferior wall changes then next step is an angiography which is an invasive procedure done through a small prick on your hand or leg. It will show whether your heart arteries have blockages and their severity. You may be advised angioplasty or bypass surgery or medical management on basis of angiography findings. This is important and you should get evaluated at the earliest. Please revert back with 2 d echo findings and also if you have any queries. Don't take this lightly. Your fasting sugars are also low so you also have to monitor your sugars closelyWishing you good health. and skip respective dose if sugars are lower than 100. Also you have to see your diabetologist for medication optimization. Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi, A year ago I was having many GI problems.  14 weeks of diarrhea, pains and cramping.

An inadequate intake of water will cause excessive stomach bloating.Water benefits the body by aiding with digestion because it supports a majority of the body's daily functions. Fatty foods cause a formation of fat cells to develop throughout the body and contribute to bloating as well. A build up of fat cells slows down the body's ability to empty the stomach.Dairy products also contribute to excessive cramps, gas, and bloating.Persons who are intolerant to lactose products experience this effect more than others.Following steps should follows to lessen the bloating:-Walk after eating a meal.-Exercise-Avoid coffee and chocolates.-Avoid Meals that are high in fat.-Avoid extremely hot or cold food.-Avoid bubble gum or bubbly beverages. If needed then medication should be included antacids, PPI, domperidone, Levosulpiride (prokinetic), digestive enzymes and some laxatives.Regards,Dr. Naresh Jain."},{"Patient":"I have gone to my general practitioner for the last year with unidentified stomach pain.

The cyst in the kidney could just be a coincidental finding. However, seeing your present symptoms, you can go for a review ultrasound scan of your pelvis and abdomen. It seems that the urinary infection of yours is persisting even after taking a course of antibiotic which is an indication for going for a urine culture and sensitivity test. Cholecystitis is a different entity which needs evaluation and treatment separately, and this also could be a reason for your nausea, vomiting and bloated feeling. Please visit your family physician with your urine culture and sensitivity report for a review.

Your wife has symptoms of chest pain and discomfort on exertion which are very typical for angina pectoris or ischemic heart disease. This means there are some blocks in the heart arteries. When a patient with such blocks walks or exercises, the heart rate increases and its blood and oxygen demand increases. Since the arteries are blocked, they cannot cope up with the extra demand of blood and oxygen while exercising or walking. This causes the chest pain/discomfort. This same principle is used in a TMT. you are made to exercise on a treadmill while your ECG is continuously being recorded to see whether the ECG shows changes while walking corresponding to her chest pain. Hence it is called provocable ischemia since we provoke the event. Before a TMT, a target heart rate is set for the patient till which the patient is usually made to walk on the treadmill. This target heart rate is usually  220 - age of the patient. Your wife's TMT showed changes of ischemia or deficiency in blood supply at 74% of this target heart rate. Hence this is a positive test and indicates a strong possibility of blockages in the heart in view of typical symptoms and a postive TMT. Your cardiologist will advice a coronary angiography for her which is a invasive test done through a small hole in the hand or the leg. This will show the blockages in the heart and their severity. On basis of the angiography findings, further treatment (medical management vs angioplasty vs bypass) can be discussed. My feeling is she would require an angioplasty.Please go ahead with an angiography and revert with the findings.

No doctor will operate on a patient without doing an angiography at first. Further, a bypass surgery also has good results these days.

But don't worry this is not a major diagnosis and air trapping or other illnesses mentioned above are only probabilities. It may be found in normal population also. To confirm the presence of a respiratory disease, I recommend you to go for a pulmonary function test which requires you to blow into a machine while your lung capacities are estimated. Please do a Pulmonary function test and revert back with the test results. Wishing you good health.Regards"},{"Patient":"My mother had a gall bladder operation but her hemoglobin level is 7 at that time because of irregular mansturian cycle because of which three blood bottles has been injected.

If all BP readings are consistently higher then a diagnosis of high blood pressure can be established.Since your are young, your arteries are still elastic, so BP can be controlled with regular exercise mostly cardio and diet restrictions with with restriction.

You have not mentioned your age here. I would have been in a better position to help you if you had mentioned your age. Your palpitations seem more likely due to stress but other organic causes should be ruled out. Please do a Holter monitoring where a device is attached to your body which continuously records your ECG over 24 hours while you go about your normal activities. This will show whether there are any heart rhythm disturbances which you feel as palpitations. Your BP reading is definitely high despite on medications. But this again may be related to the stress (health stress related to palpitations) . I suggest you record your BP over a week one reading daily and if all readings are persistently high then your BP medications need to be adjusted or changed. Please do the above and revert back. Wishing you good health. Regards"},{"Patient":"I am waiting for a medical re getting my license back.

I had nothing done about it at that point. 2 years ago i went back to the GP again for an appointment regarding something else and they found my blood pressure had raised a lot to around 140-160/85-105. I had tests and scans to check my kidneys and heart as well as seeing a cardiologist and these all came back as borderline for treatment and she would see me again within a year. This was 2 years ago and i hadn't been to see the cardiologist as they haven't sent for me! So a few weeks ago i went back to the GP to see if they could chase it up - which they have and i have an appointment for the end of this month - however my GP has given me some medication called Almodipine and told me to start that at 2.5 mg for a few days then up it to 5 mg. I however think my high readings are just because i am having my blood pressure taken, even at home it is elevated but not as much as at the surgery. My issue is that 1) I am only 23 and do i want to be taking medication for life that i actually may not need because it is just high when taken? 2) What if i do take it and i don't need it because it isn't actually high? 3) Why give me it now when i am seeing a cardiologist in 3 weeks? Also i wanted to know how long it takes the medication to cause an effect? Is it the build up or on that day of taking the tablet it will work? Here are some of the home readings i have been getting iver the past few days - Also there is such a variation in readingS, why could this be? Day 1 - 7.30 p.m - 136/103 8 p.m - 139/92 Day 2 - 7.30 a.m - 139/93 12.15 p.m - 148/100 1 p.m - 152/82 8.55 p.m - 139/97 9.35 p.m - 132/85 Day 3 - 8 a.m - 136/88 8.20 a.m - 122/89 2 p.m - 134/77 3.30 p.m - 142/78 4.30 p.m - 139/85 As you can see it seems to have lowered towards day 3 but it ranges so much! The diastolic pressure seems to be more or less always elevated - Does the almodipine medication i have effect both numbers? I do understand that it is a calcium channel blocker which works by relaxing the arteries so lowering BP. I hope you can help ease my mind slightly! Thankyou!","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for posting at HCM. Your BP readings have been consistently higher. Daily variations of BP are acceptable and you need not pay special attention to it. Since you have mentioned that you have got your kidneys and heart checked earlier and was not started on treatment  I suppose those tests were normal. since you are 23, your arteries are still elastic and can contain pressure related changes. You can contain this high BP by daily exercise cardio preferably and diet modifications including restricting the salt in your diet. Quit smoking if you already smoke.   Also your readings are not very high to be started on amlodipine at this point of time. A trial with diet modifications and exercise should be given prior to starting on medications. But you must be regular with your exercise. With diet and exercise, effect on BP can be seen on 3-4 months. If still not controlled despite the measures, then you should be started on medications.

Anemia , if hemoglobin level is less than 6 gm /dl ,we call as severe anemia. If hemoglobin is ,still less than this patient may feel dizziness and chances of faintness.

Thanks for posting at HCM. I have gone through your history. Tb infections of the lung even after complete treatment leave scar marks (fibrosis) on the lungs. It is like a wound on the skin which heals with medications but wound scar persist. So wit every TB infection ,part of the lung gets scarred or fibrosed. This scarring causes a decrease in the ling capacities.  This doesn't cause immediate problems but with age the problems may become apparent. It may cause breathlessness, cough and fast heart rate. Fast heart rate is not a direct result but occurs due to breathlessness and cough. I recommend you do a pulmonary function test which requires you to blow forcefully onto a machine which calculates your lung volumes. Another cause of tachycardia and chest pain can be angina or heart issues. Please do a ECG, 2/d echo and treadmill test to evaluate for a heart problems. Please revert back with the above tests. Wishing you good health. Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi, I was exposed to hepatitis B back in March through sexual contact, my test came back negative across the board.

No one else has been able to including all of my Drs I see. Thank you","Doctor":"Hello Good Evening,Answer of your query is quite simple as follows:Hepatitis B infection is detected on screening by HBsAg (Hepatitis Virus Surface Antigen), which detected in an infected person’s blood an average of 4 weeks (range: 1–9 weeks) after exposure to the virus.So you might be tested prior to that period.The incubation period (time gap between entry of pathogen to the body and first appearance of signs and symptoms) of the hepatitis B virus is 90 days on average, but can vary from 30 to 180 days.So you became symptomatic after around 3 months of being infected.So you should be agree that you are positive for Hepatitis B and be in regular follow up of your GP to control your disease.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am concerned because my daughter is having symptoms of gall bladder problems, however I noticed that it stated you could become sick 2 to 3 hours after a meal but she is getting sick as soon as she finishes eating.

Twice it has been when eating pizza and the 3rd time was eating a fatty food.  This has hit within the last two weeks, could the vomiting hit her that fast?","Doctor":"HI thanks for using HCM. Your Q> Could the vomiting hit her that fast?Yes. Since she has problem with gall bladder. Our body start responding from the time food is in mouth and related enzymes starts secreting and synthesizing and the organs like gall bladder starts contracting to release related digestive enzymes. The gall bladder symptoms occur more often with fatty food, so better to reduce it. You have not mentioned what problem she has(diagnosis). Better to consult your doctor for proper management as there is cure for gall bladder problem. Better to prevent any complication than treating them. Hope I answered your question.

Chronic hepatitis B may eventually cause cirrhosis and liver cancer.The infection is preventable by vaccination.Since you have mentioned that your father isn't an alcoholic person , i suggest you to check the others reasons i have mentioned above to find the actual cause if any.This Disease is completely curable in the initial stages and may require a transplant in the final stages , I suggest you to check the diagnosis with two or more doctors before coming to a conclusion , since such diseases may show up mistakenly , any way i don't suspect the efficiency of your doctor, but i would recommend you to check with another Liver Specialist also.Since you have said that it is difficult for you to afford costly liver surgeries i recommend you to try at PGI Chandigarh , or an NGo \\"MOHAN\\" At Hyderabad India to help you.Wishing your Father and your family A good health!Dr.G.Gayatri Devi"},{"Patient":"I have had a high alt level in the 70s for 5 years or so now.

Going by your symptoms it looks like you had a syncopal attack followed by breathlessness. The cause of the syncopal attack and the breathlessness should be evaluated.First of all a cardiac cause must be ruled out. Please do aa ECG and   2 d echo.

One thing is sure, that it cannot be anything serious.Hope I am able to answer your concerns.If you have any further query, I would be glad to help you.In future if you wish to contact me directly, you can use the below mentioned link:bit.ly/dr-srikanth-reddyWish you good health,Dr. Srikanth Reddy M.D."},{"Patient":"hiello sir i m a heart patients recently i gone sugar in escorts my operation has pas 1 year sucess now i m feeling that sweating and my heart is fast beating i had done 2D Echo it was fine now i m using tablets envas 5mg O/D warf 2mg /d pls tell me good to exercise to controlling my heart beat","Doctor":"hello Thanks for posting at HCM. Your symptoms of sweatig arapid heart beat can be related to heart issues. Since your 2 d echo is normal there is nothing new that has happened. But I recommend you to do a stress test which will see whether your heart is able to cope up with exercise and whether blood supply to the heart decreases when you exercise. This will give us a prediction whether your surgery results are still working well. Next issue to be checked here is thyroid issues which can also cause sweating and fast heart rate. Please do a thyroid profile and a stress test and revert back with the results. Wishing you good health.

While driving I got this tingling sensation from head to toe and shortly there after got horrible cramping of my arm, hands, and feet. Then slowly lost my speech. I thought I was having a stroke. I went to ER where they said my potassium and magnesium levels were dangerously low. I also was told I had a bladder, kidney, and gallbladder infection and a small kidney stone. It's been four days and I don't feel much better.  Im still getting occasional tingling in my face and feel very sluggish. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hello dear,The kidney helps in maintaining the acid-base balance in the body.And any pathology to it in the form of infection or stone can result in imbalance resulting in increased sensitivity of nerve endings at the Neuromuscular junctions.So, the tingling sensation in the face can be attributed to increased sensitivity of the nerves which supply those muscle groups.Other causes can be:1. Electrolyte imbalance- as reported in the ER2. Hypocalcemia- calcium is essential for nerve conduction & decreased level of calcium can cause such symptoms.3. Dietary deficiency of nutrients like Vit B6, Vit B12 & Folic acid, etc,4. Stress & hyperventilation5. Peripheral neuropathy due to metabolic reasonsSymptomatic relief can be obtained by intake of multi vitamins & mineral supplements.However, if symptoms still persist, kindly consult your Physician for a proper clinical examination.Investigations like complete blood count & nerve conduction studies will be helpful.There is no need to worry...you will be fine.

I then had an ultrasound and it read:fatty liver seen,Echogenic areas within the liver measuring 4.2 x1.8cm.  The 'Impression' reads: Fatty liver seen.Echogenic mass vs. fatty tissue seen within liver,f/u is recommended. What does this actually mean?

In your liver, there is this area which is more echogenic which means it is more whiter than the rest of liver.An echogenic area if well defined, commonly is a hemangioms which is a benign lesion. Else it can be a fat containing lesion and less likely a problematic one.I would suggest you to go for follow up ultrasound after 3 months to see if there is any change in size.Hope this helps.Dr. A.

You should limit intake of food that is not getting digested.

His BP is also under controll now. What may be the reason behind this head giddiness ?","Doctor":"Hello thanks for posting at HCM. So the main complaint is giddiness in a BP patient with history of stroke. Giddiness can be caused by some blood pressure medications. It would be very useful if you provide details like when he has the giddiness i.e. while walking or abruptly standing up from bed or lying etc. Some BP medications can cause postural hypotension which can cause giddiness on suddenly getting up from sitting or lying position. To prevent this he must get up slowly from lying position, sit for a minute, then stand up slowly and wait near the bed or sofa for about 30 secs. This will prevent giddiness episodes. Also if he is on diuretics (water pills)like lasix or thiazide, the blood volume gets depleted due to increased urine and patient becomes dehydrated which may again cause giddiness. In that case diuretics should be  given at lower doses or stopped and changed to other drugs as required. Another cause can be internal ear issues which causes vertigo and dizziness. In this case giddiness can occur at any time, mostly with motion and rotational issues. Please get an ENT consult for the same. Cerival spine issues can also cause giddiness, so please get a x ray of the cervial spine (neck). Please revert back with the above advice. I don't think the giddiness is related to the history of stroke.Wishing you good healthRegards"},{"Patient":"I had a cholestectomy 12 days post op.

An enlarged or inflammed liver on its own could explain the shoulder pain, neck pain and fatigue. It s mandatory to know the cause of the raised liver enzymes. Hepatitis A, B C and D should be ruled out systematically. An abdominal ultrasound could be useful in getting the know the size of the liver and the spleen. It is very rare that this could be infectious Mononucleosis.  In IM, raised white blood cells are seen, enlarged lymph nodes and usually with spleen enlargement and not liver most of the time. It s not usual to have raised liver enzymes in this condition.I strongly suggest you consult your primary care physician and evaluation of your liver function.Kind regards,Bain LE, MD."},{"Patient":"Hie Doctormy husband is 47yrs about 5 week ago he got jaundice he was hospitalised and he was given vit b n k for 3 wks but no help after sme weeks he started feeling pains when he go to toilet and we had travelled to zimbabwe might it be malaria all what herevthey are failing to know whats the cause his birrubin was recorded high and the urine is still coffee","Doctor":"Hi,There are many causes for jaundice and it is almost impossible to comment on the cause without knowing the results of the investigations.The minimum investigations needed would be:CBC/ESRFasting SugarSer.

Since you are having it for more than a year, your doctor will give you  medicines after examining you.Period collection can mean some of the clots still persisting in the endometrial cavity of uterus and not completely expelled out. Dont worry it will happen on its own towards the end of menstruation.Coming to fatty liver, it is seen in alcoholics, obese people, rice (carbohydrate) eating population and those who are genetically predisposed.If you are a regular alcoholic I will suggest you to get liver tests done and if you are addicted to alcohol, please consult a psychiatrist for deaddiction.Hope this helpsDr Anjana Rao"},{"Patient":"Hi, ..I have had heart flutters , or a ratcheting down type stalling heart flutter for years, but over past few months it has become a stronger drag down feeling, and seems to be faintly, but constantly \\"in the background 100% of the time now, between the stronger flutters or stalls as I call them- when my heart feels like it's sputtering like a car about to stall out.

Your symptoms of fluttering and dragging down sensation seem to be related to heart rhythm disturbances. Since you have mentioned that yoir focotr had diagnosed that flutter, it is quite possible that you are having heart rhythm disturbances which is causing you such sensations in the chest. This can lead to many other associated problems of the heart including heart failure. You must get evaluated for the same. Also you have a family history of premature heart disease. This is not emergency room serious but you should try to get an appointment  at the earliest. You must get evaluated by a ECG, 2 d echo and Holter monitoring. If all these tests show no abnormalities, a stress test is to be done. Please do the above tests and revert back with the results. Wishing you good health.

The skin affection may just be local and could be as a result of eczema and in order to remedy that you might need some medications.At the moment, you can start by taking a cold bath, then get OTC antihistamines which you can readily fine. I usually prescribe chlopheniramine for itches and may associate it to steroidal antiinflammatory such as dexamethasone or prednisone. You might require a doctor's script in order to get a hold of those. I suggest that you see a dermatologist for immediate relief.Best wishes"},{"Patient":"Male, 37yr old, 105kg.

You also require to undergo some of the blood tests like lipid profile, HBsag, Anti HCV ab, ANA, SMA, S.ceruloplasmin to see the cause of abnormal AST and ALT as they suggest that there is ongoing liver injury which if persist for a longer period of time will be harmful. It is  further advised:1.Good glycaemic control with help of Antidiabetic drugs may be Insulin 2.Regular exercise which includes brisk walk for at least 30min/day. 3. Very low caloric diet as per your BMI to reduce your weight which is must. 4. If your lipid profile is also derranged then lipid lowering agents also. 5. Cause of abnormal AST/ ALT as per scenario you have given appears to be more likely due to NAFLD which will require some medications like ursodeoxycholic acid , apart from measure which I have already mentioned.

Your symptoms resemble flatulence or gaseous distention of the stomach. It is caused by gas trapping inside the stomach which forms bubbles leading to such sensation and bloating of abdomen. It can be caused by acid reflux (acidity) and improper eating. When you eat very fast, you tend to swallow air with the food leading to gas inside the stomach. My advice to you is to eat slowly and in small quantities in short intervals. This will decrease some of your symptoms. You should also take a course of antacids for 14 days twice daily before food. Medications and their interactions can also cause such symptoms. So if your symptoms don't subside despite being the above measures, then you must get your medications changed or adjusted."},{"Patient":"I have alot of issues but one that concerns me is that I have pain in my right groin for the past 5 yrs and I just got checked and my doctor said I had a inlarged lympnode.She just said she will keep an eye on it.She checke my bood and every thing is good except I have a history of low platelets 109-120 but she s nothing wrong with my bood.She checked my overie, spleen , liver and just did a abdomen ultersound but she can t find anything wrong.But I still have pain in my groin and it get s inflamed.Also she checked for hurnia and I do not have it.My concern is that my son had Multicentric Castelman s Disiese at a young age he is now past away.He took his life at 17.But I am concerned that is maybe why I have inlarged lympnode in my groin.My doctor does not know anything about this disiese so can yu help me or give me any sudjestions.

Basically you have symptoms of palpitations and fast heart rate when you exert. This may be related to cardiac cause also. When the heart arteries are narrowed, when you ever the heart nets faster to cope up with the demand. Please do a stress test which requires you to walk on a treadmill while your heart rate and ECG is continuously being monitored. This will show whether the heart really gets fast more than normal range during exertion. Next I would also like to see a thyroid profile on you.  thyroid abnormalities can also cause fast heart rate and palpitations. Please do the above tests and revert back. Daily exercises like walking, cycling, jogging, swimming can also increase the stamina and can help in keeping heart rate under control. Wishing you good health.

Troponin is a component of the heart muscle fibre. When a person suffers from a heart attack, the heart muscle fibres get damaged releasing troponin in the blood stream. This enzymes is used to determine whether the patient has a recent heart attack. It disorders from blood within 7-10 days of a heart attack. It does not remain in blood after 10 days hence there is nothing that should be done decrease its level. If he has got persistent detection of tropomin in his blood, and if the levels are on increasing trend, then it is possible that there is an ongoing heart attack or a re attack called as reinfarction.  If it has a decreasing trend then there is nothing to work about and or will disappear eventually. Going by your description of change in mental status and forgetfulness, there is a strong possibility of brain damage during the cardiac arrest. These cognitive changes will mostly remain. Here Alzheimer's disease should also be excluded because of similar symptoms in Alzheimer's.

Your symptoms like shortness of breath, loss of weight, chest pressure, fatigue can be symptoms of anemia. But since you have worked up, I guess haemoglobin levels would have been checked and found normal. Another possibility is chest infection . You have mentioned that tests are normal, but not which tests have been done. I want to know whether a chest x ray and a CT of the chest has been done. If not please get a CT chest done. It will show if you have some infection patches in the lungs. If infection patches are present, samples from those areas can be taken by bronchoscopy for testing. Possibility of tuberculosis should also be considered here. Since your ANA is positive then the symptoms can be due to autoimmune disease also. But again it depends on the intensity of ANA, its final dilution and its pattern. Please share information about the full ANA report. ANA positivity can affect lungs, kidneys and other organs also. Please do a urine routine and creatinine (if not already done) to see if kidney functions are affected. Please revert with the above findings.

The shoulder pain may be related to the fatty liver and will settle down as the probem resolves."},{"Patient":"Good eve, i am 35yr old male. I was sent to get an ultrasound of the abdomen. I was diagnosed with a cyst in my liver. I do not drink or smoke.This is what my finds are.Liver measures 14.9 cm in length and is normal size, shape and parenchymal echogenicity. No intrahepatic ductal dilatation.There is a 1.8cm circumscribed anechoic structure within the right hepatic lobe with focal ring down artifact about its posterior aspect.Impression:1.8cm hepatic probable complex cyst with wall calcification.If there is clinical concern, recommend further evaluation with contrast enhanced CT abdomen..Please adviseThank you!","Doctor":"Hello friend,Your question does not give information whether your USG was done as a routine investigation or it was advised by a physician following any abdominal complaint like pain or discomfort in the liver region. I presume that it was found out following a routine check up because the cystic area in the liver is a compromised one and not an active one. The calcification is the result of such a situation. That means the cyst is not active and is not going to do any harm for you. What you have to do is just forget about the cyst in your liver and stop worrying over the liver complaint. Body has got several such compromising activities which are a part of its similar defence mechanisms. It has got no connection with your habit of drinking or smoking. It is not going to do any harm on you in future provided you are not too much worried about that. With best wishes,Dr. C. J.

I have performed an endoscopy which found grade A gastritis as well as an hiatal hernia, and a colonoscopy which found nothing out of the ordinary. In connection with this they took blood tests and I have some concerns when I look at the results compared to the ones I took a year ago (I have not yet seen the doctor to discuss the results). It appears that my AST and ALT levels have gone up from 19 and 31, to 74 and 118 respectively. My blood urea nitrogen has also dropped from 13 to 7 in the same period.

Could this be the cause of the bloating if that is the case?

I m currently taking Carafate and Pepcid Complete, but nothing seems to completely help. I had 2 beers about an hour ago. About 10-20 minutes after the beers I vomited, and now I have pain and gas in- what appears to be- my stomach. But the pain I m experiencing in my right side is directly behind the middle of my rib cage. Can pain in this area be normal with gastritis ? I also have reason to believe it could possibly liver pain. But I doubt my liver would hurt after one beer, I have no history of liver problems (that I m aware of). Ideas ?","Doctor":"HiPain due to gastritis can be in the upper part of the abdomen ,mostly on the right side.Alchohol directly affects the stomach lining leading to pain and vomiting.It is not related to liver.Please take Rabeprazole and domperidone capsule.Add sucralfate syrup.Once the symptoms are subsided,get an upper GI endoscopy and Ultrasound abdomen.Wish you good healthRegards"},{"Patient":"Hi ! My mother was on the intensive phase of TB treatment with Rifampicin+Iz+Py+Eb from 3.3.2013 to 1.5.2013. Although the drugs have been discontinued since then she still continues to have anorexia, nausea and vomitting and showing symptoms of jaundice doc says its DLI. Her liver profile shows very high >1000 ALT and AST and 3.4 total bilirubin. Is the problem serious? When will she get back to normal. What is the treatment for jaundice now? Presently she is taking combutol and Levofloxacin in the second phase of treatment. She frequently gets fever. Urine tests indicated high Pus cells (30-40) at first (around 24.5.13) and within two weeks of antibiotic administration for urine infection, her pus cells reduced but now (4.5.13) the RBC is high (30-40)?  She still continues to avoid smell and flavour. How long will such symptoms last?","Doctor":"Hi there ~I understand your concerns for your mother.  It is not uncommon to have symptoms of anorexia with a long term illness currently under treatment with strong antibiotics.  I am sure your mother will regain the weight once she starts to have appetite for food.  Digestive enzymes may be helpful in this scenario.  I also believe that there is a lot of help out there if she does have eating disorders or symptoms of the same prior to having TB.  A visit with a psychiatrist will clear any doubts you may have regarding her eating patterns.  It is always advisable to eat in small amounts at regular intervals if mealtimes do not work.  However, it is best to see a nutritionist in case of her not gaining weight despite the best of your efforts.  I hope this helps.Take care and have a lovely day!"},{"Patient":"Hi A few small liver haemangiomas were found incidentally on an ultrasound scan a couple of years ago. I have no pain or anything.

Jaundice is symptom when you have elevated bilirubin levels and your skin and eyes zurn yellowish. Now,question is what was the cause of it. Well, good sign is that this is only transitory jaundice and obviosly caused by temporary biliray duct obstruction. This is most commonly caused by gallbladder stone and now it passed through and you have no symptoms.  Other causes of elevated LFT and bilirubin are hepatits,cirrhosis or metabolic disorderes but if your ultrasouns was normal u have no reasn to worry about I only suggest to avoid alcoohl for next 2 months.

By regulating your diet as well as through regular exercise you will be able to lose some weight. Once you begin losing weight you would also begin losing fat from your liver. This momentum of weight loss should inspire you to exercise harder and make yourself fitter. If your fatty liver is caused by alcohol intake or fat food intake you can stop these immediately or gradually to reduce the strain on your liver. Combine this with increased levels of physical activity for best effect.Omega 3 acids are present in some plants and especially in fish.

These enzymes usually stay abnormal for sometime even after the damaging substance such as alcohol, drugs, viral infections etc. have already gone out of your system. I am glad to know that you are not a drinker. I advice you to stay away from it. It is good to limit fatty, greasy or fried foods at least until the liver enzymes come back to normal. You do need to take a good B-Complex Vitamin with Vit-C. Protein supplements are good. We do need to find out what is causing the liver inflammation. You need to get Hepatitis-B and C blood tests to make sure you have not been exposed to these viruses with chronic inflammation. If you have been on any NSAID type of drugs (Non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs) , they can do this. Certain antibiotics belonging to the sulfa or tetracycline family also does this. Auto-immune liver disease , some metabolic or genetic enzyme deficiency disorders can affect the liver. You need to have all these ruled out if the liver enzymes stay high after 3-6 months. Discuss these with your doctor and take proper action. I wish you well."},{"Patient":"hi, my name is khalil from tunis and i have Disease name s volkmann It is the result of swelling of the body fat and fat, which cause such materials to the blockage of the arteries carrying of albumin is located swelling of the artery, which leads to the loss of the amount of albumin and Fattaminac","Doctor":"HelloThanks for posting at HCM. The symptoms you mentioned are hard to understand because of language issues. But I can get a raw idea that you are suffering from blockages in the arteries and swelling of the body. Blockages in arteries causes decreased blood supply to the organs causing disturbances in the normal functioning of these organs. Such blockages when they affect the heart and kidney can lead to fluid overload and accumulation of fluid in legs and face causing swelling. You also mentioned about albumin being low. Albumin is a protein and deficiney of albumin can also lead to swelling all over the body. The treatment for the condition includes diuretics to remove excess water from body and protein supplements with high protein diet. Also finding out the blockages by angiography and if significant blockages are there, treating them by either stenting or bypass can help get rid of the cause of the swelling. Wishing you good health. Regards"},{"Patient":"I had a laparoscopic removal of my appendix and gallbladder three weeks ago today.

About 2 months ago, I had valve replacement (mechanical). The surgeon also had to repair an aneurism and remove part of a LEAD WIRE left in my ascending aorta from a procedure done 16 years ago! I have had a few related problems since then. I was actually admitted back into the hospital for 8 days because the chest tube was removed prematurely so that they could send me home. Approximately 1000ccs of blood fluid had accumulated in my chest cavity. I was on coumadin so they had to take me off of it, drain the fluid (only 700 of the 1000ccs), and then place me back on coumadin and get my INR back up. I have been recuperating and doing well, but have recently in the last 4 or 5 days been feeling pain around my left lung again and running a low-grade fever from 99 to 101 for about a day or two. JUST TONIGHT, I started noticing that my heart would skip a beat every 5 to 15 seconds or so. I am wondering what could be causing this all of a sudden. Am I okay? And will I live through the night? The on-call doctor I spoke with tonight (McKinstry) was flippant about the whole thing and said I should just go to the office in the morning and get an EKG. He was rude and impatient and did not care. Can you provide me with a little peace of mind and perhaps a little insight as to my condition so that I may be able to sleep tonight?","Doctor":"Hellothanks for posting at HCM. I have gone through the history provided. Since you have a mechanical valve you are put on warfarin. Due to the chest tube placement and subsequent removal I suppose you have got a hemothorax which means blood in the outer covering of the lungs. So the fluid inside the lungs might as well be blood. This may have happened due to he instrumentation (initial placement of the best tune then removal and second 700 cc removal) and also because you are on coumadin. Other reason for the fluid collection can also be infection due to chest tune placement (foreign body inside chest cavity) . Since you got chest pain around your left lung and also fever, I suppose the fluid has collected again and might as well be infected. There is no emergency at present and you can go to see your doctor in the morning. I recommend a chest x ray to see if there is fluid collection again in the chest cavity. If there is persistent fluid, then it may be removed and sent for analysis to rule out infection and establish the cause of reaccumulation of fluid. phase revert with the chest x ray and pleural fluid reports.

Please visit a Physician /Gastroenterologist and examination followed by required investigations like complete liver function test, abdominal ultrasonography. Treatment depend on cause so no specific therapy is there for liver. In some cases these enzymes may take some time before they come back normal. We must remove cause to improve this, take care of diet and do not take alcohol if it is there. I am sure this is mild derangement of live and in few weeks time it will come back to normal.

Should I rely on the hida scan or the abdominal ultrasound? A month ago, I also have intense back pain on the right above the waist. They've done a ct scan and my kidney was fine and no kidney stones. Now they are blaming my gallbladder and wanted to remove it. But other surgeon that I asked for second opinion said she doesn't think the back pain is due to gallbladder so she's sending me to get MRI. It's fine if they remove my gallbladder but what about if it's not my gallbladder causing the back pain? I can't picture having back pain after the surgery. Do I request another hida scan to see if polyps inside gallbladder is growing? Please advise. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for contacting HCM with your quiery.HIDA scan is more for function of the gallbladder likeit's efficiency in contracting and emptying the bile intothe intestine. If you are having symptoms similar to agallstone attack with severe right upper quadrant abdominalpain, nausea, vomiting etc , the scan would be abnormal.For polyps or stones , ultrasound examination is more sensitive.But if the size of the polyp or stone is less than one centimeterin size , it may not show up well on ultrasound.Typical gallbladder pain may radiate to the right shoulder or theright upper back and usually this is not constant, more likespasms. From the numbers thhat you have given , you seem tohave abnormal gallbladder function. This may be associated withabnormal sphincter called the sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.If that is the case , gallbladder removal will help. Remember , yourliver continues to make bile and it comes to the intestinedirectly since the gallbladder which acts as a storage organ is nolonger there.If your back problem id due to disc problems of the spine you mayhave to that evaluated by an orthopedic doctor or a neurologyspecialist.I wish you the very best."},{"Patient":"Dear DoctorI have hepatomegaly with grade II fatty infilteration, 15.8 cm span of liver showing increased parenchymal echotexture suggestive of fatty changes, SGPT (ALT) 79 and SGOT(AST) 45 as per ultrasound and blodd test.

Fatty liver becomes quite common disease in modern society. This condition is caused by liver cells degeneration and liver overload by the fat. Fatty liver can be caused by alcohol intake, severe medicines intake or due to bad diet (fatty foods). Luckily it is reversible condition and it is possible to regenerate the liver. However, fatty liver can lead to liver cirrhosis which is not reversible. I suggest you to change your dietetic habits. Avoid fatty foods, spicy foods, soft drinks, alcohol. Increase fiber rich products, vegetables, fishes intake. You should also have checked blood level of cholesterol and triglycerides and if increased, statins should be prescribed by your doctor. Ultrasound and liver tests should be repeated in a 3 months or so. Hope this will help.

I have completely stopped having coconut , ground nut, almost avoided outside food, having daily oats, having fruits and salads as directed by doctor.

Is the food reason for getting this result or there may be some other issue?Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi friend, Welcome to Health Care Magic LDL (& non-HDL) is bad cholesterol – lower, the better. HDL is good cholesterol – higher, the better. In the absence of any other risk factor 100 is ideal. [130 was allowed before.] In the presence of ischemia, 70 should be the aim. Keep your weight to normal / even a little less Quit smoking, if you are a smoker Do regular EXERCISE – say walking or jogging - 30 minutes a day / at least 5 days in a week. Isometric exercise (like bull worker) is bad. Healthy FOOD is a must. Avoid saturated fats – coconut oil, palm oil, butter, ghee, full cream milk...Avoid junk foods in particular – French fries have palm oil / Pizza has cheese / Indian sweets are made in ghee.../ Change to Poly-un-saturated oil – like sun flower oil. / Include Mono-un-saturated oil – Olive oil. Repeat the test in 6 weeks. Cholesterol can still be high, in spite of diet and exercise – you need drugs; Because it is also manufactured in the liver – and that is determined by heredity. Statin is the first choice. Some start it straight away – even with normal levels, even without problems (Primary Prophylaxis).   Repeat the test in 6 weeks... adjust the dose and/or add another drug... Discuss with your doctor..

I had an attack in the middle of the night about four weeks ago which resulted in an emergency room visit. They ran all the necessary tests to rule out heart involvement and suspected a gallbladder issue. Since then,  I have had an ultra sound and a HIda scan. The ultra sound showed sludge in the gallbladder and the HIda scan confirmed low function at 20 percent. My symptoms include an intermittent dull ache in the upper abdomen, but mostly gastrointestinal issues. I am not overweight, adhere to a healthy, low fat diet, due to a heart disease history in my family. I don't smoke or drink alcohol, and make an effort to exercise regularly. My question is related to symptoms that may appear to be unrelated. I have had a chronic cough for several years now. Already have had a work up done to try to diagnose the problem. The results of a pulmonary function test showed that I have mild restrictive obstruction disease. Those symptoms seem to have worsened with my gallbladder problems. Now, finally my question. Could there be a link between my chronic coughing and the low functioning gallbladder I've been diagnosed with? Is surgery indicated?","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. There is no direct connection between gallbladder problem and lungs problem. But there is a great connection between gastric problems and asthma disease. You need to know that acid reflux disease is very often associated with an asthma. So it is possible that your abdominal pain which is thought to be from your gallbladder, can be caused by stomach disease. Stomach diseases usually give upper middle abdominal pain. It usually appears 1-2 hours after a meal. Nausea and vomiting can be also present. Acid reflux disease can lead to peptic ulcers. That is why, before any surgery, I suggest you to have gastroscopy performed and stomach condition checked. During this test, Helicobacter Pylori infection will be also checked and if present, antibiotics are necessary. If the gastroscopy will be negative, than you can decide to have gallbladder removal. In a meanwhile please avoid fatty foods, spicy foods, fried foods, alcohol, coffee. Hope this will help.

I became terrified because I've read via the internet that it can be a variety of the things. The most popular reason is the possibility that my bile in my gall bladder duct is obstructed by a stone(s) or might a serious liver problem.  I have been a drinker of alcohol for many years, have had a bad diet that has consisted of a lot of greasy fatty food, and have also been taking Prilosec for my acid reflux (for a very long time) due to this sedentary lifestyle. A year ago my doctor had found that my bilirubin levels had increased by a little, therefore, she was not concerned at all but that I should cut out my drinking, which I did but, only for 5 months.  Fast forward to one year later and this happens; I immediately call my doctor to tell her what occured but she told me that she wasn't very concerned or worried because I didn't display any abdominal pain, black tarried stool or brown colored urine and no other accompanying symptoms, and she said that it was possible that my diet's the culprit.  She also said that if I'm really concerned that I should set up an appointment for blood work but to not be worried. It is now the fourth week, and I have changed my entire diet for the better. So, far my stools are back to normal. No pale stools. No nothing. Can someone with experience shed some light as to what might have happened to me that day? I am still a bit nervous. Is this reversible? Why would my doc say she isn't worried about this? Why is it that I should be worried ONLY if I have abdominal pain, dark urine, or jaundice? Please help!","Doctor":"Hello, bpalas, Thank you for contacting HCM with your quiery. I am glad that you admit abusing alcohol and I hope you are completely staying away from it. If you already have signs of liver damage from alcohol , this is the first step. Alcohol can cause what is called fatty liver where liver cells are loaded with fat and they can't function properly. If a person continues to drink , then there is progression to liver cirrhosis which is severe scarring of the liver leading to liver failure, coma and death. There are also lots of complications such as bleeding from ruptured venlarged veins in the sophagus and stomach, build up of fluid in the abdomen and swelling of the legs and feet etc. You mention pale stool and your internet search showed you what the causes are. Yes, bile duct obstruction or blockage from gallstone or stricture from inflammation can lead to this. Stool is usually chalky in color due to lack of bile. Sometimes, the blockage can be inside the liver , the smaller channels that bring the bile to the gallbladder. That can happen with liver disease. I would suggest that you get a complete set of blood tests, including blood count, liver panel, and also a sonogram of the liver and gallbladder. Eat a healthy meal with whole grain cereals, nuts, fresh fruits,vegetables and plenty of fluids. Excercise regularly at least three times a week. I also want you to take a good super B-Complex tablet daily along with Vit-C 1000 mg. daily. Hope this helps you.

Thank you for the query. Pale stools are caused by lack of bile secretion to the intestines. In normal condition, bile gets from bile ducts to the duodenum and gets digested by bacteria. This digestion causes stool color. When there is no bile secretion to the stool, it becomes pale. So the most probable reason of pale stool is bile ducts obstruction. You should also get dark urine and skin itching. Such bile obstruction can be caused by gallstones, pancreas cancer, liver cancer. I suggest you to have some tests done. Blood work, liver tests (AST,ALT,GGTP,AP), amylase, bilirubin, abdominal ultrasound should be done at first. If GGTP and AP will be elevated, ERCP procedure should be performed. Hope this will help.

Your BP is definitely high hence your doctor has doubled your enalapril dose. You have to wait for at least two weeks for the blood pressure to be under control.
