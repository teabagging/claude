I am trying to decifer whether I am pregnant or if my period is just late - my last period was dec. 17-21. my boyfriend and i had sex a few times during the first week of january; never more than once and we always use protection. he actually only ejaculated during sex one out of the 3 times we did, the other two he did not finish and he actually masturbated to finish. i was suppose to have started my period on the 18th of january. i realize that high stress can play a big part in a late or missed period. just after my last period i was home for the holidays and lots of arguing was going on the whole time [i actually broke down crying one night], and then on the 11th i was actually in a car accident - we have had really bad snow and i was driving down a hill and actually slid off the road and hit a telephone pole [this has never happened before and i was in shock for at least a day]. a few days after the accident my mom called and was asking me if i had started my period or not, and got me freaked out because she started telling me i should have started days before that, and thus my boyfriend and i started freaking out about the possibility of me being pregnant. there has been a LOT of fighting between my boyfriend and i because we are both so afraid that i am pregnant [its not something i would be looking forward to right now] and so there has been an extreme level of stress in that regard. i took the clear blue digital pregnancy test on the day i was originally suppose to start my period [the 18th] and it said i was \\"not pregnant\\".

First, I would say that menstruation days are not the days when you have to search for a pregnancy because the chances are really low.

If you have more 1 year that are looking for a baby regularly, you have to do a consult with your gynecologist.

I have a normal 28 days period but last two months a had a 19 days period and this month it was 24 days. i feel nauseous most time. what do i expect. can i conceive naturally with this development?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First of all, your having symptoms of chronic nausea has no effect on trying to get pregnant.However, your age is a factor to be considered.  Many women can get pregnant in their 40's but the overall fertility rate is decreased.  There is no way to know if you have the ability to conceive in advance without actually trying to get pregnant.  However, the majority of women will conceive within one year with regular (at least every 2-3 days) intercourse from the time their period finishes or day 7 of their cycle (whichever comes first) until they start to develop premenstrual symptoms.So yes, it is possible for you to become pregnant, however I would recommend evaluation by a fertility doctor if you have not conceived within 6 months.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor I was spending some good time with my bf at hotel where we didn t had sex but my bf touched my vagina with dried sperm hands.

If you are not pregnant, you should get withdrawal bleeding within 4-7 days  after consuming the required adequate dosage of Duphaston. If even after Duphaston you have not got the withdrawal bleeding even after 8 days, consider the following possibilities: 1. You may be pregnant. Please perform pregnancy test on the overnight first morning urine sample. By this time, the test results are reliable. 2. You might have taken Duphaston in insufficient dosage and/or for less  number of days. Please get the schedule confirmed from your Gynaecologist. Duphaston for only one day will not cause desired withdrawal bleeding. Later, you will have to report to a Gynaecologist for management of PCOS. PCOS is characterised by irregular menses with infertility. I hope this will help you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I am a 29 year old, diagnosed with PCOS, and have irregular menses.Been trying to conceive and carried out an IUI procedure recently after a basl temperature drop- sign of Ovulation.Usually when i take Primolut,it induces bleeding.But my Doc prescribed it for Day 16-25 of period.Is it safe even after IUI procedure @ day 14?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, If you are a case of PCOS, you should not go for IUI empirically. Just do not go by temperature changes in the Basal Body Temperature Chart; some other relevant information is important and required before attempting any Artificial Reproductory Technique like IUI. In patients with regular menstrual cycle, day of ovulation is 14 days before the expected menstrual cycle. However, since you are a PCOS case, your menses must be irregular. Hence, better not rely on day 14 of the cycle. I would advise you to go for ultrasonography ovulation monitoring. It will help following way: 1. It will precisely detect the day of ovulation when you can go for Intrauterine Insemination (IUI). 2. It will inform us about the size of the follicle when it ruptured to release the egg. Follicles of size between 18 mm to 21 mm release the healthiest eggs having good chances of successful pregnancy. 3. If the eggs are not getting released naturally (which is characteristic of PCOS), your Gynaecologist can plan induction of ovulation by some medicines like Clomiphene citrate or HMG/HCG combination and then plan IUI accordingly. May be you might require Metformin or Myo Inositol as an adjuvant therapy. 4. Ultrasonography will inform us about the development of the uterine cavity lining (endometrium). Endometrium of thickness between 9 mm to 14 mm  is most conducive for implantation of fertilized egg. If the endometrium is thin, your IUI may go waste. Hence, please submit yourself for ovulation monitoring from by Ultrasonography day 9 of the cycle  and then plan for IUI.Please do not take Primolut pills for regularizing the menses; they may interfere with the egg release. Ovulation induction medicines will regularise your menses along with the induction of ovulation. Please report to some Infertility Consultant. I hope you got the message.

Having menstrual cramps for past 3 days. Is it a sign of pregnancy and I don t want to get pregnant again . Wat can I do to get my periods at this stage to avoid pregnancy. Pls help with ur suggestion.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,During lactational phase, though the periods have started, they may be irregular and so is the egg release. Hence you cannot rely on safe period. Even though he did not ejaculate in the vagina, usually pre-ejaculation secretions (precum) does get deposited in vagina unknowingly. Precum contains some sperms in it which can cause pregnancy. I would not give importance to the menstrual cramps. May be you might get menses in few days. To determine the possibility of pregnancy, the best and quickest option for you is to opt for Beta hCG test on the blood 10 days after the incidence of unprotected sex. Alternatively you may wait for 21 days after unprotected sex and perform pregnancy test on the overnight first morning urine sample; earlier this test may report false negative results.  If you are not pregnant, you can take some progesterone preparation like Deviry for 5 days or Oestrogen + Progesterone combination like EP Forte for 2 days. 4-7 days later you will get withdrawal bleeding. If you are pregnant, you can terminate the pregnancy by medicines upto 9 weeks of gestation.

You seem to have missed your period. All the other cardinal symptoms appear about a week to 10 days after missing a period. They are :1. Nausea and vomiting with pica : you are having these2. Frequency of urinations : You seem to experience this also. 3. Breast symptoms: Engorgement with tenderness, dark discolouration of nipples & areola with areolar widening & Montgomery's tubercles under the areola and secretions from the nipple. You seem to have some of them. Stomach ache cannot be attributed to pregnancy. Some carminative like soda and antacid might give you relief from it. Considering all the symptoms, the possibility of pregnancy is quite high. You can confirm the diagnosis by:1. Pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample a week after missing a period; earlier it may report false negative. 2. Beta hCG test on blood: Values more than 25 mIU/ml are diagnostic of pregnancy while in non-pregnant state, the vales remain under 5 mIU/ml. I hope this will clarify your doubts.

To find out the duration of your pregnancy when you are not sure about the date of your last menstrual period, you have following easy options:1. Report to an Obstetrician. By clinical examination, he/she can estimate the duration of your pregnancy. 2. Get ultrasonography done. By the size of baby, period of gestation (age of the baby) can be concluded. In any method, there is variation by a week or so, which does not matter for management of pregnancy.The delivery may take place anywhere between three weeks earlier to one week later than estimated due date of delivery.

Naturally her periods comes 13th ..but periods till now not come.... Sir my question is why periods till now not come??? is she get pregnent??  sir plesase ans on it... We are very worried...so please ans on it.....","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, You have taken hasty steps after the intercourse and have landed into a stressful situation. The egg is released 14 days prior to the next menses. Egg has a life of 24 hours and the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence, a period of about a week is a fertile window. In short, during menstrual flow, there is no egg present and hence there is no possibility of conception. So there was no necessity of any protection by Unwanted 72 pills. You have given her Unwanted 72 pill. This pill has following after effects:1. There may be some bleeding a few days after the pills. 2. The following period may get delayed by about a week or so. So there is no reason to get worried about delayed menses. Wait patiently and she will get the menses (Provided you did not have any other incidence of unprotected intercourse during the cycle). One more word of caution : Blood is a very good medium for pathogenic organisms; hence there is a great risk of infection if you perform sexual intercourse during the bleeding phase of menstrual cycle. Please avoid it. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I had partial sex with my gf...i insertex my penis half inside n than pulled back within 15 sec...it has been 10 days n we didnt use protection nor pills...m sure i didnt ejaculated inside since it was there for very short period n i didnt feel anything coming out...she is getting late for her periods n we had pregnancy test on 11th day after sex the test was negative..what are the chnaces n plz tell me when to test again","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Even though you did not ejaculate inside her vagina, the possibility of deposition of pre-ejaculation secretions (precum) cannot be ruled out since it is deposited unknowingly. Precum does contain some sperms which have potency to fertilize the ovum. Moreover, when the penis had entered halfway inside the vagina, it is penetrative sex. Pregnancy test on the urine 11 days after unprotected intercourse is too early to perform. It gives reliable results usually after about 3 weeks of conception. So to find out her pregnancy status, you have following options: 1. Submit her blood for Beta hCG test 10 days after the last unprotected sexual intercourse. 2. Since she has missed her periods, perform pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample a week after missed period; earlier, the test may report false negative results. I hope this helps you in this situation. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I debsmita kundu. I am 31 years . About 2 years ago I have get pregnant but it miscarriage. So at that time i am trying to get pregnant. Thyroid level is normal. For my doctor suggestion everyday i am taking Folinext tablets and after menstruation days 3 i am taking ovofar 100 tablets. For pregnant i can take Ebexid tablet.","Doctor":"Dear Debsmita,I do empathize your situation due to repeated abortions. I would have appreciated had you mentioned the period of abortions - how many weeks pregnancy. The pregnancies which get aborted under 6 weeks of pregnancy are usually due to chromosomal abnormalities for which there is practically no remedy. You should get chromosomal study of both of you done. Sometimes there could be deficit in placental or chorionic hormones leading to abortions. It can be managed by Progestational medicines or hCG. If the pregnancy gets aborted after 3 months of gestation, you may be having weak mouth of the uterus which needs reinforcement by putting a stitch. Ultrasonography can detect such condition. In fact there are many conditions which can lead to repeated abortion. Please report to an Obstetrician and get investigated thoroughly before you attempt your next pregnant.When your Thyroid function tests are within normal limits, there is no necessity of taking Ebexid.  When you can conceive naturally, what is the need of Ovofar tablets? They are Clomiphene citrate tablets which help release of eggs from ovaries. These tablets will not have any effect in preventing your abortions. Please do not take any empirical nor irrational treatment. Report to a Good Gynaecologist. I hope you got the message.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi, I had sex on last month 26th.

Please do the need..","Doctor":"Hello dearI understand your concernAs you did sex in the fertile phase of the period, there is high chance of the pregnancy.Pregnancy test will give positive result 8-10 days after the missed the period.So I will advise you to repeat the test once your period is delayed by the 8-10 days.Do urine pregnancy test with early overnight first morning urine sample.You can also go for blood HCG test. It will detect the pregnancy earlier then urine pregnancy test and more accurate.Hope this may help youContact HCM for further health queryBest regardsDr. Sagar"},{"Patient":"hello doc., i am 25 yrs f., and i m married 6 months, after marriage my periods are irregular and i ve consulted about this and found that there is a pcos, and using metformin for the past 1 month, and this month also my periods is getting late and my doctor advised me to take registron, after a home pregnancy test, today i ve taken the HPT and the result was negative. and i ve taken the registron tablet this morning, i am trying to get pregnant, can you suggest me to get pregnant soon apart from the other issues.","Doctor":"Hello dearI understand your concernPCOS cause hormonal imbalance, anovulation that cause infertility.First you have to regularize the period by usingProgesterone pill like regestrone or krimson 35Metformin and clomiphene citrate can be used to induce the ovulation.You can also add FSH analogue to increase the fertilityYou have to use treatment for at least 6 months to increase the cahnce of the pregnancy.Reduce 10-12 % weight if you are obese.Drink plenty of water and do regular exercise.Avoid excessive sweet and take small frequent meal rather than large meal.Hope this may help youContact HCM for further health queryBest regardsDr. Sagar"},{"Patient":"Hello, I want to know that either pregnancy happens in dates or not?

He has been taking this pain medication for one month. We are trying to conceive our second baby. Will this medication afect the fetus? Or the health of the baby? Or can it bring birth defects? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.First of all, there is no medication that can be taken by the father that has any way to get into your system or a baby if you conceive.  Medications can only affect a fetus if you take it while pregnant.The only issue is that certain medications may decrease a man's sperm count and affect fertility, however pain medications like Oxycodone do not have this effect.So there is no reason for you to worry about conceiving while taking this medication.  The best way you can prepare for a healthy pregnancy is to follow a well-balanced diet, limit alcohol consumption and avoid cigarette smoke, and take a daily prenatal vitamin or folic acid, as folic acid supplements in early pregnancy helps to prevent certain types of birth defects.I hope this answers your question and best wishes for your upcoming pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"My boyfriend and I are sexually active.

Whatever narration of your sex act that you have stated in your query,there is no chance of you getting pregnant.Spillage of sperms in and around the vagina is needed for pregnancy to occur. Also, if this spillage occurs during the fertile period of the cycle, means in a woman with regular cycle between day 10 to 20 of the cycle; then only there is chance of pregnancy.3.

Your husband will help you to get through the difficulties of intercourse. Of course you can use lubricants agents to ease the penetration.Second, you should have at least 1 year regular sexual activity to worry about conceiving. Of course that I would recommend you to try because until 35 years old, is thought that ovarian reserve and ovarian response is the best.

I have a regular menstrual cycle of 28 days. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi, your pregnancy depends on the time of your ovulation.Ideally for a normal cycle of 28 days, the ovulation would occur somewhere around 14th day. Let me stress this is not the thumb rule, it is generally around this day in a normal cycle of 28 days. The confirmation can only be done by noting the daily morning body temperature and different tests.So, in a normal 28 days cycle, if we assume that the lady ovulated on 14th day, then 12th to 17th day are the fertile period wherein there are chances of conceiving. Rest are termed as safe periods.In your case, 8th day seem to be unlikely but nothing can be said for sure as the life span of sperms are two days, so if you happen to ovulate on 10th day then there could be a possibility of you conceiving. So everything depends on your day of ovulation.Hope this answers your query.Thank you and take very good care of yourself."},{"Patient":"my period was late 6 days. now that its on im experiencing painful cramps and loose stools (not often), which isnt normal for me. my cycle isnt heavy at all. i was wondering if i could be pregnant even though my cycle came?. ive also taking 3 tests early on but they were negative.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.When your period is late, the blood and tissue that normally is passed with menstruation has longer to build up within your uterus, which usualy will give you a heavier, crampier period.Secondly, the substances that your body secretes during menstruation to make your uterus contract, called prostaglandins, also accumulate to a higher level.  Prostaglandins have the side effect of making your intestines contract as well, and many women experience diarrhea during a heavy and painful period for that reason.So there is no reason to suspect that these symptoms are due to pregnancy if your pregnancy test is negative, as they are typical for a delayed menstrual cycle.To help reduce the cramping and diarrhea, taking an anti-inflammatory pain reliever like aspirin, ibuprofen or naproxen will reduce prostaglandin release and ease these symptoms for you.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"It s been 69 days since my last period, I am not pregnant as I have taken 5 pregnancy tests. I am 30 years old and have been trying to conceive for the past 5 months. I came off the contraceptive pill in October 2014. Could you let me know what tests I should be asking for when I see my doctor?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hoop I can help you today.In some women, especially if they have been on birth control pills for a long time, it can take even up to a year to resume normal hormone cycling, especially if they had irregular periods before starting the pill or very light periods. Furthermore- 80 percent of couples will conceive within one year- and infertility is defined by inability to conceive after trying for a year.I know it is hard to be patient, but most of the time it just takes more time for your regular cycle to resume.  In general, however, it is not a bad idea to see your doctor if you have not resumed menstruation within 6 months of stopping the pill, because there can be medical causes as well that can cause women to have irregular cycles or not menstruate.An adequate evaluation for amenorrhea (not getting your period), assuming you are not pregnant should include:TSH (a test for thyroid disease)Prolactin (the hormone that makes breast milk- can be caused by some tumors)FSH (shows how hard your ovaries are working to make estrogen)Estrogen levels (to see if you are making estrogen)and possibly LH (a hormone that should not be higher than your FSH level)Your doctor may also recommend your partner get his sperm evaluated as well, as 50 percent of the time a male factor can be involved in infertility as well.But again, I suggest waiting 6 months before having a hormonal evaluation as post-pill amenorrhea (the term for the syndrome of not getting your period after you stop the pill) is not unusual and most of the time gets better by itself within 6 months.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and I wish you the best of luck conceiving,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi I m 22 year old I had a implanon for 4 years nd had put a new one in April 2013 nd had it removed on June 5th 2014 what I wanna know is can I fell pregnant straight away nd is their a chance I may have a miscarriage nd I have been also having weird symptoms like my belly seems to feel a bit tight at times seem to be weeing abit nd had a day of just spotting I had unprocected sex with my boyfriend on the weekend before my implanon was removed and all so afterwards","Doctor":"Hello and I hope I can help you today.First of all, I want to reassure you that it is not possible that you could have conceived if you had unprotected sex before your Implanon was removed.Implanon is nearly 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy while it is in place, and it takes time for you to ovulate again (at least 7-10 days) after it is removed.So if you only had unprotected sex immediately before and after your implant was removed, it is unlikely you could have conceived so quickly. Pregnancy symptoms vary widely between women, and many of the same symptoms we commonly associate with pregnancy such as nausea, bloating, breast tenderness, headaches and irregular bleeding can also happen from an irregular menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy. Many women have irregular periods after discontinuing a hormonal birth control method.So, I suggest you wait for your period, which should occur around 4 weeks after your Implanon removal, and if you miss your period, a urine pregnancy test will be accurate at this time.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Had a 3rd day Embryo transfer , with 2 embryos.

But you have to stay calm. The therapy that you are using is the right one. I would also recommend taking Folic Acid and Aspirin if you were my patient. The embryo transfer is the right one, your uterus is a better place for the embryo to continue growing. If you have serious cramping you may use a spasmolytic to calm down. You have to wait another 5 or 6 days to confirm your pregnancy with a blood bHCG. After you transfer the embryos, you can not be able to know what is happening between your embryos and your organism, so you have to wait a little bit further. Cases with PCOS have minor chances to have OHSS because the quality of the eggs is supposed to be not very good, bur the doctors have to use large amount of medication due to the resistance of your ovary responding.Hope I have helped.Dr. Thano"},{"Patient":"Hi.

My husband and I had intercourse on 12th Jan thinking that I am closer to my next period and cant get pregnant. I didnt get periods at all, I had unprotected sex on 19th of Jan and started taking regestrone from 20th onwards and stopped after taking 4 tablets looking at the side effects of the tablet in the internet.Today i saw a yellowish discharge on the tissue paper after passing urine. My question is, is there a chance of getting pregnant as i took 4 regestrone after having unprotected intercourse?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Your unprotected intercourse on 19th Jan was well protected by 4 tablets of Regestrone taken within 24 hours. So this intercourse does not pause any threat of pregnancy. You may have some bleeding after few days and your menstruation may be delayed by few days to a week. However, you had one more unprotected intercourse on 12th Jan was not protected at all and hence this intercourse may result in pregnancy. You are not sure of the dates of menstruation. Moreover you have taken Regestrone pills which will delay your menses. So you cannot figure out whether you have missed your period or not. Hence, the options to detect your pregnancy status are:1. Perform Beta hCG test on the blood after 29th Jan. 2. Perform pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample after 10th of Feb. I hope this resolves your dilemma.

I am already delayed from my menstruation for a month. Note: i have polycystic ovary and i menstruation is irregular. seeking for help and advice on how to get pregnant. hope you can help me and answer my query.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is a complex dysfunction of multiple systems in the body. Irregular delayed menses and infertility is one aspect of it; the other being high insulin levels and high male hormone (androgen) levels. To have success in the management, comprehensive treatment should be taken. Ovamet is Clomiphene citrate which helps the ovaries release the eggs. You are taking the pills as per the prescribed timings. However, after ovament, egg release should be ascertained and the day should be located. This is done by Ultrasonography ovulation monitoring. It will show you the evidence of ovulation, will inform you about the size of the follicle before ovulating and also will inform you about the thickness of the endometrium. Knowledge about the day of ovulation helps to plan the sexual relations. Follicles between 18 mm and 21 mm size release the healthiest eggs having more success rate in terms of pregnancy. Endometrium of thickness between 9 mm and 14 mm is most conducive for implantation of fertilized ovum. If the eggs are not getting released in the proper size of the follicle, Inj. hCG will help this. If the endometrium is thinner, first get it well built by oestrogen treatment before you go for ovulation induction. Clomiphene is known to affect the endometrial growth adversely. If Clomiphene fails to induce ovulation, it may be supported by Inj. hCG. Medicines to lower the raised insulin levels help to release eggs. Metformin or Myo Inositol are useful in this aspect; the later is claimed to have better results. Clomiphene citrate is not advised to be taken for more than 6 months. If it fails, you will have to shift to HMG/hCG combination with the help of Infertility consultant. In PCOS, obesity is a classic symptom and needs to be controlled. Exercise and diet control will help you do that. You should try to maintain your BMI between 18 and 24. Please follow all the instructions of your consultant. Erratic treatment will not help you. I hope you get the message.

These pills also change the milliu interni of the uterus preventing the implantation. So even if you were ovulating, you are well protected. The after effects of these pills are:1. Some amount of bleeding few days after the consumption of the pill. It stops within few days. 2. The next following menses may be delayed by few days to a week.

If the test is performed too early, it may report weak positive. If the pregnancy is implanted somewhere outside the uterine cavity (ectopic pregnancy), also the test can be weak positive. To clarify the matter, please get ultrasonography done. If sac is seen within uterine cavity, it is normal pregnancy; otherwise it can be ectopic pregnancy. Such pregnancy does not grow and may rupture causing severe bleeding emergency requiring emergency surgical intervention with many units of blood transfusion. However, if diagnosed in unruptured state, it can be treated conservatively wioth medicines like Methotrexate. Please report to your Gynaecologist ASAP.

These medicines increase the stomach acidity and also cause nausea due to their metabolism in the liver. These things ultimately lead to indigestion and/or gastrointestinal upsets. This causes flutter like feeling you are having. To control the gastritis, please take some proton pump inhibitor acidity controlling medicines like Pantoprazole.

Most women have a 25-35 day cycle, so until you actually miss your period for October, there is no reason to assume you are pregnant.  The folic acid and zinc you are taking are just extra vitamins that provide health to a growing pregnancy; these should not affect or change your menstrual cycle or it's symptoms.If your period is late in October, you should purchase and perform an over-the-counter pregnancy test.  Modern pregnancy tests are very accurate and can be positive even 10 days after conception.If you do find out you are pregnant, there is nothing that needs to be done immediately as pregnancy is not a disease- it is a normal state for women in the reproductive phase of their lives.  So it is important only to keep taking your vitamins, get plenty of rest, eat a balanced diet and avoid alcohol, caffeine and drugs. If your period is mate but you are not pregnant, the delay in your cycle can have a number of causes, including hormonal imbalances, certain medical conditions like thyroid disease, and even the stress of worrying about pregnancy.  If you miss more than 2 months of your cycle (no bleeding for 3 months) and your pregnancy test is negative, you should see a physician for a hormonal evaluation.So in summary, a late menstrual cycle can be caused by pregnancy but there are other causes as well.  I suggest you perform a pregnancy test if you are late, and if it is negative, try to be patient and you will likely get it before another month goes by.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"What is the best way to get pregnant. We ve been trying hard for one year.. I am also under the care of an obgyne..and still not get one..I took medicines and some injections for my follicles..my husband s sperm count is very good and normal..I hope u can help me..thank u.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Since your husband's sperm count is very good, one issue is sorted out. Now considering failure to conceive for one year, you will have to undergo certain evaluations to assess your fertility capacity. 1. Evidence for Ovulation: Ovulation can easily be assessed by ultrasonography and home kit. However, initial evidence by ultrasonography has many advantages. It provides direct visual evidence of egg release. Moreover, we can see the size of the follicle before it released egg. Follicle of the size between 18 mm and 21 mm size produce healthiest eggs who have better possibility of successful pregnancy. Also it provides information about lining of the uterus (endometrium). Endometrium of thickness between 9 mm and 14 mm is most conducive for successful implantation of the fertilized ovum. Once you locate the day of ovulation, sexual activity can be planned on and around the day of egg release. Microscopic study of the endometrium in the second half of menstrual cycle also can provide evidence of ovulation. Hysteroscopy gives the visual impression of endometrium and then biopsy of the endometrium can be taken for microscopic study.  Hysteroscopy will also give information about any abnormalities, diseases or adhesions in the uterine cavity. Hormonal study like FSH, LH, Progesterone, Oestrogen and Prolactin can throw a light on the function of the genital system. 2. Patency of the reproduction tract can be assessed by Hysterosalpingography in which X-ray of the uterus and tubes is done after filling radio-opaque dye in the uterus. Laparoscopy also can give this information. Laparoscopy also provides information about the external appearance of the internal genital organs. If any issue is detected, it will have to be treated accordingly. If all the findings are within normal limits and still you fail to conceive, then it becomes an unexplained infertility when Artificial Reproductory Technique may have to be followed. Please report  to an Infertologist. I hope this should help you.

Now since it is more than a month that you have missed your period, pregnancy test on urine sample will provide you the evidence of pregnancy status. Even ultrasonography also can provide you a visual evidence of the same. If you are pregnant, and it is unwanted pregnancy, you can opt for medical termination of pregnancy upto 9 weeks of gestation.

Periods are usually long about 10 days n suddenly on the 14th day of cycle a gush of blood when i woke up in the morning, (like what is experienced during a heavy period) with a bit of clot.

In PCOD the ovaries have multiple follicles and there is a difficulty in having a mature follicle, so you have to induce your ovulation. In this way, the doctor controls your cycle from outside as you have a irregular and long cycle. If you were my patient, I would start giving you Clomiphen Citrate, which is a pill used to induce ovulation. This tablets start with low doses and then are giving rising doses according to the follicle growth."},{"Patient":"Hello Doc! Please let me that conceiving process depends upon the male discharge into the female body only or male and female discharge at the same time results in pregnancy? Will the female discharge during the intercourse effects the pregnancy? Is it necessary or good or bad or neutral?","Doctor":"Hello! The conceiving process occurs when the ovum (female cell) and sperm (male cell) meet each other, merge and divide. So, the condition for this process to occur is having sexual contact. When the male ejaculate his semen inside your vagina, some of his sperm pass through the cervix and uterine cavity and reach your ovum at the level of the uterine tubes. Only one of this sperm is able to conceive the ovum and then the embryo is formed."},{"Patient":"I am 13 weeks post-partum, breastfeeding and supplementing as well. My fiancé and I has intercourse three days ago and he came inside me. I have not had my period and the moment it happen I felt flutters like swimmers and now I m having cramping. Could I be pregnant and when can I take a home test?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,If you are exclusively breast feeding your baby day and night, you have very good contraceptive protection; however, occasional cases of pregnancy in lactational amenorrhoea are known. However, the symptoms of pregnancy like feeling the movements of baby will not come so soon. Abdominal pains are not cardinal symptom of pregnancy.For confirmation of status, you have following options:1. Perform Beta hCG test on the blood 10 days after the incidence of unprotected sex. hCG Values above 25 mIU/ml are diagnostic of pregnancy; in nonpregnant sate, the values are under 5 mIU/ml.2. Perform pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine 3 weeks after the unprotected intercourse. Either of these tests will provide you reliable results though the former test is more reliable and sensitive. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I am 21, I am 5' 1\\" and 120lbs. I had been on the depo shot for 6 years with the last shot being over a year ago. I would like to get pregnant. My periods have been regular for months. I have intercourse about every other day. With no turn out. Last week I went to the doctor due to having some pain in my lower left abdomen all that they found was follicular cysts in both ovaries. Which the doctor did not seem to think that was why I was having the bad pain but was relieved at the results. I have many questions on the follicular cyst subject however what I am trying to get to is that I was due to get my period today and there is no sign of it. I did take a pregnancy test but that was late this afternoon and was not with the first morning urine and I was unable to hold my urine for four hours could I still be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Let me start from the end. Performing a pregnancy test on the day you have missed your period is too early. These tests report reliable results about a week after missed period; done too early may report false negative results. If you are so keen on having the reliable results so early, you may opt for Beta hCG test which gives reliable results even few days before missing a period. Else, wait for about a week and repeat the test on overnight morning first urine sample. Urgency for urination though is one of the symptom of early pregnancy, it usually appears about 10 days after missed period. Your both ovaries are showing follicular cysts and you are facing problem in conception. It is likely that you may be having Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. However, your BMI is 22.7, which is within normal limits. Please get your blood examined for FSH, LH, Prolactin, Oestrogen and Progesterone. This will give us any evidence of PCOS. Also, submit yourself for ovulation monitoring by ultrasonography. If you are ovulating, plan your intercourse on and around the date of ovulation. If you are not ovulating, you will have to take some medicines like Clomiphene citrate or HMG/hCG for induction of ovulation. In fact since your ovaries contain so many follicular cysts, hCG injection might help you. Please report to your Gynaecologist and/or Infertility consultant. I hope this provides you initial guidelines.

Since you had accidently deposited your precum in her vagina, she has taken a good step in taking I-pill.I-pill has following after-effects:1. Few days after consuming the pill, some amount of bleeding may show. Nothing to worry about. 2. The following menses get delayed by few days to a week. Eventually, they do appear.

Yesterday also dr checked that egg is well raptured..so is there any chance to get pregnant.. We had not done sex after injection given by dr.pl help and suggest.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,In fact the egg is not ruptured; it is the follicle that ruptures releasing an egg in it. Egg has life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. So sexual relation on and around the day of egg release do have good chances of conception. You should have continued to have sex even after the injection given to you for follicular rupture; this practice further increases probability of healthy pregnancy. So if this cycle you do not conceive, modify your coital practice accordingly to increase the conception chances. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Yes, my husband and I are trying to conceive. We conceived in 2008 & lost the baby at 14 weeks with a miscarriage. Since then, we have tried to get pregnant and learned April this year, I have premature ovarian failure with very little egg reserve left. Also, I just turned 40. All those factors are working against us.  I've been on clomid for 3 cyles, and the last 2 months had mature follicles. Both times did not get pregnant. We decided to have my husband do a seamen analysis to see if things were ok in that area. He took 2 tests one month apart. There are 2 factors less than the desired level. My question is, could these 2 things be contributing to us not getting pregnant. His concentration was 6.2 out of desired 15 , and the motility was 33 out of desired 40.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,At the age past 40, the fertility does go down; however, with proper monitoring and scientific approach, pregnancy is not impossible. Now let us start from the end of your query. Though a couple of parameters in your husband's semen report are somewhat substandard, they do not rule out the possibility of conception. You may have to go for some assisted reproductory technology like intrauterine insemination of so.I am more concerned about your ovarian reserve. On what basis you have been declared a case of premature ovarian failure; and if so how is it that are responding to clomiphene citrate by ovulation? Anyway, your ovarian reserve seems to be very poor. Hence I would advise you to monitor ovulation by ultrasonography. This will help assessing the endometrial growth also. Ovulation from the follicle between 18 mm to 21 mm gives best results. The endometrial thickness between 9mm to 14 mm at the time of ovulation (thus indirectly conception and implantation) is very conducive for successful implantation and pregnancy. So at the time of ovulation with such conditions, you may get intrauterine insemination done to increase the possibility of pregnancy. You may try this for 3 months (considering your age and ovarian condition) after which you might seriously think of in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. In this advice, I am presuming that you have tested the patency of your tubes and they are patent. If you have not tested, please get Hysterosalpingography and/or Laparoscopy done for the tubal assessment before you take any active intervention step. I hope this clarifies your doubts.

I have taken 4 pregnancy tests and all of them have been negative. What s going on? Any help would be amazing, I m really worried.","Doctor":"Hi. This bleeding disorder has happened because of the levornogstrel you have taken. First, you have done sexual intercourse just the day after you finished menstruation.

First of all I would like you to take some preconceptional exams before getting pregnant. These include some blood analyses and some vaginal analyses.

What are my chances to conceive naturally? and with IVF?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and here are your answers. 1. Tuberculosis of the pelvis is likely to affect the genital organs including the uterus. Since your fallopian tubes have been shown to be affected, it is possible that your endometrium also is affected. 2. As you are on ATT now, you should avoid pregnancy until the treatment is over. 3. Steroid treatment for NK cells is better avoided for the time as immunity is compromised with tuberculosis infection. Other modes of treatment may be considered if you are fit. 4. Taking all the above facts into consideration, I would ask you to think of IVF or surrogacy as natural conception chances are very low.

Your situation is a little bit delicate. You are 44 and you have menstrual delay for 6 months. Do you have hot flashes? The greatest possibility is that you may be in the perimenopause, which is the phase around menopause. Anyway, what would give an accurate answer regarding the desire of getting pregnant is a single test which is AMH (antiMullerian Hormone). It could tell us your current situation of the ovary. If you want to take clomid, first you need to have menstruations and you should try Progesteron to take them back."},{"Patient":"Sir I have one question that is..

I have been feeling very tired and sick.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,If even after 8 weeks from last menstrual period your urine pregnancy tests are negative, you are not pregnant. The delay in your period could be due to some hormonal imbalance - could be reproductive hormones or could be Thyroid dysfunction. Please get your blood examined for FSH, LH, Progesterone, Oestrogen, Prolactin, T3, T4 and TSH. Depending upon the values and the diagnosis, the treatment will have to be planned. Meanwhile, you may take some progestational preparation like Deviry for 5 days; 4-7 days later you will get withdrawal bleeding. Though missing a period is the cardinal symptom of pregnancy, pregnancy is not the only cause for missing a period. You have to get investigated to find out the cause of your delayed menses.

When this is done through Laparoscope, the damage to the tube and surrounding tissues is much less and the chances of pregnancy are better. Your previous pregnancies were natural. So there should not be any issue of egg production with you. You have been given progesterone which helps the stabilization of pregnancy. Ovacet contains Methylfolate, Myo-Inositol, Vitamin D3. These tablets are given for folic acid supplementation. It also helps good growth of chorionic tissue which binds the baby to mother's uterus. Try to find out about the patency of your reproductory tract - particularly tubes. Since you had ectopic pregnancy, probably only one of the tubes is likely to be patent. If that also is blocked then you will have to get the reconstructive surgery of the tube performed. Tubal patency can be assessed by Hysterosalpingography and/or Laparoscopy. If at least one tube is patent, please undergo ultrasonography for ovulation monitoring.  Plan your sexual relations on and around the day of ovulation. If the eggs are not getting released, you will have to take medicines like Clomiphene citrate or HMG/hCG. If you are putting on considerable weight (3 kg/month), please find out any evidence for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). Ultrasonography during ovulation monitoring can detect this. If it is detected, you will have to undergo comprehensive treatment with the advice of a Gynaecologist. Diet control and exercise will help you reduce the weight. I hope this helps you.

Usually, after discontinuing contraceptives, the fertility returns soon. Your blood groups are not responsible for your infertility. Please undergo following investigations:1. Evidence for egg release (ovulation): There are many tools available for this. Home ovulation detection kit can also inform you whether you ovulate or not; however, at least once, ultrasonographic evidence of ovulation is desirable. It will also inform the size of follicles before ovulation. Follicles of the size between 18 mm and 21 mm release healthy eggs having more possibility of successful pregnancy. Also endometrial thickness can be assessed by ultrasonography. Endometrium of thickness between 9 mm and 14 mm are most conducive for successful implantation of the fertilized egg. Microscopic study of the endometrium before the menstruation can inform you whether you are ovulating or not. Hormonal profile is also very useful in assessing the reproductory function, particularly ovulation. Anovulation can be tackled by induction of ovulation by Clomiphene citrate or HMG/hCG combination as per the indication. 2. Laparoscopy and/or Hysterosalpingography will inform about the patency of the reproductory tract. Former one can inform about the anatomical condition of the reproductory organs. Hysteroscopy can find out any intrauterine abnormality if present. 3. Husband's semen examination after four days abstinence for the sperm quantity and quality. If any pathology is found, it needs attention. However, if there is no abnormality, plan your intercourse on and around the day of ovulation. Still if there is no result, it becomes a case of unexplained infertility which can be managed by Artificial Reproductory Technique. Please report to your Gynaecologist and/or Infertility Specialist. I hope this provides you required guidance.

There are dysfunction of reproductory system (delayed menses and no egg formation), metabolic system (high insulin levels) and hormonal dysfunction (high male hormones) in PCOS. While treating for infertility, all these three systems have to be addressed. Because the follicles do not rupture and release eggs, the ovaries form multiple cysts; hence Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. For egg release (induction of ovulation), some medicines are required. Clomiphene citrate is given initially. Along with it, Metformin is also given which helps control the raised insulin. Now a days, instead of Metformin, Myo-Inocitol is being tried which along with insulin levels brings down the male hormones levels also. Myo Inocitol is claimed to give better results as far as the conception is concerned. Clomiphene citrate should not be tried for more than 6 months. If it fails, then HMG/hCG combination is given to induce the ovulation. If both these do not offer success, Laparoscopic drilling of the ovaries also may be tried. Weight gain is another problem in PCOS. To treat PCOS and achieve fertility, weight reduction programme is very essential. BMI should be maintained between 18 and 24.9. For weight reduction, high protein and low carbohydrate low fat diet along with exercises is advised. Please calculate your BMI based on your height and weight and then take the action accordingly. You had previous two unsuccessful pregnancies. So, it seems that you have developed PCOS after the last pregnancy. Stress also is one of the precipitating factor for PCOS. I hope this helps you planning your further management of infertility due to PCOS.

I went on holiday for the past 7 days and left them at home. On the 5th day of the holiday, had unprotected sex with my boyfriend. What should I do? Could there be a chance of pregnancy?","Doctor":"Dear Chelsea,Cerezette is a Progesterone only contraceptive pill containing 75 microgram Desogestrel in it. These pills need be taken every day without break for 28 days every cycle for its successful action. Since you have dropped the pills for 7 days and had sexual relations on the 5th day of the dropped pills, you do stand the possibility of pregnancy due to this intercourse. To protect this intercourse from pregnancy, you could have taken Plan B post-coital emergency contraceptive pill within 72 hours of the intercourse. If that period is passed, you have to look for the possibility of pregnancy now. You have following options:1. Wait for the periods. If you miss them, perform pregnancy test on the overnight first morning urine sample about a week after missed period; earlier these tests may report false negative. Alternatively2. Get Beta hCG test done on your blood 10 days after the incidence of last unprotected intercourse. Values above 25 mIU/ml are diagnostic of pregnancy while values in non-pregnant sate are less than 5 mIU/ml.If any of these tests suggests that you are pregnant; and if this is unwanted pregnancy, you can opt of medical termination of pregnancy upto 9 weeks of gestation with the advice and prescription of a Gynaecologist.

Any cycle beyond these limits is defined in the text books as irregular cycle. One day beyond the text book definition may not be a hopeless situation. If you are releasing your eggs regularly, you can conceive.  The best way to get the evidence of ovulation is to go for ovulation monitoring. Though ovulation monitoring home kits are available, I would advice you to go for ultrasonography for the first few evidence of ovulation. Ovulation occurs 14 days before next expected menses. So in your case, it would be day 21 of the cycle. Subject yourself for ultrasonography for ovulation monitoring from day 17 onwards. Do this for consecutive 3 months. If you get the evidence of ovulation, you have all the possibilities of pregnancy. If you are not ovulating, you will have to undergo complete hormonal profile - Thyroid and reproductory - to assess the cause behind it. So better report to a Gynaecologist in such case.

All the medicines which you have mentioned (except progesterone cream) are supporting medicines. Please continue the supplementary medicines, even after conception also. Please do not discontinue them, the only option to it being  progesterone cream. You can take your Gynaecologist's advise regarding it. When you see the evidence of egg release (ovulation) on the kit, you should have sexual relations. Then onwards, have daily or alternate day intercourse for next 4 days. The egg has life of 24 hours only while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence, you may start the sexual relations every alternate day when you have the indication of impending ovulation.

If you find out that your right tube is open, you certainly could conceive on your own.  Many women with only one tube and ovary are able to get pregnant successfully.If it turns out that your right tube is blocked also, pregnancy can be achieved with in vitro fertilization which can be performed by a fertility specialist.So in summary- the results of the HSG test will be able to tell you definitely if you are able to conceive again.

We had a sex in today morning. What is a chances of my pregnany.when my follicule get rupture n when to intimate plz suggest","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Usually, after hCG injection, the follicle ruptures within 24 hours. You have noticed that the follicle was unruptured at 9:00 am; however at 11:00 am, you had some abdominal cramps. It is very likely that this pain was due to egg release (ovulation). It may sometimes be associated with little bleeding also. This is known as Mittelschmerz. The size of the follicle just before the ovulation was 20.5 mm. This is most ideal size of the follicle. Follicles of size between 18 mm and 21 mm produce most healthy eggs which have best pregnancy chances. You had intercourse at the time of ovulation. Sexual relations on the day of ovulation and then at least every alternate day are very productive in terms of pregnancy. You may confirm the rupture of follicle by ultrasonography. Wait for your menses. If you miss them, perform pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample after a week; done earlier, the results may be false negative. Alternatively you may opt for Beta hCG test 10 days after your intercourse. Then report to your Gynaecologist. I hope this helps you.

If the quality of your embryos is good but they fail to get implanted successfully, please find out the quality of your endometrium. Ultrasonography will reveal the endometrial thickness. Endometrium of thickness between 9 mm and 14 mm is most conducive for implantation of fertilised ovum (embryo). If your endometrium is thinner, please get it well built by some oestrogen therapy before you attempt next IVF. At this stage, endometrial evaluation appears to be the key factor in your case.

The hormonal tests will likely include (at a minimum) a serum FSH, LH, TSH and Prolactin level. The test to evaluate the fallopian tubes is called a hysterosalpingogram, or HSG.For your husband, he does not need to see a specialist but he should have his sperm count checked.  His primary physician can recommend a laboratory where he can do the test.A general OBGYN can order these tests for you and review your husband's semen analysis results.  If you require treatment, you may be referred to a fertility specialist.

By this he has not instilled some amount of semen in the vagina. Just touching vagina from outside the vagina should not be an issue of threat of pregnancy. To cause pregnancy, semen has to be injected inside the vagina or even at the introits. Then sperms in the semen can swim towards the egg through the uterus and tubes. I feel he should not be concerned about pregnancy. Please tell her also to get rid of the stress as stress itself can delay the menses. Let her wait expectantly for the menses to appear on time. If at all the menses are delayed, then she may think of performing pregnancy test on urine 8-10 days after the missed period; done earlier, these tests may report false negative results. Alternatively, she may opt for Beta hCG test which can give reliable results even few days before missed period. If the pregnancy test reports positive, she can terminate the pregnancy by medicines. However, I feel, this should not happen and she will get her menses in time.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi, I was wearign underwear and my boyfriend was wearing his underpants and slacks.

The day on which had sex is fairly near the Fertile Period which is about a week around the day of ovulation. However, you have delayed menses for a week. So you have to find any evidence for pregnancy. I would advise you to confirm the status of pregnancy by pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample. Alternatively, you may opt for Beta hCG test. Either of these test will give you the evidence of pregnancy. Then you may take further decision. You have milky discharge from vagina. You may be having some vaginal infection like Trichomona or Yeast. The former is treated with Metronidazole while the later by antifungal medicines.

If so, all your endometrium is completely destroyed. Endometrium is necessary for the implantation of the fertilized egg. So if there is no endometrium, pregnancy is not possible. Even though the tubal blocks can be reopened by tubal recanalization, the pregnancy would not be possible for the absence of endometrium. You may opt for adoption of child. This would give you additional child and the orphan child also will have parents. I am sure you need a more detailed discussion on this issue. You may ask me a Direct question on this forum for it.

Now the doctor has asked me to get the next scanning done on 29.12.2011 and said that if the follicular size is >= 0.67 cms then take Injection Ovumax 5000 units SC.Please advise what does this indicate.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,The egg is inside the follicle. Immediately after menstruation, the follicle and the egg inside are very small in size. Day by day, they go on increasing in size. About 14 days prior to the next menses the egg is released from the follicle. Just before the egg release (ovulation), the follicle attains the size between 18 mm and 21 mm. Endometrium is lining of the uterus. During menstruation its outer layers get shed off when it becomes very thin. Day by day, it also starts becoming thicker. A healthy endometrium is between 9 mm and 14 mm thickness at the time of ovulation.You have mentioned the size of follicle and thickness of endometrium, which are too low; however it is not clear these sizes are on which day of the cycle. If these measurements are at or around the ovulation, they are too low. You will need some medicine to increase the size of the follicle. As the follicle grows in size, endometrium also will become thicker. However, Ovumax is an Injection which contains Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) hormone. This injection is given to induce ovulation from a well grown follicle. It would not help the growth of the follicle. For growth of the follicle, Inj. HMG has to be given. Clomiphene citrate also may be of use; however, it may hider the growth of the endometrium.I would not advise you to go for these or such injections before you get some of your investigations done which will try to point out the deficiency. Get your blood examined for FSH, LH and AMH. Based on there levels, further management should be planned. Please report to an Infertility Consultant for expert and scientific management.I hope you got the required guidance.

In fact, contraceptive pills, as the name suggests will prevent pregnancy. If you are keen on conceiving, you should manage the PCOS comprehensively. PCOS is a complex disorder of multi-systemic dysfunction; the main being reproductory system, carbohydrate metabolism and sex hormones. It is therefore characterized by delayed heavy menses with non-release of the eggs, high insulin levels and high male hormone levels. For attaining the fertility, all these three aspects have to be managed. The main symptoms of PCOS are menstrual irregularities, infertility, obesity, hair on unwanted areas like face, chest, abdomen, legs, etc.. One of the main causes responsible for PCOS is obesity, particularly fat deposition around the waist. Clomiphene citrate or HMG/hCG combination are used to achieve the ovulation. However, high insulin levels and high male hormone levels may hamper the success of these medicines. Therefore, Tab. Metformin is added to this treatment which can lower the insulin levels. Myo Inositol is supposed to control insulin levels more effectively; moreover it can control male hormone levels also. Hence, some claim more success to this medicine. Reduction in weight is equally important in management of PCOS. Daily caloric intake upto 1000 to 1500 calories through high protein and low carbohydrate and low fat diet can effectively bring down the weight. Along with, daily exercise is very important. Please calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI). You should maintain it between 18 and 24.9. PCOS needs addressing all the aspects comprehensively. I would advise you to consult an Infertility Specialist for the management of your Infertility. I hope this helps you.

Since your Tubes are patent, semen examination is normal and the ovulation is occurring, the advice has got definite directives. However, if you are ovulating normally, I wonder why you are put on Letrazol which is to help the ovulation. Now my suggestions are :1. Get ultrasonography done for ovulation monitoring. This will be done from day 9 of the cycle till the ovulation occurs. It will provide you the information as when the ovulation is taking place and what is the size of follicle when ovulation takes place. Egg released from the follicle between 18 mm to 21 mm size are healthiest and have got better chances of fertilization. You may plan your intercourse at and around ovulation day which will increase the possibility of fertilization. Also you will get the information about the thickness of uterine lining (endometrium). At the time of ovulation, the endometrium should be at least 10 mm thick. If the endometrium is thinner, you will require some support to build up endometrium.2. In fact I am surprised to note that your ovulation is normal and still you are having irregular menstruation. Please get the information and evidences of ovulation confirmed from your doctor. 3. If with timing of the intercourse around the ovulation day still you fail to conceive, then the case is labelled as unexplained infertility. These are the cases suitable for Assisted Reproductory Techniques (ART) which include artificial  insemination (vaginal or uterine), in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer, etc. I hope this should give guidelines for further management.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I am starting to be more concerned with my body.

I have not been on a birth control for about 8 years now and have never had any pregancy scares so to speak. but the concern that I have and have not been able to get an answer for is that about abnormal paps.

Please get the semen examination of the husband performed. If that also is normal, please observe the following instructions. Follow the ovulation monitoring. This can be done either by a home kit or by ultrasonography. Plan your sexual relations on and around the day of egg release. The advantages of ultrasonography monitoring are:1. Size of the follicle can be assessed at the time of ovulation. Eggs released from the follicles of size between 18 mm and 21 mm have best chances of fertilization and successful implantation. 2. The thickness of the uterine lining (endometrium) can be assessed. Endometrium of 9 to 14 mm thick is most conducive for successful implantation of the fertilized ovum.If in spite of all the investigation reports within normal range and planned intercourse you fail to conceive, you fall in the category of unexplained infertility. Then you might have to report to Infertility Consultant for some Artificial Reproductory Technique.

Please let us know what are the other methods to conceive early like going for an alternative medication or laproscopy, please throw a light when the laproscopy should be done. We are married since 2 years","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Fertyl contains Clomiphene citrate which helps egg release from the ovary. In cases of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, there are raised levels of insulin and male hormones. To control insulin levels, Metformin is given which is supposed to increase the success rate of pregnancy in PCOS. However, it has been found that use of Myo Inocitol in place of Metformin gives better results. Myo Inocotol in addition to controlling insulin levels also controls male hormone levels. You may try this with the advice of your infertility consultant. While on medication for induction of ovulation, I would advise you to monitor your ovulation either by ultrasonography or by home kit. Please try to have sexual intercourses on and around the day of ovulation. It will increase the chances of fertilization. Inj. hCG after ovulation helps continuation of pregnancy after conception. If these practices are not successful, you may have to opt for Assisted Reproduction Techniques with the help of Infertility Consultant. If your tubal patency and the study of the other reproductory organs have not been done, they should be carried out. Laparoscopy and/or Hysterosalpingography can provide such information. If there is tubal block, it will have to be managed surgically. Any other anatomical abnormality will have to be dealt with accordingly. In fact you should have got husband's semen examination done before this. If not done, please get it done after at least 4 days sexual abstinence. Considering your age and marital history, you should not waste your time in trial and errors. Please report to Infertility Consultant ASAP. I hope this provides you sufficient guidance.

I now have a huge scar down the centre of my stomach and have to take penicillen for life. I am 26 years old. I was just wondering will I now have any complications getting pregnant and also how will this effect my scar? What is the recommended time I have to wait following surgery to try for a baby? I ask this as I may be healed on the outside but it obviously takes much longer for the scar tissue and muscle to heal inside. Hope you will kindly answer my questions. Thanks. Jodie","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Absence of spleen per se should not affect the course of pregnancy neither should it cause any problem in becoming pregnant. However, after the surgery, if you have developed lots of adhesions inside the abdominal cavity, it may cause problem in the tubes which will affect the transport of the egg to the uterus. Then, it may lead to infertility. This can be assessed by Hysterosalpingography/Laparoscopy. The scar on the abdomen should not cause any problem in the progress of pregnancy and delivery, provided the abdominal muscles have been well approximated and the scar has healed good in its full thickness. Your scar is on the abdominal wall and not on the uterus. So it should not create any problem in the progress of pregnancy nor labour. You may go for pregnancy anytime after 6 months of the surgery. However, since it was an emergency surgery, you should get your blood examined for its normal values. Usually splenic rupture leads to lot of bleeding. Please see that you have regained all your blood parameters to normalcy before you become pregnant. You should get your health checked up from an Obstetrician and get green signal for becoming pregnant. As it is, pregnancy is a condition which dilutes the blood. Pregnancy is an additional burden the body. Meanwhile, right from today, start consuming high protein diet with lots of minerals and micronutrients with special attention to iron and Folic acid. This will help improve your general health which is absolute requirement of pregnancy and motherhood.

If he is also Rh -ve, there is no necessity for you to get the injection as there is no risk of isoimmunisation.Usually, Rh negative person does not have the antibodies in the blood against Rh positive antigens by default. When the blood of such individuals comes in contact with the Rh positive cells, the body develops antibodies. Therefore, during first pregnancy, the baby has usually no risk. However, this baby if Rh positive, can be responsible for initiation of Rh antibody formation in mother's body. This usually happens during delivery or abortion. These antibodies in subsequent pregnancy may cause harm to the baby. Therefore, immediately after delivery, the injection is given which prevents the antibody formation in the mother's body. Now, since you had not taken such injection, you can find out whether such antibodies are formed in your body by performing a test called as Indirect Coomb's test on your blood.  If there are no antibodies present in your blood, your next baby is spared of the mishap. However, after next delivery do not forget to take the injection. If the antibodies are formed in your blood, the effect of baby will depend upon the concentration of these antibodies. Accordingly baby may require blood transfusion either immediately after delivery or even during pregnancy lest the risk to the baby's life due jaundice as a result of blood cells destruction. I have tried to make these very complex things as simple as possible for you. You may contact me by asking me a Direct question after you get your blood tested for antibodies.

If so, then you will have to take medicines for induction of ovulation. If you are ovulating, then there is no necessity of any medicine for egg release. Please continue ovulation monitoring by ultrasonography which will locate the day of ovulation. Then try to have frequent your sexual relations on and around the day of ovulation. Usually, healthy egg is released when the follicle is between, 18 mm and 21 mm diameter. Uterine lining (endometrium) between 9 mm and 14 mm is most conducive for implantation. Along with, it is advisable that you get the patency of your reproductory tract assessed by Laparoscopy and/or Hysterosalpingography. If any block of anatomical lesion is detected, you may require surgical correction. Since you have conceived twice before, at this stage, I do not feel there is any necessity of semen examination.

It destroys the uterine lining (endometrium) and thus hinders the conception. Along with uterine affection, usually the tubes also get infected which create anatomical and functional block in the tubes leading to infertility. Genital tuberculosis can be definitely treated completely, though it is a prolonged treatment of about 6-9 months. However, it destroys the function of the genital tract. Hence, even though genital tuberculosis is cured completely, pregnancy after that is a very rare possibility. You may think of adoption of a baby.

It will furnish you with following important information:1. Whether you are ovulating or not. If ovulating, it will help locate the day of ovulation which will help you plan your sexual relations.2. Size of the follicle just at the time of ovulation: The eggs released from a follicle between 18 mm and 21 mm size are the healthiest and can cause successful pregnancy. If the follicles are becoming larger before ovulation, induction of ovulation may be planned by Inj. hCG at the appropriate size of the follicle. 3. Thickness pf the Endometrium: Endometrium of thickness between 9 mm and 14 mm is most conducive for successful implantation of the fertilized ovum. ClomHEXAL is Clomiphene citrate which is used for induction of ovulation. It may affect the growth of the endometrium. If this  medicine does not give desired result within 3-6 cycles, there is no wisdom in continuing with it for induction of ovulation and then one should switch over to HMG/hCG combination.

If negative, you can wait for one more week and repeat the test.  If negative, you can take some medicines like meprate or deviry for inducing periods.

Will there be any effect on next period cycle. My treatment of PCO is going on since 6 months.Anticipating positive responce..........","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Susten will be useful only if you have conceived and due to corpus luteum deficiency, there is Progesterone deficiency which cannot sustain the pregnancy. So before you take Susten, you will have to confirm that you have ovulated and had sexual relations on and around the day of ovulation. After conception, Susten will definitely help continuation of pregnancy. However, if there is no conception, your menses will be delayed till you continue to take these pills. After you discontinue the pills, you would get withdrawal bleeding within 4-7 days. It would not cause any irregularities in your menstrual cycles. Instead, I would advise you following:1. First get confirmed that you ovulate (by ultrasonography). 2. Have sexual relations on and around the day of ovulation. 3. Take Inj. hCG on the day when your one of the follicle is around 18 mm size. It will cause the ovulation and support the corpus luteum also. If the conception has occurred, the pregnancy will continue, else, you will get menses after 10 days. Take only Gynaecologist's opinion. I hope this helps you.

Paucity of the endometrium is not allowing successful implantation of the fertilized ovum. 1. First ensure by ultrasonography that you release the eggs regularly. 2. You will have to take steps for developing your endometrium. One way is to get intrauterine device inserted which will prevent the fusion of the uterine walls and will facilitate the endometrial growth. 3. Along with take Oestrogen preparations continuously fro 3 months (thus you will not have menses for 3 months). After three months, discontinue the pills to have menstruation, which may be good in amount. You have to take this therapy only with the advice of a Gynaecologist. Please report to a Gynaecologist.

Stop all the medicines. You will start your period in 3-4 days time.

I will be answering your concerns today. The ultrasound report is very good. You have a mature follicle. It suggests that  may have ovulation in a day or two. From your notes it appears that you have conceived spontaneously earlier. So there is no need to take any medications to initiate ovulation. The endometrial thickness of 8 mm is good too. Do have intercourse either daily or on alternate days starting from today so that you get pregnant.Your husband's semen analysis is apparently normal as you have conceived before. Not all women trying for baby get pregnant in  a menstrual cycle. About About 25% of them get pregnant. So your chances of pregnancy in this month are one in four.I hope this is helpful.If you have further concerns, I will be happy to answer.Best wishes,Dr Rama"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor. I am a 30 year old woman. I want to start a family and went for a uterine checkup today. I was found to be having 16mm endometrial hyperplasia though i was told my ovaries are okay. This has worried me a lot since i want children. What are my chances of having a  family?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Endometrial thickness more than 14 mm is not conducive for implantation of fertilized ovum. Moreover, such a thick endometrium is indicative of failure of egg release. Please get the endometrium studied first to find out whether there is any evidence of egg release, as evident by secretory changes in the endometrium. If you are not ovulating, you will have to get treatment for induction of ovulation. Blood examination of FSH, LH, Oestrogen, Progesterone, Prolactin and AMH would help clinching the diagnosis. Endometrial hyperplasia may be associated with fibroids in the uterus. Please try to find any evidence of fibroids by ultrasonography. The chances of successful pregnancy with endometrium as thick as 16 mm are rather low; however, can definitely be managed by correction in hormonal levels and induction of ovulation if needed.

It is likely. Heavy bleeding after delayed menses may be due to process of abortion - it may be threatened abortion or incomplete abortion. Please get your ultrasonography done. If there are any products of conception visualized in the uterine cavity, you are in process  of abortion. If the cervical opening is closed and complete baby is seen in the uterine cavity, you are having threatened abortion. If there is no pain in abdomen, it can be managed by bed rest and some Progestational preparation like Susten. If the products are partly seen and/or the cervical opening is open, you are either having inevitable abortion or incomplete abortion. Then the uterine cavity will have to be evacuated. If you are not pregnant at all, the bleeding could be due to hormonal imbalance. Blood examination for FSH, LH, Oestrogen, Progesterone, T3, T4 and TSH will throw some light on the cause of such bleeding. Please report to your Gynaecologist.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hey I'm 15 years old and my name is Charlotte and I accidentally had sex with a guy friend of mine he didn't ejaculate in me but I keep thinking in my head that I am pregnant and I realised I'm 7 days away from my period can I be pregnant and what should I do about it ?","Doctor":"hi healthcare magic user, you can be pregnant if you had unprotected intercourse in fertile period.

I am having pregnancy symptoms. Sore swollen breasts, leg cramps, nausea... What are the chances I am pregnant?  I am still a couple days from my regular cycle to begin so is it to early to do a test?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Healthcare magic.I am Dr Ramadevi Wani. I will be answering your concerns today.Tying the tubes (Tubal ligation) is a very effective method of contraception. But there is a small chance of method  failure. The failure rate depends on type of tubal ligation and your age. Failure occurs either because the procedure was not performed correctly or because of recanalisation (the cut ends of tubes join together in continuity).In the first two years after surgery the chance of pregnancy is 1 in 200. The method failure does occur even after that.  Later on it is up to 1-2 per 100. About one third of these pregnancies are ectopic ( pregnancy outside uterus usually in the tubes) pregnancies. So if the pregnancy test is positive follow up ultrasound to confirm the location of the pregnancy is very important.The symptoms you are having can be premenstrual symptoms also. The earliest you can do your pregnancy test is 3 days before the due date (for 28-30 days cycle). So get a pregnancy test done accordingly.I hope this is helpful. If you have further concerns, do contact me through Healthcare Magic."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 25 years now got married in 2012 Nov soon after marriage I had follicular cyst in my ovaries  so that i did not  conceive.No we are trying from last two months but no pregnancy happened, Doctor has advised to take siphene 50mg for 5 days  from the 2nd day of periods, and also to do ultrasound scanning on 12th day after menstrual bleeding.

I will be answering your concernsIt would have been nice if you had provided me some more information like age, BMI, regularity of cycles etc.Among couples trying for pregnancy, 80% of them conceive in the first year and 90% by the end of second year. So don't be worried. You will conceive.HPV does not interfere with fertility. Since you have written about abnormal pap tests, I just want to know, if you have had STD before. If so, then get HSG for tubal patency done ( STDs can cause pelvic infection resulting in blockage of the tube). If you have not had STD before you can try for natural conception for another 6 months. If you do not conceive by the end of one year, then consult doctor and get baseline hormone tests and HSG for tubal patency for you and semen analysis for your husband done. The tests results will help in planning the treatment.To increase your chances of conception maintain normal BMI, quit smoking ( if you're a smoker) and have intercourse at least three times in a week.If you have any further concerns do contact me through Healthcare Magic."},{"Patient":"Hi  doc ,I am a 35 yr old female .my height is 5.3 inches.

The first dose (usually 50mg tablet) should be taken on the 5th day of the menstrual cycle and then subsequent doses at about the same time of day for a total of 5 days.     Most women who have cycles of 26 to 32 days and they are advised to have sexual contacts between day 10 to 20. The chances of getting pregnant are maximum around 14th day.    Follow the given steps to calculate your exact fertile period:1. Maintain a monthly menstrual cycle chart2. Note the number of days in your shortest and longest period3. Subtract 18 from the number of days in your shortest cycle. In a 28 day menstrual cycle, this would be day 10.4. Subtract 11 from the number of days in your longest cycle. Again, in the average 28 day cycle, this would be day 19.5. In this example the fertile period is from day 10 to day 19.Hope you are able to calculate your fertile period.Regards, Dr.Imaad.(if the answer has helped you, kindly indicate this)"},{"Patient":"I had sex on the 4rd day of my menses 4rom that day i do hav sex regularly my next menses is supposed to start on 1st of november but it didn't start, i went for scan because i was having signs of pregnancy but nothing was found & my husband threatened to throw me out pls i need ur advice","Doctor":"hi healthcare magic user,  you could be pregnant, early pregnancy is not seen on sonography  sometimes due to slow growth or delayed conception. please get a urine pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy. if it is positive  please start folic acid and repeat ultrasound after 7days."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctors ...i am 30yr old and married since 20 months ..i have diabetes and hypo thyroidism .current i am on insulin with follwoing doseages humolog 50 25-0-30 and thyronorm 125 .i want to have a baby ASAP ..can you suggest how i can deal with this though i have above health issue","Doctor":"hi healthcare magic user, you need  few blood tests to check hormonal status, please also get test for tubal patancy done. strict control of diabetes is required in order to prevent abortion or any complications in baby. if everything is normal then you can plan with follicular study.."},{"Patient":"I found out that I am going to be having surgery to remove my fibroids and some polyps.

Pregnancy test done on urine at such early period are more likely to give false negative results. Pregnancy test should be performed on the overnight first morning urine sample about 8-10 days after the missed period or 3 weeks after the unprotected intercourse (if it is done on or around the day of egg release, which is 14 days prior to the next expected menses). Alternatively, Beta hCG tests are very sensitive tests and can give you reliable information even few days before the missed period. However, the bloating and generalized pain in abdomen  are not the symptoms of pregnancy. In fact the first cardinal symptom of pregnancy to appear is missing a period. All other symptoms appear a week to 10 days later. The other cardinal symptoms are:1. Nausea & Vomiting with pica2. Frequent urination3. Breast symptoms like engorgement with tenderness, dark discolouration of nipples & areola with areolar widening, Montgomery's tubercles under the areola and secretions from the nipples. Your pain in abdomen with bloating seems to be due to indigestion problem. Some carminative and plain soda may give you relief. Please report to the Physician for these symptoms.

The follicle of 18 mm to 21 mm size release healthy egg which has very good chances of fertilization. Your follicles seem to be within that range. Endometrial thickness of 9mm to 13 mm is very conducive for implantation. You had 9 mm thick endometrium. And finally you had regular unprotected intercourses from day 9 to day 21 of your cycle. This includes the fertile period of the cycle. Egg is released 14 days prior to the next expected menses. Egg lives for 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a period of about 8-10 days around ovulation is fertile period. If with such favourable findings about the ovulation and endometrial thickness you are failing to conceive, you may please get yourself investigated for:1. Patency of the tubes and the genital tact with its normalcy : This can be done by Laparoscopy and Hysteroscopy.2. Semen examination for assessing the quantity and quality of sperms.However, I would like to inform you that even in absolutely normal couple, 10% of the months do not conceive, there is 90% possibility of pregnancy in normal couples.

Have you been investigated appropriately for the underlying cause of your infertility? If you have any problem in releasing the eggs from your ovaries, these tablets might help. 4 days after taking these tablets for 5 days, it is advisable to submit yourself daily for ultrasonography for ovulation monitoring. When there are indications of egg release (size of the follicle 18 mm or more), you should utilize those days  for your sexual relations. I would advise you to get following investigations done on both of you before you start taking any empirical treatment:1. Evidence of ovulation: Ultrasonography and hormonal assays : Oestrogen, Progesterone, FSH, LH, Prolactin.2. Patency of the genital tract : Laparoscopy and Hysterosalpingography. 3.

Are you still breastfeeding your daughter? Do you have regular cycles? Did your doctor do any hormone tests?Bremeston contains Bromocryptine. Bromocryptine works by restoring the balance of a substance called dopamine in the brain. It has several uses. In your context it is used- to stop breast milk secretion or-to reduce the level of prolactin hormone. Prolactin level if high  can interfere with fertilityThe other uses of Bremeston are to reduce growth hormone level and to treat Parkinsonism. There is a better drug available called Cabergoline which has less side effects than Bremeston. Do discuss with your doctor and use this medication instead of Bremeston.I hope this is helpful.

This medicine is used in cases of erectile dysfunction of the penis. If you do not get good erection of your penis due to low libido, this medicine will help you; however this medicine is effective only after you have desire to have sex.  Sildenafil Citrate is not reported to have any adverse effect on sperm quality or quantity. However, please get your semen examined after 4 days abstinence to assess the quality and quantity of your semen. Your wife is having Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. So the cause for infertility is more likely to be failure to release eggs by your wife. Please get her thoroughly investigated by a Gynaecologist and take appropriate treatment for her.

From your description, I understand that you have a retroverted uterus. This is not the sole reason for the abortion because successful pregnancies are seen in many cases. The cause of the miscarriage should be known; if a postmortem or histopathological assessment of the products was done, that would benefit a lot. Your tubal patency, hormone levels and ovulation status should be normal. After intercourse, you have to wait for at least 30 minutes lying on your stomach for proper ascent of the sperm.

If at all you are pregnant (which is unlikely), you can consult doctor and take abortion pills again.There are other contraceptive methods like birth control pills, intrauterine contraceptive device etc, which are more effective than condom in preventing pregnancy.

The reason for this is that if the test is left sitting around the second line may appear as a false positive.So this most likely means that you are correctly not pregnant as most urine pregnancy tests will eventually show a \\"positive\\" result if there left sitting around for longer than the recommended time.If you desire, you may repeat another pregnancy test tomorrow, making sure you use your first urine of the morning (as the pregnancy hormone is most concentrated at this time) and watch the test for the specified period of time on the instructions, which in your case is three minutes, and if after that time there is no second line visible than you are not pregnant and the test device may be discarded.I hope that I was adequately able to answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"hello doctor today is my 22th day my follicle ruptured on 18th day and doctor adviced me lupigest 2oomg frm my 22th day and i was given hcg 5000. i have pcod so plz can u tell me wht are the chances of pregnancy..........i had my lmp on 19th june........","Doctor":"hi healthcare magic user, chances of getting pregnant depends upon multiple factors like sperm count  ,your thyroid levels. if everything is normal then chances of conception  in reproductive age group is 15-20%."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am Anjali, I am 25 years old, my weight is 40kg and my height is 5\\"3.

My question is will i get pregant if i have sex with my partner during the 5 days using the ova-mit.Thanks","Doctor":"Hi,What is your age and  BMI ?How long you have been married?Are your periods regular?Some women do not have natural ovulation. Ovamit is given to them to bring about ovulation. Ovulation occurs 5-10 days after completing the course of Ovamit. So it is important to have sex with your husband during the 5-10 days after completing the course of Ovamit.It is important to have serial follicular ultrasound during this treatment to make sure that ovulation occurs. Sometimes there may be excessive follicles growing or there may not be any response.  Even these problems can be detected by ultrasound.Since your doctor has started you on Ovamit, I presume that baseline infertility investigations are normal ( hormone test and fallopian tube patency test for you and semen analysis for your husband ).To increase your chances of conception you both should  maintain normal BMI, quit smoking ( if you're a smoker) and have intercourse at least three times in a week.If you have any further concerns do contact me through Healthcare Magic."},{"Patient":"I am 30yrs old and have had two miscarriages in the past. currently i am on obimet 500mg BD, folic acid, ecosprin, evalon forte, fertyl super, wyselon and undergoing follicular study. On day 15th endometrial thickness is 5.5mm, left ovary follicle 20X16mm,rt ovary follicle 12X9mm. Are these good for conception or not?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,I believe your cycle is regular and between 28 to 30 days. Then, your egg release (ovulation) day would be somewhere between 14 to 16 day. The egg is released 14 days prior to the next expected menses. However, since you are on Clomiphene for induction of ovulation, this calculation is invalid. Your ultrasonography scan also suggests that you are quite close to ovulation. Usually, a healthy egg is released by follicle between the size of 18 mm to 21 mm. Though right ovarian follicle is smaller in diameter, your left ovary has got a good sized (20mm x 16mm) follicle. It may rupture any time to ovulate. May be you would be given Injection of hCG hormne for bringing about ovulation. Eggs released from follicle of size between 18 mm and 21 mm release the best quality eggs who have potency for successful pregnancy. However, your endometrial thickness is not up to the mark; it is just 5.5 mm thick. For successful implantation of fertilized ovum, endometrial thickness between 9 mm to 13 mm is most conducive. I do not feel this endometrium can give you a successful pregnancy. You are on Fertyl which is Clomiphene citrate. This medicine is used for induction of ovulation. However, due to its anti-oestrogenic action, it affects the endometrial growth adversely. According to my opinion, you should let this cycle pass without pregnancy. Since there is a problem in endometrial thickness, you should work on it by oestrogen preparations. Further more, colour Doppler study of endometrium will be more informative about the deeper layers of the endometrium.You should attempt the pregnancy when the follicle is between 18 mm to 21 mm in size and the endometrium is between 9 mm to 13 mm in thickness at the time of ovulation. May be, if endometrial growth is adversely affected by Clomiphene, you would require HMG/HCG protocol for ovulation if you cannot ovulate naturally. You have been put on Obimet, which is Metformin. It was (and is still) a belief that this medicine helps the ovulation better with Clomiphene citrate. However, the recent studies have shown that there is not much of a difference with or without Metformin; instead the use of Myo inositol has proved to be more successful with Clomiphene citrate. Please take the opinion of your infertility specialist before you attempt the pregnancy to avoid unsuccessful pregnancies or conceptions. I hope this helps you.

If so, you have proved your capacity to become pregnant. If the previous pregnancy was not from this boy friend, his semen quality and quantity will have to be tested for normalcy. However, for your height, your weight and thus the BMI appears to be rather high. You should try to maintain BMI under 24.9. Currently your BMI is 28.2. This may create problem in your conception.

Even though the anti-tubercular line of treatment cures the tuberculosis, the damaged endometrium usually cannot be restored. Even the tubes get destroyed. Though they look apparently patent after anti-tubercular treatment, their peristaltic movement is lost which does not allow the egg to be propelled to the uterine cavity. In last 50 years of my experience in Gynaecology, I have not seen any case of genital tuberculosis where endometrium and tubes are damaged, conceiving. Once your genital tuberculosis is completely cured, you may think of adopting a healthy baby. By this, you will have a child, the orphan baby will get parents and that too without increasing the population. I hope I could give you appropriate message.

You have got period on 11th June. So no possibility of any pregnancy due to any sexual relation(s) before 11th June. For postponing your menses, you were on hormonal pills. These pills can cause tender engorged breasts, tiredness, nausea and other symptoms. Still, if you want a confirmation, you may opt for pregnancy test on the overnight first morning urine sample after 18th June. I hope this resolves your dilemma.

I just penetrate not more than 1.5cm till 2cm inside and I absolutely did not ejaculate inside her. What is her chance of getting pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.There are some sperm in pre-ejaculatory fluid (pre-cum) but it only begins to come out very close to orgasm.  It does not matter how deep you penetrated during your episode of intercourse, because sperm can travel up into the vagina as long as it is moist even if ejaculation occurs very close to, but outside the vaginal opening. However, contrary to popular belief, withdrawal of the penis before ejaculation is relatively effective in preventing pregnancy- about 85 percent of the time.  And in your case, if your girlfriend was only on the 7th and 8th day after the start of her period, it is unlikely that she ovulated yet- as the most fertile time for most women is around 2 weeks before their period is due.So I really do not think you need to worry about pregnancy in this situation, as the combination of using withdrawal and the fact that your girlfriend was not in her fertile time likely prevented pregnancy.  It is impossible to give you an accurate percentage, but i would estimate that the chance of conceiving was much less than 1 percent.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was reassuring.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"get pregnantWhy is it hard getting pregnant i have been trying for years now and no sign of pregnancy.

You had fingered her vagina. Fingers never ejaculate semen. So there is no possibility of pregnancy due to fingering. 2. She had handled your penis which had some precum on it. However she had washed her hands after that. So there is no possibility of pregnancy due to that also. 3. You had wiped off your fingers which had some amount of precum on it.

It prevents the disintegration of the corpus luteum in the ovary and thus prevents progesterone deficiency. Progesterone is needed  for stabilizing the pregnancy. Therefore this injection is given to prevent early (usually before missing a period) abortion. Since the egg release and conception takes place 14 days before next expected period, you have been advised to take this injection during this phase of the cycle. This should give you better results. I hope this clarifies your doubts.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hello Dr. Grief,Me and my husband are planning to get pregnant and are planning for a specific date for our child to be born around Sept 30, 2012. What will be a good time to conceive if my menstrual period starts around the 29th and has a 30 day cycle?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,The duration of pregnancy when counted from the last menstrual period is 280 days or 9 calendar months and 7 days. In fact the egg is released (ovulation) 14 days prior to the next expected menses; i.e. if the cycle if of 30 days the egg will be released on day 16 of the cycle. The egg has 24 hours life while the sperms are active for 72 hour. Hence, the conception can happen about a week around the day of ovulation. Considering this, for practical purpose we consider about 2 weeks less from the day of ovulation (or conception). So the pregnancy precisely is of 266 days. However, for the sake of convenience, we calculate it as 280 days from the last menstrual period date. Considering these facts, if the delivery date is to be expected on September 30, the last menstrual period date should be 23 December. (Would you be having it then?) Now your cycle is of 30 days period. So the expected date of ovulation should be 07 January. Hence, if the conception takes place on 07 January, the due date of delivery would be 30 September. The hitch here is that you should have ovulation taking lace on 07 January. Moreover, we have noticed that all the pregnancies do not last for 280 days. The delivery can take place any time between 3 weeks earlier to 1 week later than the expected due date of delivery. Keeping these facts and calculations in mind, you may plan your sexual relations accordingly.I hope this will help you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"hi, I am a young lady of 25 years.

By causing constant stimulation of the pituitary, it decreases pituitary secretion of gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). LH is a hormone which causes the egg release from the follicle in the ovary. What you need at this stage is a stimulation for ovulation which is given by hCG injections. Now what you can do is monitor the ovulation by ultrasonography everyday. Utilize the day when you find the egg released; it may happen any day now. Please understand that the life of ovum after ovulation is 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Therefore, you can have your intercourse daily from today onwards in the hope of ovulation in next 24-48 hours. If this cycle you do not conceive, please observe the following instructions:1. The egg which is released when the follicle is between 18 mm to 21 mm of size is the healthy egg and has got maximum chance of successful pregnancy. When the follicle starts becoming larger before ovulation, the quality of the egg for successful pregnancy is not good. 2. Therefore when the follicle id 18 mm size, get Inj. hCG 5000 units to effect the ovulation. Usually within 24 hours after this injection the ovulation takes place. Hence, you may even have intercourse before you take the injection. 3. The lining of the uterus (endometrium) is most conducive for successful implantation of fertilized ovum (blastocyst) when its thickness is between 9 mm and 13 mm. I hope this helps you.

They will help the healthy growth and implantation of the embryo. Also have a good healthy diet containing high proteins, moderate carbohydrates and low fat with plenty of vitamins and minerals.

The pill is out of your system in 24-48 hours, which is why taking them every day is necessary to protect against pregnancy.

Brown discharge is either a stale blood collected in the uterine cavity which is now coming out or it could be a necrotic tissue (which usually is from the non-viable baby). With such a brown discharge, you have to find out about the viability of the baby. Pregnancy test may not be helpful since it takes more than a week for the pregnancy test to become negative after the baby has become non-viable. This is not a fresh bleeding and hence unlikely to be due to lifting of your daughter. The best option for you would be to get ultrasonography done. It will inform whether the baby is viable or not. If the baby is non-viable, you will have to get the pregnancy terminated ASAP to prevent further complications like bleeding, infection, etc. Please report to your Obstetrician ASAP.

Unless an egg is released from the follicle, it cannot be made available to the sperms for fertilization, which is the basic requirement and the step for pregnancy. For effecting ovulation from the follicles, first line therapy is by Clomiphene citrate. It is advised that this therapy should not be given for more than 6 months. If this medicine fails to cause successful pregnancy, then gonadotropins may be used for induction of ovulation.  Sometimes, these medicines cause ovulation, however are not successful in causing pregnancy. Particularly it is noted so with Clomiphene citrate due to its anti-oestrogenic effect. In addition, in PCOS, there is high insulin and high androgen in the body. Myo-inocitol has proved to be very effective in such situations. Yasmin is a birth control pill which may be successful in regularising your irregular menses due to PCOS; however, it may not be successful in giving you  a pregnancy.

The description you have given fits into the condition called as Blighted ovum wherein there is gestational sac without embryo in it. Occasionally such cases are noticed. The most likely cause behind this could be low quality of the egg that got fertilized or low quality sperm. This may not repeat again. You are having PCOS and you were given Tab. Benforce-M which is Metformin. PCOS is a three pronged dysfunction. Along with anovulation and delayed irregular menses, it is characterized by high insulin values due to low insulin sensitivity of the tissues and by high androgen hormones. Metformin given to you was with the intension of increasing tissue sensitivity to insulin, thus helping to bring down insulin levels. However, it has been proved now that Metformin has limited role in successful pregnancy; instead Myo inositol gives better results. You may suggest your Gynaecologist about this medicines. It also helps in controlling high androgen levels. Now you are on contraceptive pills to regularise your menses; however, they will prevent your conception. Instead, I would advise you to start on some ovulation induction medicines like Clomiphene citrate or HMG/hCG schedules. These medicines help egg release and hence regularize the menses also. While on the medicines for ovulation induction, ultrasonography ovulation monitoring is always helpful for location the evidence and the day of ovulation. This helps you to plan the sexual relations. I hope you will resolve to such scientific management of PCOS related infertility. This includes bringing down the weight (BMISince you have conceived once, there are good many chances that you would conceive again.

What does it mean? I usually have an irregular monthly period. Ive been married for 5 years now and i still dont have a child. Do i still have a chance to have a child?","Doctor":"PCOS is the most common endocrine disorder among women between the ages of 18 and 44.Polycystic ovarian syndrome, or PCOS, is a condition in which a woman’s levels of the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone are out of balance. This leads to the growth of ovarian cysts (benign masses on the ovaries). PCOS can cause problems with a women’s menstrual cycle,fertility.Overproduction of the hormone androgen may be another contributing factor. Androgen is a male sex hormone that women’s bodies also produce. Women with PCOS often produce higher-than-normal levels of androgen.Common symptoms are,    acne    weight gain    pelvic pain    anxiety or depression    infertilityPCOD diagnosed by,Gynecologic ultrasonography, specifically looking for small ovarian follicles.Serum (blood) levels of androgens (male hormones), including androstenedione and testosterone may be elevated.Some other blood tests are suggestive but not diagnostic. The ratio of LH (Luteinizing hormone) to FSH (Follicle-stimulating hormone), when measured in international units, is elevated in women with PCOS.Treatments,Where PCOS is associated with overweight or obesity, successful weight loss is the most effective method of restoring normal ovulation/menstruation,Medications for PCOS include oral contraceptives and metformin.For overweight, anovulatory women with PCOS, weight loss and diet adjustments, especially to reduce the intake of simple carbohydrates, are associated with resumption of natural ovulation.For those women that after weight loss still are anovulatory or for anovulatory lean women, then the ovulation-inducing medications clomiphene citrate[65] and FSH are the principal treatments used to promote ovulation.For women not responsive to clomiphene and diet and lifestyle modification, there are options available including assisted reproductive technology procedures such as controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) injections followed by in vitro fertilisation (IVF).so dont worry,PCOD is a common syndrome,and treatable also."},{"Patient":"Dear doctor, I am 33 yrs old female having anti tubercular medicines for asymptomatic acites with mantoux test positive for 4 months, i am now taking Rcinex 600. i have to take it 2 more months according to my physician.

Mother nature has arranged our body functioning in such a way that whenever there is any risk to life, the reproductory function is jeopardized first. However, Tuberculosis is such commonly wide spread disease in India and still the population is increasing. By and large, Pulmonary tuberculosis in early stage does not affect fertility. 2. By affecting the Reproductory Organs: When there is Genital tuberculosis, the tubes and uterine lining (endometrium) get affected. Affected endometrium is not conducive for implantation of the fertilized ovum and hence pregnancy is not possible. When the tubes get affected, there is tubal block. Along with the tubal block, tubal musculature also gets affected causing dysfunction in the tubal motility. Therefore, even after the surgical correction of the tubal block, if the tubal peristaltic movements are affected, conception is not possible. This is called as Functional Tubal Block; i.e. physically patent still functionally blocked tubes. You are suffering from Tubercular ascites. There is a good chance that due to ascetic fluid and peritoneal tubercular infection, the tubes and uterus also may be affected. Even, affection of the ovaries will affect the egg release function of the ovaries.Once your anti-tubercular treatment is over and you are declared completely cured of the tuberculosis, you should undergo some investigations like Hysterosalpingography (X-ray of uterus and tubes with radio-opaque dye in it) and/or Laparoscopy to assess the status of endometrium and tubes. Ultrasonography also will be of use for the purpose. These investigations only will inform us whether your reproductory organs are in a state to offer you any successful pregnancy. Madam, your first aim should be to get cured from Tuberculosis. Once you are cured, get investigated for fertility potential. Even if you are unable to conceive, you can adopt a child - this will give you a desired child, the child will get parents and still the population will not be increased.

Just rubbing can't make her pregnant.Pregnancy is possible only if unprotected sexual intercourse is done with ejaculation around ovulation time in regular period.

You may use OVULATION KIT to predict your ovulation time.In your case,ovulation occurred around 30th Nov and had to intercourse from 28th Nov to 2nd Dec.Consult with your gynecologist if infertility persists and need some investigations to rule out other causes.

Ovulation time is calculated 14 days before expected period date in regular cycle.Sperm ascends through vaginal mucosa after deposition of semen by contraction. Alkali media is friendly environment for sperm and helps in ascending. 100-200 million sperms are together inside vagina.Velocity of sperm is 2-3 mm/min and approx 45 min is taken to ascend from cervix to ampullary-isthmic junction.Liquid paraffin and oil are better to avoid as those may act as spermicide.I think you get proper knowledge.Be well."},{"Patient":"Your question: \\"I had my baby almost 3 months ago.

You do not have to have a period since the delivery to have resumed ovulation either.  So you are at risk for pregnancy if you are having unprotected sex.However, withdrawal is successful to prevent pregnancy about 80 percent of the time, so there is less of a chance of pregnancy if your husband did not ejaculate inside of you.I suggest you speak to your OB doctor about alternate birth control methods if you and your husband would want to wait longer to have another child.I hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"For the past few months my boyfriend and I have been pulling out (I know, not good birth control but we are 26 and fully aware of the risk).

BUT FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS  IT HAS BEEN CHANGED (ie)26,27,28,29 LIKE THAT MY LAST MENSURAL DATE WAS 17TH OCTOBER . WE HAD INTERCOURSE ON 10TH NOVEMBER. IS THER ANY POSSIBILITY OF GETTING PREGNANT?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Your menstrual cycle though not very regular, is varying between 26 to 29 days; I should say fairly regular. In regular menstrual cycle, the egg is released 14 days prior to the next expected menses. The Egg has a life of 24 hours while sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a period of about a week around the day of egg release is fertile period. Considering your period of about 28 days, your expected period was around 14 November and the day of egg release (ovulation) would be around 31 October. This calculates fertile period from 27 October to 4 November. Thus your unprotected intercourse on 10 November falls way outside the fertile period. Thus according to this calculation, you carry very minimal risk of pregnancy due to this intercourse. However, we have to consider your age factor. Your age is 47 years; nearing  menopause. Variation in your menstrual pattern is due to the perimenopausal changes. During this period of life, the ovulation is very unpredictable and irregular. Not all the cycles are ovulatory. Moreover, the menses also may become irregular. Thus it really becomes difficult to calculate the safe period. Even if your menses are delayed, you cannot figure out whether these are perimenopausal irregularities or possibility of pregnancy. Hence, during this phase of life, it is always advisable to use reliable contraceptive like condom. I feel, with this menstrual history and history of intercourse, you stand very minimal, almost no chance of pregnancy. You should get your menses. However, if at all you do not get menses even 40 days after the last menstrual period; i.e. 26 November, perform pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample. I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I'm planning for pregnancy, I'm undergoing regular follicular scan, yesterday I had a follicle measuring 15x18mm, its 21th day of my cycle, I'm having regular intercourse, so I want to know the chances of releasing the egg and getting pregnant this month.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, I can appreciate your keenness in getting pregnant. If the egg is around 18 mm in diameter, you do stand a good chance in ovulating in next 24 hours. So utilize these days for sexual relations maximum.If this cycle it does not work, please follow my advice.From day 9 onwards, submit yourself for ultrasonography for ovulation monitoring till the evidence of ovulation is noted. In this monitoring, please note the following conditions:1. Note the size of the follicle just before the ovulation. Follicles of diameter between 18 mm to 21 mm in size release the best quality eggs and have the best of the chances to get fertilized and complete a successful pregnancy. 2. Note the thickness of the endometrium (uterine lining). Endometrium of 9 mm to 14 mm thickness is most conducive for successful implantation of the fertilized egg (blastocyst). The life of an egg is 14 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Keeping these facts in mind, you may plan your sexual relations. Around the day of ovulation, have intercourse at least alternate day.I hope this helps you.

For pregnancy, mainly following factors are responsible:1. Woman has to release egg. This can be ascertained by different examinations and investigations. Though ovulation detection kit is available for domestic tests, the best way to go for ultrasonography. Daily scan for ovulation monitoring from day 9 onwards till ovulation occurs is very useful. Along with the evidence of ovulation, it gives information about the size of follicle and endometrial thickness at the time of ovulation. Follicles between 18 mm and 21 mm size discharge the healthiest ova. Endometrium between 9 mm and 14 mm is most conducive for implantation of fertilized ovum.2. Patency and normalcy of the Genital tract can be assessed by hysterosalpingography, Laparoscopy and Hysteroscopy. 3. Semen examination to find out the quality and the quantity of sperms and some other factors in the semen. So please to your Gynaecologist and get these investigations done to find out the status of the normalcy of your fertility.  Since you are trying sincerely for 2 years for pregnancy, in vain; you need to get these evaluations done. Based on the reports of these investigations, further management can be planned. With these reports, you may ask me Direct question for further guidance. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"im 28 yrs and my doctor advised to take fertyl-M 25 mg from day 5 of my period till the day 9.for how many days need to be in physical relationship.will it works.am i able to become pregnant?in how many days after using this tablets i may conceive.plz reply me soon.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Fertyl-M is a Clomiphene citrate product. It is given to induce ovulation in women who fail to ovulate normally, but have sufficient ovarian reserve of the follicles. You are very rightly taking these tablets fro day 5 to day 9 of the cycle. After day 9, you should ideally submit yourself for ovulation monitoring by ultrasonography. It has got two advantages:1. You can locate the day of egg release (ovulation). Thus you can plan your sexual intercourse accordingly. The egg has a life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence from just before the day of ovulation daily or alternate days intercourse is advised. 2. Ultrasonography will reveal at what size did the follicle ruptured to release the egg. Eggs released fro the follicles between 18 mm to 21 mm size are most healthy eggs and they have high chance of successful pregnancy. 3. Also ultrasonography measures the thickness of the endometrium (uterine lining) at the time of ovulation. Endometrium of 9 mm to 14 mm thickness is most conducive for implantation of the fertilised ovum.Alternatively you can locate the day of ovulation by home kit. However, it has limited advantages. Considering these facts, you can plan the days of intercourse. In short, utilize the day of ovulation and then have sex at least on alternate days for next 3 days. If you do not want to go for ovulation monitoring at all (which is not advisable), you may start the intercourse 4 days after the last tablet of Fertyl and continue to have at least alternate days intercourse for next week.

Like my uterus is normal, ovaries are normal, cervical canal is normal, hormone levels are normal but still infertile. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Unless the tubes are patent, there is no chance of natural conception. However, your tubes are not just blocked, there is irregularity and beading in the tubes noted in Hysterosalpingography. This finding is highly suggestive of genital tuberculosis wherein the tubes are affected. Please get yourself investigated from a Gynaecologist for genital tuberculosis. Also look for presence of tuberculosis elsewhere in the body, particularly the lungs, by X-ray. Hysteroscopy will help to have a look at the endometrium for similar lesions. Laparoscopy will throw more light on complete pelvic health. If tuberculosis is confirmed, you will have to undergo antitubercular line of treatment. Tuberculosis can definitely be treated completely by treatment under observation; however treatment of tuberculosis is a prolonged treatment and for genital tuberculosis, you may have to take the medicines for at least 9 months. Along with the treatment, healthy high protein and high calcium diet with adequate Vitamins is necessary. Fresh fruits, fresh green leafy vegetables and fresh air to breath help speedy recovery. If tubes are affected by tuberculosis, the chances of natural conception are rather poor since though by surgery the tubal patency is regained, the tubal function is damaged. So after completion of the antitubercular treatment, you may consider Artificial Reproductory Technique for conception and pregnancy. One more suggestion, as per the WHO suggestions and our experience, every case of tuberculosis should be tested for HIV since tuberculosis increases the possibility of HIV infection six fold; so also HIV increases the possibility of tuberculosis six times. I feel you should concentrate first and more on getting healthy. Then later, attempts for pregnancy may be considered.

You should also continue doctor's prescribed medicine.4) Ovulation prediction kit should be used in this context to predict ovulation and you should prepare for that day for unprotected sexual intercourse.5) You would need to do this for at least 6 months to 1 year to make sure that you have given the natural process a chance.6) Vitamin E, Zinc and folic acid supplements are very much helpful in improving fertility and chance of pregnancy.If with the above procedure, you fail to conceive, then you may need some initial investigation to narrow down the possibilities. These include:1) Fresh semen analysis for husband2) Ultrasound pelvis to check reproductive organs grossly.3) Hystero salpingography (HSG)-for tubal patency test.4) Hormonal test-thyroid profile, LH/FSH, Oestrogen & progesterone level.5) For ovulation- Day 21 progesterone level assay or serial ultrasound on day 12-16 for follicle measurement.6) For cervical factor- Post coital test & anti sperm antibody test.7) Blood sugar (PPBS) etc.Hope, it will be helpful for your information.

Kindly, consult with your local gynecologist and take advice accordingly. You may need to take hormonal pill to induce period.You should control body wt, avoid stress, take healthy low carbohydrate diet with avoidance of fatty food and sleep properly.Be well and take care."},{"Patient":"i am having irregular periods since beginning.last period was on sep 25.till now dere is no period.we hav been tryin to concieve since 18 nov. don knw wether i hav concieved or not but from last 3 daz i m getting cramps in my lower back n abdomen n a bit of nausea.today had a mild fever.please suggest","Doctor":"Hi there,If you are feeling uneasy and have not had period since September, consider doing a urine pregnancy test, to confirm/rule out pregnancy.If positive get a ultrasound done to date the pregnancy as you have had irregular cycles and the ultrasound will be more accurate in dating the pregnancy than the last menstrual cycle.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"doctor,i already had i child.she is 8 years old and it was conceived naturally but now when we are trying for second baby i am not able to conceive  i consulted the gynaec she prescribed me ovacare forte .I want to know will this help me and solve the problem.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Ovacare contains multivitamins and minerals and per-se doesn't do much for fertility. If you have been trying for more than a year, you should be evaluated by a gynecologist fully to know the cause, it could be tubal, womb, ovarian, cervical or male factor. The cause of infertility should be identified by ultrasound, blood tests, and semen analysis before treatment is started. Folic acid is the only vitamin that is essential to be taken by tablets when trying for a baby.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Zenab Tambawala"},{"Patient":"my age is 49 i'm 5ft 4in 16 stone, i have inactive thyroid, i have misscarried 3 time, that why i went online for drugs to help me try again, but all of a sudden my period stop at the end of october, i have thease tablets called fertomid-50, i have no clue on how to take them, also there was no do's or dont that came with them, just the tablet on its own. what are my chances and how would i take them, cos i have now stop bleeding.","Doctor":"Hi there,Welcome to HCM,To stop having regular periods at 49 years would mean that your ovaries are not producing eggs and it is very unlikely that you will conceive.Fertomid is given to women with PCOS, but they are unlikely to work if you don't have any period. Moreover they have to be started from the second day of period and continued for 5 days, but since you are not getting your periods, you will not be able to use them. You need to get your AMH levels done which will tell about your ovarian function.The most likely way for you to conceive now, is by considering IVF (test tube baby). The result of AMH will determine if you can use your eggs or  donor eggs may have to used.Please consult a fertility specialist to decide the next steps.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi this is thilak, my age is 25 yrs iam undergoing a treatment for getting pregnancy.  from my 2nd day of period dr gave me a tab elome for 5 days. 6th day she started me a folicule scan.  on 10th day she suggested me an injection ovamax 5000 IU i.e today.  please suggest when i can have a sex to get pregnancy.","Doctor":"Dear Thilak,Since you are under ultrasonography ovulation monitoring, it is very easy and simple for you to plan sexual relations. The egg is usually released when the follicle is between 18 mm to 21 mm size. In fact this sized follicles release best quality eggs. Probably, your follicle has reached that size, hence your doctor has given you injection Ovamax which will bring about ovulation and also help the pregnancy to stabilize if conception takes place. Attention should be paid to thickness of the uterine lining (endometrium). Endometrial thickness between 9 mm to 13 mm is most conducive for implantation of fertilized ovum. When you are given injection for ovulation, you will release egg(s) within 24 hours. So utilise this and next two days at the best for sexual relations which may help fertilization of the egg. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi, my menses was supposed to come on 15 nov but I delayed it by taking 5mg of  noresthisterone from 13 Nov till 17 nov.

Feel fine now and all night just very worried the embryos are damaged from excessive heat.Please tell me what you think.","Doctor":"Hello, and i hope I can help you today.Since you did not take your temperature, there is no way to know if you actually had an elevated body temperature at the time you felt this way.In addition, low-grade fever is not harmful to a pregnancy.  Women get sick during pregnancy just like anyone else, and a short-lived febrile illness is nothing to worry about.Only a fever greater than 40 Celsius or 104 Fahrenheit can do any harm to an unborn baby, and that usually takes place as a risk factor for congenital hearing loss.  As you only have embryos, and not a baby inside, there is really no risk to the transfer from what you experienced.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was reassuring.Best wishes for the rest of the pregnancy,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi i am 30 years old. This cycle i took fertyl 50mg starting 3 day for 5 days. Follicle monitoring done on 11 january shows follicle of size 18mm but endometrial thickness is just 5.7mm. Is this the side effect of fertyl. Will progynova 2mg help solve the problem. Last menstruation period date was 3 january.","Doctor":"Hallow, Fertyl is clomiphene citrate. It is basically used for egg release (ovulation) where natural ovulation is a problem. It is in particular useful in Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome where the follicles are maturing to varied extent and still the ovulation failure is noted. Clomiphene citrate is also having antioestrogenic effect. So it may hamper  growth of endometrium. Hence, in women where Endometrial growth is low, gonadotropin hormones may be preferred for induction of ovulation. Endometrial thickness between 9 mm to 13 mm has proved to be most conducive for implantation of fertilized ovum or blastocyst. Ovulation occurring when endometrium is just 5.7 mm is likely to end in 'no pregnancy'.So long as the follicular size is concerned, it has been reported for many decades that the ova discharged from the follicles of size between 18 mm to 21 mm are the healthiest one and give maximum fertilization rate and continuation of pregnancy success rate. Progynova is a synthetic hormone replacement for oestrogen. It is used to build up the lining of the uterus in preparation for embryo transfer during a thaw cycle for women who do not ovulate regularly. Hence in your case, it might prove to be effective in building up the endometrium. However, you should not wait for the ovulation beyond the follicular size more than 21 mm. If it takes longer for the endometrium to grow, you may waste this cycle and start Progynova earlier in next cycle and have ovulation at proper follicular size. I hope this information is useful to you for further decisions.

However, if you realize it the next day, you may take one additional pill on that day. In all missing of 3 pills in one cycle are permissible.

Aldactone is an anti-androgen that fights against high levels of male hormones in the body.  It is usually used to treat acne and excessive hair growth.  Diane 35 is a kind of oral contraceptive.So I think it is unlikely you will conceive while taking these medications, and you actually should avoid pregnancy while on Aldactone because it can cause birth defects of the urinary/genital tract.A high LH level is probably due to PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) which has nothing to do with cysts on your ovaries, but instead is a disorder of ovulation that causes irregular periods and a high LH level.  If that is your diagnosis, treatment with fertility medication is probably your best option.I hope I was able to answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best regards, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I have been trying to get pregnant but we only just started trying about 2 weeks ago.  We had sex 3 times without a condom.  Now for the past 4 days ive been experiencing lower back pain and abdominal pain. It feels like my period will be here tomorrow but it just never comes. But i also feel its way too soon to have any pregnancy symptoms.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,The cardinal and first symptom of pregnancy is missed period. Though it is not absolutely clear from your history whether you have missed your period or not, the impression I got is you have not missed period. Even if you have missed period, the other following symptoms start appearing after about 10 days or so after missed period. These symptoms are:1. Nausea & Vomiting and Pica2. Frequent urination3. Breast symptoms: Engorgement with tenderness, dark discolouration of nipples and areola with increase in areolar size, Montgomery's tubercles under areola and secretions from the nipples. Pain is not a feature of normal uneventful pregnancy without any risk. Appearance of pain anytime during pregnancy is indicative of some risk to the pregnancy. If you have missed your period, you can confirm the diagnosis of pregnancy by performing pregnancy test on overnight first early morning urine sample 8-10 days after missed period. Earlier these tests may give false negative results. Alternatively, you may opt for Beta hCG test which gives reliable results even few days before missing period. Abdominal pain with low back ache is a classic feature of amoebic colitis which can be treated with Metronidazole. In this condition, the stools are stained with blood and/or mucous.

Even after 5 months if these medicines are not giving you any result, I feel there is a need for thorough investigation to locate the cause of infertility. These causes can mainly be categorised in three groups:1. Failure to ovulate: It is assessed by different tests like ultrasonography ovulation monitoring, hormonal assays (FSH, LH, Prolactin, Oestrogen, Progesterone), study of the uterine lining (endometrium). Some times other hormonal imbalances like Thyroid also may affect the fertility and their evaluation also may be indicated. If there is no ovulation, you are given medicines to induce the ovulation. You are already on such treatment. After induced ovulation, most of the times, progesterone or hCG preparations are given to stabilize the pregnancy if it occurs. 2. Patency of the Genital tract; fallopian tubes in particular: This assessment is done by taking X-rays after putting in a radio-opaque dye in the uterus and tubes (Hysterosalpingography) and by directly visualising the internal genital organs through telescope (Laparoscopy). If there is any block, partial or complete anywhere in the genital tract, it needs to be tackled, mostly surgically. 3. Semen analysis for the quality and quantity of the sperms and semen as a whole.I would advise you to undergo all these investigations to locate the fault affecting your fertility and then accordingly have planned appropriate management instead of having just an empirical gunshot therapy treatment.

Still now she is taking psychiatric medicine.  Please help us and guide what we should do further.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Please assure your sister that pregnancy is possible with only one tube also. It seems from your narration that her both the ovaries are in situ. One tube can pick up the eggs produced by either of the ovary. Even if she had one ovary, since that ovary produces eggs, there are possibilities of the pregnancy. The prerequisite is that her tube should be normal. She may get it tested later if she finds difficulty in conceiving. Otherwise she should shirk off the stress about getting pregnant. I hope this helps you and your sister.

I have had late periods before but i do not remember them being this late. My husband and I have unprotected sex and I am not on birth control. I am only 22 and i have never been pregnant. what are the chances i should take a pregnancy test?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Your history suggests that there are good chances that you could be pregnant. Whenever a woman in childbearing age, otherwise having regular menses, misses her period, is having sexual exposure and is not on any birth control method, the first diagnosis is Pregnancy. You can confirm the pregnancy by urine pregnancy test performed 8-10 days after missed period on overnight morning first  urine sample. Another alternative is to go for Beta hCG test which gives reliable results even few days before the missed period. I am sure this helps you.

Medical abortion had lesser chance of infection as compared to surgical method. Since you have an yellowish discharge get a swab done to see for vaginal infection and take antibiotics according to the sensitivity..  Hope I have answered your query..

I have carefully gone through your case, and I think I have understood your concern. I will try to address your medical concerns and would suggest you the best of the available treatment options.1] Congratulations for thinking of parenthood.2]As you have irregular cycles it can be due to lack of egg formation or PCOS. This leads to delayed cycles and negative HPT.3] I will suggest to get USG done to know any structural problem with uterus and ovary, and to rule out PCOS.Husband's semen analysis  and Your tubal patency test after menses- HSG- hysterosalpingography, will make the picture clear about the situation.4] If needed you can take tab FERTYL to help egg formation,follicle study to guide you about day of egg formation, and you can have timed sex activity or IUI on that day.5]I will suggest indulging in a healthy diet and regular exercise regime.Include plenty of fruits, salads, vegetables in the diet. Have adequate water intake , say 8 – 10 glasses per day.6]  Avoid deep fried foods, bakery products, and refined sugars.Avoid substance abuse, if any.7] Start on FOLIC ACID, B12 supplements at least 3 months before you plan to have baby.I hope my answer helps you.Thanks.Wish you great health.Dr Purushottam"},{"Patient":"Hi Dr, I am 26 F; my last period was on 29th March. Normally I have regular period. I did urine pregnancy test which turned was negative. I don’t have any pregnancy symptoms. I saw very light pink spotting on 19th May which lasted for 2 days only (visible only when I used tissue paper). Again from 23rd May until 27th may I saw brownish spotting (visible only when I used tissue paper). Then on 29th and 30th I saw light bleeding (not enough to soak the pad). I was horrified and went to see OB. He did quick scanning of my womb. I saw white line like thing in my womb and asked OB about that. He said it was my period which was stuck in my womb. To find the reason behind this he said he needs to perform blood test to see if I had any hormonal imbalance. But the blood test report was normal. OB said he was not able to determine if I was pregnant but gave medication for my period withdrawal. He said that the medicine won’t affect baby even if I am pregnant. My question is could I still be pregnant or was the light bleeding I had my period?  Per my OB that was not my period. I want to have baby so I am scared to take the medicine he gave to me.  Some people said we need to have full bladder when ultrasound is done to see everything clearly. For me my OB did the scanning without full bladder. Could this be the reason he did not see things in my womb? Thank you .","Doctor":"Hi,    Thanks for the query. I understand your concern.      Yes  slight bleeding can occur even in pregnant state... such bleeding needs to  be evaluated &treated earliest.    In early months of pregnancy... such bleeding indicates less pregnancy hormone progesterone.     Yes yiu are just 6 weeks pregnant at present... and absence of full bladder may cause error in reading... unless he had used a vaginal probe.     Blood beta hcg testing /repeat usg scan with full bladder or vagunal probe would give you confirmed report.     Till then you should take rest.. avoid exertion or psychological stress.Hormone progesterone supplement can be started in consultation of treating gynecologist.

Only tablets will not be sufficient. The tablets you are out on are Methylcobalamin tablets. PCOS is not a disorder restricted to ovaries. It involves the hormonal and metabolic dysfunctions also. In this condition, along with the many cysts on the ovary due to entrapped eggs, insulin levels are increased and  the male hormones also increase. This all is associated with obesity, which is a peculiar obesity in which there is deposition of fat around the waste. The other symptoms are hair at unwanted places, irregular menses, etc. You will have to restrict your diet - high protein and low carbohydrate, low fat diet. Daily exercise is very important. Every day walking briskly at the rate of 90 steps per minute for minimum 40 minutes uninterrupted is advised. You may need Metformin to control the levels of insulin. Moreover, you will need some medicines to induce egg release. Commonly we start with Clomiphene citrate which has a good effect in this condition. If it fails, some other medicines also will be tried. I feel you should have comprehensive management of PCOS. You are having it for 10 years. So now do not waste time in trivial treatment. Try to hit the dart exactly in the bulls eye. I hope you got the message.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi. Me and my husband are trying to get pregnant and this will be our first child.

However, you may expect pregnancy in the subsequent cycle.There is a school which believes that after discontinuing the oral contraceptive pills, if there is any pregnancy within six months, the chances of miscarriage are rather high. So you may take your informed decision whether to go for pregnancy from next cycle or delay it for next six months. I feel, no harm in going for pregnancy. There is no risk of foetal abnormality.

I haven't seen any bleeding since then but this past week I've been experiencing pressure in my lower abdomen and pregnancy symptoms. Should I be concerned??","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, I hope the diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasonography. I am not sure whether your termination of pregnancy happened naturally or you had to have surgical/medical intervention. If it was natural termination, there is a possibility that some parts of products could have remained inside the uterus causing infection and giving you the current feeling. Ultrasonography can help you to diagnose this. If so, evacuation of the uterus under antibiotic umbrella will help you. The possibility of mistaken diagnosis of blighted ovum and growing pregnancy has to be ruled out. The other possibility is the growth of chorionic tissue tumours - either molar pregnancy or choriocarcimnoma. Former will need surgical evacuation while the later can be definitely treated and cured completely by medicines. Please get your pregnancy test and/or hCG levels done. High hCG levels indicate these conditions. Along with pregnancy test, ultrasonography will help to clinch the diagnosis. Considering your pregnancy symptoms, I strongly feel, you should get urine tested for pregnancy initially, followed by hCG levels if indicated. Also get urine examination done to find out any evidence of infection. If found, will have to be treated by appropriate antibiotics. Please report to your Obstetrician for all this work up and the required treatment. Take care please,Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"doctor my age 23, height is 5.3 ft and my weight is 70 kg.

It seems, there were some adhesions in your uterus due to the involvement of the uterine lining. Breaking the adhesions or removing a septum does not assure pregnancy. The extent of involvement of uterine lining plays a great role. You will have to undergo treatment for genital tuberculosis which is for minimum 6 -9 months. Then if your uterine lining regenerates healthily, you have some chance of pregnancy. Sometimes, along with the involvement of uterine lining, the fallopian tubes also are involved by tuberculosis and get blocked. Even though the block is removed, the tubes become spastic, lose their motility and thus cannot propel the egg to the uterus. In  such case, natural pregnancy is almost improbable. If the uterine lining is normal, then test-tube baby (in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer) may work. I feel you should plan as follows:1. Get tuberculosis treated first.2. Get yourself thoroughly investigated for patency and mobility of the tubes (by hysterosalpingography and/or laparoscopy) and status of uterine lining (by hysteroscopy and ultrasonography). 3. Find out whether you form eggs regularly (by ultrasonography, ovulation monitoring kit or hormonal profile)4. Get your husband's semen examined. All these investigations can give you idea whether you can conceive or not. Of course, they have to be carried out only after your full treatment of tuberculosis is over; i.e. after 6 - 8 months. Take care please."},{"Patient":"hello doctor ,i had a child of 8 yrs andin sep 2011 i conceived i had abortion on 26 th sptember 2011 till today i  did not get periods .  i had done hcg test but it was negative on 12 th december 2011.  but we want to have another child  .what might be the problem","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Usually 5 weeks after an abortion, the egg forming resumes. Starting of the period may vary, but is usually after 5-6 weeks. So even in spite of not having menses, the pregnancy is possible. If you are keen on having pregnancy, I would advice you to find out the day on which you release your egg (ovulation). This can be done either by ovulation monitoring kit or ultrasonography. The egg has life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence 4 days on either side of the day of ovulation is fertile period. Sexual intercourse in this period will give you good results. However, you will get the best results if you can have sexual intercourse on the day of ovulation. Otherwise, there seem to be no problem with your hCG test. Wish you safe motherhood,Dr. Nishikant"},{"Patient":"Hi my name is karthiga age -25 years i have subserous fibroid which was identified this year jan . now i am under going follicular study 12 day - rt ovarian follicle -1.7 * 1.6mm endometrial thickness 9mm . i am very afried hwether i will get postive result this month  or do i have ay problem","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for writing..Get a follicular study repeated on every alternate day till follicle size reaches 20mm. This is the time it is likely to ovulate and you should have intercourse to achieve pregnancy. Post ovulation get a scan done to see signs of ovulation.. Take progesterone for 10 days in the post ovulatory period for 10 days. In the next period if you are too anxious to conceive, you can take ovulation induction drugs. Hope i have answered your query.

I have the coil but my doctor told me it would not work with this acne medicine for three weeks. I have two days to go before completeing the three weeks. Could I get pregnant if I and my husband have done something?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.If you have the coil, there is no reason that it would not be effective while taking an antibiotic.  The interaction between antibiotics and birth control refer to oral contraceptives only (pills).  The hormonal coil only delivers hormones to your reproductive organs, so it would not interact at all with any pills you are taking.So in summary, you are still protected from pregnancy with the coil, so you do not have to worry about any additional protection from pregnancy.I hope this information was helpful and best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi Doc am 31, had a baby 2yrs and 6 months ago, 8 months after delivary i had one shot of depo once about 2yrs ago. my periods are very irregular. i last had my periods 5 months ago. i was put on nerothistorone to bring back my period. i completed the course 2 days ago but i havent seen my periods yet. please help i want to get pregnant.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Northisterone is a synthetic form of progesterone that, once the course had completed, should make you menstruate in 3-7 days if your estrogen levels are normal.So I would try to be patient and wait another week for your period.If you still have not gotten your period after another week, I would perform a urine pregnancy test to make sure you are not pregnant already, and if not, I recommend consultation with a fertility specialist as they can perform hormone tests and suggest the proper treatment to help you ovulate to have regular cycles and also help to conceive.I hope this answer was helpful, and best of luck with your condition,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I recently had my mirena taken out, I menstrated about a week after then again a week after that.

Irregular periods can be due to effect of the hormones released from the Mirena released in your blood.The effect continues for next 2-3 cycles.Negative urine pregnancy test rules out pregnancy.However, you can get the blood test done to confirm the pregnancy.Hope you found the answer helpful.

As you have irregular cycles, ovulation time cannot be predicted with accuracy. HPTs can read positive earliest at 4-5 weeks. Your serum beta-hCG titres indicate positive response. In the current scenario, the best way to clarify is to go for serial beta-hCG titres along with trans-vaginal sonogram. Doubling titres every 2-3 days indicate good prognosis. Please see a specialist for further information. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I dont have money.  I am just an ordinary lady trying to a  child.  My husband has lost his job for the past two years. My husband complains of odur in my Virgina, so i normally put lime juice before sex.  Can it change the motility  of the sperm and prevent pregnancy","Doctor":"Dear Madam,Your suspect is right. Lemon juice is acidic and it can affect the motility of the sperms and quality of the semen. Please stop using lemon juice for vaginal douching just before the intercourse. Do  ot use any deodorants also which are harmful to the sperms. If at all you want to have a vaginal douche before intercourse, you may use plain water. If there is foul smelling discharge from your vagina, there is likelihood of vaginal infection. Please get examined form the doctor, may be at ER and get treated. Even vaginal infection also affects the sperm motility and semen quality. Initially you may try by discontinuing the lemon juice douche. However, still if there is any problem in conception, I do not see you have any alternative that visiting a Gynaecologist.

Slight lower abdomen cramps are common after IUI, and if there is no associated bleeding or spotting and the pain is not very severe, then you need not worry.If troublesome, then you should consult your doctor for proper examination, investigations and treatment accordingly.Hope you found the answer helpful.

If she does have a possibility of being pregnant, should she get an emergency contraception?","Doctor":"Yes a girl can definitely get pregnant in this way as the seminal fluids even before discharge ( ejaculate) contain sperms and cases have been reported of sperms travelling from labia and even thighs to the uterus.

Early pregnancy loss most of the times could be due to chromosomal abnormalities. However, your karyotyping is normal. I would advise you to report to a foeto-maternal specialist to get yourself evaluated thoroughly for any other possible cause. Thyroid dysfunction, particularly low function of thyroid also may cause such pregnancy wastage. I do not see this investigation performed in your list. Please get your blood examined for T3, T4 and TSH. If hypothyroidism is detected, Levothyroxine is the medicine of choice.

If you had unprotected intercourse at the time of ovulation, the possibility of pregnancy cannot be ignored. Urine pregnancy test 8-10 days after missed period will reveal the fact.However, I feel the chances of pregnancy are very rare. Your breast symptoms are due to the progesterone you are taking. Progesterone causes water retention causing engorgement, heaviness and tenderness in the breasts. This progesterone will delay your menses so long as you are taking them. You should get menses 4-7 days after you discontinue progesterone. Why are you on letrazole? Have you discontinued it? Letrazole during pregnancy is contraindicated for its probable effect on the baby."},{"Patient":"iam 24 yrs old and i got married in the month of dec 8 months over ...iam not concieved up to now..my fsh  study shows that on 14 th day of mensturation  tow sides ruptured follicles my husband sperm count also normal....doctor advised me to take fertibex tablets ,letrogyl,bidanzen and doxycycline...for my husband productive m tablets and doxycycline....this time i'll get pregnency??????????","Doctor":"Dear Friend,If your ovaries on both sides are showing ruptured follicles, it means you are ovulating normally. So I do not see any reason for taking all those medicines for induction of ovulation (egg release). Moreover, the quality of naturally released eggs is always better than the artificially induced ovulation. Fertibex and Bindazen forte do contain micrunutrients and minerals that help conception. I do not see any reason for doxycycline unless you have cervical infection. If your husband's semen report is normal, why productive tablets and doxycylin? I would advise you to submit yourself to ultrasonography for ovulation monitoring and plan your intercourse accordingly. Usually the egg is released when the follicle is 18 mm or more. If the egg is released after the follicular size is more than 21 mm. Ovulation monitoring will help you to detect that issue also. If the egg release is happening after the follicle is becoming more than 21 mm, it is advisable to get injection of hCH when it is 18 mm size and have the egg release in time. I hope you will take my advice and act accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr, I,m 27 yrs old,trying past 1 year for conceive,my periods are irregular past 6 months i'm taking metformin, i have no pcod and my overies are normal when scanned..my thyroid report also normal..my ht is 5'2\\" and wt is 58 kgs..and i'm doing normal regular wrk...my last period on sep 26 till now i didn't got my periods...normally my cycle is 35-40 days...pls help...thank u","Doctor":"HiDr. Purushottam welcomes you to HCM virtual clinic.I have gone through your query.

How likely is it that I would be pregnant?","Doctor":"Thanks for your post on HCMFirstly if you are taking your birth control pills regularly you should not be worried and furthermore if you have taken a emergency contraception less than 48 hours,then you are on the safe zone.Macrobid is a antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections.And the withdrawal method is not a effective contraception method."},{"Patient":"I'm 18 years old and have been on Mononessa for almost ten months. My second week on the pill this month I was on antibiotics for a UTI and I had sex that week and the next week pretty consistently. The week I was on antibiotics we used a condom, but the very next day I was off of the antibiotics we stopped using them. I think I'm having pregnancy symptoms, but I'm not sure if they're just in my head. How likely is it that I could have gotten pregnant?","Doctor":"Hallow Baby,Mononessa is a oral birth control pill. It contains Ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate which together prevent the egg release in women. If you are on Mononessa regularly, the chances of pregnancy would be very remote as these oral contraceptive pills have very good success rate. What makes you think that you could be pregnant? Have you missed your period? If you have not, the thought of pregnancy could be because you may be worried about pregnancy. If you have missed your period, then wait for about a week or so. You should get period by that time. If still you do not get period, you may perform urine pregnancy test. Done earlier, this test may not be conclusive. Alternatively, you may detect the status by ultrasonography also, one week after the missed period. I hope you are satisfied and your stress has been relieved."},{"Patient":"I have had very heavy and painful periods for many years.....I am trying to conceive right now (miscarried in November, ectopic in March which resulted in losing my right tube.....is there any chance for me and could the cause be rooted in my heavy, lumpy and painful periods?","Doctor":"Hallow Madam,Since you have conceived twice in your life, there are very good chances that you will conceive again. However, the history of ectopic pregnancy cannot be ignored and you will have to be on the guard for it. The best option is to monitor the ovulation by ultrasonography and time your sexual intercourse on the day of egg release. You will have to submit for the ultrasonography day 9 onwards for about 5-6 days. This should give you better results. If you choose to have pregnancy when the egg from the side on which tube is intact is selected, the chances of pregnancy will still be higher. I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Hi, my name is Tracy. I have a 16 yrs old daughter and after several years of trying to have a child with my husband.

Precum also contains some sperms which are capable of causing the pregnancy. It is a good option to take Unwanted 72 pill. One pill preferably within 24 but not later than 72 hours of intercourse gives protection against the pregnancy. They have good success rate. The side effects include nausea and vomiting, delayed menses or sometimes early withdrawal bleeding.

I usually don t miss my period so could I be pregnant? Is it too soon to take an at home pregnancy test? My husband and I would like to know. Thanks in Advance.","Doctor":"Hello dear, I really appreciate your concern. If you are trying for pregnancy and not using any contraception during sexual intercourse then there is high chances of pregnancy. So I advise you to have pregnancy test using urinary pregnancy testing kit available at pharmacy. Your periods are already delayed by two weeks so if you are pregnant then early morning urine testing would give positive results. Hope my answer has solved your query. Take Care.Thank you."},{"Patient":"i want to get pregnant i am 36 yrs old an i have stopped the depro shot in feb this year but i have not seen ant signs of ovulation. although my last period was at begining of april and only light and went for bout 10 days i normally go for bout 3 to 4 and have not had period since","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You seem to be in dilemma. You have missed period or have light period and hence are not sure whether you are pregnant or not. Secondly, you want to be pregnant. Let us discuss your issues one by one. If you have not got periods after April episode, by now ultrasonography will definitely detect the pregnancy if it is there. Now it is 4 months since you got your last period. So even you can feel the growing uterus manually over the abdomen below the naval. Please try to get the possibility of pregnancy detected scientifically, by urine pregnancy test and/or ultrasonography. As I mentioned earlier, physical examination by Obstetrician also will be sufficient to diagnose the pregnancy. If you are not pregnant, and want to be pregnant, you have to follow certain ordeal. First get your partner's semen examined to assess his sperm count and normalcy of the sperms. Also try to locate the day of your egg release (ovulation). Serial ultrasonography from 9th day of cycle is the best way for this. When the ovulation takes place, utilise that day for your marital relations. Give it a fair trial. If you do not see ovulation, you will have to report to Gynaecologist for its management. In spite of ovulation and fair trial,  if you fail to become pregnant, get proper assessment of the patency of your tubes done by laparoscopy or hysterosalpingography. This is a broad outline for you. Hope you will take Gynaecologist opinion for the details."},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, I have been married for 3 yrs but did not conceive yet.

Please let me know do i get pregnecy very soon .. i am very much worried.","Doctor":"HIWell come to HCMI really appreciate your concern, pregnancy is more natural phenomenon than physiological one and it depends upon some compatibilities like presence of ovum and sperm at the time of coitus and right proportion of hormones if these are absents then conception may not be possible, along with the medicine try have the coitus on the day of ovulation,   hope this is information helps, take care and have a nice day."},{"Patient":"I have PCOS and my doctor had put me on Letrazole and the first time I didnt respond.

I have carefully gone through your case, and I think I have understood your concern. I will try to address your medical concerns and would suggest you the best of the available treatment options.Ideally after careful  IUI you should not have spotting.Spotting indicates less support of progesteron hormone to the lining of uterus.Sometimes few patients need progesterone support for which I recommend Tab. Susten Sr 200 mg twice a day for 10-15 days after IUI.This supports inner lining of the uterus as well as pregnancy.I hope my answer helps you.Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi..Im three days late for my period, I was supposed to get it friday it is now monday. Yesterday I started having light brownish spotting and discharge. The spotting and discharge continued today along with the kind of cramps I get when Im on my period. I have taken 4 pregnancy tests and three came up negative and the other was negative but I looked at it again after an hour and there was an evaporation line on it. I have also started phentermine on saturday(one day after I was supposed to start). So my question is..should I be worried that Im pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi,   Thanks for the query.I understand your concern.    Three days delay in periods with scanty brownish discharge ....without any contraception ... can be early pregnancy &the bleeding can be implantation bleeding.      Pregnancy can be cinfirmed by home pregnancy test after 8-10 days of the  expected date of menstruation.      Please repeat the test after a week.. fir confirmation/exclusion of pregnancy.

However, it is noted that most of the women conceive within six months, some up to 1 year. More delay is not a good omen for conception. It is better you opt for ovulation monitoring and accordingly try for conception. Usually a follicle ruptures and egg is released after the follicle is 18 mm or more. Accordingly you may plan the intercourse. Follicles more than 21 mm are not supposed to be good for ovulation or healthy egg and the success rate for conception with such follicles is not encouraging. I hope I have answered your question."},{"Patient":"I am 49 and had a period last July.  Then not until this past March.  Last night my husbands condom came off.  Do you think I am still ovulating?

If a Rh - ve mother carries( conceives )  with a Rh +ve child , there are rsk of her being sensitized to Rh +ve blood . To clear this effect Anti D injection (Rhogam )is given  within 24 hours of  delivery & abortion .This helps in-   -  Avoiding complications in next delivery,   - Avoiding serious  reaction  after blood transfusion in mother .. in case she needs it through out her life.   * So, in case of  your daughter-      It's good that she has received anti D after her abortion.

Depot shot relieves you of menstrual cramps, but it also prevents ovulation- which is essential for conception.So conception with depot shots is out of question.   To conceive, you have to stop having the depot shot,wait till you have normal ovulatory cycles ( it takes about 6-10 months ).. & then plan for pregnancy.

Pregnancy is possible only when sprm enters vagina. Even precum has sufficient number of sprms to impregnate a woman.

Usually after withdrawal of depot shot, fertility returns by 6-10 months , to normal.

I have gone through your query and here are some suggestions. 1. Missing three pills in a row makes the cycle unsafe. Additional protection is needed. 2. Pregnancy is not possible without ovulation. An intercourse just before the onset of the period is not likely to cause conception because even if you ovulated in the cycle, you were likely to be in the safe period. 3. Ovulation with abrupt stoppage of the pill is unpredictable. Hope you find this information useful.

Your next menses were expected on 22 July. So the egg release was expected around 8th July. The egg has got a life of 24 hours while sperms are active for 3 days. Hence a week around day of egg release is considered as fertile period. Your intercourse does fall in this period. So, there is a possibility of pregnancy.I would not consider headache for pregnancy possibility.The urine pregnancy test and ultrasonography give reliable results 8-10 days after missed period. So please wait for that period and if you do not get menses by that time, get either or both of these tests done. Beta hCG tests are more specific and sensitive, hence they give reliable results even after 2-3 days of missed period.I hope you are guided properly."},{"Patient":"hi im 29 and my husband is 31,we got married in2009, in 2008 my chocolate endometriotic cyst removed from left ovary but now again cyst recar in both ovaries, i want to conceive now. my question is without removing my cysts can i concieve?we r trying for lust 2 years, but cun't, help me please. my weight is 100kg, height 5ft and 4inch.","Doctor":"hii think i have understood your concern.first of all for your overall health you need to get down to appropriate weight for your height. have proper diet and exercise schedule.in my opinion ovum formation and getting pregnant poses difficulty with chocolate cyst.As per your question , if you do not want to undergo surgery for cysts , you need to take Inj.

I am currently 21 y/o. My gyn prescribed me to take Premphase, so that I could still have a cycle every month. I have had full cycles all the way until May, then in June no cycle, light spotting in July (spread out over a few days sporadic throughout the month), and no cycle in August. I called my gyn (and talked to a nurse) after the no June cycle, and they said that it was normal to have just spotting or not a period at all while taking Premphase, so I didn't worry too much.  For the last two and a half weeks I was feeling nauseated in the mornings and this past Friday, I even vomited. I have also experienced headaches, tender breasts, and heightened sense of smell.  I took about 4 HPT's over two days and got all positives. I was told by my gyn that I my likelihood of conceiving naturally was slim to none. I went to our state county health department, and they confirmed the pregnancy with a urine test. They said I would be due in February 2012. The nurse had not heard of my medicine and about it affecting my periods. I do not think this is a correct due date, but I am not sure. What I am most concerned with is am I really pregnant? Did my ovaries just kick back in (as my gyn said COULD happen) or the HRT help me concieve? Could this be a false positive because of my medicine or something else? They did not do a blood test, which worried me. I can't see my gyn for another 2 weeks or so because I am waiting on state insurance to kick in, I just need some advice and peace of mind.

There are two types of pregnancy tests:1)Blood test   If you are pregnant, the blood test results positive within 3-4 days after implantation, or 9-10 days after fertilization and ovulation. You can take the test within 7 to 12 days of having unprotected sex.2)Urine Test  Most women test positive for pregnancy 13.5 days after ovulation or at the time they expect their monthly periods.

The pull-out method is not 100% foolproof.If your partner has a 26 day cycle, it means she would be due around the 18th. A delay does not always mean a pregnancy, it can also be due to the mental anxiety, illness etc.She can test for a pregnancy using a home pregnancy kit about 4-5 days after the date of the missed period (assuming she has regular cycles).Ask her to use a morning sample preferably.If there is a doubt, better do a pelvic ultrasound the week after.Do not worry, seek a gynecologist opinion in case it is positive.

Today I found green on my undies what is it and what are the chances of me getting pregnant","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. If you happened to be in the fertile period during the unprotected intercourse, you have good chance of conception. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile phase. It is true that the preejaculate contains enough sperm to cause conception. The green colored discharge is not normal and needs to be examined. Also, you have to wait for your next natural period and go for further management if you miss it. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Ive been experiencing pain in my upper and lower abdomen. Lower back pain, frequent urination, dizziness, nausea, and very tired lately.

Or is there something else going on?","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for writing in to HCM.If you are having your normal regular menstrual cycles every month without missing a period, it is unlikely that you are pregnant.The best time to take a home pregnancy test is in the week after you miss your period. Hormonal fluctuations can give rise to pregnancy-like symptoms at times. However I would suggest you get a routine blood and urine test- rule out anemia or an infection.Hope this is helpful.

I shall make an effort to provide you with good professional recommendations specific to your questions.After taking post coital pills bleeding occurs within 4 to 5 days but may vary in individual. This might be the bleeding that you are experiencing now. It also indicate that you are less likely to be pregnant. It is advisable that you should go for the ultra sound (USG) on 14 th day of consumption of pill to rule out any incomplete abortion.

I shall make an effort to provide you with good professional recommendations specific to your questions.If you miss an injection, you don't have increased amount of hormones that suppress ovulation. While ovulation usually resumes three to six months after stopping the contraceptive injection, it is possible to get pregnant if you miss a shot. You should have a pregnancy test as it has been two weeks or more since your last injection.  Emergency contraception if you had unprotected sex in the past 72  hours. To reduce your risk of an unwanted pregnancy, use a secondary form of birth control, like condoms, until your next injection.Presently I advice you to perform Urine pregnancy test and use morning sample for more sensitivity.Yet again, I duly appreciate your query to me, I do hope that you have found something useful to help you and I shall be glad to answer any further apprehensions.Sincerely,"},{"Patient":"The first day of my last normal period was August 14, 2011; I recently had sexual intercourse on September 17, 2011, we didn't use a condom and he didn't pull out. I still haven't had my period for this month. Could i of gotten pregnant from having intercourse?","Doctor":"Yes, missed period is a first symptom to suspect pregnancy. The symptoms of early pregnancy - in first three months are:1. Missing a period2. Nausea and vomiting3. Frequency of urination4. Breast Changes -* Engorgement and tenderness* Brownish discolouration of nipples and areola. This happens in first pregnancy and is permanent change.* Increasing the size of areola* Clear secretions from nipple on squeezingHowever, pregnancy is never diagnosed on any of these symptoms. For confirmation of pregnancy, clinical examination is necessary. To support the clinical diagnosis, urine pregnancy test and/or ultrasonography after 8-10 days of missed period is performed. Beta hCG test is highly specific and sensitive which can give reliable results within 2-3 days of missed period.

I m not sure if that can cause sperm to get pushed up into me","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for your query.After reading through your question it seems highly unlikely that a pregnancy can occur. For a possible conception the sperm(ejaculatory fluid) has to be deposited in the vagina plus you have to be in the fertile period of your cycle.I'm sure no amount of fluid was on his hands as well.Without penetrative intercourse chances of a pregnancy are almost nil.But be careful in the future.

I am very scared","Doctor":"Hello.I have read your query. The calendar method for birth control is not 100% effective to prevent a pregnancy, as it relies on calculations to determine the fertile period. This is especially true when intercourse happens around the ovulation time. In case the periods are not regular the method is unreliable.Do not worry, just wait for your period to come normally. If its late do a home pregnancy test or an ultrasound to confirm.I would recommend moving to other effective reliable forms of birth control. Talk to your gynecologist about it.Hope this is helpful.

India is having very high incidence of Tuberculosis - Mostly Pulmonary (of the lungs) but even extrapulmonary (outside the lungs) also. Thus we cannot say that Tuberculosis everytime affects the fertility.

It takes up to 36 hours for the follicle to rupture after the injection, however it may rupture earlier also. So considering the life of ovum, intercourse up to 72 hours is fruitful, not after that. Remember that the life of sperms is up to 72 hours. So if at all this cycle goes waste, from next time try to start the intercourse about 4 days prior to the expected ovulation or injection ovigyn and continue up to 48 hours after the ovulation (confirmed by ultrasonoigraphy).Intercourse may be performed on alternate days if daily is not possible.

Your wife should take 1 tablet of folic acid daily.To increase the chances of conception you both should maintain normal BMI, quit smoking (if you're a smoker) and have intercourse at least 3 times in a week.Hope I have answered your query.

Ive not seen a doctor.My periods are regular and i get ovulation pain on day 12. My cycle is 27 days.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Pregnacare and ovacare are multivitamins and multimineral suppliments. If a woman has a deficiency of these vital nutrients it may affect her fertility. So these tablets are prescribed with the presumption that they may improve the chances of pregnancy. They do not have a central role in increasing the chances of pregnancy. How long have you been married? What is your BMI? It is important that you and your husband should see a gynecologist and do baseline infertility work up (hormone test and fallopian tube patency test for you and semen analysis for your husband). Based on the results of investigations treatment can be planned. Take 1 tablet of folic acid daily. To increase your chances of conception maintain normal BMI, quit smoking (if you're a smoker) and have intercourse at least 3 times in a week. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Ramadevi Wani"},{"Patient":"my girlfriend gave me a handjob and when i cummed some got on her hands but not much. and it dried up. so it was like sticky on her hand. she went to the bathroom a few minutes later and wiped. can she get pregnant? I was fingering her a couple nights ago and popped her cherry. Does that delay her period?","Doctor":"Semen on the hands is unlikely to cause the pregnancy unless she puts her hands soaked with semen into her vagina.Also body play without any penile insertion into the vagina and ejaculating there does not result into pregnancy.For pregnancy, the sperms of a man, which come from the semen ejaculate have to go in the reproductory tract of the woman, through vagina normally to meet the egg inside her reproductory tract, usually the tubes. By putting any other part inside the vagina or ejaculating semen outside the vagina in any part of a woman the pregnancy cannot result."},{"Patient":"Hi I am 35 years old my weight is 65.5 kgs and height is 5'3.We Got married in October 2009. we are planningFor family now but we want to know if we really need to see the Gynacologist before we plan.is there any medicine required to Ready for pregnancy? My periods are perfect.","Doctor":"Hi,Were you using contraception all these years to avoid pregnancy?Since your periods are perfect, in all probability you are ovulating regularly.You are slightly overweight. A normal BMI increases the chances of conception.  It will be excellent if you can reduce around 5 Kg weight. IF you and your husband smoke, you must quit smoking. It is important to have intercourse at least three times in a week to improve your chances of conception.Have one tablet of folic acid daily.If you don't conceive within 6 months of trying for pregnancy, you must consult Gynecologist for baseline subfertility tests ( hormone assay and fallopian tube patency test for you and semen analysis for your husband).Based on the results of investigations treatment can be planned.I hope I have answered to your satisfaction."},{"Patient":"hiya my name is rebecca wilson i am on the depo injection and have bin for very nearly a year and i was thinking of coming of it as i would like to start trying for another baby but i have bin told and have read a lot of stories that the depo could have damaged my body is this true?","Doctor":"Hi,Don't  get worried reading unfounded stories. Depo shot does not damage your fertility.Although the Depo shot needs to be repeated 12-16 weeks, when it is stopped usually it does not lose its effect in that time period. The effect can last longer because the microcrystals of depot injection sometimes dissolve very slowly. Therefore there is some delay in ovulation and conception.Although pregnancy can occur as early as three and half months after the last shot, the average time for ovulation to start is about five and half months. But the time for becoming pregnant takes a little longer, the average being about 10 months from the last shot. For some women it may take up to 18 months.I hope I have answered your concerns.

We have a 6 year old daughter and for the past 10 months we have been trying for a second child. As we didnt succed for the initial 6 months, we consulted a Gynecologist. Apparently, I seem to have BP. The reading was 140/90 when I consulted her. She put me on Alphadopa and BP has been under control. Apparently, my husband (38yrs) was tested positive for Diabetics a month ago. His FBS is ranging between 120 -130. He is on medication now. His doctor told him that his sperm count and motility is also not good and had prescribed some medicines. But, my husband has not taken any of them as he was was tested positive for Diabetics and that has put us down morally.

I had a normal delivery also. Now, we are totally confused about having a second child as we are unearthing all these health issues and we have literally dropped the idea of having a second child. Please guide me.","Doctor":"Hi,Don't be disheartened. You can definitely pursue with your effort to have a second child.You have not written clearly about the semen parameters for your husband. If minor differences, it could be because of his diabetes. Let your husband repeat semen analysis one month after good control of diabetes. Even then if the semen parameters are not satisfactory your doctor will advise accordingly.Do you have regular menstrual cycles? Have you done hormone tests and fallopian tube patency tests? What was the result? If you have not done you need to do these tests too.

Will I conceive soon??","Doctor":"Hi,I wish you had provided some more details to help you better. What is your age and BMI? Is this the first time that you have irregular cycles?How long have you been married?Regestrone contains progesterone hormone. It is used to induce periods. it does not help you in conception. It is important that you and your husband should consult gynecologist and  get some basic subfertility investigations done to find out if there is any other cause for delay in getting pregnant ( hormone tests and fallopian tube patency test for you and semen analysis for your husband).If it is found that PCOD with irregular ovulation is the only cause for delay in periods and if you are obese then it is extremely important that you reduce weight. Reducing weight by 5-10% can itself regularize ovulation and increase chances of pregnancy. Your doctor will discuss with you and start metformin + clomid to induce ovulation. These medications are used for six months.  Your chances of getting pregnant are about 40% and having live baby is around 27%.If you don't get pregnant with this treatment your doctor will discuss with you use of gonadotrophins (hormone) or ovarian drilling (surgery)   to induce ovulation.take one tablet of folic acid dailyTo increase your chances of conception maintain normal BMI, quit smoking ( if you're a smoker) and have intercourse at least three times in a week.If you have any further concerns do contact me through Healthcare Magic."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 34yrs old married.

Every cycle, a woman in reproductive health forms an egg. This egg is initially in a watery balloon which is called as Graafine follicle. When your doctor says the follicle is ruptured, probably it means your egg is released. This happens usually 14 days prior to the next expected period. You have not mentioned whether at the age of 39 your periods are still normal or not; and if so what is the duration of your monthly cycle. I will answer your query presuming your cycle is 28 days, regular. If you had your last period on 5th October, your next expected period should be on 2nd November. So your egg formation dates to about 19 or 20 October. You had contact on 18 & 20 October. So there is a high chance of pregnancy. Anyway, now this is March so you must have got the answer through your next periods. If you have missed them, you must be pregnant. If you do not want this pregnancy, you had an option of undergoing a Medical Termination of Pregnancy legally before 20 weeks of pregnancy; i.e. before 15th February. Of course this depends in which country you are."},{"Patient":"Hi... I'm 27 years old and married for 2 years.

The right ovary shows a dominant follicle which is likely to grow and rupture releasing the egg ( ovulation). The follicle grows about 1.5 mm each day. So you are likely to ovulate on day 14 or 15.

Now my question is that I had an key hole surgery for avoiding p pregency. but my present husband wants a baby from me. is their any way to have baby from my present situation, if so pl advise.","Doctor":"The term 'key hole surgery' probably refers to laparoscopic tubal occlusion or minilaparotomy. Whichever is the surgery you have undergone for avoiding a pregnancy, it is either tubal occlision or tubal ligation. In either case, the tubes gets damaged anotomically at the site of surgery. These tubes carry the ovum or the egg from ovary to the uterus and most of the times, the egg gets fertilized by man's sperm somewhere in the tube. Therefore occluding/ligating the tube prevents the prenancy. This surgery is referred to as a way of permanent contraception. However, this surgery can be reversed. For this purpose you will have to undergo another surgery called as tuboplasty. This is not as simple and a short surgery as the original surgery you have undergone for avaoiding the pregnancy. This is a major surgery. This is a highly skilled job and should be got done from expert surgeon in doing this surgery. You cannot guarantee the pregnancy 100% after tuboplasty, its sucess rate is not very high. If you are so keen on getting a child from your current husband, you may try this option, but with full understanding of its sucess and that it is a major surgry. Wish you all the best for your future child-bearing career."},{"Patient":"I have been advised to take letroz tablets for second infertility.

The main obstacle in your case is that you both are not staying together.It would be a wise decision for you to take visa and  stay with your husband for at least a year. I strongly suggest this.Ovulation occurs 14 days before the  date of your next period. Let me give an example. If your period cycle is of 30 days duration, then ovulation usually occurs on day 16 of your menstrual cycle.Sperms remain alive  in the female body for 6 days. The life span of egg is 1 day. So the fertile window is from day 11 to day 17. Instead of getting stressed with these calculations, it is advisable to have regular intercourse at least three times in a week.Take one tablet of folic acid daily.

Regarding preseminal fluid and ejaculation at the external vaginal opening, one has to be careful. From your qustion, it is clearly evident that there was semen on the vaginal opening suggesting that there was not only preejaculation fluid but also ejaculation. The first part of the ejaculation comes out with a great force. Even when the ejaculation takes place within the vagina, some sperms are known to enter the uterus. So even if you see some semen on the vaginal opening, there is a strong possibility that some part of ejaculate has entered the vagina, which is sufficient for pregnancy. Remember, there are millions of sperms in one ejaculte and to impregnate, only one is sufficient to fertilize the woman's egg. Further more, even preseminal ejaculation also is known to contain few sperms which are known to cause pregnancy. The back ache she is getting is probabally due to the stress and may be the igorous activity if at all she had during love making. Pregnancy does not give low back ache. I repeat again, the chances of becoming pregnant are very very very remote on 2nd or 3rd day of menstruation. The egg is released 14 days before the next expected menses and the life of the sperm is not more than 3 days."},{"Patient":"hi doc, just wanna ask if its OK to use pregnancy test 6 days ago after sexual intercourse,and how true is it that the woman could not be pregnant if the sexual intercourse is made on the fourth day of their menstrual period,meaning they are not fertile?","Doctor":"HiIf you have had sex on the ovulation day, then pregnancy test can be done on the 7th day after sex. The logic is implantation of baby into uterus occurs on the 6th-7th day after ovulation. With implantation, pregnancy hormone is secreted and it can be detected by tests. This is the earliest time to do pregnancy test. urine test may not detect it. You need to do blood pregnancy test. So only when you have sex at the time /just after ovulation  pregnancy test can be done after 6-7 days.What you have heard is right. The first week and the last week of a menstrual cycle are safe. A woman cannot get pregnant if she has unprotected  sex during this period.I hope I have answered your concerns."},{"Patient":"I am 17 years old and I was on the depo shot i ended the depo shot inOctober due to gaining weight.

The effect can last longer because the microcrystals of depot injection sometimes dissolve very slowly. Therefore the period can be delayed up to 6-7 months.The symptoms you have mentioned can be due to the progesterone effect of injection too.To clarify things take a blood pregnancy test as it is more sensitive than home pregnancy test.

The first seven days and the last seven days of menstrual cycle are considered safe. If you have had sex during this period  you need not worry.If you have sex on days other than safe period then there is possibility of pregnancy.Even one sperm is enough to cause pregnancy. So it is good that she took unwanted 72. Unwanted 72 is very effective in preventing pregnancy. If taken within 24 hrs of unprotected sex it is 95% effective.So there is a small possibility of method failure resulting in pregnancy.

Couple has to have regular sex for 3days following the rupture of follicle for the ovum to get fertilised. The ovum can be fertilised for 72hours after ovulation and sperm is capable of fertilising for 24hours after ejaculation. So it is a chance factor for successful fertilisation to occur. The chances are increased by follicular study and regular unprotected sex around the day of ovulation. But it may take 2-3months for successful pregnancy. Duphaston is used to maintain the implanted embryo by making the endometrium receptive and thus prevents unwanted abortion. Healthy diet and regular exercise or yoga also helps in conceiving. Adopt a healthy lifestyle and reduce stress in life. Stress has bad effects on body hormone levels. Dedicated attempts under proper supervision will have successful results just have patience for few months."},{"Patient":"my name is geeta and i cannot consieve and all report are normal and my husband report are also normal and 1st miscarrage happen and now i am showing to another docter and she given me folvite tablets whether it is right tablet to get pregrant in 1 month","Doctor":"Hi Geeta,Tab Folvite contains folic acid.

If you have unprotected sex during this period there is no possibility of getting pregnant. There was no need to take Postinor 2. After starting microgynon did you use back up contraception for the first 7 days or not?  This is important to have contraceptive coverage for this cycle.If you have used Microgynon correctly as per instructions then your chances of pregnancy are less than 1%. This means that of 100 women using Microgynon  for one year less than one woman will get pregnant.The progesterone in the pill can also cause breast soreness and nausea.If you have not used back up contraception for the first seven days of starting Microgynon then it is as good as not using contraception.

Do you have regular cycles? Usually women with PCO have irregular cycles as they do not have regular ovulation. I suggest that you take clomid/tamoxifen +Inj HCG for six cycles along with ultrasound follicular study. Ultrasound examination helps us to make sure that ovulation is occurring. If conception does not occur with this treatment then I would discuss with you two options of management. Either to start induction of ovulation with hormones or laparoscopy and ovarian diathermy for polycystic ovaries.Pregnancy rates between laparoscopic ovarian diathermy after 6 to 12 months follow up and six cycle of ovulation induction with gonadotropins are the same. Laparoscopic ovarian diathermy carries the risk of surgery. However, the rate of multiple pregnancies is lower in women who conceive after ovarian diathermy.Take one tablet of folic acid daily.To increases your chances of pregnancy, maintain normal BMI, quit smoking ( if you are a smoker) and have intercourse atleast three times in a week. For women with PCO maintaining normal BMI extremely important. Even reduction of just 5-10% of body weight corrects the hormonal imbalance and improves chances of conception.I hope I have answered to your satisfaction.If you have any further queries feel free to contact me through health care magic"},{"Patient":"My boyfriend and I were \\"dry humping\\" last night. he was only wearing boxer and I was in my undies.

Since you have a mature follicle and a ruptured follicle by 16 th day, intercourse during this time helps in achieving pregnancy to the maximum..You can get an IUI done in the next cycle if you dont conceive in this cycle.. in the postovulatory phase, take progesterone for 10 days for luteal phase support.. hope i have answered your query.. good day.."},{"Patient":"hello my name is Brenda, I have been trying to conceive for 8 months with no success. My doctor did blood work and all these other tests to see if i had a fertility problem and the results would always come out just fine. so after that my husband went in and did a sperm count and semen analysis, and the results were perfect too. My doctor has put me on metformin 1000 mg a day. i have been on the metformin for almost a month and a half. the thing is that before all this i used to have very irregular cycles and my doctor put me on provera 'birth control' for 3 months to help regulate my periods which helped for the whole 3 moths, but when i finished my period was gone for about 41 days and after that them have been much better ive been getting them around every 31 to 32 days. Like i was saying my doctor put me on metformin... but i have been searching the web and they only give that to women who have pcos and i dont have pcos. my doctor told me to take the medication for 3 months and to go back after the 3 months to see what would happen. so I just want to know why would she put me on this medication? is it going to help me conceive?","Doctor":"provera is medrox progesterone. ..it is to get your period....u do serum tsh and serum prolactin den do hsg on day 8th den do follicular study after taking clomiphene from day two den follicle size increase to 18 mm den rupture den iui fr early results"},{"Patient":"i am 27 and trying to conceive from last 3 years. my husband seman test report is ok as far my reporst are concern it is also ok accaording to doctors. now i have taken 1st sycle of 100 mg clomid, hcg shoot, and dophenen 10mg for 10 days twice a day...is it the right treatment to conceive and how many sycles i shod take.i have already taken six sycles of clomid in last 3 years as well..and do u suggest me for iui","Doctor":"HELLO DEARI understand your problem, dear since you have taken clomid for six cycles now you can go for injectable  gonadotropins for ovulation induction along with timed iui. and also iif you have any please try to overcome by yoga or meditation since many times it leads to treatment failure.

I took  it for 3 cycles i ma ovulating i have 22 MM egg in my Left ovary every time when i had follicular monitering. I still have PCOD.Please let me know what should i do to get pregnent.","Doctor":"HiPCOD is a condition which remains with you. With life style changes and medications its effects can be controlled. Birth control pills are given to regualarise cycles. It cannot treat PCOD.You did not mention what is your BMI. Maintaining a normal BMI is extremely important to increase your chances of pregnancy since you have PCOD. Therefore if are obese please reduce weight first.Since your doctor has already started clofert for ovulation induction I presume that your fallopian tube patency test, thyroid test and your husbands semen analysis are normal.It is very good that you are responding to clofert. Are you taking injection human chorionic gonadotrophin for ovulation to occur? If you are not taking discuss with your doctor and take it once the follicle reaches mature size. Have intercourse on the day of injection and 48 hours later. To increase your chances of pregnancy you should have regular intercourse atleast thrice weekly.If you dont conceive continue induction of ovulation with clofert for another three cycles. Later you may need induction of ovulation with hormones.Take one tablet of folic acid daily.Again I repeat please make sure that you maintain normal body weight.I hope I have answered to your satisfaction.

It is given to cause release of ova (egg) from mature ovum. It does not cause delay in the period. The delay could be due to pregnancy. Get a  pregnancy test done.

Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  It will increase chances of your pregnancy. Don't get stressed too much.  If it doesn't work, then you can go for evaluation.  Do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels and a ultrasound for your uterus and ovaries.  If everything is fine, you can take some medicines like clomiphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound.  When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to  6 months.  Hope I have answered your question. Regards Dr khushboo"},{"Patient":"DEAR DR.

Should not drink more than 1-2 units of alcohol per week. Your BMI should be around 25. If it is more you need to reduce weight. One more important thing is you should have regular intercourse 2-3 times/ week.If you don't conceive in 3-4 months time period consult your doctor and get the fallopian tube patancy test done.If you have any further queries feel free to ask me.

You havent mentioned about morphology though. since your wife's tests are also normal, dont worry. Usually only 60percent of the couples who intend to get pregnant in first year of their marriage will concieve within 1st year. Even if all the tests are normal some couples would take several years to concieve.Being stressed and worrying too much over the delay, will make  conception further delay by reducing sperm production, ovulation problems and implantation problems. so dont worry too much of it.  You havent mentioned about your and your wife's age. If your wife is in mid or late thirties your obstetrician would start introducing assisted firtility methods soon. Technolgy associated with assisted firtility methods are developed so well, that even if you have any trouble in concieving ,new technology would help you. so enjoy the time you have for your selves.

I m afraid that while washing the area I may have pushed some in instead and am now considering taking an emergency contraceptive pill (which I just bought at a pharmacy) as I ve read online that sperm near the entry of the vagina can in fact make its way to the fallopian tubes and can even stay alive for up to a week.

You may take contraceptive pill to take extra protection against pregnancy but literally it is not necessary in this context. Also pill may cause next cycle delayed or earlier due to hormonal imbalance.As you are getting spotting or pink discharge now, it indicates that your period starts shortly. It is impossible to be pregnant during period. Therefore I suggest to wait at least 7 days before proceeding to investigation of irregular period.

Taking birth control pills like Dixi 35 offers excellent protection against unintended pregnancy.  Using the pill correctly (perfect use) results in only a 1% chance of pregnancy each year.  Using condoms if your partner is on the pill is a great idea to avoid infections and adds some degree of added protection against pregnancy.You bring up a good question: women DO get pregnant from preseminal fluid: \\"pulling out\\" (as family planning) is far more likely to lead to pregnancy than faithful use of condoms.  Women DO get pregnant from having sperm deposited outside the vagina as well.  You should always use condoms from the start to the finish of any sexual activity until you are in a stable long-term monogamous relationship with a partner on reliable birth control.I hope that helped and best of luck to you"},{"Patient":"hi, i just want to know if there is any chance of me being pregnant if my bf and i dry humped and he came on his pants and i touched some of it.

Though, you should wait for next coming period to be sure. If you miss your period, you may need to undergo one home pregnancy test after 7 days.In general, high chance of pregnancy depends on proper timing of ovulation or fertile period & unprotected sexual intercourse with ejaculation.

So about 6 months into our relashonship I stopped using contriception all together, so we have been having unprotected sex for 6 months now and I haven't got pregnant does this mean I can't have children?","Doctor":"Thank you for consulting in HealthCareMagic. Let me mention that the effect of pills goes away in a few months and there is supposed to be no more problems in conception in this regard. To become pregnant, you need to have unprotected sex with semen discharge between 10th and 18th day of your cycle which is your fertile period. So maintain the dates and see if pregnancy comes. If it still does not come, I would insist that both of you get yourselves checked.I would insist you to get an ultrasound of the lower abdomen done and a semen analysis of your partner done and then visit a gynecologist who would be able to look into the reports and tell you if things are fine.I would also insist both of you to take folvite (folic acid) 5 mg once a day regularly at least till you become pregnant. Taking zinc supplement will also help in enhancing the sperm count of your partner and increase the probability of conception.Hope that helps.

So the act as to be done between the 10th and 18th day of the girl's cycle which is the fertile period, else pregnancy is unlikely. Nextly, although without penetrative sex might be possible, it is not without sperms getting in. Precum can contain sperms but dry surface is unlikely to have live sperms. And finally, if pregnancy occurs, she will miss her periods. Unless she misses her period, she is not going to be pregnant.So stay relaxed.Hope I answered your query.

However ovulation can persist until the time in menopause and more and more women are conceiving later in life. If you are ovulating which can be suggested with a ovulation prediction kits, increase in basal body temperature and increased progesterone level in the luteal phase then conception can still be possible. In your specific case your FSH is on the higher end of normal but E2 is still within normal limits. An AMH level can let you know how much ovarian reserve you have left and conception may be possible with timed coitus, ovulation prediction, basal body temperature charting and recognizing signs of ovulation in your own body. Of course it is also important to verify the semen analysis of your male partner or prospective father of baby. At 43 years old it is also important to remember that there is an increased maternal age-related risk of having an anueploidy like trisomy 21 risk of approximately 1 in 50. A good OB/GYN generalist or reproductive endocrinology specialist can help to guide you in this endeavour."},{"Patient":"i have been trying to conceive for over 5 yrs with 2 different partners (seperately of course), my period is regular, 29 day cycle lasting exactly 3 days each month. i track my cycle closely to when the best time to have unprotected sex is but i am still unable to conceive. what should i do?","Doctor":"HIThanks for posting your query to Healthcaremagic .

Is there a possibility that I might be pregnant anyways? And if I was pregnant, how long would it take for the symptoms to occur?","Doctor":"Hello, thank you for posting your query to HCM.Withdrawal before ejaculation is not a 100% safe / pregnancy proof way. Although there is very little chance of conception without ejaculation, but its possibility cant be ruled out as precum also has the potential to do the same. If you had sex during your fertile window, I'd suggest you take a home pregnancy test on the day of your missed period (if at all you miss it). If you dont want to wait that long then you could also go and get your blood tested for BHCG.For pregnancy symptoms to occur, there is no hard and fast rule as it differs from individual to individual. Some women start feeling 'weird' since the day of conception. Many others don't feel any difference till 3-4 months.Usually a missed period is the first sign that you must look for. Others (tender breasts, acidity, lethargy etc) may or may not come.Hope this was helpful."},{"Patient":"i am 27 years old and suffer from high blood pressure which is treated by amelodopine 10mg and 5mg ramipril. i have PCOS, but currently having no treatment for it...i am 5ft 9 and weigh 110kg....my periods are irregular....but when they occur they are normal and last 5-6 days....we are trying to conceive....my gynac prescribed me primulot n to induce my periods and then letroz for 5 days starting from the 2nd day of my period and then dubagest 100(progestrone) from 16th day on wards....this is a 3 month course is this combination of medicine proven to aid conceiving a baby..i have heard that letroz cause malformation if i do conceive...would u advise to take these medicines...if not what would u advise?","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to healthcare Magic.I have gone through your query and Would like to reply in detail as follows:1.

If you tried continuously since all these months, then I'd suggest you to get your scan done for PCOD, ovarian and uterine physiology along with a detailed checkup for thyroid and other hormones, And blood tests. Your husband also needs to be investigated in details at the same time.  You could come back with all the reports to us, or you can see a doctor, with those reports. Meanwhile do not lose hope and keep trying, as there is no hard and fast rule for the ratio of success rate to the no. of attempts in this matter. Some couples are first time lucky, and many others take much longer to get that positive on their pregnancy test. Also dont stress over it, as it hampers one's chances of conceiving. Both you and your husband must follow a healthy lifestyle, that includes a combination of healthy mind, body and soul (excercises, healthy diet and peace of mind). With this, you should also keep in mind the basic pointers like keeping your waist slightly elevated with a pillow after intercourse, and not immediately visiting the toilet etc.All the best!"},{"Patient":"I always had urinary infection since my childhood.

But it occurs during the initial months after vasectomy and rarely occurs so late. Also you are still in the ovulation phase, so pregnancy takes at least 5-6 weeks to give rise to symptoms.The best way to know this is to get a semen analysis done for presence of sperms. If they are present then it indicates a failure. So most likely these symptoms are due to gastric trouble and stomach upset. Try eating yogurt and clear soups and take B complex vitamins.

There is no harm as long as you are not pregnant. From the month you are trying to conceive, it is better to avoid heavy exercises. But walking and upper body exercises can be continued.

The use of i pill reduces the chances of pregnancy by 89% if used within 72 hrs of unprotected intercourse..With your intercourse on friday, there is more chance to get pregnant as you were on your fertile period. It can cause menstrual irregularities, so it is always better to use alternate contraceptive method like condom's or OCP's. Hope i have answered yur queries.. Good day."},{"Patient":"Is it possible to get pregnant if we have sex during her 4 days of mensturation and ejaculated inside the vagina,  without any protection (pills,contraceptives, condoms, etc), or is it absolutely impoosible to get pregnant ? what about the 2 days before and after the 4 day mensturation period?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM..Thanks for writing.. It's possible — but highly unlikely.What is the period length? women who has shorter menstrual cycle like 24 day cycle, ovulation occurs on day 10, so intercourse around 7 th day makes sperm available in the genital tract. If the woman have longer cycle, then ovulation occurs late. Sperms can survive in the female genital  tract for 72 hrs but ovum can survive only for 24 hrs.Conception occurs when an egg and sperm meet in a fallopian tube. Sometime during the middle of your menstrual cycle, most likely between the 12th and 16th days, an egg reaches maturity in one of the two ovaries. The ovary releases the egg into the abdomen, where it's quickly sucked up by the tulip-shaped opening of the nearest fallopian tube.An egg can survive in your fallopian tube for about 24 hours after it's released from the ovary. So the only way you can get pregnant is if sperm are present in your fallopian tube during this window of opportunity. If the egg isn't fertilized, it's shed along with your uterine lining during your period.Fertile period in a 28 day cycle is 8-18 days. But periods can be mistaken for intermenstrual spotting, in that case time of ovulation varies. So its always better to take a contraceptive measure to prevent pregnancy. Hope i have answered your queries.. Good day."},{"Patient":"Iam 34 yr lady having a child of 5 year.Iam diabetic mellitas , takes no medicine only food control .My first pregnancy period full with insulin and thre was no risk for the child.But after delivery i got all my health and nearly three nears take to restore my health.IF any problem if i become pregnent at this stage at this age.What precautions should I take to better health","Doctor":"Hello and welcome,I competely understand the issue. If you attempt pregnancy now, most likely you will require insulin right from the beginning as pregnancy itself causes a diabetes like state which becomes more manifested in people who are already diabetic. Also you may need higher doses than in previous pregnancy. If the sugars are well controlled throughout the pregnancy then there should not be any issues for you as well as the baby. Everything depends upon the sugar levels. If they are controlled there are no risks. A proper diabetic diet and regular exercise will help keep the sugars down. Nothing extra needs to be done apart from this. So best of luck. Take care.Hope this satisfies your query. Thanks for using HCM.     Feel free to ask any more questions that you may have.

Your doctor has given the right modality of treatment.. Follicular study helps you to know the size and no of developing follicle. When the size of the follicle reaches approximately 20*20mm, hcg inj is given. Within 36 hrs, follicle will rupture. This is the time when sperms are necessary in the female genital tract.. Sperms can survive upto 72 hrs in the female genital tract but ovum will survive only for 24 hrs.. So timed intercourse should be in and around the time of ovulation.

From the information provided, my understanding is that you are on combined oral contraceptive pills containing LNG and ethinyl estradiol. Hence, I would say these COCPs are very good contraceptives and very less failure rate. But, in case there is a failure, the chance of ectopic pregnancy is higher. So, if you miss your usual periods or have spotting or pain abdomen, immediately get one urine pregnancy test and ultrasound scan of lower abdomen done.Another thing I should tell you that that these pills are not protective against sexually transmitted diseases. So, please be careful and ask your partner to use condom everytime during intercourse.Please also avoid multiple sexual partners (if applicable) and unprotected oral or anal intercourse (if applicable).If you or your partner develops any genitourinary symptom, both of you should visit the nearest STI clinic for further evaluation and treatment.Hope you are satisfied with my answer. If you have any further query related to this, please write back.In case you have any new query in future, you can directly ask me questions @  I will try my level best to help you.Regards,Dr. Kaushik"},{"Patient":"If I'm on debo birth control shot and I start talkn antibiotics can I get pregnant and how fast because I really want a baby If I'm on debo birth control shot and I start talkn antibiotics can I get pregnant and how fast because I really want a baby","Doctor":"Hello and welcome,Most of the depo shots last for 2 or 3 months depending upon the drug. Using antibiotics does not decrease the effect of depo. So this is not a way out.The effect of the shot wears off as soon as the stipulated duration is over and pregnancy is possible in the very next cycle. So you will just have to wait till the effect wears off and then you can conceive. All my good wishes are with you.Hope this satisfies your query.

My 3 female-relatives also have this disease. And i see many who visit gynecological clinic due to the similar problem.Yes, it is difficult to conceive with polycystic ovaries. This is because, polycystic ovaries often fail to release the egg, that is required for conception. Being over-weight is one of the risk factor. The aim of the treatment is, 1. Cycle regulation, 2. Treatment of the hormonal imbalance3. and the most important one, induction of ovulation (release of egg from ovary). You are taking the right treatment, metformin helps to lose weight and it also helps in the induction. You may discuss with your doctor about the addition of other medicines that help in ovulation induction. and i think one or more drugs that can be considered are missing from your list. There are other medicines also...! You may discuss it with your doctor, or you may change your doctor and visit someone who is well  qualified in the gynecological field.

Plz tell me what is my chances of being pregnant and what is the use of these medicines","Doctor":"Hello and welcome, I understand the issue well.Chocolate cysts are due to a condition called endometriosis where the uterine lining grows inside the abdomen and sheds there as in menstruation. So the collected blood becomes surrounded by other tissues and also as a reaction to this blood the surrounding tissue grows and engulfs it leading to a choicolate cyst. These are very common. However they do distort the normal anatomy of the reproductive organs and so problems with fertility arise. The medication prescribed to you are aimed to reduce the production of this menstrual blood inside the abdomen and if the cyst is tiny it may resolve. The folinext tablet is given to every woman trying to conceive as it helps in preventing brain defects in the baby.So you may try this for a few months. However if the cyst is big then it is better to do a folluicular study to see if ovulation is occuring or not and a surgical removal of the cyst along with the endometriotic implant is a better option. So kindly discuss this with your gynecologist and then go for further treatment. Hope this satisfies your query. Thanks for using HCM.     Feel free to ask any more questions that you may have.

They said it probably happened 8-9 weeks. I had a D&C at the end of July. I had been taking Clomid before the pregnancy and after with no luck. I did not take Clomid the month I actually concieved however. Then I moved on to a clinic to do IUI. Before I actually started treatment in April, I had a positive test result in March. Five days later it was negative. In April, I took Femara and did an unsuccessful IUI. Then, in June I had another positive test...only to have it negative within 2 days. Just this month, I did another unsuccessful IUI. Every time that I have had a positive test result, or the time I actually got pregnant, there has been NO medication or intervetion other than me tracking my ovulation. What would you do?

To get pregnant faster buy a thermometer and start taking your oral temperature at bed time daily from first day of periods. when egg is released in females(usually from 14th to 17th day of beginning of menstruation) ,body temperature is raised by half degrees and that is the ideal time to conceive. This is allow you to identify your fertile period. From next month you will have an approximate date of egg release and your husband can abstain from sex for 4-5 days prior to egg release. As soon as the temperature is raised, you can have intercourse for next 2-3 days. Best position for conceiving is straight with husband on top.

If test shows a block then it is unlikely to resolve without surgery. The surgery can be done using an open technique or using endoscopes. A hysteroscopic fallopian tube recanalisation procedure can also be done if possible and does not involve any incision on skin as it is done by an instrument introduced from the vagina and uterus. So discuss these options with your doctor. Also the success rate of these procedures and conception rate after surgery is not 100%. So please also clarify this with your doctor and then go ahead.

I am  interested in a baby now. Is there a way. My husband is very cooperative and is supporting me.  KAAMINI","Doctor":"Yes you can conceive after menopause also. This is possible by IVF, that is In - vitro Fertilisation.  IVF  is of two types : self and donor.If you have reached menopause you can undergo IVF donor. In this ovum, ie, the female egg cell of some other female is fertilised with sperm of your husband. After fertilisation the embryo is transferred to your uterus for implantation.In this you will conceive, get pregnant and on delivery you yourself can breast feed the baby. The thing to be consider is that if your menopause is confirmed and you opt to choose IVF donor then you will not be the biological mother of the baby. Discuss this with your husband and decide wisely."},{"Patient":"İ ve forgot to take one yasmin pill (6 left ) on the third week i took two at once when i remembered next morning , we used pull out method before two days that i forgot the pill no unsafe sex after forgetting the pill do i have the risk of pregnancy","Doctor":"Hello and welcome,It seems that you had unprotected sex before missing the pill.

If ovulation had occurred for more than 6 times in past with Fertyl/GoodOva tablets (indicated by regular period of 28-30 days while taking tablet), its better to go for laparoscopy to  know & correct the cause. If it has not occurred OR has occurred for less than 6 times, you can continue with the tablets.

Wondering whats chances of miscarriage again and can I start now ttc being that the bleeding has stopped. Also could I be miscarrying due to spouse being diabetic. Im 29 fairly healthy and have an 12 yr old son from previous relationship","Doctor":"Hello and welcome, I understand your query. It seems that you are having repeated pregnancy losses. It is best to get evaluaed for the cause first before attempting further pregnancies. Also we do not advise to try to concieve at least 3  months after a pregnancy loss. Most of the losses are due to genetic abnormalities and are non recurrent. However if there was a baby with turners then it is advisable that both you and your husband get a chromosomal analysis to look for possible minor genetic variations. Other causes of losses are TORCH group of infections, mother having thyroid or diabetes, antiphospholipd antibodies and conditions like SLE. So please see a gynecologist and get all of these ruled out. Diabetes in father rarely causes a problem until it has been really long standing for 20-30 years and then it causes mostly difficulty in conception. As of now, I suggest that you take folic acid tablets for three months as deficiency of this vitamin also causes brain defects in babies and abortions. if a cause is found during evaluation get it corrected first and then try to conceive. If no cause is found then try conception after completing 3 months of folic acid tablets, register early with a doctor in the next pregnancy and use drugs like duphaston and HCG injections next time to prevent abortions.

Please understand that drugs like siphene have thier own set of side effects. They cause thinning of the uterine lining and hence actually may prevent pregnancy if used for prolonged periods. It is not recomended to use siphene for more than 6 months.So my suggestion is that if you are having problems with conception please visit an infertility specialist and get evaluated for ovulation, open tubes and husabands semen count. Then the proper treatment can be formulated. For women that are having regular periods the ovulation occurs between day 10-20 of the cycle and keeping contact on these days has maximum chance of conception. Hope this satisfies your query.

Is there any chance that she is pregnant?","Doctor":"Assuming that she took the iPill within 72 hours of intercourse as you describe, she shouldn't be pregnant.  The fact that her period is delayed may be a result of the iPill which can sometimes cause irregular periods.  However, if you also had intercourse at any other time in the cycle, without taking the iPill or using another form of birth control,  then she could be pregnant.  I would recommend taking a pregnancy test either way, just to make sure she isn't pregnant.I hope this answers your question, please let me know if you need any more information."},{"Patient":"hi doctor, im 33 married for i year and yet to concieve.i was treated for genital TB when i was 18 and since then my menses are scanty. im on medication for the last 10 months now,presently on a fourth cycle of clomid. my endometrium lining shows only 5.5mm at its maturity. what should i do next?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome,Scanty menses indicate that most likely the endometrium was affected. Unfortunately the chances of pregnancy for endometrial tuberculosis are very low. Only 5 - 10% conceive. I understand that you are trying for a baby but it is best that you do know the chances of a successful outcome. As of now, I suggest that first a tubal patency test must be done to check if the tubes are open as TB damages the tubes. If they are open then estrogen patches can be used to help the endometrium to grow. If repeated clomid is used then it also further thins the endometrium so clomid is not recommended for more than 6 cycles. I prefer to combine it with an IUI procedure if tubes are open. For the long term if these measures fail then surrogacy using your own ovum is an option as you can have your own child with it. Hope this was helpful.Thanks for the query.

Meaning that the contact is occasional like say once in 6 months or so. The tablet must be taken within 72 hours of the sexual episode to be effective. Also it can be taken only once in one month. A new tablet is needed for every episode. Now about your case, as you had sex twice this month, the tablet will not protect for the first episode as I assume that it is already more than 72 hours sice then. For the second episode it will protect provided it is taken within 72 hours. So you will still be running the risk of pregnancy from the first episode even if you take the tablet for the second one. She may take the tablet if the sex was within 72 hours from now and it will protect against that sexual episode only.The risk of pregnancy is small from a single act and is higher if the sexual act is between day 10-20 as these days are more fertile for the female [more likely that ovulation occurs on these days] than the other days. For the future I suggest that you use some better method like condoms, pills, or injections, or implants to prevent pregnancy. Hope this satisfies your query.

Sometimes prolonged intercourse is necessary, while in other cases even a single intercourse may result in pregnancy as in rape. The timing of intercourse is important in this respect, 7 days prior to and immediately after periods is considered Safe period, that means intercourse during those days does Not result in pregnancy.

However treatment in the form of Metformin Or Clomiphene is present, Clomiphene being superior in inducing ovulation. It is usually given in starting dose of 50 mg on day 3, 4, or 5 of the menstrual cycle for 5 days. The maximum chance of ovulation is around midcycle. Therefore Intercourse should be encouraged daily 2 days prior to ovulation and on the day of ovulation. Intercourse prior to that doesn't effect the function of clomephene, Ovulation day can be deduced by daily temperature record or OPK( ovulation predictor Kit). If ovulation doesn't occur the dose of clomephene is increased by 50 mg during each cycle, but regular ultrasound should be done for the ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome.Regards"},{"Patient":"my AFB culture done during laproscopy, it was negative in interim report but positive in final report.

As the culture reported positive, your doctor would probably want to know the extent of involvement and plan a treatment regime accordingly. You have to avoid conception during this period. If your tubal function is normal and there is no endometrial involvement, you stand good chance of conception provided your ovarian function is not compromised due to the infection. Please discuss with your health care provider and plan further management. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"me and my partner are trying for a baby. I'm a bit confused with the ovulation calendar.

I checked the blood - Beta HCG count and it was arnd 262. I tested in another lab which was using Beckman Coulter access method and had some count difference. Is this ok? Should i have to test again?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome, Beta HCG may show slight variation if tested in different labs. Also if it is tested at different times [ meaning that you give a sample now in one lab and 6-8 hours later in another lab], the HCG level will have increased in your body in 6 hours as the baby is growing and HCG is constantly produced in increasing amounts. So the level will be different. Please compare results of one lab only as others may not necessarily be comparable due to difference in estimation methods and reference ranges.

You had an unprotected sex on 15-16th day of your cycle. That comes to be  possible ovulation phase of menstrual cycle.   - If ovulation had already ocured, it won't prevent conception,but it will have a bad effect on the embryo.    - If ovulation process  was yet to start, the pill may possibly postpone the ovulation for a couple of days & prevent pregnancy.

Folic acid is a vitamin whose deficiency produces brain defects in the baby. Hence it is given to every woman with pregnancy. So please continue it. Osnate is a calcium. It is preferable given after 12 weeks. However some studies suggest that it can prevent development of preeclampsia [ raised blood pressure during pregnancy] when given in the first 12 weeks. This is still debated and I prefer to start it after 12 weeks unless that patient has a history of preeclampsia. Dirogest is progesterone. It is used to prevent abortion. So empirical use will not cause any harm but may not have any benefits too. I prefer to use it when my patients have a history of recurrent abortions or have bleeding or pain during pregnancy. So please discuss about these two drugs with your doctor. If she feels that they are needed, then you may take them. They do not cause any harm to the baby. Hope this satisfies your query.

I understand the query. If you have regular cycles, the fertile period is from day 10-20. Keeping alternate day sexual contact on these days has the maximum chances of pregnancy. You can also use ovulation detecting kits and try to keep regular sexual contact during this time for maximizing the chances. It may take a few months for the contact to occur during ovulation so keep trying. Regarding conceiving in this cycle: it is difficult to say as it is unpredictable. But you have a good chance.Pregnancy test can be done 7 days after missing the periods using the first morning urine sample. Also start folic acid tablets to prevent brain defects in the baby.Best of luck.Hope this was helpful.

The endometriotic cyst us small and the fibroids are very tiny. So most likely the fibroids will not cause infertility. The same cannot be said about the endometriotic cyst because usually it is associated with endometriosis is the pelvis. This may cause adhesions of tube and may potentially cause problem in fertility. Ovulation will not be an issue for conception as usually every ovary releases an ovum alternate months. So sometimes the right ovary will release the ovum and other times the left will do it. So you have good chances of pregnancy when the left ovary is ovulating.It is not possible to comment upon weather you will conceive or not, unless this is tried and tested. So the solution is to try and conceive for 6 months spontaneously keeping track of ovulation and fertile period. If there is no result, then contact an infertility specialist and decide about future treatment. Meanwhile start folic acid tablets to prevent brain defects in the baby.

It seems that you have been using emergency contraceptive pills frequently and want to know if you are protected from pregnancy now. The pills are meant to protect a single act of intercourse in one cycle. The results of their effectiveness in preventing multiple acts are not available. Even then as you had a heavy period, pregnancy is not there from the previous two acts. You have again taken the pill after this period, so you may have an irregular period after this. The risk of pregnancy is also low immediately after the periods. So do not worry.  However I would like to inform you that these pills contain hormones and are not meant to be taken repeatedly. They are to be used only if there is unexpected occasional sexual intercourse. If the frequency of contacts is more than once or twice in 6 months it is better to use other methods like condoms [ if frequency is less] or contraceptive pills, injections or implants if frequency is high. They are more safe and more effective. As of now, do not worry. You are most likely not pregnant.Thanks for using HCM.Have a good day.Dr Nilajkumar Bagde     Consultant Obstetrics and Gynecology"},{"Patient":"hi,Last year i had miscarriage i was 8 week pregnant.Doc suggested me to go for TORCH TEST.Result was Rubella Igg 55.57 & IGm 0.12 and CMV IGG IS 10.24 Where as CMV IGm was 0.19.Are these results normal?I have not take any medicines.Now i am trying to conceive.Should i go head?kindly suggest.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome, You seem to have a torch test showing high titres of rubella and CMV.

This antibody comes after recovering from the infection and indicates that there was an infection in the past. The normal levels are less than 1. However your rubella and CMV IgG is a bit on the higher side even now. So please get it tested after a month or so and see if levels are decreasing.If they are decreasing you may attempt pregnancy.

Thank you","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM.If you people had unprotected sexual intercourse during unsafe period then chances of pregnancy are more. If you are preganant the HPT should come positive in atleast one test among the 8 tests you have done,I dont think all 8 HPTs will give false negatives. It would have better if you had visited a gynecologist by now. Their could be some other reason for missed periods or the way of doing HPT could be wrong. Please do it one more time using early morning urine sample, if that also negative you should defnitely consult a doctorNausea, diarrhea, cramps all could be due gastroenteritis caused by food poisoning. Dont be stressed and consult a gynecologist as early as possible.RegardsDr Santosh"},{"Patient":"HiMy gf last periods came was on 28th Oct, Iand my gf had unprotected sex on 21st Nov and she had taken unwanted 72 within 4 hrs and periods got delay by6 days.

I normally stay abroad and i have come to see my wife for 10 days . In the last ultrasound the gyno has told that my wifes right egg is fully matured and is ready to ovulate . Can you pls let me know the best time to mate . We have last made love 3 days ago . thanks .","Doctor":"Hello and welcome,I am Dr Nilajkumar a consultant gynecologist and I will be helping you in your queries. I understand that you have come back for a very short time. Unfortunately the mature egg report remains valid only for a day or two as the egg releases after this and if sexual contact occurs during that time pregnancy is possible. So please check if you had contact during the time the egg was likely to be released [ next 1-2 days after the scan].I will inform you a little about the female physiology and how pregnancy occurs. Every month a single female egg is produced and released to be fertilised by the male sperm. This occurs on day 14 of the cycle in women with regular cycles but may occur on any day from day 12-18. The egg is alive for only 24-36 hours and after that it is lost. So contact during this narrow time of egg release will result in pregnancy. Rest of the whole month sexual contact will not cause pregnancy. Normally couples have contact 2-3 times a week and in one of the month it happens during ovulation resulting in pregnancy. The day of ovulation can be judged by thinning of cervical mucus, increase in basal body temperature measured by a special thermometer before getting up from bed daily or using ovulation detecting kits. I hope that you understand it now and will be able to plan things accordingly. I am here to provide any more answers that you may need.Best of luck and thanks for using HCM.Have a good day.Dr Nilajkumar Bagde     Consultant Obstetrics and Gynecology"},{"Patient":"Hiiii    My last period was on 22nd november and still now I did'nt get my period.

However the second episode of sex on 29th was in the fertile period and pregnancy is possible. The days from 10-20 of a menstrual cycle are mostly fertile days when ovulation and pregnancy are more likely if sexual episode occurs. Rest of the days are less likely to be fertile as ovulation does not usually occur on these days. But it is advisable to use protection during every act as it is difficult to predict the exact days of ovulation.If you suspect pregnancy get a urine pregnancy test done 3 weeks after 29th to rule out pregnancy.

Folic acid and calcium with vitamin D3 tablets are easily available every where.  Unfortunately no other brand that I could find contains the same composition as ovacet. Also these are simple vitamins and calcium and are not aimed primarily to restore the hormonal imbalance in PCOD. If you have not got a PCOD profile testing done, get it tested on day 1 on menses. If there are hormonal imbalance treatment needs to be targeted against them for best results. Also treatment in PCOD depends upon if the female desires pregnancy or just regular periods. Treatment is different for both. Other drugs used are metformin, cyproterone and clomiphene depending upon what the patient wants [ pregnancy or periods].

The chances of pregnancy are directly proportional to the amount of damage suffered by the tube due to the disease. So you will need a tubal patency test to check if the tubes are open. If they are, then chances of spontaneous conception are good. If they are blocked, you may need a tuboplasty surgery to open them. An ovulation study will also help to see if the eggs are being released spontaneously as sometimes TB may spread to the ovaries and produce adhesions hindering ovulation. If these tests are OK chances of spontaneous conception are there. Regarding how much the chances are will depend upon the above two results. Hope I was able to help.

These are the days when ovulation is most likely and if the periods are very regular 4th to 8th are most fertile. If you had this episode during these days the chances of pregnancy are high. Nevertheless they are not zero on the rest of the days. So it is advisable to use unwanted 72 as soon as possible within 72 hours of the episode. So do not worry.

I had my periods on 30th of last month. I took Ipill not a complete one but half of it. Are there any chances of me getting pregnant. I am really afraid as I did not take one complete Ipill also.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome,I completely understand your situation. Unfortunately half the I pill may not provide complete protection. Just check which day of the cycle it was. Days 10-20 are fertile [counting from day 1 of periods]. Rest of the days are not likely to be fertile so chances of getting pregnant are less if sexual contact occurs on other days.If it was on fertile days, the only option now is to wait for your periods. If they come, you are safe, if they are missed get a pregnancy test done after 7-10 days to rule out pregnancy. Hope this satisfies your query.

I would suggest a serum beta-hCG titre assay along with a trans-vaginal sonogram. If pregnancy is excluded, you need further investigations like hormonal profile, general check up, blood counts, urinalysis etc. In the absence of pregnancy, a missed period could mean hormonal imbalance caused by several factors like sudden weight changes, stress, infections or certain medications and once everything is clarified, a period may be induced.

Many a times females don't acheive orgasm in initial years, but that does not mean pregnancy can't occur.For conceiving early, you should try in your ovulation days which are roughly middle 14 days of your cycle, to be more precise in a 30 days cycle, from 12-20 days.

Monitoring through ultrasound and clinical guidance is needed in such procedures since there is always albeit a slight risk of causing ovarian hyper stimulation.

These medications help in monitoring insulin levels in the body and thus help in ovulation. Once ovulation is regularly established, you can proceed with your plan to conceive. Please remember, regular monitoring is necessary while on this medications as there is a risk of ovarian hyper stimulation. Please maintain a healthy weight and a healthy diet.

You do not have to worry as your chances of conception are nil. Firstly, you had the intercourse during the safe period and secondly, you had the emergency pill within the stipulated time interval.

Unfortunately there is nothing like a weak ejaculate. The sperms are stored in the male genital tract in large numbers and small number of good sperms are sufficient to cause pregnancy. So it is best if she uses another method like an emergency contraceptive pill [plan B] within 72 hours of sex, preferably within 12 hours] to avoid any unwanted pregnancy.

I am married.... and I want baby now .. Bt I have ovarian cyst.. I take medicen and that is cured now.Bt I am not getting pregnant ... would u.pls tell me some exercise or any other tips that can help me to conceive as early as possible.","Doctor":"Hello and thanks for the query, I would first explain to you about the female reproduction and then some ways to recognize when is the best chance of getting pregnant. The female is designed in such a way that every month on about the 14th day of a regular 28 days cycle, one female egg called ovum is released from the ovary and it goes to the tube and gets fertilized by a male sperm if there has been a recent sexual contact. So if sexual contact occurs during ovulation then only pregnancy will result. Having contact on all other days of the month will not lead to pregnancy. The day of ovulation varies and it may occur on any day from day 10-20 from the first day of the menses. hence this is called the fertile period. So for having a maximum chance of getting pregnant a healthy female egg, an open female genital tract [ that is no block in tubes, cervix and a normal uterus and its lining] are important. Ovulation can be detected by measuring the body temperature every day before getting up from bed using a special thermometer called a BBT thermometer. After ovulation the female body temperature increases by about 0.5 to 1 degree. Another way is to check the cervical mucus. the mucus is thin and watery during ovulation period. Special ovulation detecting kits and sonography can also be used to detect it. As of now I recommend you try to keep alternate day sexual contact between day 10-20 of the cycle for 6 months. If there is no success, visit an infertility specialist to look for any cause for not getting pregnant. Also start taking b complex and folic acid tablets if you are planning pregnancy as they help prevent birth defects in the baby.

Me & my hubby is 30 years old i m trying to conceive last 5 years but till here is not any issue. I have done HSG & Laproscopy. According to doctor my one tube is patient but till i don't conceive.so what you suggest us for conceiving","Doctor":"Hello and thanks for the query, Since you have already attempted pregnancy for 5 years, I assume that husbands semen analysis has been done and is normal. I also assume that endometritis and endometrial tuberculosis have been ruled out by histopathology and culture tests after laproscopy. If this has not been done, it needs to be ruled out as if a tube is blocked there was most likely a tubal infection sometime and a concomitant endometrial pathology may be present. If the above reports are normal then you may go for a ovulation study and if the ovary on side of the open tube is ovulating, get an Intrauterine insemination [IUI] in that cycle. Sometimes there is problem with ascent of sperm inside the cervix to the tube, so IUI helps in such cases. If there is still no luck either a tuboplasty procedure to open the blocked tube may be done. Hope this helped. Best of luck and I am sure you will conceive. A few more efforts and a positive attitude will help.Thanks for using HCM, have a good day.Dr Madhuri BagdeConsultant obstetrics and gynecology."},{"Patient":"Hi .

If you cannot read the urine test properly, you should go for the serum beta-hCG titres along with a trans-vaginal sonogram to clarify the issue. The spotting could possibly be due to an implantation bleed, but, it needs to be clarified. If pregnancy is excluded, you could be having slight hormonal imbalance which is common now and then whenever there is some stress, infection, weight disturbance etc. Such a disturbance usually gets corrected spontaneously.

This is because the fertilized egg takes about 6 days to travel and implant in the wall of the uterus. The cause of the spotting during intercourse could be due to trauma, any local factors like cervicitis, erosions or polyps or vaginitis and since it happened around ovulation, could be related to ovulation as well. You should see a specialist for a local exam to locate the cause of the spotting. You should wait for your next normal period and go for a HPT 3-7 days later if you miss it.

So I have tried to answer it both ways. Taking duphaston from day 5-14 of the cycle may not prevent pregnancy. The regimen that you are taking is not related to contraception and is not supposed to provide contraception.It is a progesterone analogue. The initial part of the menstrual cycle is dominated by estrogen hormone and progesterone comes in the later part. so theoretically, duphaston may prevent or delay ovulation by altering the hormone levels but this is not a guarantee. The cycles have become regular because of the drug. Ovarian cysts usually prevent ovulation, so regular cycles with duphaston does not necessarily mean that you may be ovulating. This means that if you are taking this drug and have an ovarian cyst, it is impossible to comment upon ovulation and pregnancy. The best way to know if you are ovulating with duphaston is by doing an ovulation study. If you desire contraception, it is advisable to use another method like condoms. If contraception is desired, Injectable depo progesterones like depo provera will be useful in both cysts and preventing pregnancy. So please discuss this with your doctor in details and then decide.

Did you mean Khushi? - it contains mifepristone and misoprostol and is an abortificient. These are used for inducing an abortion only after pregnancy is confirmed and are to be taken after consulting a gynecologist as some complications like an ectopic pregnancy need to be ruled out before taking the drug. However in your case, you have taken them before getting pregnant. So they have no role. The neil 72 is an emergency contraceptive so it prevents ovulation if it has not already occurred. So this was a good measure. However if you have had a superficial contact and no penetration, the chances of getting pregnant are low. I suggest that as of now, you must wait for your period and if you want to rule out pregnancy it may be done by a blood test if the period is missed [as you had contact around day 16 [ this is an unsafe day or fertile day of the cycle ], and a urine test 10 days after the missed period in your case to rule out pregnancy. Most likely you will have a period before that.  Hope this satisfies your query. Thanks for using HCM.     Feel free to ask any more questions that you may have.

The problem won't be solved by taking Deviry for one cycle. First, we need to check your ovarian reserve with one blood test AMH. Irregular periods can happen at both extremes: that is high ovarian reserve (PCOS) & low ovarian reserve. If reserve is good, go for ovulation induction medicines. If its low, you need some active treatment, may be IVF/ICSI.Hope this helps you.Regards."},{"Patient":"I have been off the implant for 6 months and hav been trying consecutively since den with no luck . And I don't know why. How long does it take to live your system . I already have a son. And I have started. Taking pregnacare conception . How will it increase my chances","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM,I understand your issue. There are two questions. The first is how long will it take for the implant to leave your system:If you have been off the implant for 6 months, the drug is no longer in your system. The drug clears out of the body within 48 hours of removing the implant. So this is not an issue. However, it may take some time for a few females for the fertile cycles to return. It is usually immediate after stopping the implant but may take upto 6 months in a few women foe fertile cycles to return. Another thing is that every month there are only few days when sexual contact will result in pregnancy. For a women with regular 28 days cycle, the fertile days are from day 10-18 from the first day of the previous menstrual cycle. These are the days when the female egg is released [ovulation ] and is available for uniting with the sperm for pregnancy to occur. It is advisable to keep contact on alternate days during this period for maximum chances of pregnancy.Second query is about pregnacare conception: The tablets contain many minerals and vitamins that help to prevent deficiency of these during pregnancy so that the baby gets optimal amounts of these. Some of these vitamins are helpful as their deficiency may lead to defects in the baby and these are avoided by taking these before pregnancy. It will not help in conception, will not increase your chances of conception as it is not meant for that, but it will help in having a healthy baby. I suggest that you continue the tablets for 1-2 months and try to keep contact during the fertile period. If you do not conceive within the next 2-3 months, you see a fertility specialist and get tested for the cause if any. I think that as you already have one baby, you should not have any problems in conceiving the second time. Just do not worry. Best of luck.Hope this satisfies your query.

It is possible to have twins with clomiphene but it does not mean that higher doses necessarily mean higher number of babies. It is not possible to predict who will have twins and who will not. The only way to have guaranteed multiple pregnancies is by doing a test tube baby procedure and transferring multiple embryos inside the uterus. So please do not attempt to take higher doses unless recommended by your doctor as very medicine has adverse effects. Also please take any fertility enhancing medicine only after consulting an infertility specialist as repeated indiscriminate use of these drugs lead to poor results later. Also as you have had a miscarriage, it is better to have a single baby as chances of miscarriage are also more in twins. Please do not worry about these issues so much. Consult an infertility specialist if you have problems with conceiving. If the first pregnancy was spontaneous then this is also not needed at this point of time. You may get evaluated for abortions [but we generally recommend it after repeated abortion and not if it was the first time]. Take prenatal vitamins and calcium and follow a healthy sleep and exercise pattern. Also get registered with your doctor early in the next pregnancy and take supportive drugs like HCG and progesterone to help prevent any further mishaps. I am sure you will do well.

Try sexual contact on alternate days during this period for best results. Also ovulation detecting kits may be used to see the actual days of ovulation and contact during those days increases chances of pregnancy.

But it seems that the other factors of the body like anemia,resistance, etc are not supporting the treatment.                       In P.C.O.S ovulation is inhibited, so the processes you have mentioned are not suited.                      I advise you to consult a gynecologist for diagnosis and treatment. You need a treatment for a longer periods,with intermittent scanning to sea the ovaries condition.                       Take more of green leafy vegetables,pulses,sprouts,and protein rich foods to have blood,general health and resistance against infections.

I understand your concern.    Unwanted 72 is an emergency contraceptive pill, and it should not be taken as a regular contraceptive pill. It is meant for emergency situations when you have unplanned unprotected sex.    I strongly suggest you to stop taking the pill as regular as you are taking it now, because it sure does have side effects and a could cause permanent changes to your menstrual cycle too. It does have a effect on your chances of getting pregnant in the future.     I advise you to meet a gynaecologist at the earliest who will prescribe you a regular contraceptive pill which you can take daily to prevent pregnancy, also you could ask your partner to use condoms to avoid taking pills.Hope this helps, and answers your query satisfactorily.Do write back to me if you need further assistance,Wish you good health,Take care.Regards."},{"Patient":"Best ways to get pregnant naturally over 40, for the first time? Many years ago diagnosed with pcos, but for past 3 years, periods regular on regular 28-31 day cycle. body has self regulated. I am slim, healthy, eat mainly organic food and have never been on the pill. Any advice?","Doctor":"Hi,Though the number of ova starts dwindling with advancing age, 40 is not certainly late for conceiving naturally. First of all, you should undergo investigation to proclaim yourself fit to try natural conception. Tests for ovulation, tubal patency, male factor and hormonal imbalances are all necessary. Ovarian reserve needs to be counted considering your age. If everything is fine, you may give a try for about six months with regular intercourse monitoring the ovulation period. Aided reproduction may be needed after failed natural trial for 6 months, further delay would reduce your chances of conception. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"i m a 33 years old virgin. i had my first oral sex 2 weeks ago. since then my vaginal secretions have increased tremendously. and when i looked by z mirror. i can see a hole. i can see clearly my vaginal opening. did my hymen break ? i had no bleeding or pain. but i m too worried now. we had some massage with my bf penis. can i get pregnant by the pre- cum ?? or external ejaculation ?","Doctor":"Hello, I would be happy to help you with your question.First of all, the increase in vaginal secretions is probably normal related to increased \\"sexual\\" activity.  But if there is any itching, burning or odor, you need to get checked out for common infections.  Second, the hymen is not necessarily \\"closed\\" and it is normal to see an opening through the hymen.  If you are worried, this also can be ascertained on an exam.  Finally, you cannot get pregnant from oral sex or ejaculate anywhere outside of the vagina.I hope that this helps and good luck!"},{"Patient":"hi i have been diagnosed with pco at the age off 14.

It is good that you are already doing your part in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. This is a very important aspect in the treatment of hormone imbalances. Further, since you are trying to conceive, you should go through the proper protocol of investigation. This includes a complete hormone assay, sonogram of the pelvis preferably in the trans-vaginal route, blood counts, tubal patency tests and urinalysis. Evaluation of the male partner also is important. Further management can be planned accordingly.

It is also possible that the test was just done too early based on some minor irregularity in terms of when you ovulated.  Here is what you should do:1.  Recheck the pregnancy test one week after the missed period2.  If the test remains negative, then talk to your doctor about progesterone to induce a period3.

I have also had dizzy spells a couple of time after standing for a while.

Either you are pregnant or you are not.  If you truly feel pregnant and do not trust the urine tests, then a blood test will put this question to rest.

An emergency pill is meant to be used only a couple of times a year; else, it can lead to catastrophic patterns of menstruation.

Emergency contraception can be of use only when used soon after an intercourse and not at any part of the cycle.

It is needed to have a complete investigation to gauge the extent of hormonal imbalance present as the condition is most often associated with other hormonal imbalances as well apart from those of the ovary. Metformin often helps in ovulation as insulin resistance which is an usual accompaniment, is cleared. Maintenance of a healthy weight, regular exercise and a healthy diet are also needed. To prevent the leakage of semen, use the prone position, i.e., lying on your stomach for at least half-an-hour after intercourse. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hii i m 26yrs old i m trying to conceive from last 3yrs. i have undergone laproscopy in 2011 i had a cyst in ovary that was been cured. nw from 1 yr i had undergone usg every month the problem is the ova which is released get bigger in size and forms a cyst and after my periods the cyst is not there.... i m on ovares tab and consevel and fertyl 50mg for 5 days during d 2nd day of my periods... plzzz help hw can i conceive?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for the query. Usually after reaching sufficient size the ovarian follicle will release the ovum.Intercourse should be planned during that period of ovulation to increase the possibility of pregnancy. If ovum is not getting released after ovulation, that could be a condition called lutenized unruptured follicle. This can occur due to hormonal imbalance. So this time better to go for hormonal supplementation from the beginning of the cycle. And go for HCG injection at the time of expected ovulation with your doctor's advice. Possibly this can help in increasing the chances of fertility. If not you may need to go for artificial reproductive measures. Take care."},{"Patient":"I am 29 yrs old and completed my 7 yrs of married life but still unable to conceive, I have got cleared my fallopian tube as both of them were blocked and after which I suffered with infection and could able to conceive and took medicine for the same after which got for the follicular test and development is found but not ruptured Please give an advice to get conceive.

It can be due to male or female causes or  due to a combination.In terms of your partner, you are right in assuming that he would need a semen analysis. The cost would vary according from one lab to the next. He can either consider speaking to his urologist , speaking to a lab directly to find out the cost.In terms of your investigations, your doctor would need to assess the different aspect of the reproductive system- the uterus, ovaries, tubes, cervixThis would involve both imaging and blood tests. You should consider visiting your gynaecologist or a fertility specialist.Even if issues are found with either of you there are effective techniques available that may be able to help you conceive.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"doctor i have unprotected sex on 3rd day of my period 23rd january my period stoped on next day and i hab unwanted 72 in 48 hr of unprotected sex.then  on 6th feb i have protected sex and also took unwanted 72.on 13th feb i have some bleeding continuing 3days.nd stoped.it was brown coloured .1)is this symptom of pregnency??2)if not when i got next period??","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM.Unprotected sex done on 3rd day of periods will not cause pregnancy.Protected sex followed by emergency contraception should also not cause pregnancy.Pregnancy is least likely in your case.

Is it possible for me to be pregnant even if I haven't had my first normal cycle after ending birth control? We had sex on 2/2/14, 2/6/14, and 2/9/14. I have be feeling weird like I may be pregnant.  I have cramping on one side, slight nausea, tenderness in my breast and discomfort when my bladder is full. If I have conceived, this will be my third pregnancy, my youngest child is 5. When is the earliest I can test by urine and blood? Thank you","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for the query. It is possible to get pregnant even before you get a normal cycle after stopping birth control pills. You have not even missed your period yet so it is very early to say if pregnancy has occurred. The breast discomfort, nausea and tenderness are non specific. They may be due to pregnancy or even premenstrual syndrome that occurs in some women before menses. The earliest that pregnancy can be detected is by a blood test after about 28-30 days or just around the missed period and by a urine test 7-10 days after the missed period. Please do not be so anxious. You have been through all this. Just relax. I suggest that you start tablet folic acid as it helps in the babies brain development. Hope I was able to help you.

So a D&C [better still a laparoscopy with hysteroscopy ] may be needed depending upon the above results. It is best if you have an infertility specialist guide you and help you through.

So the treatment started is fine. Metformin helps to sensitize tissue to insulin and weight loss does the same. The best management is weight loss by daily exercise and proper diet that helps restore the hormonal mileu.Also you have tried for only 5 months. It is suggested that a couple must try to conceive for at least 8-12 months spontaneously before undergoing any infertility treatment. The main issue in PCOD is anovulation meaning ovum is not released to get fertilized. I suggest that you try the weight control and metformin for 2 months and then get an ovulation study [ultrasonographic] done to see if ovulation is occurring. If it is, then you may need to practice sexual contact on those days to achieve pregnancy. If there is no ovulation with this treatment, you may need some ovulation inducing drugs along with follicular study and HCG to achieve ovulation.These are common issues nowadays and many women in my OPD suffer from this problem. Please do not worry as the chances of pregnancy are good if you take proper treatment and follow your infertility specialist. Hope I was able to help you. Thanks for using Health Care Magic.

I am a young married... since six months I'm trying to get pregnant I do not know what happens I have a 28-31 day cycle AC still does not work let me know if I can consume ovamid or clomid without prescription? there is no side effects that can harm.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for the query.I suggest that you stop worrying regarding pregnancy as you seem to have fairly regular cycles. Also you are married since six months, so there is no need to worry regarding conception. Clomid or ovamid induces formation of ova and ovulation. However it will help only in those women who are unable to conceive due to problems with ovulation. Also when they are taken for a long period, they themselves hamper conception as they cause other changes that do not allow pregnancy to occur. In your case, you have not been investigated for this, meaning we do not know if you actually have ovulation issues. So I would not recommend you to take these drugs without proper investigation. Remember that maximum chances of conception occur in the ovulatory period which is around day 12-18. I recommend that you have sexual contact every alternate day during this part of your cycle for best chances of getting pregnant. Also start taking prenatal vitamins like  folic acid for a month as this helps to prevent birth defects in  the baby.Hope I was able to help you.Thanks for using HCMHave a good day.

Pre-cum usually doesn’t contain sperm. But some men’s reproductive systems leak small amounts of sperm into their pre-cum. There’s really no way for a guy to know if he’s one of the guys who have sperm in his pre-cum or not.So it’s unlikely but still possible to get pregnant from pre-cum. The most likely way to become pregnant is through unprotected vaginal intercourse.Since she had taken plan B and she had light periods, she may not get pregnant.So at last, remember that pre-cum isn’t guaranteed to be sperm-free.

Please tell me , whether she can get pregnant","Doctor":"HelloThanks for writing to us with your health concern.PCOS is a condition characterized by baseline hormonal imbalance.In this condition, the cause is unknown.The ovaries get studded with multiple small cyst like follicles.None of them gets matured every month, hence, ovulation is erratic and periods are irregular.Regarding the follicular study, I cannot comment anything, because you have not mentioned the cycle day.The follicle size seems to be good, and the endometrial thickness also is fine.Normally on day fourteen of a normal twenty eight day cycle, the egg should be around 18 - 22 mm in size.That is when ovulation will occur.In this case, as you have not written the cycle day, continue the monitoring.WHen the egg size is optimum, ovulation would occur which also would show up on the scan.Please remain sexually active around the time of ovulation to ensure pregnancy.IF she does not ovulate, drugs like clomiphene citrate might be required next time.All the best.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi!

Also, how soon after leep can we begin trying to conceive again?","Doctor":"HelloThanks for writing to us with your health concern.You need not worry about the LEEP healing.An acute cold , cough and URTI will not interfere with its healing.One acute episode of illness will not drastically lower your immunity at all.LEEP has to heal in a few weeks ' time, and it will.So stop worrying on that count.Regarding conception, please avoid sexual activity for atleast 6 weeks following LEEP.Also, after the 6 weeks period is over, then continue using condoms to avoid further cervical erosions or infections for atleast 3 months.Please have a review examination with a gynaecologist after 3 months of LEEP, in order to have a proper per speculum and per vaginum examination.This will confirm that the cervix and the LEEP has healed properly.After that you can definitely continue to try naturally for conception.Just that there might be anticipated difficulties in normal labour and delivery.A C section might be required to deliver the child.All the best.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi i had my period on 4th january 2014 iv been having unprotected sex with my husband on and off since 11th january we are trying for a baby i already have two children my cycle is normally 28days im am due to start my period on 2nd februardy i have had on and off brown discharge spotting, it is not loads just like a very small amount","Doctor":"Hello, I would be happy to help you with your question. In women who have regular cycles, and counting the first day of your period as day#1, then conception is most likely to occur around day#14 = January 17th for you.  Given that fertility has not been a prior issue, and your timing is good, then your chance of pregnancy is actually quite high.  The spotting might be the earliest sign of pregnancy.  Even if you have bleeding that you might think is your period, make sure that you check a pregnancy at about the time of your next period's due date or a little later. I hope that this helps and good luck!"},{"Patient":"Dear!

Looking at the way your menstrual pattern has been this cycle, it appears as though you have had a a metropathic cycle and this implies that you did not ovulate.

Just wondering what my possibilities are.","Doctor":"Hello,There is no possibility of attaining a natural pregnancy through spontaneous ovulation after being proclaimed through tests to have attained menopause. Of course, through hormonal therapy and assisted reproduction, it is still possible to get pregnant, owing to your age and the fact that your uterus could be responsive to hormones so far. You may approach an infertility specialist if you are seriously thinking about a pregnancy at this stage. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Female: As I am nw 27 years old, I want to get pregnant ASAP.

If yes then how to cure it & what is the solution for it?","Doctor":"Hi,Wetness during sexual intercourse is a natural phenomenon and is for lubrication. Unless it poses a serious problem, it does not hinder conception. It is due to the secretions from the vagina as well as the Bartholin's glands. To conceive, you need to time your intercourse during your fertile days, i.e., during the mid-cycle. If you cannot conceive naturally even after trying sincerely for six months, you should get expert help to aid you further through investigations and treatment, if any.

Though your endometrium seems to be slightly thinner for this period of the menstrual cycle, it is the timing of intercourse with ovulation that is most important. Try to get contact at least on alternate days during the fertile days to enhance the chances of conception. Please monitor ovulation for better results, either through follicular study, basal body temperature charts or ovulation tests. Hope you find this information useful.

Once semen dries sperm is dead, so there is no chance of pregnancy if you touch her vagina with dried semen on your hands, but the same cannot be said for the penis.

Unprotected coitus over a period of three years would have usually caused a pregnancy. If you have irregular cycles which is common in teens then ovulation and pregnancy may not occur. As you enter your twenties and cycles regularise you may conceive.another reason may be unprotected coitus causing infection and blocking the fallopian tubes.

Size of the uterus and endometrial thickness will increase in pregnancy. After miscarriage, it will take some time for these things to come to normal level. As you underwent ultrasound on the day of miscarriage, that might have shown bulky uterus and thickened endometrium. As there are no retained products, if you are not having heavy bleeding, no need to undergo D&C.The endometrial thickness will gradually decrease. Possibly after next menstrual cycle it will come to normal level. Better to take at least two months gap for next pregnancy. By that time your reproductive organs will come to normal level and your general health will improve. After regularization of your menstrual cycle, track the ovulation and plan intercourse around that period. This will increase the possibility of pregnancy.

Repeat FSH and LH ( if not done earlier on day 2 of periods ).2. AMH3. Pelvic ultrasound scan done transvaginally.4. DHEAS, free testosterone5. Fasting serum insulin, OGTT, Lipid ProfileExercise regularly and eat healthy.There is no cure as such for PCOD, but medications like Metformin often help to improve symptoms, such as irregular cycles and excessive hair growth.Women with PCOD often face difficulties in conception due to erratic ovulation, but yes, most go on to conceive after treatment.Cycles can be regulated with cyclical progesterone therapy ( if you wish to conceive ) or oral contraceptive pills.Do not delay pregnancy for long.Take regular folic acid supplements.When you start planning for a baby, first try naturally for the first 6 months ( checking for your ovulation by ultrasound as your cycles are irregular ).IF you fail to conceive, seek medical guidance.Medications like clomiphene citrate would mostly be required in your case to induce ovulation, and then pregnancy can definitely be achieved.Minimize stress and worry, as it will negatively impact the hormones.Stop taking Ayurvedic medications - it will worsen your problem.All the best.Please feel free to discuss further."},{"Patient":"My husband and I are trying to get pregnant.

What should I do doc?","Doctor":"Hi,If you have always had regular 28-30 day cycles even without the pills, you can suspect pregnancy now; if this is the first month after stopping pills, you may expect some menstrual irregularity as ovulation can get delayed. So, please wait for 3-4 days before you take a home pregnancy test with a fresh early morning sample of urine. If you wish for an earlier and better confirmation, you can get the serum beta-hCG levels assessed coupled with a trans-vaginal sonogram. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, I'm getting married in January and will become sexually active.  Seeing as how I have no experience what so ever, I'm just wondering if I should let him ejaculate in me, I will be on the pill but I'm not sure what my chances are of getting pregnant if he does this, also we aren't going to use condoms.  Please help?","Doctor":"Hi, I have read your question and would like to give my opinion.In my opinion it should not be a problem if he ejaculates in you, if you would be taking oral contraceptive pills, as oral contraceptive pills are 99% effective if taken perfectly, means it should be taken everyday at same time without missing a single dose. If you miss any single dose , chances of accidental pregnancy become high.Hope this answer is helpful.ThanksDr.Pari"},{"Patient":"hi..my periods are very painful so the doctor adviced to take femilon till i get married.I started using femilon 4 months back and my last two packs I used without taking the 7 day break?I had unprotected sex while using femilon.Is there a possibility for me to get pregnant because i didnt break for my periods in between?","Doctor":"Hello, I would be happy to help you with your question. While on birth control pills, your chance of getting pregnant is extremely low.  Consider that without birth control pills the risk is about 15-20% per cycle, and with birth control pills, it is less than 5%.  It is not zero, however.  Also, skipping the placebo pills does not increase the risk of pregnancy. I hope that this helps and good luck!"},{"Patient":"My periods seem to he around 3 days long. 33 day cycle.

This medicines contains a hormone levonogestrel and the bleeding a few days after taking it was withdrawal bleeding, not proper menses. That is why, it is common for the next cycle to be either early or late, and the flow heavy or low. It is good that you did the pregnancy tests.

Since your wife consumed two tablets too soon, the effect would be more. She was in the fertile period around 25th December and if there was a contraceptive failure and if no other precaution was taken, there is a likelihood of conception. This can be diagnosed by taking a serum beta-hCG around the expected period and in your case, you may need to repeat the test after a couple of days and go for a trans-vaginal sonogram also.

In the present scenario, you should ideally wait for some time before trying to conceive again as your uterus seem to be very irritable.

Given the location of the fibroids (down near the cervix) there is no doubt that that this can affect the ability for sperm to get into the uterus and up to the fallopian tubes.

Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"If you are taking the pills the way you describe, then you should be protected from pregnancy.  You are taking the pills properly.  Your period may be very light this time, and that is normal when taking the pills.  Some women don't bleed at all with their periods when they are on the pills, especially after taking them for a while.  this is normal and nothing to be concerned about.  Of course, you can take a pregnancy test to make sure, but I don't think that is necessary at all.  Just keep using the pills and you will be fine.  I hope this was helpful to you, take care."},{"Patient":"Im am worried on this sat 12th sep my bf rubbed his penis on my vagina  he did not cum...i was with orgasm but then i immediately pushed him away and was my genital area with soap...is there a chance to geg pregnant..do i have to use a contraceptive pill my last period date was on sep 30th","Doctor":"Hi.

My doctor has told me that my chances of getting pregnant are little to none based on my irregular periods, missed periods for months at a time and other info I've related.  I'm going to be sexually active again and don't plan on using birth control because my doctor said it wasn't necessary.  My FSH  hasn't reached the menopausal level.  In any event, should I worry about conceiving?","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicIt is not likely that you would conceive based on the fact that you state that you have irregular periods.If you are still not menopausal , however, it would be best to cover yourself till you reach this point to prevent accidental conception.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"On 20 dec I had an physical contact with my gf...

Plssss ... tel me..","Doctor":"If she took the pills within 72 hours of the event that you described, it is very unlikely that she is pregnant, especially since you did not ejaculate inside her vagina.  It is not uncommon for the morning after pill to cause irregular periods for that cycle until things become normal again, and that is probably why she is having the unusual period.  Her cycles will probably become normal again within the next few weeks, if they don't she should call her doctor."},{"Patient":"Hi , I m 17 years old. Me and my bf had sex on Saturday we used protection. Afterward I gave him oral till he came then about 20 mins after he came , he inserted his penis in me for about 8 second then took it out .

Although I think it is very unlikely that you got pregnant, you might consider taking a morning after pill just to make sure.  These are available without a prescription from a pharmacy, and they are very effective in preventing pregnancy as long as you take the medicine within 3 days after having sex.  It is great that you used a condom, and you always should to protect yourself from unwanted pregnancy and STds.  However, you should also talk to your doctor about starting a reliable form of birth control so you don't have to worry about pregnancy at this time in your life."},{"Patient":"Hiwe r making family planning...but not sure we r going tge ryt way or not...coz we hv been trying last six months...just need to know do.we need to go for hormone count test...?We hv completd two years of our marriage.Please help me with my query.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for the query. To increase the possibility of pregnancy, you have to plan unprotected intercourse around the time of ovulation. If your cycles are irregular, consult gynecologist once and go for investigations like :- Ultrasound- Thyroid hormonal profile-Prolactin levels estimation - Blood sugar levels etc. For your husband semen analysis. If your doctor recommends you may need to go hormonal profile including estrogen, progesterone, LH and FSH. With this workup if there is any problem in fertility, that can be detected and treated. You can go for follicular study to track the ovulation and plan intercourse around that period. This will increase the possibility of pregnancy.

I took fertomid 50 mg for initial 6 months and then tried naturally. Nothing worked than I did one IUI , that did not work , this was in Jan 2013. My doc asked me to do HSG and both the tubes came blocked and suggested laproscopy. We did lap in feb 2013, left tube was corrected but right was already ok so nothing done. We did 2 IUI in May and June 2013, My husband's report was not ok during this time, he has kept on medication for few months, his numbers improved. We did 2 more IUI's in the month of oct and dec 2013, sperm count and other things were good and follicle size was  good too but IUI was not sucessful. I would like to know shall we be trying more IUI's or IVF should be thought next? My last 4 IUI's were with injections and medicine.Can IUI work in our case? or it is not a option for us now?","Doctor":"Hi. If everything is fine and you both have been worked up properly, then IVF is a good option.You are already 33 and slowly after 35, ovarian reserve also starts going down. If you have not succeeded by 4 iui's, may be there is still some problem in tubes, like some adhesions or improper tubo-ovarian relationship or any hidden cause which has not allowed iui to be successful. You may take a chance for 1-2 times more and it also depends on affordability for IVF procedure. There also result is not 100%. So you both have to decide and take chance.

Usually after giving injection, ovum can get released between 24 to 48 hours. The doctor might have told you to plan intercourse on 13th day because:- Ovulation can occur before injection also, as the follicle reached sufficient size. - Sperms can survive for 48 to 72 hours. So, better to plan the intercourse on 13th to 16th days. This will increase the possibility of pregnancy. The possibility of having pregnancy in one follicular study ranges from 25% to 50%.So, hopefully you may get pregnancy this time if all other factors are normal.

As there is history of miscarriage, better to be careful from the beginning. If possible avoid journey after conception. If that is not possible, you can go for progesterone pills in the second half of the menstrual cycle with your doctor's advice. Possibly they can help in implantation and in preventing miscarriage. Once pregnancy gets confirmed, better to avoid this type of journey. Choose some other route. If doing job is a must, you have to continue the pregnancy undercover of progesterone pills and injections at least till completion of first trimester.

In IVF embryo can be grown to certain stage outside. But after that it should be inserted into uterus and finally endometrium is needed for its growth. So, as your doctor told it may be difficult to continue a pregnancy. You once go for ultrasound.

Poly cystic ovary disease usually presents with irregular menstrual cycles, anovulation, insulin resistance etc. So your previous irregular periods could be due to this.

However, only a rapid pregnancy test can tell whether for real you are pregnant or not as even unprotected sex can lead to pregnancy. I will advice that you wait for another 2weeks and only get worried if you have symptoms suggestive of pregnancy before doing any  pregnancy test.You must have seen the distress related to being pregnant or not. Please, consider adopting and correctly using a contraceptive method so as to prevent unwanted or unplanned pregnancy.. also, protection during intercourse would help prevent the transmission of STDs.I hope you fid tis helpful. I wish you well. Feel free to ask for more information or clarification if need beThanks.Dr. Ditah, MD."},{"Patient":"Am feeling something moving in my stomach and am not pregnant.I did one test in the hous and another one was done in the hospital.

Sometimes urine pregnancy test kit may not detect early pregnancy. As your second test gave faint positive line, the possibility of pregnancy is there. So, better to go for blood test for pregnancy. Compared with urine test, quantitative blood test can give more accurate result. If not, wait for 3 to 4 days and repeat the urine test. If report shows two lines, it indicates pregnancy. Then consult gynecologist once, get examined and go for ultrasound. Ultrasound helps in confirming the pregnancy and in estimating the gestational age. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi.

Artificial insemination is different from In-Vitro fertilization (IVF). Full tubal reversal is a better option as the pregnancy will be a total natural process then. Sometimes it may fail.

You should get a complete hormonal profile, ovulation status, tubal patency tests, sonogram, blood counts and urinalysis, while your husband should be assessed for sperm quality. Provided all is well, you may go for natural conception under doctor's surveillance for a few months and if this fails, should go for artificial means like induction, IUI and IVF.
