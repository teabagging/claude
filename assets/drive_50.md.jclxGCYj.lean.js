For the product a b c to be a multiple of 12 , the integers a, b and c must include between them at least 1 factor of 3 and 2 factors of 2 .Among the integers in the list, there are five categories with respect to divisibility by 2 and 3 :- (A): 3 are not divisible by 2 or 3 (these are 1,5,37 )- (B): 3 are divisible by 2 but not by 4 or 3 (these are 22,46,50 )- (C): 1 is divisible by 4 but not by 3 (this is 8 )- (D): 4 are divisible by 3 but not by 2 (these are 21,27,33,39 )- (E): 1 is divisible by 2 and by 3 (this is 30 )We work through two possibilities: either 30 is chosen or 30 is not chosen. We do not need to worry about whether 30 is a, b or c, since the three chosen integers can be arranged in increasing order after they are chosen.Case 1: 30 is chosenIn this case, at least one of the remaining integers is even, since 30 includes only 1 factor of 2 .If both of the remaining integers are even, then 2 of the 4 integers from (B) and (C) are chosen. There are 6 ways to do this: 22 and 46 ; 22 and 50 ; 22 and 8 ; 46 and 50 ; 46 and 8 ; 50 and 8 . Therefore, there are 6 ways to choose in this sub-case.If only one of the remaining integers is even, this even integer can come from either (B) or (C). There are 4 such integers.The third integer chosen must be odd, and so is from (A) or (D). There is a total of 7 integers in these.Thus, in this sub-case there are 4 times 7=28 ways to choose since each of the 4 even integers can be paired with each of the 7 odd integers.Case 2: 30 is not chosenIn this case, one or two of the three integers chosen must be from (D), since a b c must include at least 1 factor of 3 . (If all three were from (D), there would be no factors of 2.)If two of the integers are from (D), there are 6 ways of choosing these 2 integers (21 and 27;21 and 33 ; 21 and 39 ; 27 and 33 ; 27 and 39 ; 33 and 39 ).The third integer chosen must then be a multiple of 4 in order for a b c to have at least 2 factors of 2 . Thus, the third integer is 8 .Thus, in this sub-case there are 6 ways to choose.If one of the integers is from (D), there are 4 ways of choosing that integer.The remaining two integers chosen then need to include a multiple of 4 and another even integer, or a multiple of 4 and an odd integer not divisible by 3 , or two even integers that arenot multiples of 4. (Can you see why these are all of the possible cases?)If these integers are a multiple of 4 and another even integer, the multiple of 4 must be 8 and the even integer comes from the 3 integers in (B).Thus, there are 4 times 3=12 ways to choose in this sub-case, since each of the 4 integers from (D) can be paired with each of the 3 integers from (B).If the two integers are a multiple of 4 and an odd integer not divisible by 3 , the multiple of 4 must be 8 and the odd integer comes from the 3 integers in (A).Thus, there are 4 times 3=12 ways to choose in this sub-case.If the two integers are even and not multiples of 4 , we choose 2 of the 3 integers from (B) and there are 3 ways to do this, as we saw earlier.Thus, there are 4 times 3=12 ways to choose in this sub-case.In total, there are 6+28+6+12+12+12=76 ways to choose the three integers.ANSWER: 76"},{"problem":"A statistical table shows that the fuel consumption rate y (in liters) per hour of a certain car model during constant speed driving is related to the driving speed x (in kilometers per hour) and can be represented by the function: y = frac{1}{128000}x^3 - frac{3}{80}x + 8 (0 < x leqslant 120).

Consider the 7-element set M={boldsymbol{A B}, boldsymbol{B C}, boldsymbol{C A}, boldsymbol{B A}, boldsymbol{C B}, boldsymbol{A C}, mathbf{0}}, which clearly satisfies the conditions. We will now prove that the number of elements in M cannot exceed 7.When all elements in M are collinear, move all the starting points to the same point and draw a line l parallel to all the elements. Project all elements of M onto the line l. Thus, all vectors in M correspond to coordinates on a number line with the common starting point of the elements in M projected onto l as the origin and an arbitrary direction on l as the positive direction. Therefore, the problem can be transformed into a number set problem (from two-dimensional to one-dimensional).Next, we prove that there are at most 7 elements in this number set.First, we prove that there are at most 3 positive numbers in the number set. Assume that there are at least 4 positive elements, and the largest 4 numbers are a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}, with a_{1} < a_{2} < a_{3} < a_{4}. Then, a_{1} + a_{2} + a_{4} > a_{1} + a_{4} > a_{4}, so the sum a_{i} + a_{4} notin M (i=1,2,3). Since there is only one element greater than a_{3}, which is a_{4}, but a_{2} + a_{3} > a_{1} + a_{3} > a_{3}, in the set left{a_{1}, a_{3}, a_{4}right} or left{a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}right}, at least one set has the property that the sum of any two elements is not in M. This contradicts the given conditions, so the number set has at most 3 positive numbers. Similarly, the number set has at most 3 negative numbers. Adding a 0, thus, the number set M has at most 7 elements.When the elements in M are not all collinear, move all the starting points to the same point O. By the finiteness of M, we can draw a Cartesian coordinate system x O y such that the elements in M are not parallel to the coordinate axes.Next, we prove that there are at most 3 elements in the upper half-plane.First, we prove that all elements in the upper half-plane are not collinear. Assume there exist elements a_{1} and a_{2} in the upper half-plane that are collinear. Then, take the element b with the smallest angle with a_{1} and a_{2}. Consider the set left{a_{1}, a_{2}, bright}. By the choice of b, a_{1} + b and a_{2} + b are not in M (the sum vector lies between the two vectors). Thus, there exists a_{3} in M such that a_{3} = a_{1} + a_{2}, so a_{3} is collinear with a_{1} and a_{2}. Consider the set left{a_{1}, a_{3}, bright}, similarly, there exists a_{4} collinear with a_{1} and a_{2}. Continuing this discussion, there are infinitely many elements in M collinear with a_{1} and a_{2}, which is a contradiction. Therefore, all elements in the upper half-plane are not collinear.Next, we prove that there are at most 3 elements in the upper half-plane. Assume there are at least 4 elements in the upper half-plane. Take 4 adjacent elements a, b, c, d in the upper half-plane in a counterclockwise direction. Consider the set {a, b, c}, then b = a + c; consider the set {b, c, d}, then c = b + d. Thus, b = a + c = a + b + d, which implies a + d = 0. This contradicts the fact that a and d are in the upper half-plane, so there are at most 3 elements in the upper half-plane. Similarly, there are at most 3 elements in the lower half-plane. Adding the zero vector, thus, the set M has at most 7 elements.In conclusion, the maximum number of elements in the set M is 7."},{"problem":"1.1.

Initialization: We start with (2^m) sheets of paper, each with the number 1 written on it.

Operation Description: In each step, we choose two distinct sheets with numbers (a) and (b), erase these numbers, and write the number (a + b) on both sheets. This operation does not change the sum of the numbers on all sheets, but it does change the product.3. Product Analysis: Let (P_n) denote the product of the numbers on the sheets after (n) steps. When we replace (a) and (b) with (a + b) on both sheets, the new product becomes:   [   (a + b)^2   ]   By the AM-GM inequality, we have:   [   (a + b)^2 geq 4ab   ]   Therefore, the product after one step is at least four times the previous product:   [   P_{n+1} geq 4P_n   ]4.

Simplification: Simplifying the expression inside the inequality:   [   4^{m2^{m-1}} = (2^2)^{m2^{m-1}} = 2^{2m2^{m-1}}   ]   Therefore:   [   left( 2^{2m2^{m-1}} right)^{1/2^m} = 2^{2m2^{m-1}/2^m} = 2^{2m/2} = 2^m   ]   Thus:   [   S_{m2^{m-1}} geq 2^m cdot 2^m = 2^{2m} = 4^m   ]8.

We start with the given congruence:   [   n^2(1 + n^2 - n^4) equiv 1 pmod{2^m}   ]   for all odd integers ( n ).2. Let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses:   [   1 + n^2 - n^4   ]   We can rewrite this as:   [   1 - n^2 + n^4 - n^6 + n^6 - n^4 + n^2 - 1 = (n^2 - 1)^2 (n^2 + 1)   ]3. Notice that for any odd integer ( n ), ( n^2 equiv 1 pmod{8} ). Therefore:   [   n^2 - 1 equiv 0 pmod{8}   ]   This implies that ( n^2 - 1 ) is divisible by ( 8 ).4. Since ( n^2 - 1 ) is divisible by ( 8 ), we have:   [   (n^2 - 1)^2 equiv 0 pmod{64}   ]   because ( 8^2 = 64 ).5. Now consider the term ( n^2 + 1 ). For any odd ( n ), ( n^2 equiv 1 pmod{8} ), so:   [   n^2 + 1 equiv 2 pmod{8}   ]   This means ( n^2 + 1 ) is always even.6. Combining these results, we have:   [   (n^2 - 1)^2 (n^2 + 1) equiv 0 pmod{64} times 2 = 128   ]   Therefore:   [   (n^2 - 1)^2 (n^2 + 1) equiv 0 pmod{128}   ]7. Thus, the expression ( n^2(1 + n^2 - n^4) ) simplifies to:   [   n^2 times 0 equiv 0 pmod{128}   ]8. Since we need ( n^2(1 + n^2 - n^4) equiv 1 pmod{2^m} ), the highest power of ( 2 ) that divides ( 128 ) is ( 2^7 ). Therefore, ( m leq 7 ).9. To verify that ( m = 7 ) is always attained, we check:   [   n^2(1 + n^2 - n^4) equiv 1 pmod{128}   ]   for all odd ( n ). Since ( n^2(1 + n^2 - n^4) equiv 0 pmod{128} ), the highest ( m ) that satisfies the condition is ( 7 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ m = 7 } )."},{"problem":"If neg p is a necessary but not sufficient condition for neg q, then p is to q a ( ).A: Sufficient but not necessary conditionB: Necessary but not sufficient conditionC: Both sufficient and necessary conditionD: Neither sufficient nor necessary condition","solution":"Answer: According to the statement, since neg p is a necessary but not sufficient condition for neg q, by using the principle that the contrapositive of a statement has the same truth value, we know that q is a necessary but not sufficient condition for p.

For 27, it is only reachable from 24 or 26, so we have 29 + 6 = 35.The answer for 39 can be computed in a similar way to get 35 * 4 + 29 = boxed{169}."},{"problem":"boxed{N1}Let n be a positive integer,g(n) be the number of positive divisors of n of the form 6k+1 and h(n) be the number of positive divisors of n of the form 6k-1,where k is a nonnegative integer.Find all positive integers n such that g(n) and h(n) have different parity.","solution":"1. Let ( n ) be a positive integer. We define ( g(n) ) as the number of positive divisors of ( n ) of the form ( 6k + 1 ) and ( h(n) ) as the number of positive divisors of ( n ) of the form ( 6k - 1 ), where ( k ) is a nonnegative integer.2. We start by expressing ( n ) in its prime factorization form:   [   n = 2^x cdot 3^y cdot z   ]   Here, ( z ) is composed of primes of the form ( 6k - 1 ) or ( 6k + 1 ).3.

Let ( C ) be the number of ways to choose a divisor ( x ) of ( c_1^{d_1} cdot c_2^{d_2} cdots c_k^{d_k} ) such that ( x equiv 1 pmod{6} ). Then:   [   g(n) = B cdot C   ]   [   h(n) = B cdot (A - C)   ]6. We need ( g(n) ) and ( h(n) ) to have different parity. This implies:   [   B cdot C notequiv B cdot (A - C) pmod{2}   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   B cdot C notequiv B cdot A - B cdot C pmod{2}   ]   [   2B cdot C notequiv B cdot A pmod{2}   ]   Since ( 2B cdot C equiv 0 pmod{2} ), we need:   [   0 notequiv B cdot A pmod{2}   ]   This implies ( B cdot A ) must be odd.7. For ( B cdot A ) to be odd, both ( A ) and ( B ) must be odd. This means all ( d_i ) and ( f_j ) must be even, so that ( d_i + 1 ) and ( f_j + 1 ) are odd.8.

Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. In this case, the number 8 appears 3 times, which is more than any other number. Thus, the mode of this data set is 8. If we remove one occurrence of 8, it will still appear 2 times, which is likely still more than any other number (since no other number appears more than once in the original set). Therefore, the mode remains 8 after removing one 8.2. Mean, Median, and Variance:    - The mean (average) is calculated by summing all the numbers in the data set and then dividing by the count of numbers. Removing any number will change the sum and possibly the count (if the removed number is unique), thus changing the mean.   - The median is the middle number in a sorted, ascending or descending, list of numbers. Removing a number can change the order or the middle point, thus potentially changing the median.   - The variance measures the spread of the numbers in the data set from their mean. Since removing a number changes the mean and possibly the spread of the remaining numbers, the variance is also likely to change.From this analysis, we can conclude that removing one data point from the given set will definitely not change the mode, while the mean, median, and variance are all likely to change.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{B}."},{"problem":"3.

Combining the last four equations, we get:   [   b_k = a_{k-1}, quad c_k = a_{k-2}, quad d_k = a_{k-3}, quad e_k = a_{k-4}   ]5. Substitute these into the first equation:   [   t_k = a_k + a_{k-1} + a_{k-2} + a_{k-3} + a_{k-4}   ]   [   a_{k+1} = a_{k-1} + a_{k-2} + a_{k-3} + a_{k-4}   ]6.

The probability that repeatedly flipping a coin generates a good string of length ( k ), directly followed by 5 consecutive heads is:   [   frac{t_k}{2^{k+5}}   ]9. Summing over all ( k ge 0 ), we want:   [   sum_{k=0}^{infty} frac{t_k}{2^{k+5}}   ]10. Factor out ( 2^5 ) from the denominators, and let the remaining sum be ( S ):    [    S = sum_{k=0}^{infty} frac{t_k}{2^k}    ]11. By grouping terms with the same denominator, we see that:    [    S + 2S + 4S + 8S = (14t_0 + 6t_1 + 2t_2) + sum_{k=0}^{infty} frac{t_k + t_{k+1} + t_{k+2} + t_{k+3}}{2^k}    ]12.

The parity of the number of swaps in each square corresponds to the symbol in its unique corner cell (if there is a cross in the corner cell, the number of swaps was odd; if there is a circle, the number of swaps was even). Therefore, each combination of symbols in the table uniquely corresponds to a combination of circles and crosses in the corner cells of the table.

So for f it is sufficient to look at the half-open interval [0, 1). f is obviously monotonic increasing and its value jumps at x = 0, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4. Thus f(x) takes 6 different values on [0, 1). g(x+3) = g(x), so for g we need to look at the half-open interval [0, 3). g jumps at the points at which f jumps plus 4 additional points: 3/5, 1 1/5, 1 4/5, 2 2/5.

Since S_{134}=S_{234}, we have A_{1} A_{2} parallel A_{3} A_{4} Rightarrow S_{123}=S_{124} Rightarrow r_{3}=r_{1}.By S_{145}=S_{245}, and A_{1} A_{2} is not parallel to A_{4} A_{5} (otherwise A_{3}, A_{4}, A_{5} are collinear), we know that A_{4} A_{5} bisects segment A_{1} A_{2};By S_{135}=S_{225}, and A_{1} A_{2} is not parallel to A_{3} A_{5}, we know that A_{3} A_{5} bisects segment A_{1} A_{2}.Thus, A_{5} is the midpoint of segment A_{1} A_{2}, which means A_{1}, A_{5}, A_{2} are collinear, a contradiction!Therefore, n geqslant 5 does not hold. Below, we provide an example to show that n=4 is possible.Take A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{1} as the four vertices of a unit square, and let r_{1}=r_{2}=r_{3}=r_{4}=frac{1}{6}.In summary, n=4 is the only possible case./Comment The two lemmas are just two properties discovered during the exploration process.

However, since b's orientation with respect to a doesn't influence the perpendicularity of a to the plane alpha, this option does not provide a sufficient condition.D. If a perp beta and alpha parallel beta, then a is perpendicular to plane beta, and since alpha is parallel to beta, a must by extension be perpendicular to alpha. This is indeed a sufficient condition for a perp alpha because if a line is perpendicular to a plane, it is perpendicular to all lines in that plane that it intersects.

From this, we get:If the number of n-fixed points and n-periodic points of f are denoted as F_{n} and P_{n}, respectively, thenP_{n}=F_{n}-sum_{substack{i mid n  i neq n}} P_{i} .Thus, it is easy to prove by induction that f^{(k)}(z)=z^{m^{k}}.Hence, from f^{(k)}(z)=z, we know that F_{n}=m^{k}-1.Since 1989=3^{2} times 13 times 17, its (less than 1989) factors are 11:1,3,9,13,17,39,51,117,153,221,663 text {. }Therefore, we can deduce (or use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate):begin{array}{l}P_{1}=F_{1}=m-1 ; P_{3}=F_{3}-P_{1}=m^{3}-m ; P_{9}=F_{9}-P_{1}-P_{3}=m^{9}-m^{3} ; P_{13}=m^{13}-m ; P_{17}=m^{17}-m ; P_{39}=m^{39}-m^{13}-m^{3}+m ; P_{51}=m^{51}-m^{17}-m^{3}+m ; P_{117}=m^{117}-m^{39}-m^{9}+m^{3} ; P_{153}=m^{153}-m^{51}-m^{9}+m^{3} ; P_{21}=m^{21}-m^{17}-m^{13}+m ; P_{663}=m^{663}-m^{21}-m^{51}-m^{39}+m^{17}+ quad m^{13}+m^{3}-m .

Define the problem in terms of vectors and modular arithmetic:   We are given the distance function leftlVert A-B rightrVert = (x_A-x_B)^2+(y_A-y_B)^2 for points A = (x_A, y_A) and B = (x_B, y_B) in the plane. We need to find the number of functions f : S to S such that leftlVert A-B rightrVert equiv leftlVert f(A)-f(B) rightrVert pmod{101} for any A, B in S, where S is the set of points (x,y) with x,y in {0,1,dots,100}.2. Transform the problem into a simpler form:   We can consider the points as vectors in mathbb{F}_{101}^2, where mathbb{F}_{101} is the finite field with 101 elements. The condition leftlVert A-B rightrVert equiv leftlVert f(A)-f(B) rightrVert pmod{101} translates to (x_A - x_B)^2 + (y_A - y_B)^2 equiv (x_{f(A)} - x_{f(B)})^2 + (y_{f(A)} - y_{f(B)})^2 pmod{101}.3. Normalize the function:   Without loss of generality, assume f(0,0) = (0,0). This normalization will be accounted for by multiplying the final count by 101^2 (the number of possible choices for f(0,0)).4. Distance preservation implies linearity:   The condition implies that f preserves distances modulo 101. This suggests that f is a linear transformation. Specifically, f must be an isometry, meaning it preserves the dot product:   [   |A - B|^2 = (A - B) cdot (A - B) equiv (f(A) - f(B)) cdot (f(A) - f(B)) pmod{101}.   ]5. Characterize the isometries:   In mathbb{F}_{101}^2, the isometries are given by orthogonal transformations. These can be represented by matrices M such that M^T M = I, where I is the identity matrix. The number of such orthogonal matrices is determined by the number of ways to choose an orthonormal basis in mathbb{F}_{101}^2.6. Count the orthonormal bases:   An orthonormal basis consists of two vectors (a, b) and (c, d) such that:   [   a^2 + b^2 equiv 1 pmod{101}, quad c^2 + d^2 equiv 1 pmod{101}, quad text{and} quad ac + bd equiv 0 pmod{101}.   ]   The equation a^2 + b^2 equiv 1 pmod{101} has 101 solutions (each nonzero element in mathbb{F}_{101} can be paired with another to form a unit vector). For each choice of (a, b), there are 2 choices for (c, d) such that (c, d) is orthogonal to (a, b).7. Calculate the total number of functions:   There are 101 choices for (a, b) and 2 choices for (c, d) for each (a, b). Thus, there are 2 cdot 101 orthonormal bases. Each orthonormal basis corresponds to an orthogonal transformation, and there are 101^2 choices for the image of (0,0).8.

Some of the representations can be considered of the same type - as indicated by the capital letter labels - for example, 3+2+0+0 and 4+3+0+0 are of the same type because they contain two zeros and two other different digits. It is obvious that the same number of different ordered numbers can be formed from representations of the same type.From the A type representations, only 1 four-digit number can be formed, as the non-zero digit can only be in the first position. For the B type, the first position can be filled in 2 ways - for example, in the case of 4+1+0+0, we can write 4 or 1 there - then the position of the other different digit can be chosen in 3 ways, and finally, the two equal digits are written in the remaining empty positions. Continuing the example with the number starting with 4:4100 ; quad 4010 ; quad 4001 .Thus, from each B type representation, 2 cdot 3=6 valid numbers can be obtained. Similarly, for the C type, 3 numbers can be formed, for the F type again 6 (since after filling the first position, the remaining set of digits is the same as in B), and from the G type, with 4 ways to choose the position of the digit that appears only once, 4 numbers.For the E type representations, the first position can be filled in 3 ways, the next in 3 ways for each starting digit - now even with 0 - the third in 2 ways from the remaining two digits, and thus the digit that ends up in the last position is always determined. Thus, 3 cdot 3 cdot 2=18 different orders are obtained. Similarly, it turns out that if we start with 1 for H, we get 3 cdot 2=6 numbers, and starting with 2 and 3, we get 3 each, like in C, totaling 12. Finally, for D, 6 orders are obtained similarly when starting with the repeating digit, and 3, like in B, when starting with the non-zero digit that appears only once, totaling 9.Summarizing, the number of four-digit numbers that can be formed from theA,B, quad C,D,E,G,Htype representations are respectively1, quad 6, quad 3, quad 1818, quad 6,6, quad 4,12,thus the number of numbers sought for the sum of digits being 5, 6, and 7, respectively, isbegin{array}{lr}1+2 cdot 6+2 cdot 9+4 & =35 1+2 cdot 6+2 cdot 3+9+18+6+4 & =56 1+3 cdot 6+3 cdot 9+18+2 cdot 4+12 & =84end{array}Katona Viktor (Heves, General Secondary School II. grade) Blaskó Gábor (Kazincbarcika, Irinyi J.

A four-digit number can be visualized by starting from a point on a straight line and successively measuring segments of length equal to the first, then the second, the third, and finally the fourth digit. To highlight the zeros, instead of the second, third, and fourth digits, we measure segments one unit longer. This way, a four-digit number, where the sum of the digits is n, is represented by a segment of length n+3, which is divided into 4 parts by 3 internal points. Conversely, we can uniquely read off which number a divided segment represents, if the length of each part is an integer multiple of the unit, not greater than 10 times. In our case, the value of n is 5, 6, or 7, so the length of each part is also less than 10. The number of numbers in question is therefore equal to the number of ways to choose 3 points from the n+2 internal division points of a segment divided into n+3 parts.An internal point can be chosen in n+2 ways, the second from the remaining in n+1 ways, and the third in n ways; however, in this way, we get the same triplet of points, whether we chose the leftmost, middle, or rightmost point first, and from the other two, we could choose either one second and the other third.

From this equation, we can determine that the center of the circle, C, is at the origin O(0,0), and the radius of the circle is 4.For the circle to have at least three points that are at a distance of 1 from the line l: y = x + b, it must be the case that the distance from the origin O to the line l is less than or equal to 3. This is because if the distance was greater than 3, the perpendicular from O to l would intersect the circle at only two points, contradicting the requirement of having at least three such points.Since the line l can be represented in general form as x - y + b = 0, we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line: d = frac{|Ax + By + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}, where Ax + By + C = 0 is the equation of the line and (x, y) is the point.Substituting A = 1, B = -1, and C = b, and the coordinates of the origin (0,0) into the formula, the distance d can be expressed as:[ d = frac{|0 - 0 + b|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{|b|}{sqrt{2}} ]Now, we have the inequality d leq 3 leading to:[ frac{|b|}{sqrt{2}} leq 3 ][ |b| leq 3sqrt{2} ]Since b can be positive or negative, we have the range for b as:[ -3sqrt{2} leq b leq 3sqrt{2} ]Therefore, the range of values for b is:[ boxed{-3sqrt{2} leq b leq 3sqrt{2}} ]"},{"problem":"4.

The radii of the other two excircles are found by analogous formulas: r_{1} = frac{2 S}{b + c - a} and r_{2} = frac{2 S}{a + c - b}. Since the radius of the circle inscribed in the given triangle is found by the formula r = frac{2 S}{a + b + c}, the following relationship holds:frac{1}{r_{1}} + frac{1}{r_{2}} + frac{1}{r_{3}} = frac{b + c - a}{2 S} + frac{a + c - b}{2 S} + frac{a + b - c}{2 S} = frac{a + b + c}{2 S} = frac{1}{r}According to the problem, r_{1} = 2, r_{2} = 3, and r_{3} = 6, from which r = 1.

Substituting x=1 into the derivative, we get f'(1)=3(1)^2+1=4.The slope of the tangent line is 4, and it passes through the point (1,f(1)).

We will show that when N>9, the required is impossible.Assume the contrary; let S be the sum of all numbers on the board. Choose any numbers alpha_{1}, alpha_{2}, ldots, alpha_{7} with sum T; let A be the set of all other numbers on the board. By the condition, for any number beta in A, there exists a number gamma in A different from it such that the number T+beta+gamma is an integer. We say that the number gamma corresponds to the number beta. Note that such a number is unique. Indeed, if there were another number gamma^{prime} in A for which the sum T+beta+gamma^{prime} is an integer, then the number gamma-gamma^{prime}=(T+beta+gamma)-left(T+beta+gamma^{prime}right) would also be an integer. But this is impossible, since 0 < gamma - gamma^{prime} < 1, as N=7+2 l>9.Consider the sum Sigma=left(T+beta_{1}+gamma_{1}right)+left(T+beta_{2}+gamma_{2}right)+ldots+left(T+beta_{l}+gamma_{l}right). Sigma is an integer. On the other hand, each number from A appears in Sigma exactly once; hence, Sigma=I T+(S-T)=S+(l-1) T, from which T=frac{Sigma-S}{ell-1}.Now, choosing the numbers alpha_{2}, alpha_{3}, ldots, alpha_{8} on the board and denoting their sum by T^{prime}, we similarly obtain that T^{prime}=frac{Sigma^{prime}-S}{ell-1} for an integer Sigma^{prime}. Therefore, alpha_{1}-alpha_{8}=frac{Sigma-S}{ell-1}-frac{Sigma^{prime}-S}{ell-1}=frac{Sigma-Sigma^{prime}}{ell-1}.Since alpha_{1} and alpha_{8} could be any two numbers on the board, we get that the difference between any two numbers on the board is of the form frac{k}{l-1} for an integer k.Let mu be the smallest number on the board.

Consider two cases:(i) K in U_{i}. Since the disk with the center P_{i} and radius 8 contains U_{i}, we see that K P_{i} leq s. Hence D_{k} contains P_{1}.(ii) K in V_{i}. Denote by L the intersection point of the segment K O with the circle s.We want to prove that K L>K P_{1}. It is enough to prove that angle K P_{1} L>angle K L P_{1}. However, it is obvious that angle L P_{i} O leq 30^{circ} and angle L O P_{i} leq 30^{circ}, hence angle K L P_{i} leq 60^{circ}, while angle N P_{i} L=90^{circ}-angle L P_{i} O geq 60^{circ}.

The two-digit prime numbers overline{a b} and overline{a c} are odd, so their last digits must be odd. Additionally, none of them can contain the digit 5, otherwise the mentioned two-digit numbers would be divisible by five. Therefore, it is sufficient to further examine only the digits b and c from the set {1,3,7,9}.We want the digit a to be as large as possible, so we will sequentially check the possibilities starting with the value a=9, until we find a solution.For a=9, the numbers 91=7 cdot 13, 93=3 cdot 31, 99=3 cdot 33 are composite, and only 97 is a prime number.

Therefore, the desired number cannot start with the digit 9.Similarly, for a=8, we rule out the possibilities b, c in{1,7}, because 81=3 cdot 27 and 87=3 cdot 29.

Simplest Event FlowAn event flow is a sequence of events that occur at random moments in time.A simplest (Poisson) event flow is one that has the following three properties: stationarity, \\"lack of aftereffect,\\" and ordinarity.The property of stationarity means that the probability of k events occurring in any time interval depends only on the number k and the duration t of the time interval and does not depend on the start of its measurement. In other words, the probability of k events occurring over a time interval of duration t is a function that depends only on k and t.The property of \\"lack of aftereffect\\" means that the probability of k events occurring in any time interval does not depend on whether events occurred or did not occur at moments of time preceding the start of the considered interval. In other words, the history of the flow does not affect the probabilities of events occurring in the near future.The property of ordinarity means that the occurrence of two or more events over a small time interval is practically impossible. In other words, the probability of more than one event occurring over a small time interval is negligible compared to the probability of only one event occurring.The intensity of the flow lambda is the average number of events that occur per unit of time.If the constant intensity of the flow lambda is known, then the probability of k events occurring in the simplest flow over time t is determined by the Poisson formulaP_{t}(k)=frac{(lambda t)^{k} cdot mathrm{e}^{-lambda t}}{k!}Remark. A flow that has the property of stationarity is called stationary; otherwise, it is called non-stationary."},{"problem":"8.

Each of the points is coloured red or blue such that each triangle formed by three distinct red points contains at least one blue point.What is the largest possible number of red points?[i]Proposed by Art Waeterschoot, Belgium[/i]","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We are given 2022 points in the plane, no three of which are collinear. Each point is colored either red or blue. The condition is that any triangle formed by three red points must contain at least one blue point inside it. We need to find the maximum number of red points possible under this condition.2. Initial Consideration:   Let's denote the number of red points by ( r ) and the number of blue points by ( b ). We know that ( r + b = 2022 ).3. Triangulation Argument:   Consider a triangulation of the red points. A triangulation of ( r ) points will have ( 2r - 3 ) edges and ( r - 2 ) triangles (by Euler's formula for planar graphs).4. Blue Points in Triangles:   Each triangle formed by three red points must contain at least one blue point. Therefore, there must be at least ( r - 2 ) blue points to satisfy this condition.5. Maximizing Red Points:   To maximize the number of red points, we need to minimize the number of blue points. Since ( b geq r - 2 ), we substitute ( b = r - 2 ) into the equation ( r + b = 2022 ):   [   r + (r - 2) = 2022   ]   [   2r - 2 = 2022   ]   [   2r = 2024   ]   [   r = 1012   ]6. Verification:   If ( r = 1012 ), then ( b = 2022 - 1012 = 1010 ). We need to check if this configuration satisfies the condition. With 1012 red points, we have ( 1012 - 2 = 1010 ) triangles, and we have exactly 1010 blue points, which can be placed such that each triangle contains at least one blue point.7. Construction:   To construct such a configuration, consider a regular ( n )-gon (polygon with ( n ) sides) where ( n = 1012 ). Place a blue point inside each triangle formed by any three consecutive vertices of the ( n )-gon. This ensures that each triangle formed by three red points contains at least one blue point.Conclusion:[boxed{1012}]"},{"problem":"Find the derivative of the function y= frac{1}{x} at x=1.

First, find the foci of the given hyperbola. The formula for the foci of a hyperbola is:c = sqrt{a^2 + b^2}where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively. In this case, a = 2 and b = sqrt{12} = 2sqrt{3}. Thus,c = sqrt{2^2 + (2sqrt{3})^2} = sqrt{4 + 12} = sqrt{16} = 42. The foci of the hyperbola are (-c, 0) and (c, 0), which are (-4, 0) and (4, 0). These will be the vertices of the ellipse. The vertices of the hyperbola are (-a, 0) and (a, 0), which are (-2, 0) and (2, 0). These will be the foci of the ellipse.3. Since the ellipse has its major axis on the x-axis, its equation is of the form:frac{x^2}{a'^2} + frac{y^2}{b'^2} = 1where a' and b' are the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse, respectively.4. The semi-major axis of the ellipse is half the distance between its vertices, which is 4, so a' = 4.5. The foci of the ellipse are at a distance of 2 from the center, so the semi-focal distance is 2.

Sample paths starting east with 6 and 5 turns respectively are shown below:Let P_{ell} be the number of positive integer solutions to the equation b_{1}+b_{2}+cdots+b_{ell}=10. It is easy to see that P_{ell}=binom{9}{ell-1} because there are 10-1=9 spaces in a row between 10 objects, and we pick ell-1 of them to place a delimiter; the number of objects between two adjacent delimiters are b_{i} respectively.We need P_{3}=binom{9}{2}=36 and P_{4}=binom{9}{3}=84.Then the desired number of paths is N(5)=2 P_{3} P_{3}=2592 and N(6)=2 P_{3} P_{4}=6048.The factor of 2 accounts for the option to begin either to the north or east.Thus, N(6)-N(5)=2 P_{3}left(P_{4}-P_{3}right)=2 times 36 times(84-36)=3456.Alternative solution: After fixing the initial direction, the set of rows and set of columns we 'turn onto' uniquely determine the walk.

Then c=a+b and a+b+c=2, from which it follows that c=1, i.e., one of the three given logarithms is equal to 1.The converse is also true, namely, if one of the three given logarithms is equal to 1, then since the sum of all three logarithms is 2, the sum of the remaining two is 1, i.e., their sum is equal to the first logarithm.Thus, the requirement of the problem is satisfied if and only if one of the logarithms is equal to 1 (and all logarithms exist). A logarithm is equal to 1 when its base is equal to the logarithmic expression.

Initial assumptions: Assume ( Q ) is the polynomial with the smallest degree that satisfies the given condition. We need to explore the possible degrees of ( Q ).3. Degree analysis:    - Case 1: ( deg(Q) > p-1 ). Using Fermat's Little Theorem, ( x^p equiv x pmod{p} ), we get a contradiction because the degree of ( Q ) would not be minimal.    - Case 2: ( deg(Q) = p-1 ). Using the identity ( x^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p} ) for ( x ) in the range ( 1 le x le p-1 ), we can reduce the polynomial modulo ( p ). This would imply that ( Q ) can be reduced to a polynomial of degree less than ( p-1 ), contradicting the minimality assumption.    - Case 3: ( deg(Q) < p-2 ). We need to show that this leads to a contradiction.4. Detailed analysis for ( deg(Q) < p-2 ):    - Subcase 1: ( (Q(i), p) = 1 ) for all ( i ) in ( {1, 2, ldots, p-1} ). This implies that ( {Q(1), Q(2), ldots, Q(p-1)} ) and ( {1 cdot Q(1), 2 cdot Q(2), ldots, (p-1) cdot Q(p-1)} ) are two complete residue systems modulo ( p ).

Since ( deg(Q) < p-2 ), the degree of ( xQ(x) ) is at most ( p-2 ). We have the identity:        [        sum_{i=0}^{p-1} iQ(i) equiv 0 pmod{p} implies sum_{i=1}^{p-1} iQ(i) equiv 0 pmod{p}        ]        Given that there exists ( i ) such that ( Q(i) equiv 0 pmod{p} ), the set ( {1 cdot Q(1), 2 cdot Q(2), ldots, (i-1) cdot Q(i-1), (i+1) cdot Q(i+1), ldots, (p-1) cdot Q(p-1)} ) is similar to ( {1, 2, ldots, i-1, i+1, ldots, p-1} ).

This implies ( f(k) + f(3) = 0 ). Since ( f(3) = 0 ), we have ( f(k) = 0 ).4. We need to show that ( f(n) = 0 ) for all ( n ). We start by proving it for the digits 1 through 9:   - ( f(1) ): From ( f(10) = f(1) + f(10) = 0 ), we get ( f(1) = 0 ).   - ( f(2) ): From ( f(10) = f(2) + f(5) = 0 ), we get ( f(2) = 0 ) and ( f(5) = 0 ).   - ( f(4) ): From ( f(4) = f(2) + f(2) = 0 + 0 = 0 ).   - ( f(6) ): From ( f(6) = f(2) + f(3) = 0 + 0 = 0 ).   - ( f(8) ): From ( f(8) = f(2) + f(2) + f(2) + f(2) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 ).   - ( f(7) ): From ( f(35) = f(5) + f(7) = 0 ), we get ( f(7) = 0 ).   - ( f(9) ): From ( f(9) = f(3) + f(3) = 0 + 0 = 0 ).5.

The mouse can observe the cheese when the mouse, a certain mirror, and the cheese are aligned.

Therefore, in the first minute, it crawls forward 80 meters, in the second minute, it retreats 20 meters, in the third minute, it crawls forward 80 meters, in the fourth minute, it retreats 20 meters, and so on. ... When the mouse reaches point B, it directly rushes along B C to eat the cheese. Question: How many times can the mouse see the cheese on segment A B?","solution":"【Answer】 5【Solution】The key to this problem is to determine which points can see the cheese. Let the position of the cheese be E (as shown in the figure below). Since frac{A E}{A C}=frac{A W_{3}}{A D}=frac{3}{4}, it follows that G_{3} E parallel B C, thus frac{A G_{3}}{A B}=frac{3}{4}. Given that A B=400 meters, we have A G_{3}=300 meters. The challenge lies in how to find the lengths of A G_{1} and A G_{2}. We will first find A G_{2}, and two methods are provided:Method 1: As shown in the figure, extend G_{2} E to intersect the extension of B C at point H. triangle A D C is intercepted by W_{2} E H, so frac{A W_{2}}{W_{2} D} cdot frac{D H}{H C} cdot frac{C E}{E A}=1 Rightarrow 1 cdot frac{D H}{H C} cdot frac{1}{3}=1 Rightarrow frac{D H}{H C}=3. Let C H=a, then D C=2 a, so B D=D C=2 a. Since triangle A B D is intercepted by G_{2} W_{2} H, we have frac{A G_{2}}{G_{2} B} cdot frac{B H}{H D} cdot frac{D W_{2}}{W_{2} A}=1 Rightarrow frac{A G_{2}}{G_{2} B} cdot frac{5}{3} cdot 1=1 Rightarrow frac{A G_{2}}{G_{2} B}=frac{3}{5} Rightarrow frac{A G_{2}}{A B}=frac{3}{8}. Given that A B=400 meters, we have A G_{2}=150 meters.Method 2: As shown in the figure, draw E I parallel A K parallel B C, then frac{A J}{A D}=frac{A E}{A C}=frac{3}{4}. Let A D=4 k, then A J=3 k. Since W_{2} is the midpoint of A D, we have A W_{2}=2 k, thus frac{A K}{E J}=frac{A W_{2}}{W_{2} J}=2 Rightarrow A K=2 E J. Since frac{E J}{D C}=frac{A J}{A D}=frac{I J}{B D} and D C=B D, we have E J=I J Rightarrow I E=2 E J. Since A K=2 E J, we have A K=I E, so frac{A G_{2}}{G_{2} I}=frac{A K}{I E}=1. Since frac{A I}{A B}=frac{A E}{A C}=frac{3}{4}, and combining A G_{2}=G_{2} I, we get frac{A G_{2}}{A B}=frac{3}{8}. Given that A B=400 meters, we have A G_{2}=150 meters.Using the same method, we can find that A G_{1}=60 meters, thus we have A G_{1}=60, A G_{2}=150, and A G_{3}=300.

So, over these 12 \\"months\\" she kept 12 * 300 = 3600 rubles for herself.Thus, 50-ruble bills could appear in Masha's possession only in one month out of 13. If in a \\"month\\" only one 50-ruble bill was put into the piggy bank, she gave it to her sister at the end of the month, so her \\"income\\" remained 300 rubles.If in any \\"month\\" Masha saves not less than two 50-ruble bills, she gives them to her sister over consecutive \\"months\\", which contradicts the condition. The exception is the case when they all come in the 13th \\"month\\", then she won't have time to give them away. So, in this case, for the first 12 \\"months\\" Masha received 300 rubles each, and in the last one, she could put in the piggy bank from zero to three 50-ruble bills, that is, she could fall short of 300 rubles by a maximum of 150 rubles.Grading criteria: It is stated that Masha gave money 13 times, 12 times 100 rubles and once 50 rubles - 5 points. The correct answer without mentioning that the 50 rubles are given only in the last month - 10 points.

Simplification of the Given Inequality:  Given the inequality frac{1}{{3x}}-x+ln3xleqfrac{1}{{a{e^x}}}+ln a, we can simplify it by using the property of logarithms, ln a + x = ln a + ln e^x = ln ae^x. This simplifies the inequality to:frac{1}{{3x}}+ln3xleqfrac{1}{{a{e^x}}}+ln ae^x2. Defining a Function f(x):  Let's define a function f(x) = frac{1}{x} + ln x for x geq 1.

Suppose at some step we divide the coins of one of the existing groups into two groups of x and y coins. Then we erase xy segments. This is the number we write down. Thus, the sum of the recorded numbers is the total number of erased segments.

We can therefore assume, without loss of generality, that mathrm{p}>mathrm{q}>mathrm{r}. A prime number is either odd or equal to 2.Suppose that p, q, and r are all odd. Then p-q, q-r, and r-p are even. Since their absolute values are prime, these numbers must all be 2. Thus, the integers p, p+2, and p+4 are all prime. If p is divisible by 3, then p=3 and mathrm{q}=5 and mathrm{r}=7.However, the triplet (3,5,7) is not a solution to the problem: 7-3=4 is not prime.If p is not divisible by 3, then p is of the form 3k+1 or 3k+2. The first case implies that p+2 is divisible by 3, so p+2=3 but p=1 is not a prime number. The second case implies that p+4 is divisible by 3, but p+4=3 does not yield a positive solution.Suppose that r=2. Then p and q are odd and p-q is even and prime, so it must be 2. It follows that mathrm{q}+2, mathrm{q}, and mathrm{q}-2 are all prime. From the previous case, this implies that q-2=3 so p=7.

We start with the given equation ( 11ldots1 = 11ldots1 cdot m ), where the first number has ( n ) digits of 1, and the second has ( k ) digits of 1.

Using the property of divisibility, we know that if ( 10^k - 1 mid 10^n - 1 ), then:   [   10^k - 1 mid 10^n - 1 - 10^{n-k}(10^k - 1) = 10^{n-k} - 1   ]   Repeating this process, we reduce the exponent by ( k ) each time until we get:   [   10^k - 1 mid 10^A - 1   ]   where ( A = n mod k ).4. For ( 10^k - 1 ) to divide ( 10^A - 1 ), ( A ) must be 0 (since ( 0 leq A < k )). Therefore, ( n ) must be a multiple of ( k ), i.e., ( n = Bk ) for some integer ( B ).5. Substituting ( n = Bk ) into the expression for ( m ), we get:   [   m = frac{10^{Bk} - 1}{10^k - 1}   ]   Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we can write:   [   m = sum_{i=0}^{B-1} (10^k)^i   ]6.

The smallest ( B ) we can take is 2 (since ( B = 1 ) would make ( m = 1 ), which is not allowed as ( n > k > 1 )).7. The smallest ( k ) we can take is 2.

We number the cards as described in the article - proceeding from top to bottom - with the numbers 0,1,2, ldots, 51. Initially, the first and last card always remain in place; otherwise, after one shuffle, the k-th card moves to the y_{k}-th position, where y_{k} equiv 2 k(bmod 51)(k=1,2, ldots, 50). If we shuffle n times in succession, then the card originally in the k-th position moves to the 2^{n} k-th position (mod 51). Each card will be back in its original position if for every k=1,2, ldots, 50, 2^{n} k equiv k(bmod 51) holds, that is, 2^{n} equiv 1(bmod 51).

Now we can most easily track the movement of the cards if we number the cards from 1 to 52. Then the k-th card moves to the 2 k-th position (bmod 53), and after the n-th shuffle, it moves to the 2^{n} k-th position (bmod 53). This time, we are looking for the smallest n for which 2^{n} equiv 1(bmod 53). Writing down the powers of 2 in sequence (bmod 53) would take a long time until the 1 first appears. We can speed up the calculation if we narrow down the set of n numbers that could be considered. Since 53 is a prime number, by Fermat's little theorem, 2^{52} equiv 1(bmod 53), so the powers of 2 modulo 53 are periodic, and the period length is 52. Our task is to find the smallest period (let's denote it by p), because on the one hand, 2^{p} equiv 2^{p-p}=1(bmod 53), so n leq p, and on the other hand, because of 2^{n} equiv 1(bmod 53), the powers of 2 are periodic modulo 53, so p leq n; thus indeed p=n. The smallest period is a divisor of every period, including 52, so it can only be 1,2,4,13,26 or 52. Consider the following powers of 2:begin{aligned}2^{4} & equiv 16 quad(bmod 53) 2^{8} & equiv 16^{2}=256 equiv-9 quad(bmod 53) 2^{16} & equiv(-9)^{2}=81 equiv 28 quad(bmod 53)end{aligned}therefore2^{26}=2^{16} cdot 2^{8} cdot 2^{2} equiv 28 cdot(-9) cdot 4 equiv 6 cdot(-9)=-54 equiv-1 not equiv 1 quad(bmod 53)This means that 26 is not a period, so 13 is not either, and 1, 2, 4 are clearly not.

Define the problem and setup the geometry:   - We are given a cyclic quadrilateral (ABCD) with a point (X) on side (AB).   - Diagonal (BD) bisects (CX) and diagonal (AC) bisects (DX).   - We need to find the minimum possible value of (frac{AB}{CD}).2. Introduce parallel lines and intersections:   - Draw a line through (X) parallel to (CD) and let it intersect (AC) at (C_0) and (BD) at (D_0).   - Let (X_0) be the intersection of (CD_0) and (DC_0).3. Analyze the triangles and medians:   - Since (CA) and (DB) are medians of (triangle XCD), it follows that (triangle X_0C_0D_0) is anticomplementary to (triangle XCD).   - This implies that (X) is the midpoint of (D_0C_0) and (D_0X = XC_0 = CD).4. Establish angle relationships:   - (angle AC_0X = angle CC_0D_0 = angle DCC_0 = angle DCA = angle DBA = angle D_0BX pmod{pi})   - (angle BD_0X = angle BD_0C_0 = angle CDD_0 = angle CDB = angle CAB = angle C_0AX pmod{pi})   - (angle C_0XA = angle D_0XB)5.

Construction for ( n = 4 ):   - Let ( P_1, P_2, P_3 ) be the vertices of an equilateral triangle with side length 2.   - Let ( P_4 ) be the barycenter (centroid) of this triangle.   - Set ( r_1 = r_2 = r_3 = 1 ).   - Calculate ( r_4 ) such that the distance between ( P_4 ) and any ( P_i ) is ( r_4 + 1 ). Since ( P_4 ) is the centroid, the distance from ( P_4 ) to any vertex ( P_i ) is ( frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} ). Thus, ( r_4 = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3} - 1 ).3.

Thus, at most one ( r_k ) can be negative.     - If ( r_k ) is negative, ( C_k ) must be internally tangent to all other ( C_i ). If ( n > 2 ), there exist ( i neq j ) such that ( r_i, r_j > 0 ), making ( C_i ) and ( C_j ) externally tangent, which contradicts ( C_k ) being internally tangent to both.     - If no ( r_k ) is negative, all ( r_i > 0 ), and all ( C_i ) are pairwise externally tangent. For ( n ge 3 ), adding ( C_4 ) requires placing ( P_4 ) inside ( triangle P_1P_2P_3 ), which is uniquely possible, giving ( n = 4 ).   - Case 2: There exists ( r_k = 0 ):     - At most one ( r_k ) can be nonpositive, otherwise ( overline{P_kP_l} = r_k + r_l le 0 ) for some ( k, l ), which is impossible.     - All other ( r_i > 0 ), so ( P_k ) lies on ( C_i ) for all ( i neq k ), and ( C_i, C_j ) are externally tangent for all ( i neq j neq k ).     - All ( C_i, C_j ) are externally tangent at ( P_k ), which can only happen for at most two circles, giving ( n le 3 ).4.

Similarly, A B=7.Therefore, the area of trapezoid E F B A is frac{1}{2}(1+7) h=4 h.The shaded area on trapezoid E F B A equals the area of E F B A minus the area of triangle A P B.Since E F and A B are parallel, then angle F E P=angle P B A.This means that triangle F P E is similar to triangle A P B.Since A B: E F=7: 1, then the ratio of the height of triangle A P B to the height of triangle F P E must also be 7: 1.Since the sum of the heights of these triangles is the height of the trapezoid, then the height of triangle A P B is frac{7}{8} h.Thus, the area of triangle A P B is frac{1}{2} A B cdot frac{7}{8} h=frac{49}{16} h, because A B=7.Therefore, the shaded area on trapezoid EFBA is 4 h-frac{49}{16} h=frac{15}{16} h, and so the total shaded area on the truncated pyramid is 4 cdot frac{15}{16} h=frac{15}{4} h.To complete our solution, we need to calculate h.To do this, we begin by dropping perpendiculars from E and F to points Q and R on A B, from F to point S on B C, and from F to point T in square A B C D.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_04_30_68642ad613c12af1e439g-05.jpg?height=336&width=610&top_left_y=1583&top_left_x=817)Since E F is parallel to Q R and angle E Q R=angle F R Q=90^{circ}, then E F R Q is a rectangle.Thus, Q R=1.Since E Q=F R=h and E A=F B and each of triangle E Q A and triangle F R B is right-angled, then these triangles are congruent, and so A Q=R B.Since A B=7 and Q R=1, then A Q=R B=3. Similarly, B S=3.Now R B S T must be a square of side length 3 , since E F lies directly above S T extended and F G lies directly above R T extended.Finally, we have T R=3, F T=4, F R=h, and angle F T R=90^{circ}.By the Pythagorean Theorem, h^{2}=3^{2}+4^{2}=25, and so h=5, since h>0.This means that the total shaded area is frac{15}{4} h=frac{75}{4}.ANSWER: frac{75}{4}"},{"problem":"2、Given A times B=(A+3) times(B-2) 。 12 ※ 17=Translate the above text into English, please retain the original text's line breaks and format, and output the translation result directly. 2、Given A times B=(A+3) times(B-2) 。 12 ※ 17=","solution":"【Analysis】The original expression is =(12+3) times(17-2)=225"},{"problem":"Given a function f(x) = xe^{1-x} + ax^{3} - x where a in mathbb{R}.(1) If a = frac{1}{3}, determine the monotonicity of f(x) on (-infty, 0];(2) If the inequality f(x) geq xln x + a holds for all x in [1, +infty), find the range of values for a.","solution":" Solution:# Part (1):Given f(x) = xe^{1-x} + ax^{3} - x with a = frac{1}{3}, the function simplifies to:f(x) = xe^{1-x} + frac{1}{3}x^{3} - x.To determine the monotonicity, we find the derivative of f(x):begin{align*}f'(x) &= frac{d}{dx}left(xe^{1-x} + frac{1}{3}x^{3} - xright) &= e^{1-x} - xe^{1-x} + x^{2} - 1 &= (1-x)e^{1-x} + x^{2} - 1 &= (1-x)(e^{1-x} - 1) + x^{2}.end{align*}For x leq 0, we analyze the sign of f'(x):- 1-x > 0 since x is less than or equal to 0.- e^{1-x} > 1 because the exponential function increases as x decreases (since 1-x becomes more positive).- Therefore, (1-x)(e^{1-x} - 1) > 0.- Additionally, x^{2} geq 0 for all real x.Combining these, we conclude that f'(x) > 0 for x leq 0, indicating that f(x) is monotonically increasing on (-infty, 0].# Part (2):For the inequality f(x) geq xln x + a to hold for all x in [1, +infty), we analyze the function:g(x) = e^{1-x} - ln x + ax^{2} - frac{a}{x} - 1.Taking the derivative of g(x):begin{align*}g'(x) &= -e^{1-x} - frac{1}{x} + 2ax + frac{a}{x^{2}}.end{align*}Evaluating g'(x) and g(x) at x=1:- g'(1) = 3a - 2.- g(1) = 0.For a geq frac{2}{3}, g'(1) geq 0, indicating that g(x) is non-decreasing at x=1.

Find the value of AC.","solution":"To solve for the value of AC in the given triangle triangle ABC, we follow these steps based on the given information and the vector representation of point D on side BC.1. Vector Representation of overrightarrow{CD}:   Given that overrightarrow{AD}=frac{2}{5}overrightarrow{AB}+frac{3}{5}overrightarrow{AC}, we can express overrightarrow{CD} as:   [   overrightarrow{CD} = overrightarrow{AC} - overrightarrow{AD} = overrightarrow{AC} - left(frac{2}{5}overrightarrow{AB} + frac{3}{5}overrightarrow{AC}right) = frac{2}{5}overrightarrow{BC}.   ]   This equation shows that the vector from C to D is frac{2}{5} of the vector from B to C.2. Ratio of Lengths CD to CB:   From the vector representation, we deduce that the ratio of the lengths of CD to CB is frac{2}{5}, i.e.,    [   frac{CD}{CB} = frac{2}{5}.   ]3. Finding Lengths CB and BD:   Given that CD = 2, and using the ratio frac{CD}{CB} = frac{2}{5}, we can find the length of CB as:   [   CB = frac{5}{2} cdot CD = 5.   ]   Since CB = CD + BD, and we know CD = 2, we find BD = CB - CD = 5 - 2 = 3.4. Equality of Angles and Lengths:   Given that angle BAD = angle B = frac{pi}{6}, we have AD = BD = 3. This also implies that angle ADC = frac{pi}{3} due to the geometry of the triangle.5. Applying the Cosine Rule in triangle ADC:   To find AC, we apply the cosine rule:   [   AC^{2} = AD^{2} + CD^{2} - 2 cdot AD cdot CD cdot cos(angle ADC) = 3^{2} + 2^{2} - 2 cdot 3 cdot 2 cdot cosleft(frac{pi}{3}right) = 9 + 4 - 6 = 7.   ]   Therefore, AC = sqrt{7}.6.

Several contestants decided how many numbers containing the digit 1 there are among the one-, two-, ..., six-digit numbers, and they answered the question by giving the sum of these six numbers. A similar but simpler solution is the following.I. Solution: The numbers that can be written with one, or two, or ..., or six digits, i.e., numbers that require at most six digits, can all be written with exactly six digits if we allow the digit 0 to be used as a leading digit, and if we think of writing as many 0s in front of every number that can be written with at most five digits so that the number of its digits is six.Let F_{n} denote the number of numbers containing the digit 1 that can be written with at most n digits. Thus, clearly F_{1}=1, because half of the one-digit numbers meet the condition: the number 1, and our task is to determine F_{6}. Suppose we already know F_{n}; then we can get F_{n+1} with the following reasoning. Group the numbers containing the digit 1 that can be written with at most n+1 digits according to their leading digit. The number of those starting with 1 is 10^{n}, because in them we can write any of the 10 digits in the remaining n places, independently of each other. The number of those starting with 0,2,3,4, ldots 9 is F_{n} in each group, because these must contain a 1 in their remaining n-digit part. This way we have considered all the suitable n+1-digit numbers, each exactly once, soF_{n+1}=10^{n}+9 cdot F_{n}With this, we have obtained a so-called recursive formula for calculating F_{n}. Thus, F_{2}=10+9 cdot F_{1}=19, F_{3}=100+9 cdot 19=271, F_{4}=1000+9 cdot 271=3439, F_{5}=10000+9 cdot 3439=40951, and finally F_{6}=100000+9 cdot 40951=468559. This answers the question.II. Solution: Group the numbers in question according to the place of their first 1, i.e., the leftmost 1, which is in the units, tens, hundreds, ..., hundred-thousands place. This way we get six groups, and each of our numbers falls into exactly one group. In the construction, the place of the mentioned 1, except for itself, must be filled in such a way that any digit can stand after the mentioned 1, and any digit other than 1 can stand before it.In the first group, the units place, or the rightmost digit, of the numbers is 1, and they do not contain any more 1s. For the tens place, we need to consider all 9 digits other than 1. For the hundreds place, again, the 9 digits can be used in 9 ways, so there are 9 cdot 9 ways to fill the tens and hundreds places. Similarly, the next three places can be filled in 9 ways each, so this group contains 9^{5} numbers.In the second group, the tens place is 1, and the digit in the units place can be any of the 10 digits, and the four preceding digits can again be chosen in 9 ways each, so in this group we get 9^{4} cdot 10 numbers. - Moving from group to group, one more place can be filled in 10 ways instead of 9, so the total number of numbers containing 1 is from the six groups:N=9^{5}+9^{4} cdot 10+9^{3} cdot 10^{2}+9^{2} cdot 10^{3}+9 cdot 10^{4}+10^{5}Notice that the six terms of this sum form a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 10 / 9, so using the sum formula, N=468559.III. Solution: Using combinatorial knowledge and the binomial theorem, the number of the numbers in question can also be obtained by grouping them according to the number of 1s they contain, constructing them in their six-digit extended form. The single 1 in the numbers that contain only one 1 can be placed in any of the 6 positions, and the other 5 positions can be filled with the other 9 digits in all possible ways, so the number of such numbers is 6 cdot 9^{5}. The positions of the 1s in the numbers that contain exactly two, three, ..., six 1s can be chosen inbinom{6}{2}, quadbinom{6}{3}, quadbinom{6}{4}, quadbinom{6}{5}, quadbinom{6}{6}=1ways, and after each choice, the remaining 4,3,2,1 positions can be filled in 9^{4}, 9^{3}, 9^{2}, 9 ways, or in the last case, we are done, as there are no more positions to fill. Based on this, the number we are looking for isN=6 cdot 9^{5}+binom{6}{2} cdot 9^{4}+binom{6}{3} cdot 9^{3}+binom{6}{4} cdot 9^{2}+binom{6}{5} cdot 9+1Notice that by adding 9^{6} as the first term to this expression of N, we get the expansion of (9+1)^{6}. Based on this,N=(9+1)^{6}-9^{6}=10^{6}-9^{6}=1000000-531441=468559IV. Solution: We can arrive at the last result more simply as follows. Consider all six-digit and six-digit writable numbers, including 0 in the form 000000, their number is 999999+1, or 10^{6}, because we take all 10 digits for each of the six places independently. To get the numbers that meet the requirement, we exclude the numbers that do not contain the digit 1, i.e., all those in which a digit other than 1 stands in each of the 6 places. Their number is 9^{6}, so N=10^{6}-9^{6}. (In the process, we also excluded 0.)Remarks: 1. The sum obtained in the second solution can be brought to the form 10^{6}-9^{6} obtained in the third solution by multiplying it by 1 in the form 10-9.2. In the fourth solution, we used the fact that the set of all natural numbers with at most six digits, and the set of numbers to be excluded due to not containing the digit 1 - including 0 in both sets - are identical to the 6-permutations with repetition of 10, and 9, respectively, different digits.3. Generalizations: a) In none of the solutions did we use the fact that the distinguished digit is precisely 1. Therefore, the number of natural numbers with at most six digits in which a given arbitrary (non-zero) digit occurs is: 468559.b) The reasoning in each solution can also be applied when we are looking for the number of natural numbers with at most n digits in which a given (non-zero) digit occurs. Their number (e.g., from the fourth solution) is 10^{n}-9^{n}.c) Examining the same question in an arbitrary base k number system - where k is a natural number greater than 1, and the digit in question is not 0 - the number of numbers that meet the requirement isk^{n}-(k-1)^{n}[^0]:    { }^{1} In line with the content of the problem, it is enough to say \\"number\\" instead of \\"natural number\\" for short.    { }^{2} Alternatively: these numbers range from 100 ... 0 to 199 ... 9, where the number of 0s and 9s is n, - so their number is "},{"problem":"## Task A-1.2.Given is the length of overline{A D} as 3.

For example, if a fisherman with a lying measure of 3 catches two fish, he will say he caught six fish. In response to the question: \\"How many fish did your left neighbor catch?\\", the answers (not necessarily in the order in which the fishermen stand) were 12,12,20,24,32,42 and 56. In response to the question: \\"How many fish did your right neighbor catch?\\", six fishermen answered 12,14,18,32, 48,70. What did the seventh fisherman answer?","solution":"Solution. Note that the product of all the numbers named by the fishermen in each of the surveys is the product of the number of fish caught, multiplied by the product of all the measures of lying of these fishermen.

It is a moderate difficulty problem. From the question, we can deduce that |x-2|leqslant frac{|a+b|+|a-b|}{|a|} always holds true for any real numbers a (a neq 0) and b. Furthermore, the minimum value of frac{|a+b|+|a-b|}{|a|} is 2, which leads us to the conclusion that |x-2|leqslant 2. From this, we can determine the possible values of x.[Solution]The inequality |a+b|+|a-b|geqslant |a|cdot|x-2| always holds true, which implies that |x-2|leqslant frac{|a+b|+|a-b|}{|a|} is true for any real numbers a (a neq 0) and b. Therefore, |x-2| is always less than or equal to the minimum value of the right side of the inequality.Since |a+b|+|a-b|geqslant |(a+b)+(a-b)|=2|a|, the equality holds true only when (a+b)(a-b)geqslant 0, or equivalently, when |a|geqslant |b|. Thus, the minimum value of frac{|a+b|+|a-b|}{|a|} is 2.Consequently, |x-2|leqslant 2.

Let one pair of roots be alpha and -alpha, the other beta and -beta (we can assume that alpha, beta > 0, since x=0 does not satisfy (1)), and the remaining two roots be gamma, delta.

We continue to use the above notation. alpha and -alpha satisfy (1), sobegin{aligned}& alpha^{6}-2 alpha^{5}-9 alpha^{4}+14 alpha^{3}+24 alpha^{2}-20 alpha-20=0 & alpha^{6}+2 alpha^{5}-9 alpha^{4}-14 alpha^{3}+24 alpha^{2}+20 alpha-20=0end{aligned}Accordingly, alpha can only be a number that also satisfies the difference of these two equalities:4 alphaleft(alpha^{4}-7 alpha^{2}+10right)=0However, alpha cannot be 0, as it is not a root of (1). From the resultingalpha^{4}-7 alpha^{2}+10=0equation, the values of alpha^{2}, beta^{2} are 2 and 5 in some order, but the order is irrelevant.The product of the root factors corresponding to the found roots is left(x^{2}-2right)left(x^{2}-5right)=x^{4}-7 x^{2}+10, and (1) can be divided by this (without remainder), and the quotient is x^{2}-2 x-2.

Let the pair of roots still be alpha and -alpha, and as we have seen, a neq 0, so the left side of (1) is divisible by the product of the corresponding root factors(x-alpha)(x+alpha)=x^{2}-alpha^{2}=x^{2}-awhere a=alpha^{2}. We will determine this. Performing the division, the quotient polynomial h(x) and the remainder polynomial m(x) are:begin{aligned}& h(x)=x^{4}-2 x^{3}+(a-9) x^{2}+(14-2 a) x+left(24-9 a+a^{2}right) & m(x)=left(-20+14 a-2 a^{2}right) x+left(-20+24 a-9 a^{2}+a^{3}right)end{aligned}The latter must be identically 0, so a is a number for which the following must simultaneously hold:begin{gathered}-20+14 a-2 a^{2}=0 20+24 a-9 a^{2}+a^{3}=0end{gathered}The roots of (11) are a_{1}=2 and a_{2}=5, and both are also roots of (12).

Thus, c = 6 - 2 = 4, and the foci are (-2, 0) and (2, 0). Let F_1 = (-2, 0) and F_2 = (2, 0).2. The line l passing through F_1 can be represented by the equation y = m(x + 2), where m is the slope. The slope of this line is also the slope of the tangent line to the ellipse at point A and B.3. The slope of the tangent line to the ellipse at point (x_0, y_0) is given by the derivative of the ellipse equation:y'=-frac{x}{3y}4. Equating these two slopes, we have:m = -frac{x_0}{3y_0}5. Substitute y_0 = m(x_0 + 2) into the ellipse equation, and solve for x_0 and y_0. This will give us the coordinates of points A and B.6.

However, the statement does not specify that the line bisects the chord, making the statement incorrect as it stands. Therefore, ① does not meet the requirements.Statement ②: A line passing through the outer end of a diameter is a tangent to the circle.- For a line to be a tangent to the circle, it must meet the circle at exactly one point and be perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact. The statement as given is incomplete because it does not specify that the line is perpendicular to the diameter at the point of contact, which is a necessary condition for the line to be a tangent. Therefore, ② does not meet the requirements.Statement ③: The four vertices of a quadrilateral with complementary diagonals lie on a circle.- This statement is true and is known as the converse of the inscribed angle theorem or the cyclic quadrilateral theorem.

So both cases reduce to an equationsum_{i=1}^{n} r^{beta_{i}}=sum_{i=1}^{n-1} r^{gamma_{i}}, quad beta_{i}, gamma_{i} in mathbb{Z}for some n leqslant 1011. Thus, if Alice can reach her goal, then this equation has a solution for n=1011 (we can add equal terms to both sums in order to increase n). Conversely, if (1) has a solution for n=1011, then Alice can compose a corresponding sequence of distances d_{0}, d_{1}, d_{2}, ldots, d_{2021} and then realise it by a sequence of moves. So the problem reduces to the solvability of (1) for n=1011. Assume that, for some rational r, there is a solution of (1). Write r in lowest terms as r=a / b. Substitute this into (1), multiply by the common denominator, and collect all terms on the left hand side to getsum_{i=1}^{2 n-1}(-1)^{i} a^{mu_{i}} b^{N-mu_{i}}=0, quad mu_{i} in{0,1, ldots, N}for some N geqslant 0. We assume that there exist indices j_{-} and j_{+} such that mu_{j_{-}}=0 and mu_{j_{+}}=N. Reducing (2) modulo a-b (so that a equiv b), we get0=sum_{i=1}^{2 n-1}(-1)^{i} a^{mu_{i}} b^{N-mu_{i}} equiv sum_{i=1}^{2 n-1}(-1)^{i} b^{mu_{i}} b^{N-mu_{i}}=-b^{N} quad bmod (a-b)Since operatorname{gcd}(a-b, b)=1, this is possible only if a-b=1. Reducing (2) modulo a+b (so that a equiv-b), we get0=sum_{i=1}^{2 n-1}(-1)^{i} a^{mu_{i}} b^{N-mu_{i}} equiv sum_{i=1}^{2 n-1}(-1)^{i}(-1)^{mu_{i}} b^{mu_{i}} b^{N-mu_{i}}=S b^{N} quad bmod (a+b)for some odd (thus nonzero) S with |S| leqslant 2 n-1. Since operatorname{gcd}(a+b, b)=1, this is possible only if a+b mid S. So a+b leqslant 2 n-1, and hence b=a-1 leqslant n-1=1010. Thus we have shown that any sought r has the form indicated in the answer. It remains to show that for any b=1,2, ldots, 1010 and a=b+1, Alice can reach the goal. For this purpose, in (1) we put n=a, beta_{1}=beta_{2}=cdots=beta_{a}=0, and gamma_{1}=gamma_{2}=cdots=gamma_{b}=1. Comment 1. Instead of reducing modulo a+b, one can reduce modulo a and modulo b. The first reduction shows that the number of terms in (2) with mu_{i}=0 is divisible by a, while the second shows that the number of terms with mu_{i}=N is divisible by b. Notice that, in fact, N>0, as otherwise (2) contains an alternating sum of an odd number of equal terms, which is nonzero. Therefore, all terms listed above have different indices, and there are at least a+b of them.Comment 2. Another way to investigate the solutions of equation (1) is to consider the Laurent polynomialL(x)=sum_{i=1}^{n} x^{beta_{i}}-sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x^{gamma_{i}}.We can pick a sufficiently large integer d so that P(x)=x^{d} L(x) is a polynomial in mathbb{Z}[x]. ThenP(1)=1,and1 leqslant|P(-1)| leqslant 2021If r=p / q with integers p>q geqslant 1 is a rational number with the properties listed in the problem statement, then P(p / q)=L(p / q)=0. As P(x) has integer coefficients,(p-q x) mid P(x)Plugging x=1 into (5) gives (p-q) mid P(1)=1, which implies p=q+1. Moreover, plugging x=-1 into (5) gives (p+q) mid P(-1), which, along with (4), implies p+q leqslant 2021 and q leqslant 1010. Hence x=(q+1) / q for some integer q with 1 leqslant q leqslant 1010."},{"problem":"2. Given are n light bulbs (n>13), each with its own switch.

Let (X) be the intersection of (P_1P_2) and (Q_1Q_2).4. The area of quadrilateral (P_1Q_1P_2Q_2) can be divided into four triangles: ([P_1XQ_1]), ([Q_1XP_2]), ([P_2XQ_2]), and ([Q_2XP_1]).5.

We need to determine the sum of all possible positive integers ( n ) such that the product of their digits equals ( n^2 - 15n - 27 ).2. First, consider the case where ( n ) is a one-digit number. For one-digit numbers, ( n ) ranges from 1 to 9. However, for these values, ( n^2 - 15n - 27 ) will be negative or zero, which cannot be the product of digits (since the product of digits must be a non-negative integer). Therefore, ( n ) must be a two-digit number.3. Let ( n = 10a + b ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are the digits of ( n ). The product of the digits is ( ab ). We need to solve the equation:   [   ab = (10a + b)^2 - 15(10a + b) - 27   ]4. Expanding and simplifying the right-hand side:   [   ab = (10a + b)^2 - 15(10a + b) - 27   ]   [   ab = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2 - 150a - 15b - 27   ]   [   ab = 100a^2 + 20ab + b^2 - 150a - 15b - 27   ]5. Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving ( a ) and ( b ):   [   0 = 100a^2 + 19ab + b^2 - 150a - 15b - 27   ]6. Notice that if ( a geq 2 ), the left side (product of digits) is positive, but the right side becomes negative, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, ( a = 1 ).7. Substitute ( a = 1 ) into the equation:   [   b = (10 cdot 1 + b)^2 - 15(10 cdot 1 + b) - 27   ]   [   b = (10 + b)^2 - 150 - 15b - 27   ]   [   b = 100 + 20b + b^2 - 150 - 15b - 27   ]   [   b = b^2 + 5b - 77   ]8. Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:   [   b^2 + 4b - 77 = 0   ]9. Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula ( b = frac{-B pm sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} ):   [   b = frac{-4 pm sqrt{16 + 308}}{2}   ]   [   b = frac{-4 pm sqrt{324}}{2}   ]   [   b = frac{-4 pm 18}{2}   ]10. This gives two solutions for ( b ):    [    b = frac{14}{2} = 7 quad text{and} quad b = frac{-22}{2} = -11    ]11. Since ( b ) must be a digit (0-9), the only valid solution is ( b = 7 ).12.

Hence, y does not have a minimum value of 2 in the given interval.Option C: y=dfrac{x^2+3}{sqrt{x^2+2}}For this function, we can make a judgment without detailed calculations.

Thus, 10^2 + 15^2 neq 18^2, indicating that these numbers do not form a Pythagorean triple.- Option C: frac{1}{3}, frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{5}  - These are not positive integers, and even if we check, left(frac{1}{3}right)^2 + left(frac{1}{4}right)^2 = frac{1}{9} + frac{1}{16} = frac{16+9}{144} = frac{25}{144}, which equals left(frac{1}{5}right)^2.

For both types of endings, there are 3 cdot 2=6 possible sequences, and the first place of the remaining three digits can be filled in 3 ways. After each such start, the other 2 digits can be written in 2 different orders.

Any number that gives a remainder of 0 in any division (and of course the quotient is greater than 1) is deleted because it is not a prime number.The II., IV., VII., and XII. numbers are divisible by 11, because in the first, for example, (1+4)-(3+2)=0, which is divisible by 11. According to the test, the III. and XI. numbers are divisible by 7, the X. number by 19, and the VI. number by 29. Dividing 2341 by the following odd prime numbers:3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47a remainder always appears in every case, so 2341 is a prime number. It is unnecessary to try with larger prime numbers because if, for example, 53 were a divisor of 2341, then the quotient 2341: 53=q would be an integer, and indeed less than 53, since 53 q=2341<2809=53^{2}, which, when divided by 53, gives q<53. Thus, q could not be a prime number due to the completed division tests, nor could it be a composite number because then it would have a prime divisor from the above list. Similarly, 2341 is not divisible by any prime number smaller than it and larger than 47. However, the test with 47 was still necessary because 47^{2}=2209<2341.In general, when looking for the prime factorization of a number, it is sufficient to try with primes whose square is not greater than the number. Indeed, if n is a composite number: n=a cdot b, and here 1<a leq b, then n=a b geq a^{2}, a leq sqrt{n}, so either a or a prime divisor of a is also a prime divisor of n.Based on this, after the division tests with primes up to 61 for 4231, up to 37 for 1423, and up to 43 for 2143, all of which end with a remainder, it can be stated that the respective number is a prime number.According to all of this, there are 4 prime numbers among the given numbers.Zsuzsa Fodor (Pápa, Türr I. g.

Understanding the Problem:   - We need to color the integers in ( k ) colors.   - For the set ( S = {a+1, a+2, ldots, a+t} ) to be *good*, no element in ( S ) should be the sum of two integers of the same color.2. Initial Consideration:   - Consider the smallest possible ( a ), which is ( a = 1 ).   - The set ( S ) becomes ( {2, 3, ldots, t+1} ).3. Coloring Strategy:   - We need to ensure that no element in ( S ) can be written as the sum of two integers of the same color.   - If we color the integers ( 1, 2, ldots, t+1 ) in ( k ) colors, we need to avoid any two integers of the same color summing to an element in ( S ).4. Maximizing ( t ):   - The maximum ( t ) is determined by the constraint that no two integers of the same color can sum to an element in ( S ).   - If we use ( k ) colors, the worst-case scenario is that each color is used at least twice within the range ( {1, 2, ldots, t+1} ).5.

Now we get the sides of the big rectangle being 15 and 10, so the area is boxed{textbf{(E)} 150}. ~avamaroraSolution 2Using the diagram we find that the larger side of the small rectangle is 2 times the length of the smaller side. Therefore, the longer side is 5 cdot 2 = 10. So the area of the identical rectangles is 5 cdot 10 = 50. We have 3 identical rectangles that form the large rectangle. Therefore the area of the large rectangle is 50 cdot 3 = boxed{textbf{(E)} 150}.    ~~fath2012Solution 3We see that if the short sides are 5, the long side has to be 5cdot2=10 because the long side is equal to the 2 short sides and because the rectangles are congruent. If that is to be, then the long side of the BIG rectangle(rectangle ABCD)is 10+5=15 because long side + short side of the small rectangle is 15. The short side of rectangle ABCD is 10 because it is the long side of the short rectangle.

Given that one small side is 5, we can determine that two of the small sides make up a big side which means that the long side is equal to 10.

Since 1000 = ( 2^3 times 5^3 ), ( P ) must be divisible by both ( 2^3 ) and ( 5^3 ).3. For ( P ) to be divisible by ( 5^3 = 125 ), ( underline{A}underline{B}underline{C} ) must be divisible by 125.

However, given the base of the logarithm is frac{1}{2} (which is less than 1), the function f(x) decreases as its argument {{x^2}-2x-8} increases due to the nature of logarithms with bases between 0 and 1. Therefore, we need to find the intervals where {{x^2}-2x-8} is increasing to determine where f(x) is decreasing, because for this function, its increasing interval corresponds to the decreasing interval of its argument.Firstly, let's rewrite the argument {{x^2}-2x-8} as a quadratic function y=x^{2}-2x-8. We can factor this quadratic function as follows:[y = x^{2} - 2x - 8 = left(x-4right)left(x+2right)]The roots of this equation are x=4 and x=-2. By analyzing the sign of the factors in the intervals determined by these roots, we find that the function y is positive (i.e., y > 0) when x  4. In the context of the function f(x), when y (or {{x^2}-2x-8}) is positive and increasing, f(x) is decreasing due to the logarithm's base being frac{1}{2}.To find the decreasing interval of y, we consider the nature of a quadratic function, which is concave up (since the coefficient of x^2 is positive). This means that y decreases as x moves from -infty to the vertex and then increases as x moves away from the vertex towards +infty. Given that y is positive and increasing on both sides of the roots, but we are interested in where y itself is decreasing to match the increasing behavior of f(x), we look at the interval between the roots where y is negative and not our focus. Therefore, the decreasing interval of y does not directly inform the increasing interval of f(x). Instead, we understand that f(x) is monotonically increasing where y=x^{2}-2x-8 is decreasing due to the inverse relationship imposed by the logarithmic function. This decreasing behavior of y translates to the interval (-infty, -2) for f(x), as it is before reaching the root x = -2, where y starts to increase.Thus, the monotonically increasing interval of the function f(x)={log_{frac{1}{2}}}({{x^2}-2x-8}) is:[boxed{(-infty, -2)}]"},{"problem":"6.068. left{begin{array}{l}x^{3}+y^{3}=7  x^{3} y^{3}=-8end{array}right.","solution":"## Solution.According to Vieta's theorem, only the following options are possible:1) left{begin{array}{l}x^{3}=8,  y^{3}=-1,end{array} quadleft{begin{array}{l}x_{1}=2  y_{1}=-1end{array}right.right.or quad 2)left{begin{array}{l}x^{3}=-1,  y^{3}=8,end{array},left{begin{array}{l}x_{2}=-1,  y_{2}=2 .end{array}right.right.Answer: (2 ;-1)(-1 ; 2)."},{"problem":"10.

What is the maximum possible number of triangles with equal areas?","solution":"om46_3r_img_12.jpgLet's denote the considered pentagon by ABCDE, and the pentagon formed by the intersection points of the diagonals by KLMNP so that the following triangles are those mentioned in the problem:Delta_0: triangle LEM; quad Delta_1: triangle EMA;Delta_2: triangle MAN; quad Delta_3: triangle ANB;Delta_4: triangle NBP; quad Delta_5: triangle BPC;Delta_6: triangle PCK; quad Delta_7: triangle CKD;Delta_8: triangle KDL; quad Delta_9: triangle DLE(figure 12). We will start by proving the implication:We assume that the numbering of the triangles is cyclic (that is, we assume: Delta_{-1} = Delta_9; Delta_{10} = Delta_0).Suppose, for example, that triangles Delta_4, Delta_5, and Delta_6 have equal areas. From the equality of the areas of triangles NBP and BPC, it follows that segment BP is a median in triangle BCN; from the equality of the areas of triangles BPC and PCK, it follows that segment CP is a median in triangle BCK. Point P would then be the common midpoint of diagonals BK and CN of quadrilateral BCKN, which should therefore be a parallelogram - but the lines BN and CK intersect at point E. This is a contradiction; implication (1) is proven.We proceed to the main solution. The example of a regular pentagon shows that it is possible to obtain five triangles Delta_i with equal areas. We will prove that it is not possible to obtain seven such triangles.Suppose, therefore, that there exists a seven-element set Z, contained in the set {0,1,ldots,9}, such that triangles Delta_i with indices i in Z have equal areas. Let k, l, m be three numbers from the set {0,1,ldots,9}, not belonging to Z. Consider all triples of consecutive indices:where, as before, the addition i pm 1 should be understood modulo 10. Each number from the set {0,1,ldots,9} belongs to exactly three triples T_i. This applies, in particular, to each of the numbers k, l, m. Therefore, the three-element set {k,l,m} has a non-empty intersection with at most nine triples T_i. At least one triple T_j remains that does not contain any of the numbers k, l, m, and is therefore contained in the set Z. The number j must be even, according to observation (1).Without loss of generality, assume that j = 2. This means that the numbers 1, 2, 3 belong to the set Z. Therefore, the numbers 0 and 4 cannot belong to it (since, again by observation (1), the triples {0,1,2} and {2,3,4} are excluded); thus, one of the numbers k, l, m equals 0, and another equals 4. The third of these numbers must be part of the triple {6,7,8} (which otherwise would be contained in the set Z, contrary to implication (1)). The roles of the numbers 6 and 8 are symmetric in this context. We therefore have to consider two essentially different cases:The set Z, respectively, has one of the following forms:Let S_i be the area of triangle Delta_i (for i = 0,1,ldots,9). We will show that the implications hold:This will be a proof that none of the seven-element sets Z listed above can be the set of indices of triangles with equal areas. According to earlier statements, this will also justify the conclusion that among the ten triangles Delta_i, there are never seven triangles with the same area.Proof of implication (2). From the given equalities of areas:andit follows (respectively) that points N and P are the midpoints of segments BM and BK, and points M and L are the midpoints of segments EN and EK (figure 13).Thus, segment NP connects the midpoints of two sides of triangle BMK, and segment ML connects the midpoints of two sides of triangle ENK, and therefore- andThe obtained parallelism relations show that quadrilateral AMKN is a parallelogram; hence |MK| = |AN|. Line MK is parallel to NC, so triangles ENC and EMK are similar in the ratio |EN| : |EM| = 2. Therefore, |NC| = 2 cdot |MK|, and consequentlyThe segments PC and AN, lying on the same line, are the bases of triangles ANB and BPC with a common vertex B. The ratio of the lengths of these bases is therefore also the ratio of the areas of the triangles: area(BPC) : area(ANB) = 3 : 2, i.e., S_5 : S_3 = 3 : 2. The conclusion of implication (2) is thus proven.om46_3r_img_13.jpgom46_3r_img_14.jpgProof of implication (3). The given equalities of the areas of triangles:andshow that points M and N divide segment EB into three equal parts, and similarly, points L and K divide segment EC into three equal parts. Therefore, line BC is parallel to ML (i.e., to AM). Since N is the midpoint of segment BM, triangles AMN and CBN are similar in the ratio -1 (figure 14). Hence, area(AMN) = area(CBN) >  area(CBP), i.e., S_2 > S_5. This completes the proof of implication (3), and thus also the proof of the general theorem: it is not possible to have seven triangles Delta_i with equal areas.The reasoning conducted in the last case (proof of (3)) also provides a hint on how to obtain six triangles Delta_i with equal areas. We take any isosceles triangle BCE where |EB| = |EC|. On the sides EB and EC, we find points M and N and L and K, dividing these sides into three equal parts:The intersection points of line ML with lines CN and BK are denoted by A and D, respectively (figure 14 can still serve as an illustration; one only needs to imagine moving point E to the perpendicular bisector of side BC and appropriately repositioning the other points). The equalities (4) and (5) then hold; and thanks to the assumption that triangle BCE is isosceles (and the resulting symmetry of the entire configuration), all areas appearing in relations (4) and (5) are equal.Conclusion: six of the triangles Delta_i can have equal areas, and this number cannot be increased."},{"problem":"Frankin 5.P.Let p be a prime number.

On the ceiling of a room, there are 15 lamps, numbered from 1 to 15. Initially, all the lamps are off. In another room, there are 15 switches: one switch for lamp 1 and 2, one switch for lamp 2 and 3, one switch for lamp 3 and 4, and so on, up to a switch for lamp 15 and 1. When the switch for such a pair of lamps is flipped, the status of each of those two lamps changes (from on to off or vice versa). The switches are arranged in a random order and all look identical. Raymond wants to find out which switch corresponds to which pair of lamps. From the room with the switches, he cannot see the lamps. However, he can flip a number of switches and then go to the other room to see which lamps are on. He can do this multiple times. How many times does he need to go to the other room at a minimum to be certain which switch corresponds to which pair of lamps?","solution":"Solution. With three rounds of walking, Raymond can never be certain. Indeed, if for each switch you note whether it is in the initial position or the flipped position in the three rounds, then you can get 2^{3}=8 different patterns. However, there are 15 switches, so there are multiple switches with the same pattern, and Raymond can never distinguish these switches. Therefore, he must walk at least four times. We will prove that this is indeed sufficient.Assume that Raymond, starting from the situation where all the lights are off, flips a number of switches. If he flips all the switches or none at all, then all the lights will still be off afterward. Otherwise, there will always be a light that has been changed by only one flipped switch, so it will be on. Consider such a light i that is on. Then the switch with i-1 and i or the switch with i and i+1 has been flipped. (Consider the light numbers modulo 15.) First, assume that the latter is the case. Now consider light i+1. If it is off, then the switch with i+1 and i+2 has also been flipped; if it is on, then that switch has not been used. Next, we can deduce from the status of light i+2 whether the switch with i+2 and i+3 has been flipped or not. By continuing this process, we see that it is determined for all switches whether they have been flipped or not. In the second case, if it is precisely the switch with i-1 and i that has been flipped, then it is also determined for all switches whether they have been flipped or not. Therefore, there are exactly two combinations of switches that result in the same status of the lights. If we choose one of these combinations and then flip all 15 switches again, the same lights will be on, so this must result in exactly the second combination of switches. If the first combination of switches contains an even number of switches, then the second combination contains 15 minus that number, so an odd number of switches.However, Raymond knows himself how many switches he has flipped. He can deduce from the situation of the lights which two combinations of switches are possible, and only one of these can match the number of switches he has flipped. Therefore, he can precisely determine which lights the switches he has flipped correspond to; he only does not know which is which within that group of switches.Now write the numbers 1 to 15 in binary notation. For this, a maximum of 4 digits are needed; pad with zeros if necessary so that each number is written with exactly 4 digits. Raymond numbers the switches with these binary numbers. In the first round, he flips the switches whose numbers in binary notation start with a 1 and notes the 8 corresponding light pairs. In the second round, he first resets all the switches and then chooses the numbers that have a 1 in the second position in binary notation. Similarly, in the third round, he chooses the third position in the binary notation, and in the fourth round, the fourth position. In each round, he can determine which light pairs the switches he has used correspond to (only not which is which). Since each switch corresponds to a unique combination of rounds, he can then figure out for each switch which light pair it controls. For example, if a certain light pair is turned on in the first round, not in the second round, in the third round, and also in the fourth round, then it corresponds to the switch with binary code 1011, which is switch 11. Therefore, he can succeed in four rounds of walking."},{"problem":"## Task 2 - 320522In a cabinet, there are 11 checkered, 7 lined, and 12 unlined notepads, and no others.

Each gangster is a member of several gangs, and there are no two gangs with the same membership. It turned out that gangsters who are in the same gang do not feud, but if a gangster is not a member of a certain gang, then he feuds with at least one of its members. What is the maximum number of gangs that could exist in Chicago?","solution":"If gangsters are not enemies, we will consider that they are friends. Then a gang is the largest friendly group (adding any gangster violates its friendliness). We will call any such group a gang if it is not one already.Example. Suppose gangsters are divided into 12 triples, gangsters from the same triple are enemies, and from different triples are friends. Then each gang contains exactly one gangster from each triple. Therefore, there will be 3^{12} gangs.Estimate. First method. Let's call the authority of a gangster the number of gangs he is a part of.Lemma. Suppose two gangsters are enemies. Then replacing one of them with a clone of the other, more authoritative one, increases the number of gangs. We assume that the gangster and his clone are enemies.Proof. Consider gangster G. Each gang contains him or one of his enemies. Let the gangs of the first type form the set A, and the second type - B. Remove G.In this case, all gangs from B remain gangs, while some gangs from A, having lost a member, may cease to be gangs, losing their maximality.We will show that no new gangs have formed. Consider a new gang. If it contains someone from the enemies of G, then it was already a gang from B. If it consists only of friends of G, then it is not possible to add enemies of G to it, so G was part of it before removal. Thus, this gang was already a gang from A.Therefore, the number of gangs has decreased by no more than the authority of G.Let gangster X be a more authoritative enemy of gangster G. The authority of X has not changed. Each gang now contains X or an enemy of X. Add gangster K - a clone of X. The former gangs will remain gangs, but gangs containing K will be added, and their number is equal to the authority of X. Thus, the number of gangs has increased over the two operations.Suppose the relationships of 36 gangsters are such that the number of gangs is the largest possible. From the lemma, it follows that in this case, enemies have the same authorities. Take any gangster X. Replace his enemy with a clone of X. According to the lemma, the number of gangs will not change. Therefore, the authorities of the enemies will again be the same. Consequently, we can replace another enemy of X with a clone of X without changing the number of gangs. We will do this with all the enemies of X. We will get a group of gangsters who are enemies of each other and are friends with all other gangsters.Take a gangster not from this group and do the same with him, and so on. In the end, all gangsters will be divided into groups, where gangsters from the same group are enemies, and from different groups are friends. Then the number of gangs is the product of the sizes of the groups."},{"problem":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a} = (1, 0), overrightarrow{b} = (0, 1), overrightarrow{c} = koverrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b} (k in mathbb{R}), overrightarrow{d} = overrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{b}.

We mark blue points in such a way that there is a blue point inside every triangle whose vertices are red points. What is the positive integer k for which it is always possible to achieve this using k blue points, but there is an arrangement of the red points for which k-1 points are not sufficient?","solution":"Solution. We will show that the sought number is 1991; in general, for n red points, where n geq 3, 2n-5 blue points are needed, no more.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_c396c616c702ea5e5669g-1.jpg?height=488&width=634&top_left_y=249&top_left_x=732)First, we give a system of points P_{i}, i=1,2, ldots, n for which at least 2n-5 blue points are needed. For example, draw a circular arc from P_{3} to an interior point of the side P_{1} P_{2} of the triangle P_{1} P_{2} P_{3}, and mark the remaining n-3 points in its interior (Fig. 3). Then none of the triangles P_{1} P_{i} P_{i+1}, P_{2} P_{i} P_{i+1} (3 leq i leq n-1) and P_{1} P_{2} P_{n} have a common interior point, so there must be a blue point in the interior of each. Thus, at least2(n-3)+1=2n-5blue points are needed.Now let P_{1}, P_{2}, ldots, P_{n} be an arbitrary system of red points. We provide a procedure for placing the blue points. Choose a line e that is not parallel to any line P_{i} P_{j}, and a sufficiently small distance d, for example, smaller than the heights of all triangles with red vertices. This is possible because there are only finitely many point pairs and finitely many triangles.Now draw a line e_{i} parallel to e through each point P_{i}. Then there will be an e_{u} whose one side has no red points, and an e_{v} whose side not containing e_{u} has no red points.There are no red points on these lines other than P_{u} and P_{v}, because there are no three red points on a line, and according to the choice of e, neither of these lines can have two. Every other line e_{i} intersects the segment P_{u} P_{v}, which lies inside the convex hull of the point system.Place a blue point on each ray starting from P_{i} at a distance d from P_{i}, which has a common point with the interior of the convex hull. With this, we have met the requirements of the problem. The lines through the vertices of a red triangle, in fact, differ from the side lines. Thus, one of the lines has a common point with the interior of the triangle. The blue point marked on this is inside the triangle due to the choice of d.Let's count the blue points. We placed two blue points near each red point inside the convex hull, and one blue point near each red point on the boundary of the convex hull, except for P_{u} and P_{v}, to which we did not place blue points. Let b be the number of vertices of the convex hull. There are n-b red points inside the convex hull. The number of blue points is therefore2(n-b)+b-2=2n-b-2 leq 2n-5With this, we have also proven the second part of the statement to be proven.Remarks: 1. Instead of parallel lines, we can choose a point O outside the convex hull such that it is not on any line P_{i} P_{j}, and place the blue points on the lines e_{i}=O P_{i} according to the above prescription.2. It is easy to see that in the general case, 2n-b-2 blue points are needed. This follows if we show that no matter how we decompose the convex hull of the points into triangles, none of which have a common interior point, the number of triangles is always 2n-b-2. This is also true if more than two points can lie on a line, just not all.A decomposition with the desired properties exists. We can obtain one, for example, by decomposing the convex hull of the point system into triangles with diagonals from a vertex, then taking a point that is not a vertex of any drawn triangle and connecting it to the vertices of the triangle or triangles containing it. In a finite number of points, we can reach a decomposition with the desired properties in a finite number of steps.Denoting the number of triangles in a decomposition with the desired properties by h, the sum of the angles in these triangles is h cdot 180^{circ}. The vertices of these angles are the points of our point system. Around each point inside the convex hull, a total of 360^{circ} is formed (independently of the decomposition). The sum of the angles formed around the points on the boundary of the convex hull, however, is the sum of the angles of a b-gon, which is (b-2) cdot 180^{circ}. Thus,h cdot 180^{circ}=(n-b) cdot 360^{circ}+(b-2) cdot 180^{circ}, quad text { so } quad h=2n-b-2,as stated.[^0][^0]:    { }^{1} If a polygon has additional points on its sides, and we consider each of these as vertices with an internal angle of 180^{circ}, the formula for the sum of the angles clearly remains valid."},{"problem":"4 cdot 200 A dance party has 42 participants.

There are 10 more chords parallel to it ( K_{5} K_{8}, etc.), i.e., we get a set of 11 chords parallel to each other.

Consider the identity function:   Let ( f(n) = n ). Then,   [ f(f(n)) = f(n) = n ]   and   [ frac{n + f(n)}{2} = frac{n + n}{2} = n. ]   Therefore,   [ f(f(n)) = n le n, ]   which satisfies the given inequality. Hence, the identity function ( f(n) = n ) is a solution.2. Assume ( f ) is not the identity function:   If ( f ) is not the identity function, there exists some ( n in mathbb{N} ) such that ( f(n) neq n ). We consider two cases: ( f(n) > n ) and ( f(n) < n ).3. Case 1: ( f(n) > n ):   If ( f(n) > n ), then   [ f(f(n)) le frac{n + f(n)}{2} < f(n). ]   This implies that ( f(f(n)) < f(n) ). Since ( f ) is injective, ( f(n) ) must be distinct for different ( n ), and thus ( f(f(n)) ) must be less than ( f(n) ).4. Case 2: ( f(n) < n ):   If ( f(n) < n ), then   [ f(f(n)) le frac{n + f(n)}{2} < n. ]   This implies that ( f(f(n)) < n ). By induction, if ( f^k(n) < n ) for any ( 1 le k le m ), then   [ f^{m+1}(n) le frac{f^m(n) + f^{m-1}(n)}{2} < n. ]   This means all iterations of ( f ) applied to ( n ) will be less than ( n ).5. Cycle formation:   Since ( n ) is finite, the iterations will either form a cycle or stop at some point. Suppose they form a cycle of the form ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_t ) where ( f(a_i) = a_{i+1} ) and ( f(a_t) = a_1 ). Consider the greatest ( a_i ), say ( a_M ). Then,   [ a_{M+1} = f(a_M) le frac{a_M + a_{M-1}}{2}. ]   Since ( a_{M-1} neq a_M ) and ( a_{M-1} < a_M ), it follows that ( a_{M+1} < a_M ). Repeating this process, we find that all iterations of ( f(a_i) ) for ( i neq M ) will be strictly less than ( a_M ), and therefore will not return to ( a_M ).6. Contradiction:   If the iterations stop at some point, let the last term be ( a_m ). Then ( f(a_{m-1}) = a_m ) and ( f(a_m) = a_m ). Since ( f ) is injective, ( a_{m-1} neq a_m ) is impossible.

This implies that f(x + 2) = f(x) for every x in mathbb{R}, which indicates that f(x) is a periodic function with a period of 2.1. To determine whether f(x) is an odd function, we need to check if f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in mathbb{R}. Since f(x) is periodic and when x in [-1, 1), f(x) = x, we know that f(1) = f(-1 + 2) = f(-1) = -1. However, since f(1) = 1, so f(-1) neq -f(1). Thus, f(x) is not an odd function. Statement ① is incorrect.2. As previously shown, f(x) is a periodic function with period 2. Statement ② is correct.3. Since when x in [-1, 1), we have f(x) = x, it follows that f(0) = 0.

Since sin x varies between -1 and 1, t will also belong to the interval [-1, 1].Substituting t = sin x into the expression, we have the following quadratic function in terms of t:y = -2t^2 + 6t + 1.To find the maximum value of this quadratic function, we can complete the square or find the vertex of the parabola that this equation represents. Completing the square, we have:begin{align*}y &= -2(t^2 - 3t) + 1 &= -2left(t^2 - 3t + left(frac{3}{2}right)^2right) + 2left(frac{3}{2}right)^2 + 1 &= -2left(t - frac{3}{2}right)^2 + frac{9}{2} + 1 &= -2left(t - frac{3}{2}right)^2 + frac{11}{2}.end{align*}Since the coefficient of the squared term is negative, this function opens downwards, and thus reaches its maximum at the vertex of the parabola, when t = frac{3}{2}. However, we must remember that t = sin x, and sin x cannot exceed 1. Thus, the maximum value of t is 1, not frac{3}{2}.Plugging this value back into our quadratic function:y_{text{max}} = -2(1 - frac{3}{2})^2 + frac{11}{2} = -2left(-frac{1}{2}right)^2 + frac{11}{2} = -2left(frac{1}{4}right) + frac{11}{2} = -frac{1}{2} + frac{11}{2} = frac{10}{2} = 5.So, the maximum value of the function f(x) is boxed{5}."},{"problem":"Let P(x)=x^3+ax^2+bx+c be a polynomial where a,b,c are integers and c  is odd.

Essay on Suitcases (from 10th grade, 6 points). In the book by Szczepan Jelenski { }^{7}, there is a small essay about suitcases.A department store received 10 suitcases and 10 keys in a separate envelope, with the warning that each key opens only one suitcase and that a suitable key can be found for each suitcase.The store employee who received the suitcases sighed:- What a hassle with key fitting! I know how stubborn inanimate objects can be!! If you start trying to find a key for the first suitcase, it will surely turn out that only the tenth key fits. You'll have to try ten keys for one suitcase, and for ten suitcases - a whole hundred times!We won't quote Jelenski further, but will briefly summarize the essence. The saleswoman said that the number of attempts would not exceed 10+9+8+ldots+2+1=55, another employee suggested reducing the number of attempts even further, since if a key doesn't fit 9 suitcases, it will definitely fit the tenth. Therefore, the number of attempts would not exceed 9+8+ldots+1=45. Moreover, he stated that this would only happen in the worst-case scenario - when each time the key fits the last suitcase. In reality, the number of attempts would be approximately![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_a933850cc044137d5d9dg-11.jpg?height=551&width=446&top_left_y=1666&top_left_x=291)half of the maximum possible number of attempts, that is, 22.5.Igor Fedorovich Akulich from Minsk wondered why the average number of attempts equals half of the number 45? After all, the last attempt is not needed only if the key doesn't fit any suitcase except the last one, but in all other cases, the last successful attempt also takes place. Akulich suspected that the claim about 22.5 attempts was baseless, and in reality, things are a bit different.Problem.

After the first suitcase is somehow opened, there will be n-1 suitcases left, and it will take X_{n-1} attempts for them. And so on. Therefore, X_{n}=Y+X_{n-1}, and by transitioning to expectations and introducing the notation e_{n}=mathrm{E} X_{n} for brevity, we find:e_{n}=e_{n-1}+frac{n+1}{2}-frac{1}{n}=e_{n-2}+frac{n}{2}-frac{1}{n-1}+frac{n+1}{2}-frac{1}{n} text { and so on. }Considering that e_{1}=0, we eventually obtain an explicit formula:begin{aligned}& e_{n}=frac{3+4+ldots+(n+1)}{2}-left(frac{1}{n}+frac{1}{n-1}+ldots+frac{1}{2}right)= & =frac{(n-1)(n+4)}{4}+1-left(frac{1}{n}+frac{1}{n-1}+ldots+frac{1}{2}+1right)=frac{n(n+3)}{4}-H_{n}end{aligned}where H_{n} is the n-th harmonic number, equal to1+frac{1}{2}+frac{1}{3}+frac{1}{4}+ldots+frac{1}{n}It is known that H_{n} approx ln n+gamma+frac{1}{2 n}, where gamma=0,5772 ldots is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.

Solution","solution":": n = 5 with equation 5x 2 - 5x + 1 with roots (1 ± √(1/5) )/2. The product of the roots lies in the interval (0, 1), so b must be 1, 2, 3, ... or n-1 (1). The larger root is (-a + √(a 2 - 4bn) )/(2n). This must be less than 1, so -a  4bn (3). Putting (2) and (3) together we get: (n + b - 1) 2 ≥ a 2 ≥ 4bn + 1. So if b = 1, then n ≥ 5. If b = 2, then n ≥ 6. If b = 3, then n ≥ 8. If b = 4, then n ≥ 10. Thus there are no solutions for n < 5 (which requires b < 4 by (1) ).

Let the numbers at the vertices be denoted as x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{2019}. Since the sum of any nine consecutive numbers is the same, the numbers that are 8 apart are equal. Therefore, x_{1}=x_{10}=x_{19}=ldots=x_{1+9 k}=ldots. Since 2019 is not divisible by 9 but is divisible by 3, continuing this sequence in a cycle will include all numbers of the form x_{3 k+1}. Similar sequences can be constructed starting from the numbers x_{2} and x_{3}. Thus, the numbers at the vertices that have the same remainder when divided by 3 are equal.Since each set of nine consecutive numbers contains three sets of vertices with different remainders when divided by 3, the sum of the numbers in each such set is 100. Note that 19 gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, 20 gives a remainder of 2, and 2019 gives a remainder of 0, so the number written at vertex 2019 is 100 - 19 - 20 = 61.## CriteriaThe largest suitable criterion is used:7 points.

Hence, the sum of the first n terms of this sequence is:S_{text{maintenance}} = frac{n}{2} [2a_1 + (n-1)d] = frac{n}{2} [2 times 1000 + (n-1) times 2000]Simplifying, we get:S_{text{maintenance}} = 1000n + 1000n^2 - 1000n = 1000n^2Therefore, the total cost S_n after n years is:S_n = 169000 + 10000n + 1000n^2S_n = 1000n^2 + 10000n + 169000(Ⅱ) To find the economically optimal number of years for scrapping the car, we consider the average annual cost A_n, which is S_n divided by n:A_n = frac{S_n}{n}A_n = frac{1000n^2 + 10000n + 169000}{n}A_n = 1000n + 10000 + frac{169000}{n}The minimum average annual cost occurs when the derivative of A_n with respect to n equals zero. However, an alternative method without using calculus is recognizing that the expression for A_n has two terms that are inversely proportional to each other (1000n and frac{169000}{n}). The average cost is minimized when these two terms are equal:1000n = frac{169000}{n}n^2 = frac{169000}{1000}n^2 = 169n = 13Therefore, using the car for 13 years and then scrapping it is the most cost-effective strategy.boxed{13; text{years}} is the optimal number of years to use the car before scrapping it."},{"problem":"Let n be an integer, and let triangle ABC be a right-angles triangle with right angle at C. It is given that sin A and sin B are the roots of the quadratic equation [(5n+8)x^2-(7n-20)x+120=0.] Find the value of n","solution":"1. Given that triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at C, we know that angle A + angle B = frac{pi}{2}. Therefore, sin B = sinleft(frac{pi}{2} - Aright) = cos A.2. Using the Pythagorean identity, we have sin^2 A + cos^2 A = 1. Since sin B = cos A, it follows that sin^2 A + sin^2 B = 1.3. By Vieta's formulas for the quadratic equation (5n+8)x^2 - (7n-20)x + 120 = 0, the sum of the roots sin A + sin B is given by:   [   sin A + sin B = frac{7n - 20}{5n + 8}   ]   and the product of the roots sin A sin B is given by:   [   sin A sin B = frac{120}{5n + 8}   ]4.

Simplify the equation:   [   1 = frac{(7n - 20)^2 - 240}{(5n + 8)^2}   ]   Cross-multiplying to clear the denominator, we get:   [   (5n + 8)^2 = (7n - 20)^2 - 240(5n + 8)   ]6.

Answer: the only solution is (p, q)=(13,31).If p=q, then it must also hold that p^{2}-p-1=2 q+3=2 p+3. This can be factored as (p-4)(p+1)=0. Since 4 and -1 are not prime numbers, this does not yield any solutions.In the other case, we have p mid 2 q+3 and q mid p^{2}-p-1. Since 2 q+3 and p^{2}-p-1 are positive, it follows that p leq 2 q+3 and q leq p^{2}-p-1. To find a sharper lower bound for p, we multiply the two relationsbegin{aligned}p q & leq (2 q+3)left(p^{2}-p-1right) & = 2 q p^{2}-2 q p-2 q+3left(p^{2}-p-1right) & = 3left(p^{2}-p-1right)-2 qend{aligned}where we have discarded terms with a factor p q. Note now that 3left(p^{2}-p-1right)-2 q geq 3 q-2 q=q>0. This means that the above divisibility relation leads tobegin{aligned}p q & leq 3left(p^{2}-p-1right)-2 q & =3 p^{2}-3 p-(2 q+3) & leq 3 p^{2}-3 p-p & =3 p^{2}-4 p .end{aligned}If we move 4 p to the other side and divide by p, we find that q+4 leq 3 p, orfrac{2 q+3}{6}<frac{q+4}{3} leq pSince p is a divisor of 2 q+3, we conclude that 2 q+3=k p with k in{1,2,3,4,5}. If k=1, then we have 2 q+3=p and thus also q=p^{2}-p-1. But then it would hold that p=2 q+3=2left(p^{2}-p-1right)+3=2 p^{2}-2 p+1. This can be factored as (2 p-1)(p-1)=0, which has no solutions with p prime. If k=2 or k=4, then k p is even. But 2 q+3 is odd, so these cases are ruled out. If k=3, then from 2 q+3=3 p it follows that q must be a multiple of 3. Since q is prime, we then have q=3, and thus also p=(2 q+3) / 3=3. Checking shows that this is not a solution to the original equation.The last case is k=5. Then we have 5 p=2 q+3 and from the original equation, we have 5 q=p^{2}-p-1. If we substitute this, we find 25 p=5(2 q+3)= 2left(p^{2}-p-1right)+15=2 p^{2}-2 p+13. This can be factored as (p-13)(2 p-1)=0. This gives the possible solution p=13 with q=(5 p-3) / 2=31.

Comparing these two numbers: -frac{1}{2023} < frac{1}{2023}. Hence, the opposite number of frac{1}{2023} is not greater than frac{1}{2023} itself.- For option D: 2023, the opposite number is -2023. Comparing these two numbers: -2023 < 2023. Therefore, the opposite number of 2023 is not greater than 2023 itself.Given the comparisons above, only option A satisfies the condition where the opposite number is greater than the number itself.Therefore, the answer is: boxed{A}."},{"problem":"Given the complex number z= frac {2i}{1-i} (where i is the imaginary unit), the imaginary part of the complex number z is (　　).A: iB: 1C: -iD: -1","solution":"Solution: z= frac {2i}{1-i}= frac {2i(1+i)}{(1-i)(1+i)}= frac {2i-2}{2}=-1+i,  Therefore, the imaginary part of the complex number is 1,  Hence, the correct option is boxed{B}.

The point M is on the ellipse, and we denote it as M(m,n). According to the problem, overrightarrow{FP} = 2overrightarrow{MF}.3.

Define the function ( f(n) ): Let ( f(n) ) be the maximum number of numbers that can be on the board at any given time, starting with the number ( n ).2. Base case: For ( n = 1 ), the only divisor of 1 is 1 itself. When 1 is erased, no new numbers are written on the board. Thus, ( f(1) = 0 ).3. Inductive hypothesis: Assume that for all ( k < n ), ( f(k) leq k^2 ).4. Inductive step: Consider the number ( n ). When ( n ) is erased, all its divisors except ( n ) itself are written on the board. Let ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_k ) be the divisors of ( n ) excluding ( n ). Then, the maximum number of numbers on the board is given by:   [   f(n) = sum_{i=1}^{k} f(d_i)   ]   By the inductive hypothesis, ( f(d_i) leq d_i^2 ) for each ( i ). Therefore,   [   f(n) leq sum_{i=1}^{k} d_i^2   ]5. Bounding the sum: We need to show that ( sum_{i=1}^{k} d_i^2 leq n^2 ).

Specifically, for any ( n ),   [   sum_{d mid n, d < n} d^2 leq n^2   ]   This inequality holds because the sum of the squares of the divisors grows slower than the square of the number itself.6.

Determine whether among all eight-digit multiples of 4, there are more of those that contain the digit 1 in their decimal representation, or those that do not contain the digit 1.","solution":"1. First, we determine the number u of all eight-digit numbers divisible by four. Each such number has a non-zero digit in its first position from the left. Thus, we have 9 possibilities. For the next five positions, it can have any digit of the decimal system, i.e., 10 possibilities for each position, and it ends with a two-digit number divisible by four, i.e., 00, 04, 08, 12, 16, 20, 24, ..., 96, a total of 25 possibilities. Therefore,u=9 cdot 10^{5} cdot 25=22500000A similar consideration can be applied to finding the number v of all eight-digit numbers divisible by four, which in their decimal notation do not contain the digit 1. For the first position from the left, we now have 8 possibilities, and for each of the next five positions, we have 9 possibilities. The last two digits on the right must be a two-digit number divisible by four, but it must not contain the digit 1. These are all the two-digit numbers from the previous paragraph except for 12 and 16, i.e., 23 possibilities. Therefore,v=8 cdot 9^{5} cdot 23=10865016.Conclusion. Since u>2 v, there are more eight-digit multiples of 4 that contain the digit 1 in their (decimal) notation than those that do not.Note. The number u of all eight-digit multiples can also be determined by a simple consideration: the smallest multiple is A=10000000, the largest is B=99999996, so the desired number is frac{1}{4}(B-A)+1=frac{1}{4}(B+4-A)=22500000.To prove the inequality u>2 v, it is not necessary to calculate v, because the ratiofrac{u}{v}=frac{9 cdot 10^{5} cdot 25}{8 cdot 9^{5} cdot 23}=frac{9}{8} cdotleft(frac{10}{9}right)^{5} cdot frac{25}{23}can be well estimated using the binomial theoremleft(frac{10}{9}right)^{5}=left(1+frac{1}{9}right)^{5}>1+5 cdot frac{1}{9}+10 cdot frac{1}{9^{2}}=frac{136}{81}=frac{8 cdot 17}{9^{2}}thusfrac{u}{v}=frac{9}{8} cdotleft(frac{10}{9}right)^{5} cdot frac{25}{23}>frac{9}{8} cdot frac{8 cdot 17}{9^{2}} cdot frac{25}{23}=frac{17 cdot 25}{9 cdot 23}=frac{425}{207}>2.For a complete solution, award 6 points, of which 2 points for the correct expression of u, 3 points for the correct expression of v, and 1 point for the proof of the inequality u>2 v or an equivalent inequality.

After meeting, some people greeted each other with handshakes, but no one shook hands with their own brother, and no one shook hands with the same person twice. At this point, Xiao Li noticed that, apart from himself, everyone had a different number of handshakes. How many times did Xiao Li shake hands? How many times did Xiao Li's brother shake hands?","solution":"Explanation: From the problem, it is easy to see that the maximum number of handshakes for each person is 4, and the minimum is 0. Also, except for Xiao Li, each person has a different number of handshakes. Therefore, the 5 people must have handshakes 0 times, 1 time, 2 times, 3 times, and 4 times respectively.Using points to represent people and lines between points to represent handshakes. Let F and E represent Xiao Li and his partner, and A, B, C, D represent the other two pairs of brothers, where A and B, C and D are brothers.First, consider the point with 4 lines. First, exclude point E, because if point E connects 4 lines, these 4 lines must connect to A, B, C, and D respectively. Thus, the point without any line connected would be a contradiction. Therefore, the point connecting 4 lines must be among A, B, C, and D. Assume it is point C, and these 4 lines are C A, C B, C E, and C F. Then, the point without any line connected is D (as shown in Figure 2).Next, consider the point that only connects 1 line. First, exclude point E, if point E only connects 1 line, then A and B can each connect at most 1 line to point F. This way, there would be no point connecting 3 lines, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the point that only connects 1 line can only be A or B. Assume it is A. At this point, E can only connect 1 line to E B, so there must be 1 line between B and F (as shown in Figure 3).In summary, Xiao Li shakes hands twice, and Xiao Li's partner shakes hands twice."},{"problem":"2.

The slope of 3x-4y+4=0 can be rewritten as y=frac{3}{4}x+1, which means its slope is frac{3}{4}. Thus, the slope of the perpendicular line l must be -frac{4}{3}. To express the equation of line l in the slope-intercept form, we use the general form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. However, since we're looking for a general form equation, we can start with the standard form Ax + By + C = 0, where A and B are proportional to the slope -frac{4}{3}.

Notice that ( gcd(x, x^a y^{b-1} - 1) = gcd(x, -1) = 1 ) since ( x ) is a positive integer.

Find the length of the major axis of the ellipse.","solution":"Let's break down the solution into detailed steps for clarity:1. Identify the parameters of the given ellipse: The given ellipse equation is frac{x^2}{25} + frac{y^2}{9} = 1. From this, we can identify a^2 = 25 and b^2 = 9, where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse, respectively.2. Determine the distance of foci from the center: The foci of an ellipse are located along the major axis, and the distance of each focus from the center, c, is given by c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2}. Substituting the values of a^2 and b^2, we find c = sqrt{25 - 9} = sqrt{16} = 4. Therefore, the coordinates of the foci are (pm c, 0) = (pm 4, 0).3. Formulate the equation of the new ellipse: A new ellipse passing through the point (sqrt{5}, sqrt{3}) and sharing the same foci as the given ellipse would have an equation of the form frac{x^2}{a'^2} + frac{y^2}{a'^2 - 16} = 1, where a'^2 - 16 represents the squared semi-minor axis, adjusted for the same foci distance, c = 4. 4. Substitute the point into the ellipse equation: Plugging the point (sqrt{5}, sqrt{3}) into the new ellipse equation gives us frac{(sqrt{5})^2}{a'^2} + frac{(sqrt{3})^2}{a'^2 - 16} = 1. Simplifying this equation gives us frac{5}{a'^2} + frac{3}{a'^2 - 16} = 1.5. Solve for a'^2: Solving the equation frac{5}{a'^2} + frac{3}{a'^2 - 16} = 1 for a'^2 yields a'^2 = 4sqrt{5}. Therefore, a' = 2sqrt{5}.6. Determine the length of the major axis: The length of the major axis is twice the length of the semi-major axis, 2a'. Substituting a' = 2sqrt{5} into this formula, we get the length of the major axis as 2 cdot 2sqrt{5} = 4sqrt{5}.Therefore, the length of the major axis of the ellipse passing through the point (sqrt{5}, sqrt{3}) and having the same foci as the given ellipse is boxed{4sqrt{5}}."},{"problem":"A necessary but not sufficient condition for \\"I am a senior high school student majoring in liberal arts at Yueyang No.1 High School\\" is that I am studying at Yueyang No.1 High School ( )A: Class 407B: Class 409C: Some liberal arts class in senior highD: Some class","solution":"Let the proposition \\"I am a senior high school student majoring in liberal arts at Yueyang No.1 High School\\" be Q.

Khrabov[/i]","solution":"1. We start with the given system of equations:   [   sin^2{x} + cos^2{y} = y^4   ]   [   sin^2{y} + cos^2{x} = x^2   ]2. We claim that ((x, y) = (pm 1, pm 1)) is the only solution. Note that if ((x, y)) is a solution, then ((pm x, pm y)) are also solutions due to the symmetry of the trigonometric functions and the even powers.3. Assume (x, y geq 0). Summing the two equations, we get:   [   sin^2{x} + cos^2{y} + sin^2{y} + cos^2{x} = y^4 + x^2   ]   Using the Pythagorean identities (sin^2{x} + cos^2{x} = 1) and (sin^2{y} + cos^2{y} = 1), we have:   [   1 + 1 = y^4 + x^2   ]   [   2 = y^4 + x^2   ]   Therefore:   [   x^2 + y^4 = 2   ]4. Since (x^2 + y^4 = 2), we have (y^4 leq 2). This implies (0 leq y < sqrt[4]{2}). Given that (y) is in the range ([0, pi/2)), we can use the fact that (sin(cdot)) and (cos(cdot)) are increasing and decreasing functions respectively in this interval.5. Express (x) in terms of (y):   [   x = sqrt{2 - y^4}   ]6. Substitute (x = sqrt{2 - y^4}) into the second equation:   [   sin^2{y} + cos^2{sqrt{2 - y^4}} = 2 - y^4   ]7. Consider the function (f(y) = sin^2{y} + cos^2{sqrt{2 - y^4}}). We need to check if this function equals (2 - y^4) for (0 leq y < sqrt[4]{2}).8. Notice that if (y^4 > 1), then (y > 1). This would imply (sqrt{2 - y^4} < y), which is a contradiction since (y^4 + y^2 - 2 < 0) would not hold. Hence, (y < 1).9. If (y^4 < 1), then (y < 1). This implies (y = 1) is the only possible solution for (y > 0).10. Substituting (y = 1) into the equation (x^2 + y^4 = 2), we get:    [    x^2 + 1 = 2    ]    [    x^2 = 1    ]    [    x = 1    ]11. Therefore, the only solution in the positive quadrant is ((x, y) = (1, 1)). By symmetry, the solutions are ((pm 1, pm 1)).The final answer is ( boxed{ (pm 1, pm 1) } )."},{"problem":"# Problem 3.

The first factor on the left side is positive for any admissible value of x. Since the second factor is always non-negative, the inequality on the domain of definition (i.e., under the condition x^{3}-10 x+7 geqslant 0) is equivalent to the equation x^{3}-18 x+28=0. One of the integer roots of the equation is x=2 (it is not difficult to find by trial among the divisors of the free term of the equation). Performing the division of the left side by the polynomial x-2, we factorize it: (x-2)left(x^{2}+2 x-14right)=0.
