I get running nose, too much sneezing daily. I checked with ENT doctor 6 months back. He did endoscopy and said its dust allergy & I should take more care & avoid dust. He gave nasal spray. I used it whenever I get nose block. However now a days that spray is not effective. I am getting cold, sneezing several times daily. I am not able to bear it. Please suggest me which specialist I should consult (some people are telling me to consult Allergist) Please suggest me","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. First of all, I would like to know which nasal spray you used to have. If it is decongestant type of spray (xylometazoline), I would not suggest you to use it often.If it is an intranasal corticosteroid (fluticasone or mometasone), I would suggest you to use it daily at least for 2 weeks with proper technique.2. At present, I would also suggest you to take daily montelukast and levocetirizine for at least 2-4 weeks.3. As you already have had endoscopy recently by an ENT surgeon, it is easier for me to make suggestions to you.4. As an Allergist-Immunologist, I would suggest you allergy testing for common air-borne allergy causing substances like - house dust mites, cockroach proteins, common molds & pollens in your area, animal dander (if you have pets), etc.Allergy testing will help you to identify substances causing allergies to you as well as to know how to avoid exposure to them.5. Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you specific allergen immunotherapy which works on your immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms on long term basis.6. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution.7. Regular breathing exercises and a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals will be helpful to you in a long run by improving your lung capacity and immunity respectively.In reply to your specific query (whom should you consult), I would like to suggest you that allergic rhinitis is best managed by a team consisting of an ENT specialist and an Allergist-Immunologist. ENT specialist takes care of symptoms and Allergist takes care of allergy itself and immune system.Hope above suggestions and information will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"sir i have an alergic problme with dust.my heart beat going so fast.and also breathing problems occur.i cant take breath properly.and cough problem and nossel problems are also troubled me.plz suggesst some good for me.paise hote to tujhe puchta kya .ja yha se","Doctor":"HIWell come to HCMif you do have dust allergy then try to avoid the dust exposure and this happens some time then this can be managed with Tab Levocetrizine 10 mg three times in day, hope this information helps, (look the money is not the important factor for us, service of man kind is the matter, and for person like you manner would be necessary)"},{"Patient":"i am getting a wet feeling on my head with some dizziness, i can also feel fluid in ears with stuffed nose, get some twitching in legs and arms occasionally, it happens in evenings. my primary care doctor says it might be because of allergy/sinus, what could cause this?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make following suggestions for you:1. Wet feeling on head, heaviness of head/face as well as fluid in ears, stuffed nose can be caused by sinusitis, especially if it is long standing. Dizziness can also be caused by sinusitis due to disturbance in pressures in middle ear cavity.2. In my opinion, usually twitching in legs and arms may not be due to sinusitis or allergies but they may be due to medicines as side effects or due to any other cause.3. From your symptoms, were I treating you, I would suggest you a prolonged treatment for sinusitis (at least 2-4 weeks). I would suggest you intranasal corticosteroids, montelukast, levocetirizine and daily regular steam inhalation. I would also suggest you antibiotics if you have fever.4. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.5. I would also suggest you to take plenty of warm fluids during day as well as a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc).Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any other query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I got stung by a wasp 4 days ago and had an allergic reaction.

Is this an after reaction from the wasp sting?","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to HCM,Wasp stings are common, especially during the summer months when people are outside for prolonged periods. Wasp stings can be uncomfortable, but most people recover quickly and without complications.The majority of people without sting allergies will show only minor symptoms during and after a wasp sting. The initial sensations can include sharp pain or burning at the sting site. Redness, minor swelling and itching can occur too.Only about three percent of the general population is allergic to wasps stings and Severe allergic reactions to wasp stings are referred to as anaphylaxis.During anaphylaxis patients will have severe swelling of the face, lips, throathives,itching, breathing difficulties,wheezing,dizziness, sudden drop in blood pressure, nausea or vomiting and rapid pulse.Thank you."},{"Patient":"my father use steroids(wysolon 5mg) for more than 10yrs for asthama.After that he left using that and stated rotacap inhailer for last 01 year but recently from one month no asthama medicine is working on him .please sugest what to do. right mow I am looking to consult a pulmonologist for my father.","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your father's history and would like to make suggestions for him as follows:1. Using inhaled corticosteroids (in form of inhalers) is always better than taking corticosteroids orally. So it's good that your father has switched on to inhalers.2. I would like to know the drug he is using in Rotahaler. There are many drugs available to be used with rotahaler and if he is not responding to a drug since last 1 month, changing the drug or increasing the dose of the drug would be a better option. Please give details of your inhaler to the pulmonologist when you visit him.3. In general, I would suggest him two types of inhaler. One controller type (inhaled corticosteroids) to be used daily and regularly and the other rescue type (salbutamol) to be used on as-and0when-needed basis for asthma symptoms.4. I would suggest him to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.5. Regular breathing exercises and a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) will help him in a long run by improving his lung capacity and immunity respectively.6.

I cosult with with chest specialist but no result. when symptom arise I take CLVAM BID 625 (it is an antibiotic) and asthalin syrup or Inhaller. But problem is now recently it is happening that without inhaller I can not live. In every 2-3 hours I have to take inhaller. does it good for me. pls help me how to cure pearmanently.............","Doctor":"Hello Sahidul Haque,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to know more about you like - apart from asthma, do you have any other medical condition? Do you need to take any other drugs frequently/regularly? Do you have nose symptoms - sneezing, nasal congestion, nasal itching? Do you have burning in chest, regurgitation of food/fluid, especially after hot/spicy meals? Do you have headaches or facial pain/heaviness? Is there particular season when your symptoms are worst? Do you take any regular medications for asthma? etc etc.From your current history, I would like to make following suggestions to you:1. Were I treating you, I would suggest you daily montelukast and inhaled corticosteroids for at least 2-3 months. I would specially emphasize on correct technique of using inhalers so that maximum drug would enter your lungs.2. Were I treating you, I would suggest you antibiotics like Clavam 625 for every asthma episode. Asthma episodes are usually not due to bacterial infections and hence do not require antibiotics unless specifically prescribed by doctor.3. If you need to take asthalin (salbutamol) inhaler every 2-3 hours, it suggests your asthma is not under good control. Hence in my opinion, you require regular medications to improve control of asthma as suggested in no 1.Asthalin should be used only on as-and-when-needed basis.4. Should you have frequent nose symptoms also, I would add an antihistamine like levocetirizine in your treatment.5. I would suggest you allergy testing which will help you identify the substances causing allergy to you and also to know how to avoid their exposure.Based on the allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may also prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune system to improve allergy symptoms on long-term basis.6.

I would suggest you allergy testing which will help you identify the substances you may be allergic to and also to know how to avoid exposure to them.4. I cannot name specialist according to terms & conditions of HCM. Sorry for that.5. As you have asked about herbal or medicine, in my opinion, you should combine both.The most important concern should be identify what exactly you have and also the cause of what you have. Allergy testing and an ENT consultation will help you to know what exactly you have.Once diagnosis is confirmed, you can manage yourself with appropriate medications (allopathic or herbal) as both have their own pros and cons. Combining both will reduce duration of your treatment and also minimize side effects, provided both the allopathic and herbal doctors are co-operative to each other.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you a quick recovery and the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi.

Both T-minic and Longifene contain antihistamines which cause sedation and drowsiness as side effects.So I would suggest you to contact your doctor and inform him/her about sedation.2. Viral infections can reduce appetite. Return of appetite is usually a sign of recovery. Both viral infections and medicines themselves can be cause of poor appetite. Were I treating her, I would use Flexon/Crocin only when she has fever and not regularly, to minimize the medications. I would suggest you to discuss about this with her doctor.3. Until recovery, please allow her adequate rest and give her plenty of liquids.

Yes, as it can be a symptoms of egg or any other food allergy.Common foods causing allergies are milk, peanut, egg, fish, shell fish, soy, tree nuts and wheat.If you observe any correlation with specific food and your symptoms, I would suggest you allergy testing for that particular food.2. Any hot, spicy food can also cause direct running nose without having allergy.3. In reply to your last query, yes, if you are undergoing stress and your symptoms are aggravated by stress, psychosomatic is a possibility. Even allergies can be aggravated by mental stress.4.

I would like to know the inhaler you use. There are two types of inhalers - rescue type and controller type.I assume it a \\"rescue\\" type of inhaler like salbutamol or levosalbutamol.If you are using it 10 times a day, it suggests your asthma control is poor. Were I treating you, I would suggest you regular montelukast and a \\"controller\\" type of inhaler like inhaled corticosteroids for at least 2-3 months depending upon response. You can use \\"rescue\\" type of inhaler on as-and-when-needed basis for breathlessness/asthma symptoms. 2. Should you have nose symptoms, I would add regular antihistamine like levocetirizine to above medications.3. I would like to know more about hiatus hernia and your symptoms. Do you have regurgitation of foods, heart burn, nausea, etc? Have you had endoscopy to diagnose hiatus hernia? etc.It is also important for you to remember that salbutamol (commonly used asthma medication) can worsen some of the esophageal problems like gastroesophageal reflux.4. I would suggest you allergy testing which will help you identify the substances causing troubles to you and also to know how to avoid them.Avoidance of foods causing allergies and air-borne allergy-causing substances will help you both for asthma as well as eczema.Based on allergy testing results, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on immune symptoms to improve allergy symptoms on long term basis.5.

Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of asthma.2. Antihistamines like Cetrizine can also be used to provide symptomatic relief.3. Need for anti biotics can arise if there is a secondary infection.4. Also make sure that you are well protected from exposure to cold, dust or other allergens.As the condition is related to hyper-sensitivity of your immune response, it can only be managed symptomatically.Complete cure will need complete shut down of your immune mechanism, which will make you prone for severe life-threatening secondary infections.So, kindly continue the medications as prescribed by your treating Doctor.Wishing you a good health.Take care."},{"Patient":"my 2 year old daughter(3rd child) was seen last friday for a wellness check up which turned into a sick visit.  they said they heard wheezing and gave her a treatment right there in the office.  the doctor gave her an antibiotic and some steriods which my daughter as complete the meds yesterday.  a couple of days ago i would notice she would start to cry randomly and say ouch mommy.  last night when she would take a deep breath she would say ouch and then jerk or shiever like she was cold.  as i thought about it last night while watching her when she would fall asleep, i realized she has been putting everything in her mouth.  like large beads from a purse she had, legos, paper, crayons, dirt, ect.

Were I treating her, I would prescribe her regular montelukast in addition to seroflo inhaler. It will help her exercise-induced symptoms as well as improve control of asthma.2. I would also make sure that her technique of using inhaler. This is the most important aspect as if it is not proper, adequate amounts of drug may not be reaching lungs.3. If she also has allergic rhinitis (nose symptoms), sinusitis or gastroesophageal reflux disease (heart burn, regurgitation especially after hot/spicy foods), I would also treat them simultaneously as each of them can aggravate asthma.4. If she needs to use levolin or nebulization more than twice a week, it means her asthma is not properly controlled and in that case i would increase her controller medications.5. Personally I would suggest her allergy testing which will help her to identify the substances causing allergies and also to know the measures to avoid them.Based on allergy testing, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe her allergen specific immunothearpy which works on her immune system to reduce allergy symptoms gradually.6. Regular breathing exercises (including Yoga & Pranayama) and a healthy diet rich in vitamins, minerals & antioxidants (i.e., adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) will also improve her lung capacity and immunity respectively and will help her in a long run.7.

Do you smoke or are you exposed to dusts or air pollution? Does anyone from your family have asthma or allergies? etc...From your history, I would like to make following suggestions to you:1. I would agree with your treatment at present.2. Were I treating you, I would add montelukast in your treatment as it helps both nose and asthma symptoms.3. If you need to use Asthalin inhaler more than twice a week, I would suggest you to use daily inhaled corticosteroids.Asthalin inhaler is to be used on as-and-when-needed basis. I don't recommend it to be used regularly.4. Once your asthma is under good control, I would first start reducing deriphyllin, as it has many side effects compared to other drugs.5. I would also suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.6. Regular breathing exercise and a balanced diet (adequate green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) will help you in a long run.7.

Seretide inhaler and Aspirine Protect 100 mg are used for a long time.By using this combination your symptoms are going to subside.Contact your doctor to discuss about this treatment.I hope my answer is helpful.Wish you good health.Dr. Behar."},{"Patient":"My husband has had an ongoing problem for longer than 4 years. Every 3-6 months his upper lip will swell like a balloon and he says he gets a \\"coppery taste\\" from it.

If not, what could the problem be?","Doctor":"Hi dear,At the outset,all your husband complaints are suggestive of acquired angioedema,it usually caused by allergy.The skin of the face, normally around the mouth, and the mucosa of the mouth and/or throat, as well as the tongue, swell up over the period of minutes to hours. In my opinion,avoidance of allergen and use of antihistamines like Tab.cetrazine can prevent future attacks..please let me know if my advice helpful to you in any way.Best wishes .RegardsDr.Harpreet"},{"Patient":"Hi I have developed allergic asthma at the age of 25. I never had a history of asthma in the past 24 years & no one from my family ever had this disease. My chest XRay is normal & the Ige count is 380 IU, I have been prescribed a combination of Fluticasone 200mcg & Formoterol 6mcg as I had some problem with Budesonide 200mcg & Formoterol 6mcg(Had Nose blockage & eye irritation after taking budesonide). This steriod + LABA combination is prescribed in powder format ie (Rotocaps). I developed this disease while I was posted at Mysore & than Bangalore for on an assignment & since than this disease dosen't seem to go away. I feel taking Montek LC 1/4 tablet gives me the best relief as compared to the above steriods but do feel quite drowsy after this medication though it is just 1/4 of the tablet. One of the doctors suggested me to go for an allergy test as I was a victim of Late Onset Asthma. I wanted to know if an allergy test will help me get rid of this disease. I have been doing breathing exercise & have recently started taking Lemon with hotwater as lemon acts as natural antihistamine.","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you:1. I would mostly agree with your current treatment and also the diagnosis of asthma, especially allergic asthma as IgE is 380 (normal up to 100).2. First of all, I would suggest you to make sure your technique of using rotahaler as it is very important for ensuring drug delivery into lung.3. Were I treating you, I would also prescribe you daily montelukast. The sedation that you experience with Montek LC may be due to Levocetirizine component.4. I would suggest you allergy testing as it will help you identifying the substances causing troubles to you as well as to know the measures to avoid them.Also, based on the reports, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on your immune system and improve allergy symptoms on long term basis.5. In general, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution. They do not cause \\"allergy\\", they directly irritate airways. I know air pollution is a problem in Bangalore.6. Regular breathing exercises including Yoga & Pranayama and a healthy diet rich in vitamins, minerals & anti-oxidants (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) will help you on a long run by improving your lung capacity and immunity respectively.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any other concern, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hallo Doc,My wife 31 years old and suffering from allergy since three years.We have consulted many doctors but in vain.Now for remedy she takes levocet ,if its severe takes avil 25.She starts sneezing on smell ,dust, even she fries something.Thank you","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your wife's history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1.

The possibility of ulcer is low when someone has such abdominal pain intermittently.The information provided by you is not sufficient to provide a good opinion.

If yes how much and in what time?I would like these details from you to help you further.meanwhile you can consult your doctor for endoscopy and anti acidity medicines like tablet pantoperazole and antacids.Hope I have answered your question.

Foracort 200 inhaler of cipla products.","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and query and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. First of all, Duolin and Foracort are different types of inhalers, they cannot be compared.Duolin is a \\"rescue\\" type of inhaler which is to be used on as-and-when-needed basis for asthma symptoms. It is not to be used daily/regularly.Foracort is a \\"controller\\" type of inhaler which is to be used regularly. Choice of type of inhaler can be made only after reviewing your symptoms and other details.2. I would also like to emphasize that sinusitis and asthma are lined many-a-times. Proper treatment of sinusitis is important for reducing asthma symptoms. Usually I treat sinusitis with regular intranasal corticosteroids, montelukast, levocetirizine, steam inhalation and saline irrigation of nose.3. I would also suggest you allergy testing which will help you identify the substances causing troubles to you and also to know the measures to avoid them.4. Regular breathing exercises and a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) will also help you in long run.5.

First of all, I assume that she really has anahylaxis. Unfortunately there are no tests available that can reliably diagnose anaphylaxis. So it's only listening to her symptoms the diagnosis is usually made.But there are other conditions also that might mimic anaphylaxis. However, sudden onset itchy rashes and breathing difficulty together can be symptoms of diagnosis.2. If the cause is not known, occurrence of anaphylaxis cannot be predicted. So the best strategy is to keep injectable adrenaline (in some countries autoinjectors are also available) with her. Whenever should she develops symptoms, she should inject the adrenaline herself; it could be life saving.Again, please make sure with her doctor that she really has anaphylaxis so that he can prescribe adrenaline to her.3. Regarding cause, it can occur due to food-borne allergens, air-borne allergens, some drugs, insects stings/bites and sometimes without known cause.Common foods are - milk, egg, peanut, soy, tree nuts (almond, cashew, pistachio, walnut, etc), fish, wheat, shell fish, etc. As you correlate with protein powder, please try to correlate the contents with above.If the food is identifies, avoidance is the best strategy.Common drugs are NSAID pain killers (other than paracetamol) - like ibuprofen, diclofenac, aspirin, etc, and antibiotics like penicillins.Sometimes association of occurrence of anaphylaxis with menstruation or exercise may also be present.3. Please try to correlate her occurrences with above mentioned anaphylaxis triggers. If she can identify the trigger, avoidance will be the best.Hope above suggestions and information will help her.Should you/she have any other query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your sister the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"R/sir i have been suffered from Asthametic Problem .

I would suggest you allergy testing, especially for indoor air-borne allergens like house dust mite, common indoor molds in your region, cockroach allergen, pet dander (if you have pets).

Allergy shots usually need treatment for long duration. So if you are changing your place, personally I would suggest you to consult an allergist for need of continuation.2.

Even though the tests have come back negative should I be concerned about anaphallxis and carry an EpiPen?  Either way I'm not eating crab again.","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make following suggestions to you:1. If your allergist has made diagnosis of anaphylaxis, it is highly desirable to carry Epipen as its prompt use can be life-saving should you have any episode of anaphylaxis. There is no specific test to diagnose anaphylaxis retrogradely, so diagnosis cn be assumed only after knowing the details of episodes.2. I usually think of diagnosis when more than one systems are involved - any two of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory and skin.So, if you have only vomiting and diarrhea (gastrointestinal) associated with crab, and no other symptoms like fainting, hypotension, collapse, palpitation, cough, respiratory difficulty, wheezing, swelings, itching, hives, etc, I would not first think of anaphylaxis.As your allergy tests are also negative, I would first think of non-allergic intolerance or something like food poisoning.However, if you have any of the above mentioned symptoms, anaphylaxis would be my first consideration, in that case, Epipen will be a need for you.Hope above information will help you.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello, I have been coughing profusely since 3 months.

If she does not appear to be in difficulty and she complaints of not being able to breath, she could have nasal obstruction. I would like to know whether she has any nose symptoms - running nose, sneezing, nasal congestion, etc.In that case, treating the nasal congestion would help her rather than rescue asthma medication..Hope above suggestions will help you.Wish her the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, for a week now I have been getting sharp abdominal pain.

Were I treating you, I would suggest you regular montelukast which will be helpful for both upper and lower airway allergies.2. As you have more nose symptoms, I would also suggest you daily antihistamine like cetirizine/levocetirizine/fexofenadine in addition to montelukast.3. I would suggest you to use salbutamol or levosalbutamol inhaler on as-and-when-needed basis whenever you have lower respiratory system symptoms.4. Personally, I would suggest you allergy testing which will help you identify the substances you may be allergic to and also to know how to avoid them.Based on the report, an allergist-immunologist may also prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy which works on your immune system to improve allergy symptoms gradually.5. I would also suggest you regular breathing exercises and a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) which will improve your lung capacity and immunity respectively in a long run.6.

She has been diagnosed with MS since August 2008.  She is having major problems with hives and swelling.  Her face swells up almost every day.  Today, she woke up with her eyes almost swollen shut.  She is sticking very strictly to her gluten free diet.  She has been allergy tested for common food allergies and had no significant reactions.  They hives and swelling have been getting worse lately and started in the summer 2010.  We are at a loss.  What are your thoughts?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your daughter-in-law's history and would like to make following suggestions for her:1. I would like to mention here that most of long standing hives and swellings (angioedema) are non-allergic. So if her all allergy testing is negative, I would not suggest her to think of \\"allergy to something\\", rather than they may be related to abnormal functioning of immune system. As both celiac and multiple sclerosis are non-allergic immune-related disorders, chances are very high that her hives are non-allergic.2. I usually suggest such patients daily antihistamines like cetirizine/hydroxyzine regularly. The dose of them can be adjusted according to response of her symptoms. 3. In general, I would suggest her avoidance of too spicy/too hot diet. Also please activities causing excessive sweating and hot water baths.4. Personally, I would also suggest her tight-fitting, woolen or synthetic type of clothes. In my opinion, loose-fitting, cotton clothes will be the best.5. I would suggest her a diet rich in vitamins and minerals (plenty of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) which will help her immunity in a long run.6. A stress-free life is very important for a healthy immune system. Regular relaxation, meditation and exercises will also help her in a long run.Hope above suggestions will e helpful to her.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your daughter the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I have been told by my allergist that I am allergic to pollution in the air.

Montelukast acts as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis.Formonide (Formoterol + Budesonide) acts as bronchodilators and relieve breathing difficulty.If you do not consume the medications, their effect reduces & you get prone to acute allergic attacks.This condition is related to the hyper-sensitivity of your immune response.It can only be managed symptomatically.Complete cure will need complete shut down of your immune mechanism, which will make you prone for severe life-threatening secondary infections.So, kindly continue the medications as prescribed by your treating Doctor.Wishing you a good health.Take care."},{"Patient":"I have had a cronic cough for about the last 4 years now.

Is there any other options.","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your son's history and would like to make suggestion for him as follows:1. If your son has frequent flare ups and needs oral steroids (prednisone) 3 times a year, that means his asthma is not under good control.I understand your concern about steroids, and would like to mention that, I have no concern about inhaled corticosteroids, but I do have a concern about oral corticosteroids.As inhaled steroids work locally, they are least absorbed in body and mostly have local side effects. But frequent oral steroids are not desirable, although they have to be given when they are needed.2. So I would like to first get reviewed your son's technique of using inhaler in presence of a doctor. This is most important as if it is not proper, there are high chances that he may not be actually getting enough drugs into his lungs.3. I would like to step-up his controlled medications of asthma.4. I would suggest you to get his allergy testing done. This will help him identifying the substances causing troubles to him and also you will know how to avoid them.Also, an Allergist-immunologist may prescribe him allergen specific immunotherapy based on the allergy testing, which works on immune system to gradually improve allergy symptoms.5. Please try to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible to him.6. A healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) will improve his immunity in a long run.7.

First of all, yes, cough can definitely be the only symptom of asthma, but not very commonly. Especially if your cough is improved with corticosteroid inhalers and worsened by stopping them, there is high chance that the cough be asthmatic.2. Also, allergic rhinitis and sinusitis due to allergies can also cause cough. So it is important to identify the cause of the cough.3. Asthma cannot be definitely diagnosed with x-ray or blood tests. I would suggest you spirometry with reversibility with bronchodilator testing, which can diagnose or rule out asthma.4. For allergic cough, I usually prescribe my patients a combination of monelukast and levocetirizine which improves allergic rhiniris, sinusitis as well as asthma.5. I would also suggest you regular breathing exercises and avoidance of dusts/smokes/air pollution.6.

About 5 months ago i came to Australia for the summer. When i got here i started getting very tight chested and wheezy. It would b bad for few days then ok.

From your history, it seems you have had a good control of asthma symptoms with minimum medications and the control has been lost after coming to Australia. Of course, the change in environment has to do with it. If you do not have significant fever, please do not worry about viruses.2. Were I treating you, I would suggest you daily montelukast and \\"preventer\\" type of inhaler such as inhaled coritcosteroids or inhaled coricosteroids+formoterol/salmeterol combination.Once your symptoms would improve after at least 2-3 months of regular use of above medications, I would think of reducing your maintenance drugs. 3. Should you have any symptoms of rhinitis - nasal congestion, running nose, sneezing, etc, I would also add an antihistamine like cetirizine/levocetirizine to above drugs.4. Personally I would suggest you to try to avoid exposure to dusts/smokes/air pollution as much as possible.5.

It is important to remember that sinus surgery corrects structural problems related to nose/sinuses, it cannot \\"cure\\" allergies as basically, allergies are related to immune system.So, unless your ENT surgeon suggests you need to have a repeated surgery (he will advise you only after examination of inside of your nose and after some investigations), you may not actually require a surgery.2. Were I treating you, I would suggest you to continue intranasal corticosteroids (nasonex), I would add regular montelukast and an antihistamine like fexofenadine, cetirizine or levocetirizine.3. I would suggest you regular steam inhalation (please be cautious to avoid burns) and neti. It will help.4. Should you have reflux symptoms, i.e., regurgitation of foods after meals or burning pain in chest, especially after hot/spicy/oily meals, I would prescribe you antacid like omeprazole for at least 6 weeks. It can worsen sinusitis.5. I would also suggest you allergy testing and consult an Allergist-Immunologist with the report. After reviewing your symptoms and reports, he may prescribe you allergen specific immunotherapy. The \\"injections\\" you have heard of might be actually immunotherapy. Nowadays, there are both injections and drops (to be kept under tongue) available.Of course it should be continued for 3-5 years, but improvement in symptoms usually begins within first 6 months of beginning of immunotherapy.It works on your immune system to modify response towards the substances one is allergic to and hence improves allergies gradually.6.

Antihistamines may cure the symptoms but they are usually not advised as they can cause even more sedation and drowsiness along with red wine/alcohol. Please consult your doctor before using an antihistamine.Personally I would suggest you to take a good nutritional multivitamin-multimineral supplement containing especially vitamin B6, C and other minerals, for 2-3 months, which aid in metabolism of histamine.

DOES SHE NEED ANY SUPPORT DRUG TO COUNTER THE EFFECT OF STEROID","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your wife's history and would like to make following suggestions to you:1. Yes, Flomist contains a corticosteroid - Fluticasone propionate.It is very important to remember that there are so many types of corticosteroids available. Corticosteroids in nasal sprays mostly act locally and only tiny amounts get absorbed into blood hence do not significantly produce general side effects caused by corticosteroid tablets/injections.2. Common side effects of intranasal corticosteroids are local - burning in nose, dryness of nose, sometimes small bleeds. 3. Intranasal corticosteroids should be used with proper technique (please consult your doctor for learning the proper technique) to minimize side effects.Especially, the spray should be directed towards side-roof (alae) of the nose, not towards the middle membrane (septum) of the nose. If used for long time with directing towards septum, there is a rare possibility of perforation of septum of the nose.4. Regarding duration, it should be determined by patients symptoms, not by time. All the medications can only control allergy symptoms, they do not \\"cure\\" it. So as long as your wife needs them, they should be continued. The decision to stop medications is best taken by her treating doctor. In general, once symptoms are under control with other medications, life style measures and environmental control, they can be slowly reduced and stopped under doctor's guidance.5. From your history, I would agree with most of the treatment for your wife. I would also suggest her daily breathing exercises and a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) for a better recovery.6. I would also suggest her allergy testing which will help her identifying the substances causing troubles to her and also to know how to avoid them.7.

Both cefuroxime and ondansetron are known to cause severe allergic reactions like anaphylaxis.2. It is also possible that not the drug itself, but preservatives, excipients, coloring agents, etc used in manufacturing the drug can also cause anaphylaxis.3. There are not very reliable tests available to definitely diagnose or rule out drug allergies except in case of penicillin allergies. Hence, once a patient had an anaphylaxis to a particular drug, the best way it to avoid it.4. I would suggest you to consul an Allergist-Immunologist in Delhi who will ask your history in great detail to come to certain conclusion.5. There are many allergists in Delhi.

There are two types of inhalers - \\"reliever\\" types to be used on as-and-when-needed basis for asthma symptoms and \\"preventer\\" types - to be used on daily basis irrespective of symptoms.2. Were I treating her, I would suggest her to use both types of inhalers appropriately. I usually prescribe my patients salbutamol/levosalbutamol inhalers as \\"relievers\\" and budesonide-formoterol inhalers as \\"preventers\\".3. I would also suggest her spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility as well as allergy testing.

As an Allergist-Immunologist, I would suggest her to her allergy testing done for air-borne allergens, especially house dust mite, common molds & pollens in your area, cockroach proteins and animal dander (if you have pets). This will help her to identify the substances causing asthmatic and nasal symptoms to her. Depending upon the results, an Allergist-Immunologist may prescribe her allergen specific immunotherapy which will \\"train\\" her immune system to modify response towards these substances and will improve her allergy symptoms in a long run.2. Both nose airways and lungs airways are in continuum from inside. So it is important to treat and control nose symptoms to prevent asthma symptoms. 3. Usually I prescribe such patients daily levocetirizine and montelukast. Also, I would prescribe her salbutamol or levosalbutamol inhaler which is to be used for asthma symptoms on as-and-when-needed basis.4. Regarding nasal sprays, it depends upon what kind of spray she has used. Sometimes prolonged use of decongestant sprays (used to \\"open\\" nose) can lead to even worsening of nasal congestion and in such cases, I would suggest her to use intranasal corticosteroid spray for at least 2-4 weeks.5. Personally I would suggest her regular breathing exercises and a diet rich in vitamins and minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) which will improve respectively her lung capacity and immune system in longer run.6. Please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution to her as much as possible.7. Regarding need of surgery, it can be best decided by an ENT surgeon rather than an Allergist-Immunologist.

In reply to your main query, Yes, it is possible that you could be allergic to fish.Personally, I would suggest you to go for skin testing or serum specific IgE to fish to confirm/support your allergy.2. If both of the reports are negative, it is very much possible that you may have histamine fish poisoning. It caused by consumption of improperly preserved (improper refrigeration) fish. The symptoms are more or less similar to allergy, but it is not an actual allergy, it is a kind of food poisoning.So, if your testing is negative for fish allergy, you could take a chance by eating fish from a reliable source.

What else could I do or could it be?","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicYour husband would need to reduce friction , heat and moisture.This means using cool clothes, keeping the areas separated as much as possible, using barrier creams between the affected areas.In addition, he may need  a short course of a topical course of an antifungal and mild topical steroid (to reduce inflammation).In terms of your itching, it may be related to seasonal allergies. The oral anti histamines should help.Other causes of generalised itching are: liver disease, allergies to medications, thyroid disease, infections such as scabies.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I ve been having the smell of blood in my nose and the taste of blood in the back of my mouth.

I don t necessarily eat unhealthy or have unhealthy habits, but I never feel any better.

If you use the above meds and do not notice any improvement, then you should visit your doctor to find out if you have bacterial sinusitis.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Since March when the weather changed and allergies started, I've two things happening.

This nature of the pain you explained in your girlfriend is ''spasmodic in nature. This can be due to :-Biliary colic due to gall stones-Ureteric colic due to ureteric stone -Intestinal obstruction causing spasms.I would advise you the following:X-ray of the abdomen in standing and lying down position- this is the the cheapest and simple most diagnostic tool. -Ultrasonography of the abdomen.The treatment will be as per the findings on the reports."},{"Patient":"I had what I believe was an excersize induced asthma attack after swimming a few laps and after 2 uses of my inhaler was able to breathe more normally.

I'm a bit concerned that this could turn into anaphylaxis? and what can i do to treat the symptoms? thank you","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and understand your concern.I would like to make following suggestions to you in reply to your queries:1. As your symptoms are for last 3 days, I would first think of allergy and infections (viral or parasitic) as causes. I treat my such patients with antihistamine like cetirizine/hydroxyzine and montelukast for 3-5 days.I also prescribe  course of anti-parasitic drugs if intestinal worms is a possibility.2. Common foods causing such symptoms are milk, egg, peanut, tree nuts, soy, fish, shellfish and some fruits/vegetables. Sometimes cheese, preservatives/colors in packed foods can also cause such reactions. Please try to correlate your symptoms with intake of these foods to identify the food that may have caused you allergy.3. Antibiotics and pain killers can also cause such symptoms. So if you are currently taking any, please consult and discuss with your physician.4. I can understand your concern about anaphylaxis. But unfortunately it is not predictable.From your symptoms, at present I think it's only urticaria and angioedema. However, a severe reaction may result in anaphylaxis. Shoulg you have any symptom like - dizziness, severe abdominal pain, vomiting, breathing difficulty, suffocation, throat constriction, feeling of losing posture, etc - these symptoms may suggest anaphylaxis. Please consult your physician immediately in such case. 5. If you don't have any of above symptoms, you may have simply urticaria and angioedema. In that case, I would treat with montelukast and an antihistamine like cetirizine/hydroxyzine for 3-5 days as mentioned above.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I have had an allergic reaction to hair dye.

Yes, as suggested by GP, antihypertensive medications from the groups of  ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin Rceptor Blockers (ARB) (Kindly confirm whether he is taking any of these) can cause similar complaints.However, I would like to suggest that it is not always within an hour of consumption of the drug. Personally when such patient comes to my clinic, I suggest patient's physician revising the anti-hypertensive medicines and to change them, if possible.Please discuss above information with your GP.2. Even Maalox can occasionally cause allergic reaction. The symptoms will be similar.3. Were I treating you, I would suggest you to take a levocetirizine & montelukast when such symptoms occur. You can discuss possibility of alternative anti-hypertensive medicine (if your drug is from ACE inhibitor or ARB groups) with your GP.

Does he have nose symptoms (nasal congestion, running nose, sneezing)? Does he have any other allergies? What is the frequency of his symptoms? From your history, I would like to make following suggestions for your son:1. Flovent is Fluticasone, which is to be used on regular basis (\\"preventer\\" type of inhaler), not on as-and-when-needed basis.

However, please consult your doctor before starting.2. For acute symptoms of wheezing/breathlessness, there other types of inhalers like salbutamol or levoaslbutamol (\\"reliever\\" type of inhalers).It is very important to know difference between these two types of inhalers and also when and how to use them in asthma. 3.

Urticaria, especially lasting more than 6 weeks, may not be always due to allergy. 2. Were I treating you, I would suggest you an antihistamine like cetirizine/levocetirizine for 1-2 weeks.3. I usually advise such patients tests like complete blood counts, ESR, CRP, urine & stool examination, and if necessary, allergy testing, thyroid testing and ANA. These investigations may give clues to cause of urticaria. Please discuss these tests with your treating physician.4. Intestinal worm infestations can commonly cause urticaria.

As long as her current treatment, I would agree with most of it.2. Regarding need for removal of adenoids, I would agree with your pediatrician that efforts should be made to preserve adenoids upto age of 6 years as they important for a child's immunity. 3. I would like to emphasize the importance of device and technique of using inhalers (Seroflow/Budecort). If they are not perfect, the drugs may not be reaching the lungs in adequate amounts and hence not be as effective as they should be.In my opinion, for a 3.9 year child, metered dose inhaler with spacer with mask is the best inhaler equipment. Please make sure her technique of using the inhalers is perfect by reviewing it in presence of your pediatrician. Also, regular cleaning and changing the spacer every 6 months is advisable.4. Were I treating her, I would add regular montelukast in above treatment, which may improve her symptoms and reduce need for repeated steroid requirements. 5. A healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc), avoidance of the allergens (to which she is allergic) and avoidance of dusts & smokes are also important measures for her.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to your daughter.Wish her the best of the health and a bright future ahead.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi,My name is Anup.

Breathing exercises, Yoga and Pranayam have now scientific back up for improving lung capacity in asthma patients. But they should be learned under professional guidance. I would suggest you to be trained by a qualified person.2. First of all, I would personally suggest you to take regular medicines (montelukast and/or inhaled corticosteroids) after consulting your doctor.This is because, as you are having repeated asthma attacks, they need to be controlled first. Breathing exercises & Pranayama cannot be used alone to treat asthma. They take time to be effective and they need to be performed regularly for long time.Once your asthma is under good control, your drugs can safely be decreased under guidance of doctor.3.

Were I treating you, I would ask you following questions: Do you have cough that awakes you at night more than once a week? Do you have difficulty in performing routine activities (including exercise) due to asthma symptoms? Do you need to take asthalin more than twice a week?If any above answers is \\"yes\\", I would suggest you daily treatment like inhaler or montelukast. 2. For relief of symptoms, I would suggest you to use salbutamol (asthalin) inhaler rather than asthalin syrup whenever you have symptoms.Please be sure that salbutamol or levosalbutamol are \\"reliever\\" type of inhalers which are used on as-and-when-needed basis and inhaled corticosteroids (such as combihale) are \\"preventer\\" type of inhalers which are to be used daily and regularly as suggested by your doctor.3. In general, inhaler forms are chosen over oral tablet/syrup forms because inhalers work direct locally in lungs and start working quicker. Moreover, only a few portion from inhaled drugs gets absorbed into blood, so generalized side effects are minimum. Local side effects are more common.4. Common side effects of combihale are local - throat irritation, oral thrush, change in voice and they can be minimized by rinsing the mouth after use of inhaler. As mentioned above, generalized side effects with inhalers are uncommon and can occur with long term use with high dosages. Generalized side effects of corticosteroids are gastritis, hypertension, diabetes, cataract, glaucoma, etc and of formoterol (one of the components of combihale) are increased heart beats, tremors etc. But they are rarely seen with proper use.Hope above suggestions and information will be helpful to you.Should you have further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"my son had allergy testing yesterday and I was given a paper that listed the things he is allergic to.

Molds mostly grow over damp/moist areas. Hence, if there are any such areas in/around your home, there are high chances that they may be source of molds. Removal/professional treatment of such areas would reduce production of molds.2. Using dehumidifier/air conditioning to reduce humidity inside rooms is also an important measure as molds grow in humid environment.3. Ensuring adequate ventilation and sunlight exposure in rooms is also another measure as it may \\"wash away\\" mold spores from the room and sunlight will provide dry heat.Above measures are usually suggested to reduce mold exposure.

If you have frequent bleeding from nose, I would suggest you to consult an ENT specialist who will examine your nose from inside to identify the cause.3. I would suggest you to get allergy testing done for house dust mites by skin prick testing or specific IgE levels in blood. This will confirm house dust mite allergy.4. Following measures are usually suggested for house dust mite allergy:a. Washing bedding covers, pillow covers, etc every week in hot water (>130 F) and dry them in sunlight thereafter. (Heat kills dust mites)b. Reduce humidity in rooms to around 50% of ambient humidity in environment by using dehumidifiers or air conditioners. (dust mites need humidity for growth)c. Removal of carpets, thick curtains, upholstered furniture, etc from bedroom. (these are reservoirs of dust mites)5. If allergy testing confirms house dust mite allergy, I would suggest you allergen specific immunotherapy for house dust mite proteins which will improve your immune system and will gradually reduce your symptoms of dust mite allergy.

Take PPI, Pepto bismol Antacid can help ."},{"Patient":"Sir,I wish to consult you for my wife who is an asthmatic patient with hyperthyroid & BP and now mentally  not feeling well since 6-8 months even after consulting Doctors/Physicians.

I want to consult with a cardiologist, but are there different kinds, and what particular cardiologist should I see.","Doctor":"Hello dear,The symptoms as mentioned in your post can be attributed to Acute exacerbation of asthma, secondary to the respiratory tract infection.Management consists of:1. A course of antibiotics based on culture & sensitivity reports.2. Asthalin+ Seroflo inhaler- provide symptomatic relief by causing broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs). So, it can be used during an acute attack.3. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of asthma.4. Antihistamines like Cetrizine can also be used to provide symptomatic relief.5. Also make sure that you are well protected from exposure to cold, dust or other allergens.As your treating Doctor has advised you to consult a Cardiologist, kindly meet him to rule out any Cardiovascular cause for your symptoms.You can consult any Cardiologist for this matter.Wishing a good health.Take care."},{"Patient":"What strengths does coreg come in?

Regards Sreeni","Doctor":"Hello Sreeni,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make following suggestions to you:1. Early morning sneezing and nose symptoms are usually due to allergy to one of these - house dust mites, molds, cockroach allergens, animal proteins (if you have a pet in home) etc.2. Were I treating you, I would suggest you to get allergy testing for house dust mites, common indoor molds in your region, cockroach allergen, animal proteins (if you have a pet) and common pollens in your region.This will help you to identify the substances you are allergic to and also to know the measures to avoid exposure to them.3. Some of the substances like house  dust mite can not be avoided completely. For these types of allergies, I would suggest you specific allergen immunotherapy which improves one's immunity like vaccines to reduce allergy symptoms.I would suggest you to consult an experienced Allergist-Immunologist in your region for treating these types of allergies.4. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes & air pollution as much as possible. 5. Were I treating you, I would prescribe you regular montelukast and levocetirizine/cetirizine for your current symptoms.6. A healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) and regular breathing exercises also will help you in a longer run.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health and a bright future ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I'm struggling really bad with my asthma when I am in work.

If you need to take inhalers 10 times (3 puffs each time), I would add other controller treatment for your asthma in addition to as-and-when-needed inhalers.Usually I add montelukast to my patients to control asthma. If that is not effectively, I prescribe regular inhaled corticosteroids for at least 2-3 months.2. If you have nose symptoms (nasal congestion, running nose, sneezing) also, I would add levocetirizine/cetirizine in addition to montelukast.3. Personally I would suggest you to get allergy testing done which will help you identify the substances you may be allergic to and also the measures to avoid them.4.

For acute attacks of asthma, salbutamol (Asthalin) and levosalbutamol are commonly used and most effective drugs.Usually salbutamol does not cause the type of reaction you described.

In such patients, I usually suggest them to avoid the foods causing problems to them for 3 months and take probiotics and multivitamin-multimineral supplements during that period.Thereafter I advise them to gradually introduce the foods which were withheld.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"hi i am a 20 yr old female who usually is very healthy. i have ashma but its very mild and never gives me any trouble (i can forget i have it). over the past few days i keep getting really shaky hands. 1 minute im freezing the next minute i sweating because im so hot. my breathing has got really bad aswell. for example this morning i made my fiances lunch for him and i had to sit down and really concentrate on breathing for a while. you would of thought i'd been running. my whole body is aching aswell can't get comfortable. any advice as to what is happening would be appciated. thank you","Doctor":"You would have inhaled a potential allergen during cooking.

Few months ago I got a node developed over my neck which was surgically removed. The biopsy report revealed NHL , stage III, (low grade), And for its treatment I have been advised for R-Chop.(immuno therapy). I have received three cycles of R-Chop so far & within couple of going to receive fourth one. CT Scan revealed nodal mass in my abdominal mesentric muscles .

I'm having a few problems all of them about my nose and sinuses.  I moved from Ohio down to Alabama 6 months ago.  I'm getting ready to go back soon.  Right before I left I started having problems with my right sinus.  When it started, it was just at night but now it sometimes lasts on and off in the day as well.  It's as if it's swelling shut where I can't breathe out of it.  But there's nothing in it.  I'm not blowing out anything and there's nothing draining.  Another problem is that there seems to be scabbing in both nostrils at the openings and just up in a little way.  They're extremely sore.  Next is on the edge of nostril towards the tip of my nose, there's a \\"knot\\" or bump. It is really sore.  I thought it was a pimple at first or an ingrown hair.  Well the scabbing and the bump both went away eventually, but now they have come back again.  I don't know what is going on or what to do about it.  At least how to make any of it more comfortable until it goes away.  I plan on seeing a ENT when I get back to Ohio, but if you could help me out for now I'd really appreciate it.

And very often his nose bleed","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your son's history and would like to make following suggestions to him:1. Avoidance of the substances he is allergic to is the best strategy for managing allergies. If he has been tested for allergies, I would suggest him to avoid the foods he is allergic to. (provided that allergy testing is reliable)For dust allergy, specific allergen immunotherapy can be advised by an Allergist-Immunologist after thorough allergy evaluation.2. I would agree with his treatment suggested by his doctor. However, were I treating him, I would add montelukast and levocetirizine to above treatment. 3. Solupred 20 is corticosteroid. In severe asthma symptoms, it may be necessary to give oral corticosteroids. A short course of 3-5 days of corticosteroids does not cause significant long term side effects.So as his doctor thinks Solupred 20 is necessary for him at present, I would agree with him. Treating doctor is the best judge of the child's condition.4. If he needs repeated asthma symptoms or repeated corticosteroid courses, I would suggest him regular medications like montelukast or inhaled corticosteroids. (Inhaled corticosteroids are much more safer than oral corticosteroids, but are less useful in acute symptoms)So I would suggest you to review his symptoms with his doctor to discuss the need of regular medications.5. I would suggest him to avoid the exposure to dusts, smokes & air pollution as much as possible.6. A healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) will also help him in a longer run by improving his immunity.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to him.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your son the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello sir...

If you are allergic to the substances which cannot be completely avoided (house dust mites, pollens, molds, etc), I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who may advise you specific allergen immunotherapy, which will improve your immunity to reduce allergy symptoms.3.

Drugs like Xyzal (antihistamines) treat symptoms of the allergy, not the allergy itself. Hence as long as one has allergy symptoms, one has to take them repeatedly.2. Common side effects of Xyzal (& similar drugs) are sedation, drowsiness, poor concentration, etc. If you are not experiencing such side effects, you can take it for long duration as it usually does not have long-term side effects.3.

If both of them are negative, you can consider yourself at low risk of reacting to that particular food.3. Personally I would suggest you to consult an allergist who will perform an Oral Food Challenge Test to see whether you react to selected foods (sea foods and fish). These tests are performed with readiness to deal with any allergic reaction, which can be treated as soon as possible.

Is she regularly exposed to dusts/smokes/air pollution?From your given history, I would like to make following suggestions to her:1. As per your query, Ketasma (Ketotifen - an antihistamine) can cause sedation, drowsiness as side effects.2. Personally I would suggest her to check her hemoglobin levels and allergy testing for common foods and air-borne allergens prevalent in your region.I would suggest to maintain her hemoglobin around 14 g%. If she tests positive to any allergy-causing substance, avoidance measures can be suggested which may help improving both atopic dermatitis and asthma.3.

Has she ever been investigated? Does she have fevers, joint pains, etc?From your given history, I would like to make following suggestions to your wife:1. Were I treating her, I would suggest her Specific IgE by ImmunoCAP for milk protein or skin prick testing or preferably both for milk allergy. If it is positive, I would suggest her to restrict milk & milk products for at least 6 months. If it is negative, there are high chances she has milk intolerance rather than milk allergy, which is an entirely different condition.2. Not all hives/swelling of body parts are always due to allergies, especially if they are present for more than several months and no clue can be thought of about precipitating factor.In such cases, I usually advise tests like complete blood counts, ESR, CRP, ANA, tests for liver, kidney & thyroid function, allergy testing, urine & stool examination, etc. Selection from these tests can only be done after reviewing complete history of the patient. I would also suggest her testing for physical urticaria which is performed by allergists/dermatologitsts.

Childhood asthma, especially at 3 years of age may or may not be due to allergies. Personally I would suggest him allergy testing for common food and air-borne allergens, which may help you to know whether he has allergic or non-allergic asthma. If allergic, avoiding the substances he is allergic to may be helpful.2. Chocolates do not cause problems to all the children with asthma. However, depending upon composition of the chocolate (containing milk, tree nuts, pea nut, eggs, etc), they should be avoided in children with particular food allergies.3. Excessive intake of chocolates can sometimes cause running nose, cold-like symptoms due to the contain more histamine compared to many other foods. 4.

What do you think it might be?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your son's history and would like to make following suggestions for him:1. From your history, I would first think of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and food allergy.2. Were I treating him, I would prescribe him antacid like ranitidine or omeprazole before each meal for at least 2 weeks. If his symptoms are improved, I would continue the same for at least 6-8 weeks.3. I would also suggest him to avoid hot, spicy foods, teas & coffees and chocolates. 4. if he does not improve, I would suggest to test him for food allergies.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to him.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your son the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I have severe rash problem, may be because of some allergy. I get it almost everyday. I went to see a doctor and he gave all kinds of medicines which could not make any difference. Now I am using homeopathy. Though it is under control, the allergy persists.

Do you have any other allergy problems or medical conditions? Do you have to take any regular medications? Since how long you are having rashes?From your given history, I would like to make following suggestions to you:1. Were I treating you, I would prescribe you an antihistamine like cetirizine/levocetirizine/fexofenadine/hydroxyzine for at least 7-10 days.2. I would also prescribe you a short course of anti-parasitic drug as intestinal parasites are common cause of urticaria/hives.3. I would suggest you to avoid hot,spicy foods and activities causing excessive sweating for a few weeks.4. If you are having rash for more than 6 weeks, I would suggest you to investigate with complete blood counts, ESR, CRP, thyroid testing, urine and stool examination, which may give clue towards cause.5. Personally I would suggest you to avoid tight-fitting, woolen or synthetic clothes. Loose-fitting, cotton clothes are the best for urticaria/hives in my opinion.Hope above measures will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you a good recovery and the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi , I am Prashant age 28/height 6 feet and weight 87kgs.) I stay at Mumbai.I have allergic rhinits, Sinitus and RAD. The allergy test has shown that I Have dust mite allergy . IgE Test results at 340.The PFT test is normal also the doctor says the chest is clear. Currently I am taking MontiCop LC, Nasal spray and Allergy drops. Since last 5 months I am taking this but no improvement . whenever I have allergy attack I suffer with shortness of breath,nasal congestion , runny nose and restlessness ( Just like panic attack). It happen mostly in the evening or night or in the cold air ( but not in AC) but in day time also in some days. I have observed that the symptoms were worst in winter but still I have above mention problem. Please help me.Should I change the medicine? Why I get panic attack whenever I have allergy attack with shortness of breath. Is shortness of breath a common sign of allergic rhinitis? Please help me to overcome from this.","Doctor":"Hello,I would like to make the following suggestions to you:-No, shortness of breath is not a sign of allergic rhinitis. At the most, nose block may create an impression that you are feeling difficulty in breathing. But if it is not due to nasal obstruction, it may be due to bronchoconstriction caused by reactive airway disease.-A panic attack can also cause a feeling of suffocation. In my opinion, measuring peak expiratory flow rate during the attack and after the subsidence of the attack is an easy option to identify the cause of breathing difficulty for you.-By allergy drops, I assume you are talking about specific allergen immunotherapy. It takes a few months (six months or more) for immunotherapy to become maximally effective, so I would suggest you continue it under the guidance of your allergist.-I agree with your treatment with Monticop LC, nasal spray (intranasal corticosteroids) and allergy drops.-In addition to the above, I would also suggest you avoid exposure to dust, smoke, and air pollution as much as possible. Regular breathing exercises and a diet rich in vitamins and minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etcetera) will also help you in the long run.-Stress is a very important factor affecting allergies and the immune system adversely. Should you have frequent anxiety or panic symptoms? I would suggest you seek professional help for the same.Hope I have answered your query.

I went to the ER last night and they did blood test and an ultrasound and saud  they couldnt see anything but they they told me it could be apendisitis and to watch for a fever. im looking for a second opinion because the pain comes and goes. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.IF the pain comes and goes in the abdomen , this is called spasmodic pain and can be there in intestinal infection , appendicitis , ureteric colic , biliary colic. Since ultrasonography has been done it is possible that this is due to intestinal infection as this is not seen in the ultrasonograqphy. I would advise you to take a course of an antibiotic, metronidazole and probiotic. Watch for Fever and go for CT scan as this can certainly confirm or rule out appendicitis and so."},{"Patient":"my daughter aged 14 years is suffering from asthmetic bronchotis and now started taking seroflo inhaler twice daily alongwith one homeopath medicine for allergy. She will use it for three months. Whether there are side effects for using the same for three months and I also want to know whether asthma can be cured completely.","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your daughter's history and would like to make following suggestions for her in reply to your query:1. Seroflo contains two drugs - Salmeterol and Fluticasone.Inhaler therapy is usually considered much more safe than oral drugs because the inhalers act directly in the lungs with negligible absorption in the body.Common side effects can be local irritation in throat, oral thrush, change in voice (due to Fluticasone) and tremors, feeling of heart beats due to Salmeterol.These side effects can be minimized by proper technique of using inhaler and by rinsing the mouth after each use.2. Regarding cure of asthma, Specific Allergen Immunotherapy can cure asthma for a few years (sometimes for lifelong), if asthma is due to allergy. A thorough allergy evaluation (not only allergy testing)is necessary before suggesting immunotherapy.3. In general, I would suggest her to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes & air pollution as much as possible.4. Regular breathing exercise and a diet rich in vitamins & minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts etc) will also do good for her immune system and will help her in a long run.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to her.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your daughter the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I'm experincing very itchy feet, last week i noticed some red itchy marks all over my legs and feet so i took an oatmeal bath and the itchying was realived so since i thought it was dry skin ive been putting lotion on regularly but now my feet are once again itchy, i also just began taking depo pevara and was wondering if this may be a symptom?","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicThe fact that the itching is confined to the feet implies that it is likely related to something coming into contact with the feet such as lotion, cream, socks, shoes.You may want to determine if any of these would likely cause your reaction.The use of an oral anti histamine and mild topical steroid to the area would help the itching.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I think I have been bitten by a spider on my arm, I have a fairly large lump there now, maybe half a golf ball size but at no stage has it hurt, it was VERY itchy initially but after not scratching it it has settled down.

I was unable to sleep in the nights due to breathing difficulty.I used Allegra, Sudafed, Claritin on and off ( never used as a course as I was pregnant)After delivery, the allergy continued but not as severe as when I was pregnant.I went for allergy testing ( skin pricking test ) in USA in december,2013 and I was diagnosed as allergic to DUST MITES and some other environmental factors too. I was given a Fluticasone nasal spray to use. I used it for 3 weeks and stopped it as they are steroids.I came to India for 2 months ( January and February) . I visited a general doctor and was diagnosed as Allergic Rhinitis.  I tested CBC ( Complete Blood Count ) test and thyroid and eosinophilia - all were negative.  The  doctor said it is pure allergy caused due to dust. He prescribed me to use Montair LC for 20 days. Iwas feeling better while using the medicine. After stopping the medicine, the symptoms came back. Then I visited doctor again he told me to use the medicine Montair LC for 15 more days and check it. I used it and was fine and the symptoms returned when I stopped using the medicine. Then, I visited an Ayurvedic doctor in India and was asked to use chywanprash,  SwAsari pravasi, tribhuvankriti Ras and SwAsari ras for 3 months and use Chyawanprash only for 3 years. I started using these Ayurvedic medicines on and off as they have high heat potency. Then, whenever I get severe allergy reactions, I take Montair LC for few days for relief and stop it.  ---- what kind of diet is required for this allergy type??? ---- what foods should I ignore????           I used to take lemon, honey and apple cider vinegar mixed with water fora Few days in the early mornings for increasing my resistance.

As you have asked about cortisone, I would like to mention the following:1. Cortisone is a corticosteroid. A single corticosteroid shot usually does not cause significant side effects except pain at the injection site, sometimes gastritis, etcetera.2. Of course, repeated or long term use of cortisone (or any other corticosteroid tablet or injection) can cause various and some serious side effects like gastritis, hypertension, diabetes, psychosis, osteoporosis, weight gain, cataract, glaucoma, suppressed immunity, skin changes, etcetera. So it is never advisable to have corticosteroid tablets or shots without a doctor's recommendation.3. For severe allergy symptoms, intranasal corticosteroids (for nose allergies) and inhaled corticosteroids (for asthma) are preferred, they act locally and do not cause above mentioned side effects.4.

I'm using a puffer now and I was wondering what I can do to help him sleep at night. he wakes up coughing at least 4-5 times every night and seems always congested and has been having a hard time drinking his bottles. other than using saline drops and a nasal aspirator, I've also closed off his heat vent (that is the cause of the allergy, we heat our house with a wood furnace) is there anything else I can do? are there medications that can help?","Doctor":"Hello,I would like to know what are his symptoms of asthma and how it was diagnosed as it is very difficult to definitely diagnose asthma at this young age. I also would like to know whether he regurgitates or vomits feeds, whether he has had wheezing, whether he has nose block, etcetera. From your given history, I would like to make the following suggestions for your son:1. Please continue using treatment as suggested by his doctor. Nasal saline drops are very safe and can be used very frequently for nose blocks.2. Breastfeeding is ideal for any infant less than six months. Personally, I discourage feeding with bottles in young infants as it can cause repeated infections (even after good care). Mother's milk provides many factors that protect an infant from allergies and infections.3. Was I treating him, I would prescribe him an antacid like ranitidine for 1-2 weeks. If this improves his symptoms, I would suggest it continue up to at least 4-6 weeks.4. Personally, I would suggest him testing for milk allergy (assuming he is receiving animal milk in a bottle). If the test is positive, milk and milk products may be omitted after consulting your pediatrician.5. I would suggest you make sure that he is protected from smoke, dust and strong cold winds or air currents.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Parin N. Parmar"},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor. How are you? I have recently noticed that whenever I smell the scent of hookah I get caught up in a series of nonstop coughing and find it hard to breathe.

Does he have nose symptoms (sneezing, nose congestion, running noes)? Is he exposed to any smoke at home? Does he regurgitates/vomits foods often? Does he have any skin allergies?From your given history, I would like to make suggestions for him as follows:1. Were I treating him, first of all I would review his inhaler device and technique. This is very important as if the device/technique are improper, most of the drug may not go into the lungs and therefore the treatment may not become effective.So, personally I would suggest you to get the inhaler device and the technique of using it reviewed by a pediatrician experienced with inhaler therapy.In my opinion, metered dose inhaler with spacer device with mask is the best device for a 3 year old child.2. I would agree with the drugs that your doctor has suggested. It is important to remember that Flohale and Montair are to be taken regularly and Levoline is to be taken when he has wheezing on as-and-when-needed basis. 3. If he has frequent nose symptoms, I would add a daily antihistamine like cetirizine/levocetirizine to above treatment.4. Were I treating him, I would also prescribe him vitamin C for 2-3 months. I would also suggest you to get his hemoglobin levels and if low, maintain hemoglobin around 14 g%. These two measures will help improve his immunity and reduce frequent infections.5.  Personally I would suggest him testing for allergies to air-borne allergens and food proteins. Allergy testing will help you to identify the substances causing troubles to him and also to know how to avoid them.6. In general, please try to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.7. A nutritive diet rich in vitamins & minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) will help him in a long run.Hope above measures will be helpful to him.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your son the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"my stomach feels like theres bubbles poppin and it makes noises allll the time! like everry minute! it even makes noises at the top of my stomach where the rib cage starts and everything.

Thanks","Doctor":"Dear Sonia,The symptoms as mentioned in your post can be attributed to Acute exacerbation of asthma, secondary to the respiratory tract infection.Management consists of:1. A course of antibiotics based on culture & sensitivity reports.2. Asthalin+ Seroflo inhaler- provide symptomatic relief by causing broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs). So, it can be used during an acute attack.3. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of asthma.4. Antihistamines like Cetrizine can also be used to provide symptomatic relief.5. Also make sure that you are well protected from exposure to cold, dust or other allergens.If symptoms still persist, kindly consult a Pulmonologist for proper clinical evaluation.Wishing a good health.Take care."},{"Patient":"i am a 22 year old, 5,6 and wiegh around 14 and half stone i am asthmatic and been advised not to take ibuprofen and without realising i have taken ibuprofen this morning and now suffering with tight chest pains. i have taken my reliever and preventer inhalers what else can i do??","Doctor":"hello, thanks for your query, with one brufen  u may have slight wheeze and cough. after 4-6hours its action reduces, ur inhaler  is sufficient for that obsarbed dose of brufen. hope i have answered your query. all d best. take care."},{"Patient":"I am 20yrs old and over the last couple of weeks I have started wheezing when I lye down and coughing up small amounts of flem. I got a new cat around 2 weeks ago, at first it was in my bedroom but I began sneezing, had an itchy throat and eyes. After a few days I moved the cat to a different room, this helped the sneezing but not the wheezing. I go to the gym 3 times a week and can breathe fine but when I try and sleep its impossible. Any idea whats up?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. Yes, cat can cause allergic symptoms like sneezing (allergic rhinitis) and wheezing (asthma). There are many proteins in cat saliva, urine, skin epithelia, dander etc which causes allergies.The best option in my opinion would be to remove cat from the house. However, if it is not possible, I would suggest you to keep the cat out of bed room (as you are already doing), bath the cat at least every week and minimize carpets & upholstered furniture in house.2. Personally I would suggest you to go for allergy testing for cat allergens to confirm allergy to cat proteins.3. After removal of cat from room/house, it takes around 6 months to decrease the cat proteins in the room/house. So, in my opinion, it will take some time to reduce your wheezing, if it is due to cat proteins.4. Were I treating you, I would prescribe you daily montelukast and levocetirizine for at least 2 weeks and to use salbutamol or levosalbutamol inhaler if you wheeze.5. If allergy testing supports allergy to cat proteins, I would suggest you specific allergen immunotherapy to cat proteins, which will improve immunity towards cat proteins. In that case, you may not need removal of cat from your room/house.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My son has been getting welts on his body (reminds me of mosquito bites) usually waking up with them. Appears to be some type of bug bites. I know it is not bed bugs, have dealt with that with that before. Have done the deep cleaning of room, washing everything. Could this be an allergy to something?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your son's history.Yes, they can be due to bug/mite bites (there are several types of bugs/microorganisms, some of them can not be visible with naked eye).If he does not get welts daily, I would also think of food allergy. For that, I would suggest you to observe his evening meal and the days he gets symptoms. This will help you to identify a correlation between food and his symptoms.Were I treating him, I would prescribe him levocetirizine/cetirizine/hydroxyzine for 5-7 days and to wear loose, preferably cotton-like clothes (to avoid sweating). I would also suggest him to apply lotion like calamine on his skin.Hope above measures will be helpful to him.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish him the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"my 8 yr old daughter gets rashes( she gets two kinds of eruptions on her body and face, palms, sole) during high fever. she is sensitive to dust, and gets nose block and sometimes wheezing after play. shes allergic to brufen. we are planning to do the allergic test for her. please advice.","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your daughter's history and I would like to make following suggestions for her:1. If she gets frequent eruptions with fever, I would first think of drug allergy. Common drugs causing allergies are analgesics like ibuprofen (Brufen), nimesulide, diclofenac, etc as well as antibiotics like penicillins, cephalosporins, etc.Hoever, practically any drug can cause allergy, so were I treating her, I would review her medicines in great detail.2. As she is allergic to brufen, personally I suggest to use only paracetamol for fever and pains. Paracetamol is the safest analgesic for patients with drug allergies in my opinion.3. For drug allergy, unfortunately most of the allergy tests are not reliable to diagnose/rule out drug allergies with exception of penicillin allergy. In my clinic, if I suspect allergy to drugs other than penicillins, I have to eview each and every drug used by the child in great detail and then can make suggestion regarding avoidance.4. As she also gets nose block and sometimes wheezing, I would suggest her testing for air-borne allergens (specifically house dust mites, common molds in your area, common pollens in your area, cockroach proteins, animal dander if she has contact with animals, etc). Were I treating her, I would take her history of symptoms as well as her environment in a great detail to select the allergens to be tested. This is very important because testing for number of substances without knowing child's symptoms many times yield results which are falsely positive causing unnecessary restrictions on the child.Hope above measures will be useful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your daughter the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi my son is 3.5 yr old 2 days back when he wackup from bed, the whole body get redish rashes and itching probelm, we went to his perdiotic doctor he gave some allergy medicine, latter in the evning he got stomech ache and sever ferver in the night and also the rashes increaesd the whole body, then we admited into a hospital and they started treatment now, the fever continues and the rashes little come down now only in the leg side but too mach pain when he lift his legs, I am not sure what kind of allergy, I heard from doctor it is called artic can you explain what is the cause of this disese and what is the precaution to take so that it won't repeat","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your son's history and I would like to make following suggestions:1.

Were I treating your son, as he got such episode for the first time, along with high fever, I would not suspect allergy. I would first think of viral infection which caused his urticaria. Leg pain, in my opinion, also favors viral infection rather than allergy.4. If he gets repeated episodes of  such itchy rash, I would suggest him testing for food proteins.5. For treatment, I would suggest him an antihistamine like cetirizine/levocetirizine/hydroxyzine for 5-7 days, lotion like calamine over the itchy skin, paracetamol for fever & pains, rest and plenty of oral fluids.

I always advise my asthma patients to keep a rescue inhaler (such as salbutamol or levosalbutamol) with themselves. So if you are having a rescue inhaler, I would suggest you to use it before going to hospital so that it would start working inside your lungs.2. I would suggest you to inhale fresh air. Please do not be in a crowded/closed room which may have reduced oxygen levels as compared to fresh air in open surroundings.3. If you go to hospital, you could inform them that you are an asthmatic and are having breathlessness after paint spray use.

Asthma is a disease with long-duration, but it is not possible to make prediction whether it will be life-long, particularly at your age. There are worse periods and disease-free periods, which are not predictable and depend on many factors like environment, diet, physiological changes, habits, etc.It is always good to understand the disease, stay positive and seek expert opinions from different specialties so that you can manage yourself in the best possible way.2. The inhaler you are using (Asthalin rotacaps) is used for rescue management. Whenever you have symptoms of wheezing or breathing difficulty, I would suggest you to use it on as-and-when-needed basis.3. If you are not comfortable with the inhaler device, there are many inhaler devices available such as metered dose inhaler, metered dose inhaler with spacer, dry powdered inhaler, etc. In my opinion, metered dose inhalers are the best and easy to use. Using them with spacer provides maximum drug delivery to lungs.I apologize as I cannot provide you company name as per our terms and conditions.4.

This chemical is involved in causing some of the allergy symptoms.Histamine is not involved in other aspects of the immune system. The immune system is vast and there are different types of cells that involved in an immune response.The part of the immune system involved in allergies is different than the parts that- fight viral infections, fight bacterial or parasites, reduce cell multiplying and cancer.So, no, the use of anti histamines would not affect the aspect of the immune system involved in suppression abnormal cell growth.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"hi. i am 25 year old. i am facing the probbem of allergy by mutton since 10 yrs. whenever i eat, i get itching in all over body as well vomiting. beside mutton there is no problem by chicken. before 10 yrs i used to eat it. but that time i had no prblm like this.","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicIt would be important to avoid using it in the future.If you continue to use it despite your allergy, the allergic response would progressively worsen.If you are accidentally exposed, then the use of oral anti histamines would help.As a persons is repeatedly exposed to a particular substance, it is possible to build an allergic response to it.

Do I have to use the tapered procedure when taking predisolone?","Doctor":"Hello dear,Prednisolone being a corticosteroid should be taken only under the guidance of your Doctor and follow a tapering off procedure before stopping it.The symptoms as mentioned in your post can be attributed to Acute exacerbation of asthma, secondary to the respiratory tract infection.Management consists of:1. A course of antibiotics based on culture & sensitivity reports.2. Asthalin+ Seroflo inhaler- provide symptomatic relief by causing broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs). So, it can be used during an acute attack.3. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of asthma.4. Antihistamines like Cetrizine can also be used to provide symptomatic relief.5. Also make sure that you are well protected from exposure to cold, dust or other allergens.If symptoms still persist, kindly consult a Pulmonologist for proper clinical evaluation.Wishing a good health.Take care."},{"Patient":"my daughter aged 2 and half years suffering with frequent cough doctor suggested that to use monticope syrup 5ml twice daily, asthalin inhaler twice and cortizon inhaler twice a day for 3 months. is there any side effects for prolonged use of these medicines. please answer me.","Doctor":"HI thanks for posting your query on HCM.Tong term use of asthalin ,cortizon,monticope are associated with harmful side effects.They include electrolyte disturbances,acne,growth disturbances,gastric ulcers,dry skin,body dysmorphism,bone disturbances,etc.I suggest you not to use these drugs for more then the prescribed period.Consult your doctor for further assistance,thank you,take care"},{"Patient":"I m currently staying @ a house w/filthy carpets stained from vomit & beer, I scrub & Lysol several times daily due to the filthy nature of this person.

I would like to know more details for him like - Since what age is he having asthma? Does he have any other allergies like nose allergy, skin allergy, any other? Does he have any other medical condition? Does he have any family member with allergies/asthma? Does he have any digestive problem? Is his growth (weight and height) normal compared to other children of his age?However, from your given history, I would like to make suggestions to him:1. One of the most important aspect of treating a young child with asthma is his technique of using inhaler.First of all, I would suggest you to get his inhaler device and technique of using inhaler device reviewed by an experienced pediatrician/allergy specialist. This is most important as if the technique is improper, he may not be getting adequate amounts of drugs in his lungs and therefore the inhaler may not be that effective.After varifying his technique and inhaler device only, I would think of increasing dose of his inhalers.2. In my opinion, Metered Dose Inhaler with Spacer device with baby mask is the best inhaler device for him.3. Were I treating him, I would add regular montelukast which may improve asthma symptoms.4. If he has frequent nose symptoms, I would also add daily levocetirizine/cetirizine to above treatment.5. Personally I would suggest him allergy testing, which may reveal the substances he may be allergic to and also how to avoid them. 6. In general, please try to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible. Please make sure that no family member from home is smoking inside the home (irrespective of your nephew's presence).7. For diet, I would suggest him a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) which will help him in a long run. If allergy testing suggests any food allergy, he should avoid the food he is allergic to.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"hi doctor ? my name is varun and i am 20 height 5.8 and just facing an allergic problem which i am not able to find out from 3 years so i am having some type of allergy for which i am just eating a medicine named vozet from 3 years only this medicine make me feel relaxed so could you just help me out with something !!!","Doctor":"Hello Varun,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history.

Avoidance of the substance one is allergic to is the best strategy for allergies.2. Vozet (levocetirizine) can treat most of the symptoms of nose/skin allergy. However, it dues not \\"cure\\" the allergy itself. So as long as you have symptoms, I would suggest you to take the drug.3. A nutritive diet rich in vitamins and minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) helps to improve the immune system (ans also allergy symptoms) in long run.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you and solves your query.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"a few years ago, i was allergic to chocolate. it went away after a month, and never came back. now, 5 years later, i got it again, having bad headaches and rashes on my face, and difficulty breathing.

I would also suggest you daily nasal irrigation with nasal saline sprays and steam inhalation (please be cautious to avoid burns) regularly. This will hasten your recovery process.3. Personally I would suggest you allergy testing which may help you identify the substances you may be allergic to and also to know how to avoid them. An Allergist-Immunologist may advise you specific allergen immunotherapy depending on results of allergy testing.

Prior to that, I smoked a pipe in high school. That was also for less than a year. I stopped smoking for a month during the summer and encountered a problem with my mouth. On a family trip, my inner lip started tingling and it felt like I was having an allergic reaction. Some benadryl seemed to help, but there's a canker like sore where the tingling originated. I believe it comes and goes or it could just be there and only tingles occasionally. It's not an open wound, it's not bleeding or oozing and it's not numb. There's no pain associated with it, it's just a slight rise on my inner lip. One would have to compare both sides of the mouth to know it was there. I had a panic attack today in class after researching oral cancer, I'm worried that it's something other than a canker sore.","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicIt is understandable to concerned but it would be less likely to be cancer at your age.It is true that smoking does increase the risk of another of different cancers including oral cancer but it is more likely at this point that the sore represents oral herpes.Oral herpes is very common and prevalent in the population.It would cause abnormal sensations such as tingling, swelling and a sore.This can be confirmed by your doctor.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"My 8 month's son is suffering from allergy for 6 days.

These medications should be adequate to treat her allergic response.There should be some improvement within 24 to 48 hours.

Is it normal for this area to look this way since there are organs in the area. I have not noticed it to be puffed out this way in the past. however it does fell (from what I remember) a little bit like when I had mono and my spleen was enlarged as this is what I am worried about; the spleen being enlarged. could it be anything else like maybe gas or something not as dangerous to my health?

If you have tonsillitis you should see an ENT to get a proper examination, investigations and treatment.The swollen part on the left upper abdomen is not at all normal. This is indicative of some reason underneath.The spleen on enlargement can be palpated to be enlarged, is never seen to be enlarged like this unless it is massively enlarged. This can be due to gases in the intestines.I would further advise you the following:-Standing X-ray of the abdomen-Ultrasonography-EnteroclysisOnce the proper investigations and a consultation with a Surgical Gastroenterologist is done , you get a proper diagnosis and then a proper treatment can be instituted.Till then do not go for paintballing or any strenuous activities at all."},{"Patient":"21 year old male, 6'2\\" and 155 lbs., no significant medical history except a slight shellfish allergy in the past (resulting only in pimples on face) Currently in Mexico and have eaten quite a bit of shellfish.

In addition, to progress to coughing at night (which means fluid is building up in the lungs), it is likely that you would have other indicators of heart failure.There would also be a history of risk factors that put you are risk of developing heart failure.The most common causes of persistent coughing: (1) post nasal drip (2) asthma (3) refluxWith the discharge you are seeing , post nasal drip is possible and more likely than heart failure unless you have risk factors.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I have had a chesty cough now for 3 weeks.

Since the first dosis and throughout the months that I took it, I didn t have a single cough attack. My question is: a cough that reacts to asthma meds, is necessarily asthma?? or can a sinus cough or GERD cough react to asthma meds??Thanks a lot!","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history.I would like to answer your queries as follows:1. Sinusitis, GERD and asthma are all internally linked. Both sinusitis and GERD can aggravate asthma symptoms. If one can control sinusitis and GERD, one's asthma control very much improved.2. So if you have sinus, and your cough has responded to Seretide (Salmeterol), I would suggest you to treat sinusitis well.Were I treating you, I would prescribe you montelukast and levocetirizine/cetirizine for at least 4 weeks. I would also suggest you daily steam inhalation and nasal irrigation with nasal saline spray.3. GERD cough may not improve with Seretide (Salmeterol) type of asthma medications alone. But if you have GERD, 6-8 weeks of antacids will treat GERD as well as GERD related asthma symptoms.4. In addition, I would suggest you avoidance of exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible. Please do not smoke if you smoke. 5. Regular breathing exercises and a healthy diet rich in vitamins & minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) will help you additionally.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you and solves your queries.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My 8 month old has been mildly conjested for approximately 3 weeks now.

Were I treating her, I would give her montelukast for 1-2 weeks edpending upon response.2. If she has any nose or eye symptoms, I would add an antihistamine drug like hydroxyzine.3. If in spite of above treatment she has wheezing, I would suggest her nebulization with salbutamol after get her examined by a pediatrician. 4. From your history, personally I would like to suggest her to check for food allergies like milk, soy, peanut (depending upon contents of her formula). If allergy testing is positive, that particular food should be avoided.5.

Sun block creams are all a temporaray remedy. Is there any permanent cure for that? Thanks","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and first of all I would think of what is known as \\"Solar urticaria\\" (itching with rash due to sun exposure).I would like to suggest you as follows:1. Prevention is the best treatment for this type of allergy. Please try to avoid direct sunlight by suitable clothes.2. I would suggest you to apply sun block creams with SPF (Sunlight Protection Factor) 15 or more before anticipated exposure to sunlight.3. Personally I would suggest you to take foods rich in vitamin A (retinoids) like carrots, green leafy vegetables, mango, other \\"yellow or orange\\" colored fruits, etc. Retinoids can improve solar energy.4. In spite of above measures, if you develop itching and/or rash following sun exposure, I would suggest you to take an antihistamine like cetirizine or levocetirizine immediately, which will help.Hope above measures will be helpful to you.Sunlight allergy is usually a very benign condition.

I have been spending sleepless nights due to blocked nose. please reply in details. Thanks so much for your help.","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history.From your history, my opinion is as follows:1. Allergies are due to some abnormal functioning of immune system and DNS (deviated nasal septum) is a physical/structural abnormality. Both are entirely different.2. Nasal symptoms such as nasal obstruction can be caused by both DNS and long standing allergic rhinitis. Sinusitis can be caused by both DNS and long standing allergic rhinitis.3. Mild DNS usually does not cause severe nose symptoms. Gross DNS (as in your case) can cause severe nose symptoms.4. So surgical correction of gross DNS can improve your nose and sinus symptoms greatly, especially nasal obstructive symptoms. But it cannot cure allergies. To summarize in brief, as both are contributing to your symptoms, correction of one can improve your symptoms but I can not say DNS surgery can permanently cure allergies. Allergies is entirely different.For nose allergies, I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will advise you allergy testing. This will help you knowing what substances you are allergic to and how to avoid them. An Allergist may also suggest you Allergen Specific Immunotherapy which works on your immune system to improve allergic symptoms on long term basis.An ENT surgeon is the best person to say how much improvement you can expect (it depends upon your severity of DNS as well as nasal examination) with DNS surgery.

Since how long she has been having asthma? What are her symptoms? Does she have any other allergies/nose symptoms? etc.I would like to make following suggestions for you:1. Budecort is a \\"controller\\" type of asthma medication (it is an inhaled corticosteroids). It is considered the best inhaled drug to control asthma.If you give it regularly, it definitely improves asthma control. I would like to tell you that it take 1-2 weeks to get maximum effects of budecort. So please continue it regularly even if initially you may not see its effects.2. It is also important to understand that it only controls asthma, does not \\"cure\\" it. As most of the asthma in young children (less than 5 years of age) improve with age, we can hope for improvement. 3. If low dose budecort does not help, its dose can be increased.4. Another most important thing is type of inhaler device and technique of using inhaler. If it is improper, chances are that a patient may not get adequate amounts of drug in lungs and therefore it may not be that effective. So please make sure that your daughter is using her device in perfect manner.5. I would also suggest your daughter avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.6.

However, I assume you have nose allergy (nasal congestion, sneezing, running nose, etc) because that is the most common and also because you have headache. From this assumption, I would make suggestions to you as follows:1. Benadryl controls symptoms of allergies, it can not \\"cure\\" allergies. So as long as one is taking it, one feels good. Once one stops it, one gets the symptoms again. However, this is not a withdrawal. Please do not worry that you are getting \\"withdrawal symptoms\\" due to stopping Benadryl.2. Long standing nose allergies (allergic rhinitis) can involve sinuses which may be cause of your headache. So, if you are having headaches, I would first think of affection of sinuses.3.

Does she have wheezing after walking? Does she have chest pain, palpitation, excessive sweating, etc? However, from your given history, I would like to make following suggestions to your sister:1.

I would also suggest her allergy testing so that she may identify the substances which are causing troubles to her and to avoid them. Regular breathing exercise will help her.2. Were I treating her, I would suggest her to get her hemoglobin levels done. If they are low, they can cause breathing problem after heavy work/exercise. In that case, iron, folic acid, vitamin B12 and other nutrition supplements will be useful.3.

Is he exposed to smoke?However, from your given history, I would like to make following suggestions to you:1. In reply to your main question - montelukast's safety - Yes, it is considered one of the safest drugs for allergic children. Of course, it can cause side effects like nausea, vomiting, headache, but they are rare. Unless your son is not experiencing any of these side effects, he can take montelukast regularly for long period.Montelukast is an effective drug for both allergic rhinitis (nose symptoms) as well as allergic asthma/wheezing/cough. If it can control symptoms, it can avoid other drugs like inhaled corticosteroids.However, I would like to specify here that montelukast does not work on immune system basically.2. Of course, allergy panel testing is expensive. There are other low-cost allergy testing available, but their quality is doubtful. So personally I would suggest that whenever you go for allergy testing, please choose the best quality testing.3. Please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution to him as much as possible. 4. Hemoglobin 9.6 is a concerned to me for his immune system. It is desirable to maintain hemoglobin around 13-14. Low hemoglobin levels predispose to repeated infections.5. A healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals (adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) will be good for his immune system for long run.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you and solve your query.Should you have any other query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your son the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I have an allergy and I am taking Hyrax 10 mg from the past 4-5 years the dose being every alternate day.

Personally I would suggest you to get allergy testing done which may identify the substances you are allergic to and also to know the measures to avoid them. Avoidance is the best strategy for allergy.2. Any anti-histamine drug like Hyrax (Hydroxyzine) can control allergy symptoms. They can not \\"cure\\" allergies.3. If you are having allergy symptoms if you are off the drug, personally I would suggest to continue drug in such a way that it minimizes your symptoms.4. Sedation is a common side effect of Hyrax (Hydroxyzine). As you are troubled by sedation, personally I would suggest you drugs causing less sedation like fexofenadine or levocetirizine or ebastine etc.5. For permanent relief from allergy, as mentioned above, avoidance is the best strategy.

Simultaneously, I would suggest you regular steam inhalation and warm saline gargles to hasten the healing process.4. Once you have no longer episodes of cough & chest complaints, I would plan to reduce your medications gradually.5. As you are working in a bakery, I would specially suggest you to cover your nose and mouth with a mask while working. If possible, you could take steps (like keeping window open) to improve ventilation in the area where you work.6. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution. Regular breathing exercises and a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals (e.g., adequate amounts of green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) will definitely help you in a long run.7. I would suggest you allergy testing, which will help you identifying substances causing troubles to you and also measures to avoid them.8. If above measures do not help, personally I would suggest you spirometry to know your lung capacity and identify type of lung problem you have.Hope above suggestions will help you.Regarding your main question, I would say, Asthma, if cannot be cured, can be very well controlled by regular medications without affecting your daily life. If allergy testing identifies some allergen, you may be prescribed specific allergen immunotherapy, which can change your immune system to improve your asthma. Also, if daily exposure to bakery dust (including yeast, wheat flour, egg, other dusts) is the cause of your symptoms, avoiding bakery dust will help you a lot.I must also mention that it takes long time to develop allergies and asthma. So no matter you have tolerated bakery dusts so far, may be it is now increasing your symptoms (it's known as Baker's asthma, you can read on internet).Should you have any further query, please fell free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My son is 4, he had a skin test a couple of years ago as he had a bit of an asthmatic chest ... which showed that he has a bit of an allergy for grass .. the pediatrician then said it's fine for him to play on grass ... grass never made him itch and he could play on it ... now at the age of 4 however, if he even just runs on the grass his feet and legs itch. Can i give him Allergex for children .. will this help?? As a pharmacist has recommended Zirtec or allacet.","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your son's history.Yes, you can give Allergex for his itching. In addition, I would also suggest him applying a lotion like calamine over itchy areas. These will help.If Allergex causes him side effects like sedation, drowsiness, reduced concentration, dry mouth, etc, then drugs like cetirizine (Zyrtec or Allecet suggested by your pharmacist) or levocetirizine should be given, which cause less side effects.Hope above answer will help you.Wish your son the best of the health.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My husband has pain in his upper abdomen for 4 days.

Called back and said no.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query and proper history.Since the pain is in the upper abdomen in middle , just below the rib cage and the CT scan and blood works are normal, we can always think of severe gastritis as this is not picked by the CT scan or the blood tests. I would advise to undergo urgent Upper GI Endoscopy so that the proper diagnosis be made. Epigastric Hernia is another possibility. And is best tested by a Proper Physical Examination by a Surgeon , hence get an appointment at the Surgeon ."},{"Patient":"When my daughter dances she has weakness in her legs when she is done dancing (tap) hard.

Does she have breathing problems without exercise? Does she have night-time cough? Does she have any other physical problems?However, from your given history, I would like to reply your queries as follows:1. If she has breathing problems apart from exercise, I would suggest her taking montelukast alone for at least 2-3 months.2. If she has frequent nose symptoms also, I would suggest to add regular cetirizine or levocetirizine for at least 2-3 months.3. I would personally suggest her to get allergy testing done. This will help her know what she is allergic to and how to avoid it.4. It is perfect that she is using inhaler before she starts. However, if this is not enough, I would make two suggestions: a. To take a montelukast an hour before dancing. b. To perform a brief exercise (like running) for 5-10 minutes, approximately 45-60 minutes before her dancing time. This may help her performing dancing session more smoothly.5. For leg weakness, I would suggest you to check her hemoglobin levels, if low, they should be corrected with oral iron, folic acid and vitamin B12. 6. Were I treating her, I would also prescribe her vitamin and mineral supplements including vitamin D and calcium in form of multivitamins for 3 months.7.

For nose and sinus problems, personally I would suggest you regular steam inhalation which will hasten your process of recovery.3. I would also suggest you regular nasal irrigation with saline sprays which can be helpful.4. For asthmatic symptoms like wheezing, difficulty in breathing, I would suggest you to use salbutamol or levosalbutamol inhalers when you have symptoms.5.

A course of antibiotics based on culture & sensitivity reports.2. Asthalin+ Seroflo inhaler- provide symptomatic relief by causing broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs). So, it can be used during an acute attack.3. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of asthma & allergy.4.

I would like to ask you a few more questions like: What is the total duration of your illness? Why did you need 5 courses of azithromycin? At what interval and for what duration did you take azithromycin? Did you have any blood reports? If yes, what were they? What are the other medications you are taking currently? Did you have fever? After antibiotic course, do you have fever at present? Did you have such complaints in past? etc etc.However, from your history, I would like to suggest you following:1. I would first think of gastritis as cause for excessive salivation and vomiting. It can be due to any antibiotics or some other medicines also. So it does not necessarily suggest intolerance to Augmentin. I would suggest you antacid like omeprazole or pantoprazole half-an-hour before meal for at least 7 days/as long as you are taking antibiotics/medications whichever later. 2. Please continue your other medications as prescribed by your doctor.3. If you have not had complete blood count, I would like to suggest to get it done.

Taking Augmentin after meals will also help. 5.

Please consider following points, they will be helpful to you:1. From your history, I would agree with your doctor that you are taking regular controller inhaler, that is, Foracort 200 twice a day. It is important for you to know that it is a preventer/controller type of inhaler and you have to take it regularly regardless of your asthma symptoms. Please review your treatment at least every 3 months with your doctor, who may increase or decrease your controller medications.2. Asthma inhaler or levolin nebulizer - both are similar type of drugs (rescue inhalers) for asthma patient. You can use either of them, whichever you are comfortable with.However, if you have to use them more than twice a week, it suggests your asthma is not well controlled and you should upgrade your regular(controller/preventer) medicines.3. Most important thing - please make sure your technique of using inhaler is perfect. If all the necessary steps of using inhalers are not followed, adequate amount of drug might not reach the lungs.4.

Most important thing - allergy testing is not 100% to identify the cause, especially in cases of long-term urticaria like yours. So although you have been tested positive for a few food substances, personally I would suggest you to observe your food and correlate with urticaria. If urticaria does not appear within 2-3 hours of taking a food item, even if it is tested positive, you may start eating it gradually. You may not be really allergic to that particular food item.2. I would like to know whether you take any other medicines regularly. Particularly analgesics like ibuprofen, diclofenac, etc can cause urticaria. In that case, please contact your physician who will suggest you alternative drugs.3. Were I treating you, I would suggest you a short course of anti-parasitic treatment with nitazoxanide or albendazole. Many times, intestinal parasites also can cause chronic urticaria.4. Personally I would suggest you investigations like complete blood count, ESR, CRP, Thyroid function tests, Urine and stool routine & microscopic examination. These may give clue to cause of your urticaria symptoms.5. For treatment, till the cause is found, I would suggest you to continue taking an antihistamine like Hydroxyzine (Allegra, which you already have taken) or Levocetirizine (Levorid, which you have already taken) or both on regular basis.6. Please avoid activities causing excessive sweating. Also, please avoid sudden changes in temperatures e.g., moving immediately from hot outsides to air-conditioned cold room inside. 7. Please avoid tight-fitting and woolen clothes. Loose, light-weight, cotton clothes will be best for you in my opinion.Hydroxyzine causes more sedation. So I would prefer it to take it at night.Hope above suggestions will help you.Wish you the best of the health.Should you have any other query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"if i do any physical activities my body  experiences burning feeling with rashes all over the body and severe itches. I referred several doctors they said it is because of some allergy but cannot be diagnosed, they prescribed me with cetrizine tablets, I am taking it for nearly 10 years so became addict to those tablets.  so please help me to come out of my disease and tablet addicting problems...........","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history.I would like to ask you about your symptoms in great detail, like - what are the activities that precipitate itching & rashes, whether they occur without any activity as well, whether you have any other medical conditions, whether you are taking any other medicines on regular basis, whether you have any other allergies, etc etc.However, from your history, I woud first think of what we call \\"Cholinergic urticaria\\". It is not exactly due to \\"allergy\\", rather it is due to some physical factors which causes rashes and itching.Were I treating you, I would suggest you as follows:1. Please avoid exercises and activities causing excessive sweating, if possible.2. Please avoid bathing in hot water, sauna baths, exposure to hot temperatures, etc. However, if any of these does not cause you symptoms, you can continue with it.3. I would suggest you to avoid hot beverages, alcohol and hot-spicy foods as much as possible.4. If you are having mental/emotional stress, I would suggest you regular meditation and stress reduction techniques as it also can be aggravating your symptoms.5. If you are not comfortable with cetirizine, I would personally suggest you to take ketotifen, which works better for these types of urticarias.6. Please do not scratch when you itch, it will only aggravate itching. You can apply lotion on itchy areas.An important thing I want to mention here is please do not think of \\"addiction\\" of antihistamines. These types of urticarias usually last for several years. So as long as you have symptoms, you need to take antihistamines like cetirizine. Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Wish you the best of the health.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello I have just found out I had mild asthma a couple of weeks ago I have done my breathing treatment and everything seemed fine until today I had a mini attack... Why? I also remember my doctor saying that I need to cut back on caffeine since I have asthma because of the medicine that I'am taking and yesterday I had a soda could that have been the reason why I had the attack.","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history & I would like to answer your queries as follows:1. Common causes of asthma attacks (factors triggering asthma) are - exposure to allergens (house dust mites, molds, pollens, pet dander, etc), exposure to irritants (dusts, smokes, air-pollutants, strong perfumes, pesticide sprays, etc) as well as exercise, cold air currents, cold foods/beverages, etc.2. I guess your doctor may have prescribed you a drug from aminoxanthines class (such as aminophylline or doxophylline). That is why he asked you to cut back caffeine, to avoid side effects of the drug. Caffeine usually does not cause asthma attack.3. Soda, by itself does not trigger an asthma attack. If it is a cold soda, due to cold temperature it can trigger asthma symptoms.Hope above points will be helpful to you for your queries.Wish you the best of the health.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My daughter, 6 yrs old was receintly tested for allergies b/c her lip swelled enormously at school. This was after eating lunch (pears, potatoes, bread). She also was upset and crying b/c an incident made her upset. I had to pick her up from school and her lip was swollen for 24 hours along with her eyes/face (but lip was worse). They tested her & she's allergic to Birch, cats and numerous other outdoor trees/grasses (just can't remember the names). She is on medicine at night along with two injections twice/week. However she was very upset yesterday and started crying and her lip swelled up again. I wonder if this has nothing to do with being allergic to foods/outdoor pollen and is a cuase of anxiety? Will she outgrow this? any help is very much appreciated!","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your daughter's history.I would like to ask further questions here like - Detailed description of each episode of lip swelling, whether she has hives associated, whether she has any other allergic disorders, whether she has abdominal pains with such episodes, whether she has any other medical conditions, whether she takes any other regular medications, etc etc.However, from your given history, I would like to make following suggestions for your daughter:1. Though she has tested positive for some allergens, personally I would not surely say she is \\"allergic\\" before knowing details of her symptoms. It is very important to remember that some allergy tests can be positive despite the child being non-allergic.2. For foods, I would suggest you to correlate foods with symptoms. In past, if she has reacted to particular food within 2-3 hours after eating, then only consider she is allergic to that particular food. 3. Were I treating her, I would suggest her investigations like complete blood counts, ESR, CRP, urine and stool routine & microscopic examination. These would give clue to cause of her symptoms.4. If she has no hives and only repeated episodes of swelling, I would also suggest her to investigate for serum C4 levels to screen for hereditary angioedema.5. Till her diagnosis is confirmed, I would prescribe her daily montelukast and an antihistamine like levocetirizine/cetirizine and also would give her a course of anti-parasitic drugs to treat intestinal parasites which may be causing the symptoms.6. In nutshell, yes, it is possible that this may not have anything to do with her allergies to food/pollens.7. Whether she can outgrow of the condition can only be told after getting her exact diagnosis.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your daughter the best of the health.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"hi sir, every morning when i wake up and when i open the window, i started sneezing ,itching of nose and started running nose and nose blockage... sometimes whole days i have these things coming...with this i have oncertain itching and pain at ear, and also itching at lower and corner eyes...wat treatment should i take for this....","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history. I would first think of allergic rhinitis from your history.I would like to make following suggestions to you:1. Were I treating you, I would prescribe you montelukast and an anti-histamine like levocetirizine/cetirizine/fexofenadine for at least 2-4 weeks (depending upon response).2. If your symptoms are very severe or they do not improve with above treatment, I would suggest you intranasal corticosteroid spray for at least 7-14 days (depending upon response).3. Along with these medications, I would suggest you nasal irrigation with nasal saline drops at least 3-4 times a day as well as daily washing your eyes with clean water 3-4 times day. This will help to reduce your medication requirement.4. Please try to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes, cold air currents and air pollution as much as possible. You can cover your nostrils with cloth/handkerchief/mask in case of possible exposure to these irritants.5. From the pattern of your symptoms (more in morning, upon opening of windows) I would first think of allergy to house dust mite or pollens. To confirm the diagnosis, I would suggest you allergy skin/serum testing which will help you to identify the substances you are allergic to and also to know measures to avoid them.6. I would also suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who can advise you specific allergen immunotherapy based on results of your allergy testing, which will work on your immune system to improve your allergy symptoms gradually.7. A healthy diet rich in vitamins, minerals and anti-oxidants (e.g., green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) will help you in a longer run.Hope above measures will be helpful to you.Wish you the best of the health.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"my son is 1 and half yr old suffering from asthama. doctor has prescribed syp kidpred and tab alupent and syp azithral. after 5 days of treatment no relief for cough or breathlessness.our family history of asthama my brother 26 yr old taking cap aerocort (rotacaps 2-3 time in a week and hyperacidity complaint .i am worried about my son early stage asthama diagnosis. is asthama need life long steroid treatment or bronchodilator treatment like my brother ? long duration steroid consumption what is side effect? tell me what to do in this case","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your son's history and can understand your concern, especially when thinking of asthma in a child and you have a family history of asthma as well.Please do not worry at this stage. First of all, childhood asthma is different from adult asthma. Were I treating your son, I would like to know his symptoms in great details to decide his treatment like - Since what age has he been wheezing? Does he have nose symptoms? Does he regurgitates often after feeds? Which are the worst seasons for him? Does he have any other allergies like atopic dermatitis, food allergies, etc? Does he always have symptoms with fever or without fever also?However, from your history, to address your queries, I would like to suggest you as follows:1. I would add montelukast and levocetirizine to your son's ongoing treatment. It may improve symptoms as well as it may reduce requirement of steroids.2. If he is wheezing, I would suggest nebulization with salbutamol/levosalbutamol 3-6 times a day depending upon severity. It will improve wheezing symptoms.3. One-and-half year is a very early age to predict future of asthma. So I would not suggest you to think of life-long asthma and medications at this stage. 60-70% of children \\"grow out\\" of childhood asthma by 7-8 years of age.4. Although genetics is important cause of asthma, there are other factors like environment, nutrition, etc which we can modify and improve his asthma.5. Even if he needs steroids, I would suggest him inhaled corticosteroids, which are far more safe than corticosteroid tablets. Inhaled corticosteroids act maximum locally, at the lungs itself, and only less than 1% enters the blood. So they are very safe.However, if he needs high dose steroids for long term, side effects can occur.6. Common side effects of corticosteroids are weight gain, hypertension, diabetes, gastritis, cataract, glaucoma, growth retardation, etc etc. However, these are more seen with oral (tablet) corticosteroids. Inhaled steroids usually cause local side-effects like throat irritation, oral thrush, etc. Only rarely, they can cause other side effects.7. There are other drugs for asthma control also (like montelukast) which are used to reduce steroid requirement.8. Personally I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will advise your son allergy testing. It will help you to identify the substances he is allergic to and also how to avoid them.9. Please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.10. A healthy dietary habits like diet rich in vitamins & minerals (e.g., green leafy vegetables, fruits, sprouts, etc) will also improve his immunity and help him in a long run.11. If any family member is a smoker, it would be advisable not to smoke inside home.Hope above suggestions will make things clear. Wish your son the best of the health.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCMThank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My 13 year old daughter has been having stomach pain often for years.

We are going to her doctor today any suggestions on bloodwork labs testing to recommend to her.  I can't handle it anymore I have kept telling her for the longest time you'll be ok but maybe something really isn't ok.","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your daughter's history.From your history, I would first think of chronic gastritis or gastro-esophageal reflux disease. I would like to make suggestions to you as follows:1. If she has never been tested for food allergies, I would suggest testing for food allergies, especially, milk, peanut, wheat, soy, eggs, tree nuts, fish, shell fish. She needs not to be tested for all the foods above, choose the foods she is normally/frequently eating. Food allergies, especially milk protein allergy, can cause chronic gastritis.It important to know that milk protein allergy is not same as lactose intolerance. One has to avoid milk and all milk products in milk protein allergy.2. For treatment, I would suggest her a 6-8 weeks course of antacids like omeprazole or pantoprazole before each meal.It is important to remember that she should take continuously for minimum 6 weeks even she is free of symptoms as complete healing of inner lining of stomach/esophagus takes 4-6 weeks.3. If she has to take frequent pain relievers, I would suggest to prefer paracetamol to all other pain medications. All other medications like ibuprofen, diclofenac, mafenamic are notorious to cause gastritis. Paracetamol is considered the safest among pain medications in terms of gastritis.4. I would also suggest her to avoid hot & spicy foods as well as caffeinated beverages. A soft, bland diet is would be the best.  5. If she does not improve with above measures, I would think of H.pylori infection and treat her with appropriate antibiotics after necessary tests.

Increased vagal tone ( mostly in the night i.e nocturnal asthma) during sleep could promote bronchoconstriction . There is a diurnal variation in vagal activity  that has been demostrated in asthmatic patients, with higher vagal activities occurring in the night.So when vagus nerve stimulated it lead to parasymphathetic reflex and triggers asthmatic attack typically in the night due to more bronchoconstriction.This is a very complex scientific proved study .Hope this will help you."},{"Patient":"dear dr. my 17yrs daughter is suffering from severe allergy since 3yrs. i have tried many drs. but all ae gone in vain. she is taking alaspan 10g. and it makes her drowsy. plz tell me what i should do. i am very much worried with her health, bcoz she is becoming waek day by day. she has obesity also. susmita chatterjee west bengal","Doctor":"Hello  Susmita Since you are from India , so you will understand better .

Please continue your inhaler therapy. Make sure your technique of using inhaler is correct. Personally I would suggest you to use metered dose inhaler with spacer device, which ensures maximum drug deposition into lungs.2. Were I treating you, I would add daily montelukast and cetirizine/levocetirizine to your regular treatment. This will improve your both rhinitis and asthma symptoms.3. I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will suggest you allergy testing. This will help you identifying substances you are allergic to. The Allergist may suggest you specific allergen immunotherapy which will improve your immune system to reduce allergy symptoms.4. It's great that you have quit smoking. I would also suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.5. Personally I would suggest you to learn and perform regular breathing exercises, Yoga & Pranayama, which will improve your lung capacity.6. A healthy diet rich in vitamins, minerals and anti-oxidants (e.g., adequate green leafy vegetables, fruits, whole grains, sprouts, etc.) will also be helpful to you in long run.Ass you have asked about allergy treatment center in Bangalore, I must say there are some very good Allergist-Immunologists in Bangalore at present. You may choose any one of them depending upon your ease of travel.However, personally I would suggest you Kempegowda Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) where a lot of Allergy-Immunology work is going.Well, allergy-asthma are very well manageable and most persons with allergy-asthma can live absolutely normal life with appropriate treatment.

However, personally I would not recommend dexone or dexomethasone as they are oral corticosteroids and their long term use have many side effects.It is important to know that allergy medicines like anti-histamines and corticosteroids do not cure allergy. So you need to take them continuously as long as you are having symptoms.Personally I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist for allergen specific immunotherapy (vaccine) again. Nowadays, it is available in most countries and its quality and practice has also improved compared to days in 1980s. Sublingual form of immunotherapy is also available which does not require injections.I would suggest you to take immunotherapy (vaccines) at least for 3-5 years which will minimize your requirements of allergy medicines and also corticosteroids.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you the best of the health.Should you have any query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My husband again is having a severe allergic reaction on his penis between fingers neck after cystoscopy.

Does he have symptoms only during spring or other part of year also? Is he on any regular medications? Does his symptoms start with fever or without fever? How, in every spring, mycoplasma pneumonia was diagnosed? Does he have allergic rhinitis? Does any of his family members have allergies/asthma?However, from your history, personally I would like to investigate him for allergies to air-borne allergens. Depending upon the reports of the allergy testing, he may be advised avoidance measures and allergen specific immunotherapy if indicated. So my personal opinion to you is to consult an Allergist-Immunologist for identification and management of his allergies.However, if he is really having repeated mycoplasma pneumonias, you should be really concerned about it as it is uncommon in children with good immune system.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your son the best of the health.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Regards."},{"Patient":"I have been having sharp, stabbing pains in left abdomen.

But they are very very rare. So practically, I would not consider soybean allergy causing blood in urine in your child.There are many causes commonly causing blood in urine in children.

Of course, if by listening to his heart sounds via stethoscope one thinks there is a possibility of heart disease or if he has any of the following symptoms, I would suggest Echocardiography to diagnose/rule out cardiac cause: breathlessness after walking/running, bluish discoloration of lips/nails, swelling of the feet, etc.Hope above answer will be helpful to you.Wish your son the best of the health.Should you have any query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello, my child is 2.5 year old, weight approx-12kgs and it seems she is allergic to something, very often , i mean on monthly basis she starts sneezing or coughing, not too badly but this goes on for 2-3 days.

Contents of Corex Dx can sometimes cause sedation, drowsiness, constipation, etc. Do look for side effects if you give it to her.

All these may be part of physical urticaria syndromes.For treatment, I would make following suggestions:1. You can take antihistamines like Allergra (which you are already taking) when you are getting symptoms.2. Avoid activities which cause excessive sweating.3. Please avoid tight-fitting or woolen clothing. Loose fitting, cotton clothing is best.4. If you think you have dry skin, I would suggest you to regularly apply moisturizers.5.

To reduce episodes of episodes of wheezing/asthma symptoms, it is important to control allergic rhinitis (nasal symptoms) as well. Control of nasal symptoms will improve control of asthma.So I would suggest to take daily montelukast and levocetirizine for at least 6-8 weeks. This will help both nasal symptoms as well as asthma symptoms.2. Seroflo is a controller medication for asthma. Please make sure that you are using it regularly on daily basis. Also, please make sure your technique of using rotahaler is absolutely perfect. If the technique is not proper, the drug going inside lungs reduces considerably and therefore it is not effective as it should be.3. Please use reliever rotacap inhalers like salbutamol or levosalbutamol if you are having wheezing in spite of this. If you need to use them for more than twice a week, I would suggest you to upgrade dose of controller medications after consulting your doctor.4. I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible. Please do not smoke if you are smoking.5. I would also suggest you regular breathing exercises and a nutritive diet rich in vitamins & minerals and anti-oxidants which will help you in a long run.6. Personally I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will advise you allergy testing. This will help you to identify the substances causing trouble to you as well as ways to avoid them.

I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will suggest you allergy testing.

As far as eczema is concerned, milk proteins are more likely to cause eczema as compared to yeast in children.Hope this will solve your query.Feel free to ask to HCM if you have any further queries.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello, I have just found out about pollen and fruit allergies. I can t eat many fruits or nuts anymore as it causes my lips to burn and feel like they are swelling, my tongue gets raw and my thoart feels like it is staring to swell. I can t even drink sprite or any citrus drinks due to this. Also, when I eat something I shouldn t I get like a yeast infection but not a real one. I itch terribly in my private areas. Am I really allergic to fruit etc","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history. I would particularly like to ask which fruits cause you symptoms and which fruits you can take safely.From your history, I would think first of Food-Pollen Syndrome (Oral Allergy Syndrome). It is a benign allergy syndrome with rare consequences/progression.It usually causes symptoms only after consumption of raw fresh fruits. So I would suggest you following:1. Please make a list of fruits that causes symptoms. You can take rest of the fruits without trouble.2. You can try taking cooked/steamed/baked fruits. This will alter allergenic proteins and may not cause you symptoms. Same way, some allergens are in peels of the fruit, so removal of peel also may not cause symptoms.3. If you have any symptom like itching, swelling, burning in lips/throat/oral cavity, please take an antihistamine like cetirizine immediately.4. I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will ask your symptoms in great detail and may advise you allergy testing to confirm the diagnosis.5. Important: If fruits cause you symptoms like abdominal pain, vomiting, dizziness, severe throat swelling, suffocation, please do not take these fruits without confirmation of diagnosis.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"hello Docs. i am 22 Years old male . height 168 and weight 64 .i am having cough since 3 Years + i have a childhood history of asthma , even today i hear some wheezing so i use Brochidilators .and i feel better ,tht is not a Problem But i usually have cough through out the day , its just one cough Out as if i am emptying my throat ,i met a local doc he said it can be urti  and suggested me amoxicillin . i used it But the days i use it i feel better but rest sucks .i Dont have any sputum .i fell something blocks my troat near pharynx .and feel dyspenic these days i have a Problem With Nose also early morning i feel one nostril blocked .or two sometimes With some very little sputum .But i am Not Dyspenic when i go to jog or something i Jog 5 Kms everyday [not in winters]  wat must be the likely Problem . ?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and I would first think of allergic rhinosinusitis with asthma.I would answer your query step by step:1. From your history, in my opinion, your most bothering symptoms are related to nose-sinus-throat and throat rather than asthma. Your throat/pharynx symptoms are due to long standing repeated irritation of pharynx due to post-nasal drip as well as exposure to allergens and irritants.So I would first consider intranasal corticosteroids and montelukast daily for at least 2 weeks. Daily steam inhalation and warm saline gargles will also hasten the recovery. Please try to avoid exposure to dust, smoke and air pollution as much as possible. I would also suggest to avoid cold beverages, alcohol and smoking (if it applies to you).It is very important for you to remember that chronic rhinosinusitis requires a long treatment with patience and careful precautions.2. As you have mentioned, you can use inhaled bronchodilators when you have wheezing. But if you have wheezing more than 2 days a week, I would suggest you to start inhaled corticosteroids for at least 6 weeks in addition to above. However, montelukast will also help for your asthma.3. It is very good for you as you jog 5 kms everyday. Please continue!4. I would also suggest you regular breathing exercises/Pranayama/Yoga which will help you in long run. 5. A healthy diet rich in vitamins, minerals and anti-oxidants is equally important.6. I would personally suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will suggest you allergy skin testing and may advise allergen specific immunotherapy. This will help you avoiding allergy causing substances and immunotherapy may improve your immune system to improve allergy symptoms and reduce need for medicines on long term basis.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"The place I am from is terribly full of pollution and I have dust allergy. I eat alternate days, a drug brand name INFINAIR 5/10 mg which is manufactured by Pfizer Limited. My question is it right what I am having, is it okay to consume 1 tablet that to every alternate day, what are the side effects to be caused to me by its consumption, do you suggest me any other medicine or medical treatment or is there any non medical treatment to cure my problem. Also can t this trouble be 100% cured from its roots.I eagerly anticipate for your response.Thanks un advance and Regards","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history. I would like to address your queries one by one:1. If your tablet (Infinair5/10) controls your symptoms adequately, you can continue taking at alternate days for long time. However, if it does not adequately control your symptoms, I would suggest you to take it daily.2. Infinair has 2 contents: Levocetirizine 5 mg & Montelukast 10 mg. Both are considered generally safe for long term use. Common side-effects of Levocetirizine are sedation (most common), feeling drowsy, poor concentration, etc. Common side-effects of montelukast are headache, nausea, etc. If you are not feeling any side effects of above, you can continue taking it for long time.3. If you are not having any side-effects, I would suggest you to take the same medicine. If you are experiencing sedation, drowsiness, etc, I would suggest you a combination of fexofenadine and montelukast which cause less sedation.4. For non-medical treatment, I would suggest you following: a. Avoidance of dust/smoke/air pollution as much as possible. For example, using face masks while driving in polluted areas, using personal protective device while working if work involves exposure to dust, etc b. Ensure adequate ventilation and sunlight exposure in your rooms to lessen concentration of allergy-causing substances c. Please do not smoke if you dod. A nutritive diet rich in vitamins, minerals and anti-oxidants5. For \\"cure\\" of allergic rhinitis, I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will suggest you allergy skin testing/blood testing. Depending upon its results, he may advise you specific allergen immunotherapy which basically works on your immune system to change allergy symptoms. Hope my answer will be helpful to you.Wish you the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"HI. I am a 25 year old male living in Africa, having a history of acidity. Recently i was given steroids medication to help my asthma however it cause my body to gain weight and have blood in my stool, i have stopped all medications except use my rota-inhaler (budocote and Asthalin) for my asthma and the doctor prescribed Esomeprazole 2 times a day for my acidity for 2 month. i have noticed if i have herbal ginger tea or any herbal medication that causes blood in my stool and pain on my lower back. Could you help me determine what may the cause be and what test do i require to do inorder to find and treat the problem.","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and I would like to give my opinion as follows:1. Oral steroid medications can cause weight gain as well as can cause gastritis (can aggravate acidity). So it's good that you have stopped your medications and started Esomeprazole for 2 months.2. Again, it's good that you are controlling your asthma with rota-inhaler - Budecort and Asthalin. Inhaled medications, if used appropriately, only rarely cause systemic side effects.3. A severe gastritis/peptic ulcer can cause bleeding in stomach/upper part of small intestine. So if your stool contains black blood, it means blood is coming from stomach/small intestine. Taking antacids such as Esomeprazole for at least 8 weeks will help in such case. However, if it does not improve, I would suggest you Upper GI scopy (endoscopy of stomach and 1st part of small intestine).4. If your stool contains fresh/red blood or blood drops, it means blood is coming from mostly large intestine. In that case, oral steroids are not usually the cause. In that case, you will need a Gastroenterologist consultation to identify the case and proper treatment.5. Ginger, in excess amount, can also cause gastritis. So personally I would suggest you to avoid it for at least 2-4 weeks after your blood in stool is clear.6. I would also suggest you to avoid hot & spicy food. Please avoid alcohol, smoking and caffeinated beverages if you are taking.Hope above points will help you.Wish you the bast of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"today my upper arms and shoulders started itching.

Avoid smoking- it causes broncho-constriction & aggravates asthma.2. Asthalin+ Seroflo inhaler- provide symptomatic relief by causing broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs)So, it can be used during an acute attack.3. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of asthma.4. Antihistamines like Cetrizine can also be used to provide symptomatic relief.5. Need for anti biotics can arise if there is a secondary infection.6. Also make sure that you are well protected from exposure to cold, dust or other allergens.This condition is related to the hyper-sensitivity of the immune response.It can only be managed symptomatically.Complete cure will need complete shut down of the immune mechanism, which will make you prone for severe life-threatening secondary infections.So, it is advisable to kindly continue the medications & inhalers as prescribed by your treating Doctor.Wish her a good health.Take care."},{"Patient":"I am having allergic rhinitis problem since many years. symptoms are after evry 7-8 days , for one full day i sneeze vigoursly. any smeel like perfume, spices , detergent powders aggravate the problem. i dont know whtehr it is allergic rhinitis or some thing else. after taking avil in the night, next day i feel good. again after 7-8 days , the problem repeats.

Is there any seasonal variation? Does your work/occupation involve exposure to dust/smoke? Do you smoke? Do you have regurgitation after spicy meals? etc. These answers would help to get more closer to diagnosis.However, from your history, I would like to suggest you following:1. Please continue anti-allergic and antacid medicines for at least 2 weeks.2. I would suggest you to perform gargles with warm saline or antiseptic like betadine for throat troubles.3. Please try to avoid too cold or too hot foods and also please avoid exposure to dust,smoke and air pollution as much as possible. 4. If your work/job involves exposure to smoke/dust, covering nose with a cloth or mask as a protective measure will be helpful.5. For identification of allergy causing substance, I would suggest you allergy testing. The best measure to prevent allergy is to avoid the allergy causing substance. A consultation with an Allergist-Immunologist will be helpful to identify what you are allergic to.For permanent solution to allergy, identification of allergy causing substance is essential.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"hi my name is Aaron past couple days i been coughing up pure blood and puking up blood i even wake up in the morning with the taste of blood in my mouth and today i puking up blood and i feel really like headed and blurry vision and my chest is throbbing with pain it hurts alot","Doctor":"Hai,persistent cough will increase the pressure in the head and that will lead to discomfort in head and vision.chronic cough will lead to irritate the wall of the respiratory tract that leads to bleed while you cough.kindly visit a physician to rule out the cause for the cough and get it treated.thank youhope i answered your query"},{"Patient":"I was taking a 12-Hr Sudafed along with a Zyrtec for my allergies, but I would wake up around 3 am every night.

I am Dr.Aliem, and I am pleased to answer your query. The site and nature of your pain suggests that it may be ureteric colic, i.e pain that occurs due to obstruction of your urinary passage, usually by a stone. I suggest you to consult your doctor, who may order an Ultrasound scan of your abdomen and KUB (Kidney/Ureter and Bladder). This will pick up even small stone(s) if present, and will be helpful in excluding other common causes of your pain. If confirmed, treatment of kidney stone disease will be based on the size and site of it. In the mean time, I suggest you to take plenty of water. This helps you to flush your urinary passages and clear it off of pathogens. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I started having hives 2 days ago. Hives are covered my arms, legs and upper body.

Once your symptoms improve significantly, I would stop intranasal steroids and start daily montelukast and levocetirizine.During the treatment, I would also suggest daily nasal cavity irrigation with saline spray 3-4 times a day and steam inhalation at least twice a day. If you have throat irritation, I would additionally suggest you warm saline gargles upon awakening and before going to sleep.All above measures will work towards your relief of symptoms.For allergy, the basic cause of your symptoms, I would suggest you to consult an ALlergist-Immunologist who will perform allergy testing and help you identify the substances you are allergic to. Avoidance measures for the substances you are allergic to and sometimes allergen immunotherapy will help managing your long-standing allergy.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you a fast recovery and the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"I’ve had a pain in my lower left abdominal area that has been causing me pain which can be sharp at times for 4 weeks now.

The presentation of narrated symptoms suggest that there can be possible gravels in the urinary system, ligament stretch/others (which are not detectable by CT scan).

Asthalin+ Seroflo inhaler- provide symptomatic relief by causing broncho-dilation (dilating the smaller airway passages, relieving the obstruction & increasing airflow to lungs)So, you can use it whenever you are having an acute attack.2. Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of asthma.3. Antihistamines like Cetrizine can also be used to provide symptomatic relief.4. Need for anti biotics can arise if there is a secondary infection. But this should be taken only under the guidance of your Physician.5. Also protect yourself from exposure to cold, dust or other allergens.Wish you a good health.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello Doc, I have some questions for you. I experienced rapid heart beat last night after I ate fried fish and red spots occurred all over my body and I felt like my head was so hot that it seems like it's going to burst. Everything went back to normal after I drink soft drinks (sprite). My parents gave me anti-allergy medicine but I was afraid to take it because It might make it worst. I also experienced this last week, after eating dried fish. I am 22 years old now, and when i was in Grade 5, i had an asthma attack. I cannot breath air and was taken in ICU after I ate Tuna Fish. Only those times I have those kind of reactions but most of the time nothing happens if i eat any kind of fish. Do you think I am allergy to fish, doc? What kind of allergy is it? If it will happen again next time, will it be a threat to my life?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history.As you are not experiencing symptoms every time you eat fish, first of all I would think of Histamine fish poisoning rather than fish allergy.Histamine fish poisoning is a relatively common type of food poisoning. It occurs after consumption of improperly preserved or inadequately refrigerated fish (Fish require stringent refridgeration for preservation). It occurs due to presence of excess of a substance called histamine in the fish. The symptoms are the ones you described - skin rash, itching, headache, palpitation, sometimes breathlessness, etc. The symptoms develop within a few minutes of consumption of fish and usually subside by 6, rarely last up to 12 hours.A very important thing to know is that it is not possible to know whether the fish is likely to cause histamine poisoning by look or even taste of the fish. It looks and tastes same. Only sometimes one feels a typical peppery or burning taste in mouth while consuming fish, one can suspect it is rich in histamine and one should not consume it.Usually antihistamines medications like chlorpheniramine and ranitidine are used for treatment of symptoms.So, in your case, I would think of Histamine fish poisoning rather fish allergy. It is even more common wish some variety of fish like Tuna, Sardine, Mahi-mahi, etc. It is not an allergy. It usually is benign and self-limited, but rarely it can cause death. If you experience any serious symptom like difficulty in breathing, dizziness, palpitation, etc it is advisable to go to ER and get examined by physician and treated.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor.My name is Ishan Malik from Baroda, India.

A good rest, adequate amount of fluids and avoidance of smoke/dusts/air pollution will also help.However, if your symptoms do not improve or any new symptom develops, I would suggest you to consult a physician who will examine your chest and suggest proper treatment.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you a fast recovery and best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"I have had a headcold for 5 days and it feels like I have palpitations or difficulty getting my breath....need to take a deep breath every so often.

If he has more of morning symptoms, personally I would like to test him for allergy to house dust mite, indoor molds, cockroach allergens and pet dander allergens (if you have a pet). If these tests suggest allergic disease, I would suggest him to take regular montelukast and an antihistamine like levocetirizine. Also, the allergist will also suggest him some allergen control measures depending on allergy testing result, and if possible, allergen immunotherapy.If he has other long term health issues (as you have mentioned \\"poor health\\"), I would suggest you to consult a pediatrician first who can examine him in detail and suggest investigations to come to a diagnosis.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your son the best of health.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am suffering from a skin allergy, in which i get red rashes and iching on my body.

The whole night we gave him steam but nothing positive turned out. Next day morning we took him to the hospital and after examination we got to know that he was suffering from Allergic asthma. He had allergy from the change of season. Dr advised him for Salbair and Budate Inhalers. We are giving him both the inhalers whenever the change of season occurs and he becomes okay.

In his earlier years also he was okay then how come now his cold an cough have emerged out as allergic asthma. Will this go throughout his life???","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your son's history and understand your concerns.Childhood asthma is a very dynamic disease, it tends to improve and worsen over longer period of times depending upon many factors such as environment, types of allergies, diet, use of medicines, etc. So practically it is not possible to predict future of childhood asthma. In general, most of children grow out of childhood asthma with age, say around 6-8 years of age. Regarding your 2nd question about habit of puffs, it's a common misbelief. Children actually do not become \\"habituated\\" to inhalers, but sometimes it's necessary to continue inhalers for several years to keep children symptom-free, so one thinks as if it's habitual. Important thing I would like you to know is that most medications \\"control\\" asthma, they do not \\"cure\\" allergy. I would suggest you to consult an Allergist who, after allergy testing, can suggest you what she is allergic to and how to avoid them.One more thing, Salbair and Budate are different types of inhalers. Salbair is rescue inhaler, used in times of worsening symptoms/asthma attack, it is not to be used on regular basis. Budate is a controller inhaler, it has to be used regularly as per your doctor's advice. It's very important for you to know the correct use of both types of the inhalers.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your son the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi!

If you are using them regularly as suggested by your doctor and still have episodes of acute breathlessness, I would suggest you to upgrade/change your asthma controller medicines, i.e., Triohale.I would highly recommend you to make sure your technique of using inhaler is perfect, as if it is not correct, drug will not be going adequately into lungs and the inhaler will not benefit as expected.As you have seasonal variations, I would suggest you to consult an Allergist who may advise you allergy testing and suggest further measures to avoid allergy causing substances.I would suggest you to have regular breathing exercises, Yoga and Pranayama along with nutritive diet rich in vitamins, minerals and anti-oxidants. Please try to avoid dusts-smokes-air pollution as much as possible. Hilly areas are free of air-pollution and smoke, but they can have pollens due to trees, at times dusty if it is a bare hilly area.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"My son, 10 year old, is asthmatic. He is frequently getting sick these days. His asthma was diagnosed when he was only 8 months old. During these years he has improved. In last two years he was much better. For the last three months his frequency has increased.","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your son's history.Childhood asthma is a dynamic disease which has a tendency to improve and worsen over long time periods depending upon child's environmental changes, diet, medications, etc.If for last three months his frequency has increased, if his symptoms limits his daily activities/exercise or he has night-time cough more than once a week or he has to use his rescue inhaler (such as salbutamol or levosalbutamol) for more than twice a week, I would suggest him to start daily controller medications (or increase his controller medications if he is already taking them) for at least next 3 months. I will also suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will test him for allergies and may suggest additional measures and allergen immunotherapy to improve asthma control.I want to emphasize on correct technique of using inhalers as this is crucial to ensure that adequate amount of drug is getting into his lungs.I would also suggest him regular breathing exercises, a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals and avoidance of dusts-smokes-air pollution as much as possible.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your son the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi dr,my 3yr old kid got nail scratch by a dog.we gave rabivax for two days.we did not completed thecourse.but she got allergy due to insectbite which is lasting for Two months inspire of giving medicines.is this because not  completing the injection course?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.Insect bite allergy and incomplete course of rabivax has no relation.Sometimes an insect bite causes a large reaction, which takes time to heal, in between it may be get infected, and repeated scratching it will not allow it to heal.So please do not correlate it with incomplete course of vaccination.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your daughter the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello My son Brandon woke up this morning with his lip swollen and his right side of his mouth swollen.

If this has happened for the 1st time to him, I would suggest you not to worry and a 3-5 day course of antihistamine such as cetirizine or chlorpheniramine maleate or levocetirizine will help.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish Brandon a fast recovery and the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"For more than 3 weeks I've had lower right abdominal pain that increases with movement of any kind.

I didn't seem to have an allergic reaction at time of sting, perhaps having a delayed reaction?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and from your history I would first think of delayed local reaction to bee sting.I would suggest you cold compresses and antihistamines like cetirizine of levocetirizine. This will control itching. You can take analgesics if it is painful.However, if it grows in size, gets pus inside, causes you to have fever or any other systemic symptoms, I would suggest you to consult a physician.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you fast recovery and the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"hello sir my daughter is three and a half year old  and we hadcame last november only  but  from that time only  every now and then she had the problem of frequent fever ,cold  and cough although ive consulted alot many pedatrician in bangalore but still im not finding any improvement","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your daughter's history.I would like to ask some additional questions here, like - how frequent? what is the duration of each episode? does every episode always has fever? is the fever high or low? does she ever has wheezing or fast breathing? etc.However, I am trying my best to help you from the history you have provided.For a child below 5 years of age, it is \\"normal\\" to get around 6-8 cough-cold infections per year, especially in our country, as she is frequently exposed to new infections from peers and friends and from environment. These infections usually start with fever, usually moderate to high.However, if he has frequent cough and cold without significant fever, each time lasting usually a week or more, I would suggest allergy. I would suggest daily montelukast and levocetirizine for treatment and prevention of respiratory allergy.Avoidance of dusts-smoke-air pollution-cold air currents will help, so as a nutritive diet rich in vitamins and minerals. Please use antibiotics only for infections, not for allergic episodes.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your daughter the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"Good evening!

Getting out of breath can be a symptom of both heart and respiratory disease. But if your son already has asthma, breathlessness/wheezing after exercise/sports suggests what we call \\"exercise-induced bronchospasm\\". Usually it means your son's asthma is not under adequate control and he needs to upgrade his controller asthma medications. Personally I would suggest adding montelukast for asthma control which works better in this type of symptoms.I would also suggest him to take an inhaler like salbutamol or levosalbutamol 20 minutes before starting exercise/playing. Or he can take a tablet montelukast 30 minutes before exercise/play. Also, have a slow warm-up like walking/jogging for 5-10 minutes around half-an-hour before scheduled play will also reduce his symptoms. Hope this will make things clear to you and will be helpful.Wish your son the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"my child is 5yrs now. can she be diagonsed with asthma Asthma runs in my family presently she is coughing badly and always gets worsen during seasonal change. some experts says she has tonsils and few others says she is allergic Present Doctor has advised for CBC, Gbp and AEC test Pls advice","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.Childhood asthma can be present at this age, especially when there is family history of asthma. If your child has recurrent wheezing episodes, requires nebulization, night time cough, symptoms associated with seasonal changes, I would first think of asthma. Asthma can be allergic and non-allergic.The investigations suggested by your doctor will help, but if they are negative, it will not mean your daughter has no allergy/asthma.There is not a single test to diagnose asthma at this age. Detailed asking of symptoms and pattern of symptoms only will suggest asthma. However, there are tests available for diagnosis of allergy, I would additionally suggest allergy testing and serum IgE levels for allergy.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your daughter the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"I have a 10 year old son (57 kg) 5'1\\" who is suffering from Asthma since he was 8 years old, currently I am giving him Asthalin Liquid (2tsp)when required for the last 2 years  Should I change it to Duolin? HE also uses the Asthalin inhaler. The shortness of breath starts at about 4:30 am or at night as soon as he is in bed (10:30 pm). Am staying in Navi Mumbai at present. Kindly advise. I would remain ever gratefulMs Suparna","Doctor":"Hello Ms Suparna,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your son's history.Both Asthalin and Duolin are rescue drugs for asthma. They are used when child as an asthma attack/worsening of asthma. Duolin contains two drugs - salbutamol (same as Asthalin) and ipratropium bromide.Practically, if your son responds well to Asthalin inhaler, I would suggest you to continue it on \\"as and when required basis\\". When symptoms are more/attack is severe, it is advised an additional drug such as ipratropium bromide (as in Duolin). However, most attacks can be well managed with Asthalin only.I want to emphasize one thing that if he needs to use Asthalin approximately more than twice a week or he has night-time/early morning cough more than once a week, that suggests his asthma is not well controlled. So using regular controller medications like montelukast or inhaled corticosteroids is highly recommended. Also, as he is having mostly night/early morning symptoms, I would think of house dust mite or mold  or cockroach allergy. So I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will suggest him allergy testing and advise accordingly.As general measures, I would suggest yo avoid dusts, smokes, cold air currents and air-pollution as much as possible. If he can perform regular breathing exercises, Yoga and Pranayama, that will help him a lot in a long run. I would also suggest him a nutritious diet rich in vitamins, minerals and anti-oxidants. I would suggest his bed room to be warm and well-ventilated, however, more recommendations can be made on basis of allergy testing only.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your son the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor...

I would suggest you to take daily montelukast and levocetirizine at least for 2 weeks. If your problem is long standing (over a few years), a course of intranasal corticosteroids will help better.However, if you always have one-sided symptoms, you could have simultaneous local nasal problem also (allergy usually causes both-sided symptoms), so I would suggest you to consult an ENT surgeon who will examine you and may identify a local cause.Correction of the cause of nasal blockade will improve your snoring also.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"my daughter is 3.5 yrs ,and suffers very often from severe cold and chest congestion what is the best treatment ?

However, I would definitely like to know for what condition she has been taking medicines since 5 months of age and how it was concluded that her liver is weak.Personally I agree with your child specialist and would recommend Montek LC kid for her allergy symptoms.Montek LC kid contains two drugs within - montelukast and levocetirizine. Both are considered usually safe for long term use in children. Sometimes child may complaint of sedation due to levocetirizine component. If you notice any behavior change or dizziness, please consult your pediatrician but they are rarely seen in practice. However, it is important to identify what she is allergic to.

This test will help to know her lung function and capacity.I would suggest her to take daily montelukast as a controller medication. However, decision about need and optimum of dose of inhaler medications can only be taken after knowing her all the symptoms and course of asthma since very beginning.Regarding home management of asthma attack, I would advise to use salbutamol inhaler at the time of attack. If the attack does not improve with it, you should consult your doctor.Although all the pediatricians are very well qualified to treat childhood asthma, it's usually pulmonologists and allergists who specialize in the management of asthma. India is a vast country and there are many pulmonologists/allergists in major cities in all parts of India.Personally I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will advise her allergy testing and may identify his allergies contributing to asthma.

Could it be more than","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your son's history.If his asthma is controlled with inhalers and steroids, he does not have wheezing or fast breathing and still he complaints that he can't breath, I would first think of nasal or nasopharyngeal obstruction, the common causes are allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, nasal septum deviation and adenoid enlargement.I would suggest you to consult an ENT surgeon, who will examine his nasal cavities and may suggest you some investigations including X-ray to identify the cause. However, if he is having active wheezing or fast breathing or constant coughing, I would think his asthma is not well controlled yet and would suggest you to increase asthma medications after consulting your pediatrician.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your son a quick recovery and best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"Dear doctor my wife has breathing problems but when she is taking anti biotics the problem seems to diappear. Could this be asthma as she gets relief by using inhalers.

Sometimes infections are one of many causes of asthma attack.Personally I would suggest your wife to get Spirometry with post-bronchodilator study done which will help to come to diagnosis of asthma. If she has asthma, she should be able to manage her symptoms only with asthma medications and she will need antibiotics only when infection is the cause of her breathlessness.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your wife the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am 26, have been asthmatic for 20 years. I recently found out I have a heart murmur. The technician mentioned that there might be a link between the two? Isn't rare to develop a heart murmur at my age...it seems unlikely no one has caught it before...","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.Yes, you are right. It's rare. Heart murmur usually is a sign of heart disease but there are other causes also. Also, sometimes very faint murmurs can be present in otherwise healthy persons.Longstanding asthma is not commonly related to heart disease. Although, a long-standing, uncontrolled asthma can affect right-side of heart after many years.So, at this point I would suggest you not to worry, and personally I would suggest you to get an Echocardiography done to know the structure and functioning of the heart. If it is normal, you should not worry.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"hi i am 40 years old and for six months having problems with allergic reactions. my test results show that i have a 792 allergy. i am getting rash all over my body but most in the face and chest. i am using diprofros injection for 4 months once a month sometimes every 3 weeks. do i have to take this for the rest of my life or is there something else i can do? to avoid the use of diprofros?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and from your history I think you may have what we call \\"chronic urticaria\\".It is important to identify the cause of chronic urticaria, it is not always allergic. So I would like to ask you in detail about possible causes like excessive sweating, sun exposure, contact with hot/cold water, any drug intake by you, symptoms of intestinal worms, viral infections, thyroid disorders, etc. And I would also suggest you investigations like CBC, ESR, CRP, thyroid tests, urine & stool examination. If these investigations reveal any cause, I would treat the cause.If these do not reveal any cause, I would suggest you to consult an Allergist who will ask you in detail and suggest you further investigations to look for cause of urticaria.Till your cause is identified, I would suggest you to take Levocetirizine in morning and Montelukast and Hydroyzine in evening which may control the symptoms. Personally I would not suggest corticosteroids (like diprofros) if these medicines are effective to control your symptoms. Also, avoidance of too spicy food, avoidance of woolen & tight clothes, avoidance of activities causing excessive sweating, etc measures will also help.Duration of chronic urticaria can only by predicted if cause is found.I hope this will make things clear to you and will be helpful.Wish you the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello!

As she has asthma and eczema, I think she is having atopy (a tendency to have allergies). And these allergies occur usually due to air-borne allergens and food allergens. Of course, she has reacted to amoxycillin in past, but drug allergy is not the only cause of asthma and eczema.So I would suggest you to consult an Allergist who will test her for food and aeroallergen allergies and suggest you how to manage her allergies.Hope this will make things clear for you and will help you.Wish your daughter the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"My son is 26 years old and is an asthmatic.

I think your daughter has allergic respiratory problem but I would like to ask more questions about nature of cough, cold, whether she wheezes, frequency of symptoms etc to know exact nature of her disorder.However, for allergic respiratory diseases, I would suggest her Montelukast whenever she develops symptoms. This will reduce her symptoms along with other medications prescribed by your pediatrician.If she is is having problems during any specific season, I would suggest to start daily Montelukast 2 weeks before the season and continue during the season. This will also reduce the number of episodes.I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smoke and air pollution as much as possible. Limiting foods that usually trigger her episodes will also help.Childhood allergic respiratory disorders usually can improve by ages of 6-8 years but it depends on type of allergy she has, her diet and environment, hereditary factors, genetics, etc. So it's difficult to predict most of the times.I would also suggest you to consult an Allergist who will suggest her allergy testing and help you identify what to avoid and how to.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your daughter the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"i have dust allergy with Bronch.Asthama and now i reside in crowded city so i do find breathing problem.Specially in the morning time...

So for you, first of all, I appreciate that you are aware about yourself.Regarding medications, you can use L montus if you are having both asthma and allergic rhinitis. If you don't have allergic rhinitis, only regular Montelukast will do for asthma.If you have predominant morning symptoms, allergy to indoor allergens like house dust mites, indoor molds, cockroach may be a cause. So I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will suggest you allergy testing and will advise you accordingly.In city areas, air pollution is a big factor. I would suggest you to find some time for regular exercises like jogging/walking and breathing exercises/Yoga which will help you in a long run and improve your lung capacity. Equally important is a nutritious diet rich in vitamins, minerals and anti-oxidants to improve your immunity.Hope this will be helpful.Wish you the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi I have had a dull, mild ache on my lowerwfor 2 weeks.

Also, I would suggest you to avoid hot, spicy meals and eating too much at a time, especially in the evening. If possible, a relaxing brief walk after evening meal will also help. Of you smoke, drink alcohol or consume excessive tea-coffees, please try to avoid them. If this does not apply to you, that is great!!For sinus, I would advice you to take montelukast and levocetirizine for at least 2-4 weeks. I would also suggest daily irrigation of nasal cavities with nasal saline spray 3-4 times a day. I would also suggest you to avoid air pollution, dusts and smoke as much as possible.

Most common causes are dry skin and micronutrient (vitamins & minerals) deficiencies but other causes can be also there like chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, thyroid disorders, some drugs, etc.Hence I would suggest you to regularly apply moisturizers over body and take nutritional supplements containing especially vitamin E, vitamin A, zinc & selenium. Please try to wear loose, cotton clothes if possible and avoid woolen, tight clothing. Please try to avoid activities causing excessive sweating.

I conclude that you are having recurrent episodes of cold and cough for last 3 years and breathlessness for last 6 months, more in winters.Were I treating you, I would consider allergic disorder and would suggest you to take daily levocetirizine, montelukast and an inhaled corticosteroids. I also would suggest you regular nasal saline spray 3-4 times a day and steam inhalation. All these medicines control your symptoms but they do not \\"cure\\" the allergic disease. Hence I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunolgist who will advise you allergy testing and may advise allergen immunotherapy based on results of allergy testing. Allergen immunotherapy will improve your immune system to reduce allergy symptoms. Allergy testing will also help you identify the substances you should avoid.I would also suggest you regular breathing exercises, Yoga & Pranayama, which will help you in a long run and improve your lung capacity. Also, please try to avoid dusts, smokes & air pollution as much as possible.Eosinophilia is not a disease. It is a finding in complete blood count testing. It may be due to allergic disorders but there are other causes like parasitic infections, some drugs, and others. If you have insomnia due to nasal obstruction, treatment of allergic rhinitis will help it. Also, both allergies and insomnia are aggravated by mental stress, so if stress is a factor for you, please try to manage it with meditation & relaxation.

As he does not have any respiratory complaints like frequent cough & colds, I would not suspect he is reacting to mice droppings as they are usually inhaled as particles and affect respiratory system more.I do not know diet of your son but the most common foods causing food allergy are - milk, peanut, tree nuts (cashew nut, almonds, pistachio, etc), soy, eggs, fish, shell fish & wheat. So please try to correlate his diet with his symptoms.If you are not getting clues from above, I would suggest you to consult an Allergist who will ask the history in detail and suggest him allergy testing that might reveal the substance causing allergy.As his symptoms started 6 months back, I would not suspect any serious infection.

Initially I used to take bronchodilator like asthalin. Gradually the frequency of inhaler kept increasing and in a span of 10 years I have come to a point where even asthalin is no longer effective. I consulted a doctor some 2 years back about this development and prescribed combitide inhaler, this inhaler gave me a lot of relief and after about 6 months he reduced the dose. Now recently he has prescribed Formonide 400 and has told me that he is reducing the dose. I am still skeptical whether this is reducing the dosage or increasing it, also suggest whether the inhaler can be completely stopped in a future date? I am a little concerned about the long term use of steroids. Kindly advise.","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history. Formonide 400 contains the corticosteroid Budesonide (400 mcg) and Combitide contains the corticosteroid Fluticasone. Both are different corticosteroid molecules and hence their dosages cannot be compared exactly. However, in general, Budesonide is said have lesser side effects as compared to Fluticasone as Fluticasone is considered more potent than Budesonide.If you are taking Formonide 400 once a day, it means you are taking Budesonide 400 mcg per day, which is not a high dose. I want to emphasize on the fact that your technique of using inhaler is crucial to determine the quantity of drug that reaches your lungs. So please be very careful about it and make sure you are following all the necessary steps daily, i.e., shaking the inhaler, expiration, good coordination between pressing and inhalation, holding breath for sometime after inhalation and rinsing mouth afterwards. Following these steps correctly will ensure maximum drug delivery to your lungs and minimum drug entry in your stomach.I would also suggest you to use spacer device with inhaler which will further increase drug delivery to lungs.I would also suggest you regular breathing exercises which will help you in a long run. Regarding your concern about future, asthma is a dynamic disease which tends to worsen and improve over years. So it is difficult to predict but I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will suggest you allergy testing which will help you what to avoid for better control of your asthma.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"My 10-month old has eye buggers, cranky, runny (clear) nose, no fever but very hot (seems like) and just miserable.He also has a cough. we thought it was allergies, but the allergy medicine doesn't seem to be working.

There are many better inhaler devices are available like Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI), MDI with spacer device or Dry Powdered Inhalers (DPI), etc. They are easy to use, easy to carry and ensure good drug delivery to lungs. So I would recommend to use MDI with or without a spacer.Daily home based nebulization not only is cumbersome but also carries a small risk of infections. Hope I have made things clear to you and this will be helpful to you.Wish your daughter the best of the health.Regards.Dr Parin N.

From your complaints of nose blocking and frequent cold, I think you are also having allergic rhinitis.Asthma is a chronic disease but with proper understanding of asthma and use of asthma medications, it usually does not hamper normal activities of patients including sports and exercise. So most important thing for you is to take all the medications regularly.Asthma has so many types. Hence I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will advise you allergy testing. This will help you to know what to avoid to prevent asthma symptoms. Also, he may advise you allergen immunotherapy which may modify your immunesystem to reduce allergy symptoms.I would also suggest you to perform regular breathing exercises & avoid dusts-smoke-air pollution as much as possible.If you have symptoms of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) like regurgitation of food after heavy/spicy meal, burning in chest, nausea, vomiting, etc I would suggest you to continue a drug like Neksium-40 mg (which you are already taking) for at least 8 weeks. Also please avoid heavy spicy meals, especially at evening, and try to have a relaxing brief walk after evening meals. This will help.Asthma is a dynamic disease which tends to improve and worsen over years, this depends upon type of asthma and patient's life style. But with proper care, I'm sure you will be able to live a normal life like most other normal persons.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"my dad is in pakistan he just recieved a report which says he has serum ige 2500 in his body. i dont understand the complications of the problem and the serum ige, i need some help ? furthermore are there any possible cures for this amount of serum ige and the complications it could produce? thank you.","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.Serum total IgE is a helpful/supportive investigation for some diseases, but it alone does not diagnose or rule out any condition.Serum Total IgE 2500 is considered a high value. The most common causes when it is elevated are allergic conditions like allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic respiratory aspergillosis, etc. However, it is not only associated with allergic causes. It can also be elevated in some intestinal worms infections, some rare immune disorders, etc.At this point I would suggest you to not to concentrate on IgE levels itself. It is important to know the cause of raised IgE levels. Appropriate management of the cause is the only important treatment.Regarding complications, they are mostly due to the diseases themselves. They are mostly not related to IgE levels.If your father is having allergies, I would suggest him to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will advise him allergy testing and then suggest appropriate management of the condition.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your father the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"if a person's report for tuberculosis after medically treated is found to be negative after 5 months, yet the medicine is supposed to be continued till 9 months, does that mean the person is completely cured and is it safe for small childrens to live in the same house?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.There are many types tests for tuberculosis. I assume you are referring to sputum examination for tuberculosis, which is most commonly used for diagnosis of tuberculosis.If a person's sputum has turned negative after 5 months of treatment, it does not mean he/she is completely cured. He needs to complete the full course of anti-tubercular medicines suggested by his physician.Negative sputum means the person is no longer excreting tuberculous bacteria in his sputum. So it is considered safe for other persons coming into his contact.So, yes, once a person is sputum negative, it is safe for children to come in contact with him and stay in the same house.However, this does not apply to other tests for tuberculosis.Hope this will be helpful to you.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am suffering from Dust/smoke allergy, something itching in my throat, i started couging and then my breath gets noice from my chest & asthma started...what do you suggest...in last september i took Fexofenadine nasal spray and i continously take telfast 120 mg. Thanks/Faisal Paracha","Doctor":"Hello Faisal.Thank you for asking at HCM.Telfast 120 is fexofenadine. Fexofenadine and nasal spray will help your nasal and throat symptoms of allergy but not asthma (noise from chest, feeling of being breathless).I would suggest you to take a combination of montelukast and levocetirizine for 1 week. This will work for both nasal allergies and asthma. If you have no symptoms with this, I would suggest you to take it at least for 2-3 months or as long as you expect exposure to dust and smoke.However, if this does not help you, I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will suggest you allergy testing and may advise you allergen immunotherapy, inhaled corticosteroids, etc.I would also suggest you regular breathing exercises.

She will improve if th ecause will be allergic.There are other medicines for different conditions causing cough also, but they can be advised only after detailed assessment and diagnosis.I would also suggest you to keep her away from smoke, dust, air pollution & cold air; also please avoid cold water, cold drinks & cold foods like ice cream etc.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your daughter a quick recovery and best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"im having sever running nose and cough since 2 days.i am asthmatic.i am using symbicort inhaler for 7 years.now i am using symbicort every alternate days.is mondeslor a non steroidal drug? the doctor had asked me to take it for 2 weeks. can i use rhinocort also with mondeslor?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.Your 1st question: Mondeslor - it is a non-steroidal drug which is effective both for allergic rhinitis and asthma. 2nd question: Rhinocort and Mondeslor both for allergic rhinitis. Rhinocort is more potent than Mondeslor; Rhinocort is an intranasal corticosteroid while Mondeslor is non-steroidal drug.So personally I would suggest you to start both, Rhinocort and Mondeslor as you have severe nose symptoms, but switch to Mondeslor only as early as possible (when nose symptoms are controlled).Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"My 10 year old daughter keeps getting bruises on her arm.

I think I weigh 240 but it does not hinder me. I have asthma and depression. I recently was sick.first I had a very bad cold which I attributed to the change of weather. I was better for a day and then my asthma started up. I couldn't breathe and was wheezing. I was coughing so bad and so much I had stomach pains. Then last week my anal area started to hurt. I noticed it when I used the bathroom but I ignored it,figuring it would go away. It didn't. The pain got so severe that I at guest seemed to couldn't sit,walk,lay down e.t.c... it just hurt. I noticed that my left buttock was swollen. I can't use the bathroom because I can't sit. this is embarrassing for me,but I can't control my bladder because I can't clench my buttocks together. There is no blood in my stool. I've been sitting in hot baths which at first seemed to soothe me but now it's making it worse.  three days ago I started taking Aleve to help with the pain. It helped at first. the pain had lessened and the swelling went down. But I noticed on my left buttock ,starting near my anal entrance there is a large swelling. I'm not sure what to call it, but it is huge and I fear that it it's some type of huge blister. It Burns. I can't get to a hospital. I can't move. Please it's there anything you can tell me about this? I went through a 24 pill bottle of Aleve within three days, I can't sleep, eat e.t.c..I am scared.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for using healthcare magicIt is possible that the swelling that you notice in the anal region may be a hemorrhoid. This is treated by warm (not hot) sitz, treating constipation, use of steroid creams to reduce inflammation and avoiding prolonged sitting or standing.If it is on the buttocks itself, then is possibly an abscess which is a localised collection of pus.An abscess requires incision and drainage by a doctor. Antibiotics are also needed.It would be best to visit your doctor to determine the exact diagnosis.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"SIR  i am affect with asthama , i consult with my doctore, he told me 6 month take motack lc and inhalder.now 12 month compleled. now i suffering very breathing problem. now i am working out of my home city. now i take the same tablet and inhalder last 1 week . its any broblem will come","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.It is very important to understand asthma. Montack LC and inhalers control the symptoms but they do not \\"cure\\" asthma. Again, there are two types of inhalers - controller and rescue. I would highly recommend you to know the type of your inhaler. Controller inhalers are to be used daily on regular basis. While rescue inhalers are to be used when you have symptoms of breathlessness, wheezing despite using controller medicines. (Montack is also a controller medicine).SO the inhaler that you are using is not a rescue type, I would suggest you to purchase salbutamol inhaler which you should keep with you while away from your city. You can use it when you have symptoms.Regarding duration of asthma treatment, it is determined by activity of asthma. Allergy & asthma are dynamic, they tend to improve or worsen with time. So decision regarding decreasing your drugs and inhalers can only be taken by your physician after asking you about your symptoms. So please do not stop/decrease drugs by yourself.I would also suggest you regular breathing exercises and avoidance of smoke, dust & air pollution. This will help you in a long run.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"i started having asthmatic symptoms as an adult and i get it seasonally, what would be a good way to control it?

I think you have food allergy related to non-veg diet and what we call \\"solar urticaria\\".Talking about food allergy, it is very important to know your symptoms related to consumption of food. Usually they are immediate itching, rash, swelling after consumption of food. If it is so, I would suggest you to avoid the food you are allergic to for at least 6 months. Afterwards you can try to eat in small quantity to see whether you react. If you are not sure exactly to which non-veg food you are allergic to, I would suggest you to observe closely your diet and symptoms. Most common non-veg foods causing allergy are fish, shell fish, eggs, etc.Regarding sun allergy (solar urticaria), I would suggest you to take daily levocetirizine and montelukast for a month & use a good sunscreen lotion. Please protect your skin from direct exposure to sunlight. Vitamin A rich food like carrots, mango, green leafy vegetables will also help.Stress/tension can aggravate allergies, so I would recommend you daily relaxation and meditation.

I also tried over the counter cold medicine with no results.

Recurrent runny nose, cough, sore throat etc are usually due to allergies.I would suggest you to take daily regular montelukast & levocetirizine for 1 week. As you have asthma since childhood and you are also have difficulty in breathing, I would suggest you to get a test called Spirometry with post-bronchodilator reversibility test done. This will help to know your lung function as well as status of your asthma.Although montelukast will help in asthma, depending upon results of spirometry, you may need regular inhaled corticosteroids.I would also suggest regular breathing exercises and avoidance of smoke-dust-air pollution as much as possible.Regarding heart murmur, Echocardiogaphy will be helpful to know structure and functioning of your heart.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"I have been experienceing severe abdominal pain for about 3 weeks.

The pain does not seem to be associated with anything I eat or drink.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query and an elucidate history.The cause of the pain in the abdomen with normal CT scan be due to entero-colitis or the infection related to the intestines. Since you already have a strp throat the infection is swallowed and directly affects the intestines to cause the problems that you have. This may or may not be associated with loose stools or so. I would advise you to take a course of an antibiotic and metronidazole along  with probiotic and supportive and symptomatic medicines. The 2 pregnancies in the past and a Tummy Tuck surgery may not be associated with the present problem.

Since allergies and bronchitis is a life long issue, is it safe to take them daily?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.Montelukast is useful in both allergic rhinitis and asthma and Levocetirizine is useful in allergic rhinitis (nose symptoms) mainly. As your son has no complaints and has improved a lot, I would suggest you to drop levocetirizine first and continue montelukast only for 14 days. Decision regarding tapering montelukast depends upon how severe your son's bronchitis or asthma is. If he has only occasional episodes of bronchitis, he can stop montelukast and restart again when he develops symptoms of nose allergy or bronchitis and continue till the symptoms subside.If he has seasonal problems, I would suggest him to start montelukast 2 weeks prior to expected bad season and continue throughout the season.However, if he has frequent bronchitis all throughout the year, I would suggest him to continue montelukast daily at least for a year to prevent attacks of allergic bronchitis.I would also suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will advise him allergy testing. This will help him to identify the substances he should avoid. An Allergist may advise him allergen immunotherapy which modifies his immunesystem to reduce allergy symptoms.I would suggest your son regular breathing exercises, a healthy nutritious diet & avoidance of dusts-smoke-air pollution as much as possible which will help him in a long run.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your son the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"my whole body itches like I rolled around in insulation and it has bee like this for over a year.

These reports will guide towards cause of the itching. Your doctor will be able to treat the cause.

But most important thing I want you to know is that correct technique of using inhalers is the most important aspect of asthma management. So if your son is comfortable with inhalers (MDI), please make sure he follows every step of using MDI every time, i.e., shaking the inhaler, expiration, pressing inhaler with deep inspiration, withholding breath and rinsing and gargling. If the technique is not proper, drug will not go into the lung in sufficient amount.I would personally suggest to use spacer device with inhaler as it increases the amount of drug reaching lungs, technique is easier and it reduces amount of drug reaching in stomach, hence lesser side effects.I would also make sure that you know types of medicines. Budecort inhaler & Montair LC are controller medicines for asthma (you have to take the regularly to prevent attacks) and Asthalin inhaler is a reliever medicine (you have to use it when your son has worsening asthma symptoms/asthma attack)I would also suggest your son regular breathing exercises, Yoga & Pranayama and to have a healthy nutritious diet rich in vitamins & minerals. This will help him in a long run. He should avoid dusts, smoke & air pollution as much as possible.Well, above medicines control asthma.

I had sinus problem in the past.","Doctor":"HelloIrritating cough ,Running nose ,Cough is associated with yellowish color phlegm or sometimes dark in color,An old case of sinus problem.Amoxycillin , lecoceterizine and cough syrup ( reswas) are not working .When patient with these symptoms visit my clinic I usually advise them to take monteleukast+ bambuterole tablet once or twice in day till complete cure . If sore throat is there I advise them to take levofloxacin 750 mg once in day for 5 days .I also advise my patient to avoid contact with mite , dust , pollen , mold , sudden change in temperature , fine dusting powder , hay . Because these are predisposing factors causing sinus problem and allergy ( as you may have these symptoms due to asthmatic allergic bronchitis ) .Hot coffee and steam inhalation also act as bronchodilators . All these symptoms are due to bronchoconstriction caused by these predisposing factors.Since these drugs are prescription drugs so please consult a physician and take a prescription.Hope this information will be helpful for you."},{"Patient":"I have had abdominal pain for two days. It seems to be unrelated to foods I have eaten. I have gone to the bathroom normally. It hurts when I press on it.  I am able to function and do normal daily activities. I finished my menstrual cycle two days ago.  The pain is more of a discomfort, not quite as bad as cramps. It feels similar to eating something that didn't agree with me, but I have no other symptoms to indicate that.  I have also had a migraine for five days, which is also typical around my period. When I press on my stomach it hurts more around the belly button area-above and below it.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. The presentation of narrated symptoms suggest that it is related to intestine colic from various possible reasons as early appendix inflammation or others.

Take care."},{"Patient":"i've been experiencing abdominal pain for over 2 weeks now. i was diagnosed with a bladder infection and took my prescription. a week later, i still had pain and was given a different antibiotic. that night i experienced severe abdominal pain, predominantly on the left side for 1.5 hrs before it passed. 2 days later, i was still having pain so i went back to the dr. my urine came out clean and he suggested that perhaps i had an ovarian cyst that burst. my pain subsided finally about 2 days ago, but my husband and i had sex this morning and i experienced deep pelvic pain during sex. this was followed by bleeding approximately 2 hours later. im not sure if this is the beginning of my period or not, but i wasnt expecting it until next week. FYI, i have the Mirena IUD placed right now.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query and an elucidate history. The history of pain in the abdomen - treatment- reduction in symptoms but then recurrence of pain and then deep pelvic pain during sex is indicative of multiple problems at the same time. This may be a mixed infection of the  urinary tract as well as the of PID, meaning Pelvic Inflammatory Disease. I would advise you the following:To undergo all the tests of blood, urine and stool.Ultrasonography of the abdomen including trans-vaginal USG and Examination by a gynecologist to ascertain the cause. Proper diagnosis will lead to a proper treatment.If there is still no complete relief after the next course of antibiotics, metronidazole and anti-fungal medicines, I would advise you to undergo CT scan of the whole abdomen and colonoscopy."},{"Patient":"Hi, Last week I had some sort of virus it seemed (101 fever for 3-4 days on and off), and body aches during and a few days afterwards.  Now, 10 days after I initially got sick, I have a metallic taste in my mouth, and have boughts of light-headedness, and waves of naseaua (today is day 3 of this)...is this just an extension of the virus or something possibly more serious?","Doctor":"HelloYou are having some sort of VIRUS ( according to you and query ) and  also there were  body aches , fever .These symptoms remained almost for 10 days . Now you are having light-headedness and nausea. In my opinion this is not due to any type of virus but these symptoms may be due to these reasons, these include.1 Hyper acidity or gastritis caused by fever or the drugs taken for body aches and fever . These drugs produces hyper acidity and this is main cause of  NAUSEA & LIGHT-HEADEDNESS . Since these symptoms are troublesome, so take some antacid syrup ( if it contains oxetacaine , better) but if there is severe nausea then you  may need drugs like proton pump inhibitors like pantaloc- D once or twice in day . Also avoid greasy  , oily , spicy foods . It might also help to avoid drinks containing caffeine in them ( like coffee or tea ) . 2 Tension or anxiety may develops such symptoms caused by after effect of virus fever.In my opinion this is not a cause of concern , rather try to divert your attention toward other things . These symptoms ( common after fever ) subsides within next 5-7 days .

She has had a cough for about 2 months and seems to suffer from allergies. Has been prescribed cortisteroid drops and antibiotic drops. What is the buildup on her eye composed of? How would she get this? Could it come from her peers in a play day situation? I.e. Is it contagious?

I would also add montelukast & levocetirizine orally.First of all, in case of allergic keratoconjunctivitis, there is abnormality in structure of eye. So please don't worry about build up of her eye. Allergy is an abnormal reactivity of immune system.If she has recurrent allergic conjunctivitis, it is important to identify allergen causing her symptoms. For that I would suggest to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will advice her some allergy testing and identify the cause.Allergic keratoconjunctivitis is usually due to an allergic reaction to air-borne allergens like pollens, molds, etc. So they usually come from environment rather than from peers directly. and therefore, it is not contagious.

I have seasonal allergies but I take allergy medicine for it. My allergies take place during the spring/summer. Therefore I don't see a reason why my constant sneezing is taking place. What do you think?","Doctor":"HiIndividuals having seasonal allergy may be sensitive to dust or other allergens in the environment. At present you seem to be having sneezing episodes in the morning. This is due to the presence of dust or dandruff over her pillow cover.When you go to the bed in the night the senses of your body will be low. The dust and other allergens will get accumulated inside the nose. When you wake up in the morning, the senses are back and this will indicate the brain about the presence of allergens and then the nose starts clearing it, inducing sneezing and running nose.Hence, avoid sleeping in front of the AC or under the fan and change your pillow cover every night before going to the bed.

The usual dose for long-term treatment of asthma is 1 to 2 puffs (or 1 puff in children 4 years and older) 4 times per day. I would recommend to use a steroid inhaler rather than the ventolin.

This happens when food and acid from the stomach and upper digestive tract  flow backward all the way up into the back of the throat, and sometimes even into the back of the nasal airway. The regurgitated acid thus burns the throat and induces inflammation of the mucosa. The inflamed mucosa gives rise to a sensation of the lump in the throat and excess saliva is produced to soothen the inflammation. You may require medicines such as proton pump inhibitors and prokinetics for the treatment of same. Meanwhile, drink plenty of warm water; avoid coffee/tea, fizzy drinks, chilled food and beverages.

There are so many types of asthma. As you have allergic reactions only related to cat exposure, it seems you are allergic to cat allergens (proteins from cat saliva, dander or urine which cause allergy). So avoiding contact with cat as well as avoiding visiting places with cat will be a way of preventing reactions.However, if it is not possible to avoid these, I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who may suggest allergy testing and immunotherapy which gradually \\"trains\\" immune-system to react differently to cat proteins. He may also suggest you spirometry with post-bronchodilatation reversibility test to see whether you have asthma and how your lungs function.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"hello doc.im from india and my daughter is having bronchities problem .and the doc has told me to give nebulization with astelin 4th hourly and budecort should be given 12 th hourly .am i correct doc.suppose if i give budecort in the afternoon at 12.45pm noon. it shoud be given againnow at 12.45am now","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.The prescription of asthalin nebulization 4 hourly & budecort nebulization 12 hourly is perfectly fine for a mild attack of allergic bronchitis/asthma.I would suggest you to please adjust the schedule to comfort of your daughter.For a 12 hourly used drug such as Budecort, a difference of 1 hour will not make a great change in therapeutic response. So schedule the dosing in such a way that your daughter has not to be awakened from sleep and not to be disturbed significantly.However, it is important to adhere to 4 hourly Asthalin nebulization as it is a rapidly acting drug.Hope this will make things clear to you and will be helpful.Wish your daughter a quick recovery and best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"I have been dealing with very puffy eyes lids in the morning for about a month now. My eye lids are extremelly puffy and I cannot get this to go away. I have tried benedryl, clariton and allegra. I have also tried icing my eyes, using eye drops and was even prescribed steroids to apply to my eye lids as well as steroid eye drops. I am now on prednisone for three days. I went out and bought a allergy pillow...re-washed everything in my house but nothing is helping. I will go to bed with my eyes looking a lot better but then when I wake up, they are worse again. Could this be a food allergy? It's a never ending cycle. Any advice would be amazing.(I am going to see an allergist in a month)","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history. What is something unusual is you don't have significant itching and also puffiness of eyes do not improve with antihistamines. At this point, I would suggest you to get urine examination (routine & microscopy) done & also get blood tests (serum creatinine & blood urea) done. This will help to know whether the symptoms are due to any kidney related illness. Personally I believe that consultation of a physician will be more helpful to you.Regarding your question about food allergy, it is possible, but unusual as you don't have any other symptoms of food allergy like itching, hives, abdominal pain, gastric upset, flatulence, etc.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"i am 3 months post ventral hernia repair and i can't tell if anything was done.

I have edema in my legs arms and ankles. I look as if i am about 6 months pregnant. I have seen the surgeon and my pcp, neither seem to think it's a problem.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.Read your history carefully and understood your problems. You has undergone ventral hernia surgery 3 months ago, and since your Surgeon is talking about screws , means you have undergone this by Laparoscopy route.The distension like 6 months pregnancy can be due to intestinal; obstruction or due to occurrence of incisional hernia or may have a large seroma. This can be confirmed by an oral and intra-venous contrast enhanced CT scan of the abdomen. This alone can guide you and your Surgeon about the possible cause and then can be dealt with properly,...."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 21. She seems to have an allergic reaction to paracetamol. She has taken it in the past and become violently ill shortly afterwards. Yesterday she took an OTC product containing 500mg paracetamol, although she had not checked the label before taking. Again she was violently ill. This seems to be very unusual, I guess she will just have to avoid this drug in the future, and read labels on ITC PRODUCTS CAREFULLY.","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.What you rightly said is allergy to paracetamol is relatively less common than other analgesic drugs, but I would like to say some patients do react to paracetamol.I your daughter has allergy to paracetamol, she should avoid paracetamol and all preparations containing paracetaol in future.However, it is very important to know the nature of reaction. I would suggest your daughter to consult an Allergist who will ask about the nature, features & duration of reaction in great detail. This is very important because on basis of these details, he will be better able to advice your daughter regarding future use of medicines.Sometimes, not the drug itself but the excipients, colors, additives & preservatives used in drugs may be causing allergic reactions.Hope this will help you.Wish your daughter the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"HI MY SON IS 14 YRS OLD WITH A HISTORY OF ASTHMA .

Shaking the inhaler for 5 seconds before use, inhale it with right technique, rinsing the mouth with water without swallowing it are very important steps for using it. If they are not followed correctly, the drug may not reach to lungs in sufficient amount.Also, rather than using two puffs in the morning, I would prescribe 1 puff each in morning and evening.

Although you already have noticed you react to chicken, the culprit food can be chicken or any of the ingredient of the preparation you consumed.Hence I would suggest you to consult an Allergist. Two most important questions he will ask you are - 1. Have you ever had any such reaction without consuming chicken? 2. Have you ever consumed chicken and not reacted?He may also suggest you allergy testing depending upon your history.If you are allergic to chicken, I would suggest you to avoid them for at least 6 months and then try again with small amount.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am a 45 yr old female.

And have been undergoing allergy shots for almost 5 yrs and still suffer with my allergies. I need options. I don t know what else to do or try. Suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.From your history, I guess you have chronic rhinosinusitis, most probably due to allergy.If you have not consulted an ENT surgeon, that will be my first suggestion. He will examine and look for some anatomical problems like deviated nasal septum, etc. He will also examine your nasal cavities and sinus entry point with a small endoscope, if he feels the need to do so.But if you have no such problems, I would suggest you to take intranasal corticosteroids and montelukast and levocetirizine for 2 weeks. Please do not use otc decongestant sprays unless you really need them. I would also suggest you to use nasal saline spray 3-4 times a day.Daily steam inhalation, avoidance of dust-air pollution-smoke & regular breathing exercises will also help you on a long run.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"My son s allergies are bothering him very much. He has been taking clarifying every day for about a month for the high pollen count and today took a decongestant. This has not helped. He plays baseball each night during the week. Have read that I should close up the house and turn the air on but he is at school all day with no air. What can we do to help him?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.From your history, I guess your son is having allergic rhinitis, which is not controlled despite medications.I would like to suggest him to take a combination of montelukast & levocetirizine regularly for 2 weeks. I would also suggest him to use nasal saline spray 3-4 times daily.Avoidance of dust, cold air exposure, smoke & air pollution will definitely help.If he is allergic to pollens, it is advisable to close up the house during high pollen count days. However, if he is not allergic to pollens and allergic to house dust mite & indoor molds, I would suggest to ensure proper ventilation and sunlight into the house to reduce humidity and increase temperature. So that depends on what he is really allergic to. I would suggest you to get allergy testing done, if not already done.Hope this will help you. Wish your son best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"hi my name is Akshay. my mother has asthma n her age is 48. she takes seroflo rotocap 100mg everyday n her asthma is very much under control. but she has been taking it for a few years now n the doctor has advised her to take it for the rest of her life. she s worried whether or not to take it regularly since it contains steroid. is it really harmful or does she slowly need to stop consuming it or at least take it less frequently rather than everyday?","Doctor":"Hello Akshay,Thank you for asking at HCM.First of all I want to inform you that Seroflo-100 contains 2 drugs - Fluticasone (100 microgram) & salmeterol (50 microgram). If your mother is very well controlled with using Seroflo-100 rotacap once a day, it is really very good for her.The decision to reduce asthma medications depends on how severe her asthma has been in recent past. If it's very quiet, say, she does not have any slightest symptom due to asthma in last 3 months, I would suggest you to use rotacaps containing only flluticasone 100 (not salmeterol) for next 3 months. If she is able to maintain the same control for next 3 months also, then decision regarding reducing fluticasone (corticosteroid) can be thought of.You should know that the tapering of asthma controller medications should be gradual and under a physician guidance, it must not be self attempted. I would also suggest her regular breathing exercise, Yoga & Pranayama, which may improve her lung capacity over a long time.However, if she is not able to taper medications due to return of symptoms, I would say that inhaled corticosteroids have least side effects compared to oral forms. Right technique of using inhaling device, taking the medication in morning & gargling after inhalation procedure will minimize the side effects.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your mother the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am an asthma patient since last 14 years. The condition has aggravated in the past 3-4 years and it is only seasonal. I get asthma attacks in April-May in North India mostly due to season change. I need to move to Bangalore for a job permanently. Please suggest if this will be good for me or will the condition worsen?","Doctor":"Hello.Welcome to HCM.I went through your details.It is indeed very difficult to predict whether Bangalore will be good or bad for you as asthma depends on so many factors. And most important thing what are the allergens you are allergic to. Only thing I can say that it will change!!When you move to Bangalore, the flora is completely different from that in North India, so pollens change. (Specially because you have seasonal asthma, I would suspect pollens as important allergens for you). Also, humidity may be more increasing house dust mite & mold exposure. Also, pollution will depend on area where you would live. So there are many factors that will affect asthma. Personally I would suggest you not to worry and stay positive. I would also suggest you to practice regular breathing exercises, Yoga & Pranayama. Please avoid dust, air pollutants & smoke as much as possible. Have a healthy nutritious diet. This will help you a lot.Regarding medications, as you are having seasonal asthma, I would suggest you to start montelukast 2 weeks before expected season and continue regularly during the season.If this does not control, I would suggest you to consult an Allergist who will suggest you allergy testing and may suggest inhaler medications & immunotherapy.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am taking Montek LC for the last 2 and half years. Initially i used to take one tablet daily before bed at night. But for the last one year or so i started to take it after every alternative days and now on SOS basis. Please tell me that if i take this medicine medicine on SOS basis will it reduce my Allergy and Asthamic problem. Will this medicine completly stop my asthamic & Allergic problem? If yes then how long time should it take?And what is the side effect of Montek LC and Montair LC? Regards Paul","Doctor":"Hello Paul,Thank you for asking at HCM.Yes, Montek LC is effective for allergy & asthmatic problem. It is effective both for allergic rhinitis & asthma.It's good that you can manage your allergies by using it on SOS basis. Well, using it on SOS basis is good approach for allergic rhinitis (nasal symptoms). But unless your asthma is of very mild severity (intermittent symptoms only), I would suggest to use it regularly. If you have seasonal allergies, you can start Montek LC 2 weeks before expected bad season and continue daily during the season.Regarding your question of stopping asthma & allergy, I would say, Montek LC does not \\"cure\\" allergies. But allergy & asthma are, by themselves, dynamic in nature, they come & go, they change their severity over period of time. So as long as you are having them, I would suggest you to take the drug. So unfortunately doctors cannot predict how long one needs to take allergy medications.Basic ingredient drugs in both Montek LC & Montair LC are same - montelukast & levocetirizine. Most common side effect is sedation due to levocetirizine. Occasionally some patients may report headache, impaired concentration, nausea, very rarely depressive thoughts. But if you don't have any of these side effects, it is safe for long term use.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"hello doctor my son is 9 years old from age of 2 ,he is having aasthma by that time docs told at the age8 he will be alright  but still he is having the problem and he stammers when he have cold &coughand afterwards aiso it continues what to do ,please help me","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.Most of the childhood asthma improve with age and subside by 7-8 years as told by your doctor. However, exact age at which the child will be alright cannot be told and of course, some children do not improve and continue to have asthma.So if your son's asthma has improved over years (that is, he is having fewer attacks of asthma than he used to have before, or he is requiring fewer doses of inhaler medicines that he used to require before), I would not worry. However, if his asthma has not improved as suggested above, I would think he may have an allergic asthma which continues into adolescent and adult age. In such case I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will after detailed history taking suggest your son allergy testing, which is necessary to know what he is allergic to.Breathing exercises & avoidance of amoke-dust-air pollution will help him a lot improve his asthma.Regarding stammering, it is a speech disorder and is not directly related to asthma. However, psychological issues such as low self-esteem (which may be due to having asthma) can contribute to stammering. I would suggest you to stay positive towards him, encourage him and get a help from a speech therapist who will suggest some speech exercises for stammering.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your son the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi I am 21, 5'1, 61kg .

She currently takes a daily inhaler (Advair) and a rescue inhaler (Proair). I was going to talk to her doctor and find out if there are any drugs that are similar to that or if that drug is still available. I also had 2 inhalers back then but I always took those pills for almost 3 or 4 years.","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.First of all, if your daughter's asthma is well controlled with daily inhaler, she may not have bronchospasm after exercise/sports. So personally I would not suggest you to take a drug before exercise if she does not have any problems after sports.However, you can use rescue inhaler Proair itself around 15 minutes before exercise/sports to prevent bronchospasm after sports.Montelukast tablet is also available which can be used 30 minutes prior to sports for the same purpose.I would also suggest to try this approach: If her sports time is scheduled, I would suggest her to have a lighter exercise (like slow running) for 5-10 minutes around 30-40 minutes before. This acclimatization will help her to prevent a major bronchospasm after the scheduled sports activity.Hope this will help you.Wish your daughter the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"When lifting heavy items or climbing stairs, I get short of breath.

If it is low, you could take iron tablets along with folic acid & vitamin B12 tablets for a few months. Also if you are not accustomed to lifting heavy weights or climbing stairs since long and if you have started these activities recently, that may also be the cause.

Any advice","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.Feeling difficulty in breathing after exercise/sports is not always sports related asthma (what we call \\"exercise induced bronchospasm\\").Obesity/overweight & anemia are also other causes. If she does not do regular exercise and suddenly she gets involved in a physical sport, that also make her feel a little breathless & tired.I don't know the age of your daughter but as per height & weight given by you, her body mass index(BMI) is around 29, which is more than desirable. (whether she can be called obese or overweight or normal depends on her age)So I would suggest your daughter to not to think and worry about sports induced asthma at present. I would suggest her to consult a good physical trainer who can advice her regarding diet, exercise & ideal body weight. I would also suggest her to get blood hemoglobin levels done if she looks pale or she has frequent fatigue.Of course, exercise challenge followed by spirometry can be done to diagnose/rule out exercise-induced bronchospasm, but I would advice to go for the test only if she has had recurrent episodes of coughing, breathlessness and wheezing after physical exercise.Hope this will help her.Wish her beast of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am wheezing more and more.

I s any advive for me?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I would like to know your age. At present I assume that you are a young adult or a middle-aged adult.GERD is Gastroesophageal reflux disease, in simple language, contents from your stomach enter esophagus in an abnormal way that causes any of the symptoms like regurgitation, nausea, vomiting, burning in chest or epigastrium, etc.Normally a valve (sphincter) is present at lower end of esophagus which prevents this. Due to various factors, this preventing mechanism is disturbed and causes GERD.As you are having asthma, it is important for you to know that: 1. GERD can worsen asthma. 2. Some asthma medications like asthalin, theophylline may contribute to worsening of GERD.So at this stage, I would not suggest to take frequent asthalin inhaler by yourself. Of course, you will have to take when there is an acute exacerbation.From my view, managing GERD is your first priority and it's quite simple. I would suggest you daily proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole or pantoprazole or rabeprazole or like) before meals for 6-8 weeks. Also I would suggest you to avoid spicy & hot foods, all caffeinated drinks, tea & alcohol. Please do not eat till full stomach. Also, I would suggest you to have light meals in evening, it will be best for you if you could manage a short relaxing evening-walk after evening meals. Please stop smoking if you smoke. Also, weight reduction will help you if you are obese.Regarding asthma, as your asthma has worsen, I would suggest starting a regular preventer medication (such as inhaled corticosteroids or montelukast) which will decrease your need for asthalin inhalers. Hopefully, if you can control GERD, you will see an improvement in asthma control also. I would suggest you to consult a physician/pulmonologist for managing asthma who will suggest appropriate preventer medicine after detailed history & examinationand explain how to use it.Both GERD and asthma take some time to improve, so please take your medications regularly.Wish you a fast recovery and best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"sir my son suffering from cold ,cough from last 6 days ist 3 days he was suffering from fever also but now fever is ok. same condition he had in feb of 2012.. my doctor says he has some allergic problem it may be asthma..he give him levolin and i want to know what is ur suggestion for it my son is 1year and 5month old.","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your son's history. As his last episode started with fever, it may be a viral infection also. And at this age, it is \\"normal\\" to have 5-6 viral cough-colds in a year. So if every time his symptoms start with fever (especially if fever is high), I would say he is having recurrent viral infections.However, if he develops recurrent cough & cold without fever, with weather changes, with exposure to cold/humid atmosphere, allergy may be possible.Levolin can be used in both - childhood asthma as well as viral wheeze.

Avoid cold foods (cold drinks, cold water, cold sweets, ice creams, etc)2. Avoid too hot and too spicy foods.3. Avoid heavy meals at evening/night.4. Take nutritious balanced diet involving sufficient amount of whole grains, green vegetables, fruits, nuts & legumes & dairy - this is for overall health and a good immune system.5. Unless you are allergic/intolerant specifically to some foods, you can take all foods.As an allergist, I would like to say that sneezing every morning is usually due to house dust mite allergy. I would suggest you to take levocetirizine and montelukast daily.Also, daily nasal wash with nasal saline spray 3-4 times a day will help. Please ensure good ventilation and sunlight into the bedroom.

So I would suggest you to consider your food allergy report as a guide, not a diagnosis.Milk allergy is very common. If you have it you will have to avoid all milk products and you will see a very good improvement within 2-4 weeks.As a practical option, I would suggest you to avoid the foods that you have tested positive for for 2 weeks, and if you are improved, introduce single food (from the list you have avoided) every 2 weeks. Please keep milk & curd as last foods to introduce as they are the most common allergies.If you do not see improvement after elimination of foods for 2 weeks, I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who is qualified to diagnose food allergies & also to interpret results of IgE test in a correct way.Regarding your next question, if your IgE levels to milk are significantly high & you also improve with milk elimination, it is food allergy, although sometimes lactose intolerance may be present along with it.As per modern science, mail part of treatment of food allergy is avoidance of the food you are allergic to. Probiotics, immunotherapy, herbal/Chinese medicine etc are other options but they are not always successful.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish you the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"I'm 22years old I'm 5'2 I weight probably around 116 pounds.

However, I guess he is having childhood asthma.Albuterol is usually the most important medicine to be used in flair up. Even Duoneb contains two drugs - ipratropium bromide & albuterol. So it can also be used initially for asthma exacerbation. However, it cannot be given so frequently as albuterol alone.Also, if your son has frequent flair ups, I would suggest to increase controller medications (increase dose of inhaled corticosteroids or add montelukast) as need for frequent albuterol indicates asthma is not under good control.Hope this will help you to solve your query.Wish your son best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello My son is 2 years old and have a allergy problem and doctor start Myteka sachet for one month pls tell me its right because last week he have a infection and dr start Cyclor bt after one week again he have infection and dr started injection for treatment pls reply","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.From your history, I guess that your son has got frequent respiratory complaints, most probably due to allergy.Myteka contains montelukast and it does not have major side effects even after using for a few months in children.

It is a very important step for your respiratory complaints.From your history, I would conclude that you are having recurrent breathlessness, worsening on humid days.You may be having allergy to house dust mite or molds, which increase in concentration during humid days or pollens which are released during rainy season.I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist who will take your detailed history and suggest allergy testing. He may suggest you allergen immunotherapy after allergy testing.If you have frequent shortness of breath, you may need daily controller medications (inhaled corticosteroids, montelukast, etc)I would also suggest spirometry with reversibility testing. This test is helpful to differentiate between asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).

Heredity, environment (pollution, humidity, temperature, etc),  dietary habits, etc contribute to it.I guess your son has allergic rhinitis with childhood asthma.I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist, who may suggest allergy testing after detailed history from you. Allergy testing will help to know type of asthma (allergic or non-allergic) and if it is allergic, identification of allergen causing the problems to your son. If indicated, he may suggest specific allergen immunotherapy to your son which works on immune system to treat the allergy.Regarding age of cure, it depends on type of asthma. Most childhood asthma improve by 6-7 years of age, but if a child is highly allergic, herediary and environmental factors are there, he may continue to have asthma later.I am surprised to know that your son is only 4 years old and he is able to use rotacaps. Generally older children only can use rotacaps appropriately. If technique of using rotacaps is not correct, the drug does not go into lungs in right amounts. So I would suggest you to show the technique of using rotacaps to any pediatrician/physician and if it is not correct, you may use Metered Dose Inhalers with Spacers for budecort.

They are many, commonly used effective ones are inhaled corticosteroids and montelukast.If used correctly, you will have a very good health and you will be able to carry out most of the daily activities without restriction.As you have been told about \\"irregularity of lungs\\" & 54% function, I would also suggest to get Spirometry with reversibility testing done. This test will help you and your physician to know more about your lungs.Cough, breathlessness, feeling of lung contraction, breathlessness upon exercise, etc suggest that your asthma is not well controlled (I guess you don't have any other problems) which needs to be treated appropriately with controller medications.So, don't worry.Wish you best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"SIR I KRISHNAKANT .i am suffering from sudden coughing sice last 5 years.after hard hitting cricket ball in my chest.i went to amny doctors for checkup.did xrays and other test TB. but not find any problem. they are telling me its allergy problem. i am realy sufferd hard because of this cough. whenver it will start.no cough will come out. but it is realy very intolarble. bcoz of this some time vomitting and tears in eyes,back paing and chest pain. could you pls suggest me a suitable medicin for this Regards krishnakant","Doctor":"Hello Krishnakant,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history.

Your keen observation will help you to identify the food causing allergic symptoms.I would like to let you know that most common foods causing allergy are - milk, peanut, treenuts, soy, eggs, shellfish, fish & meat. However, it is possible to have allergy for any of the foods, so food diary is indeed a handy tool.Rast tests are used for diagnosis of food allergy but they are not 100%. It is possible to have a negative Rast test despite having allergy to food and also vice versa.Also, sometimes a child can have non-allergic reaction to a food, which cannot be picked up in laboratory tests. If this approach does not lead you to any conclusion, I would suggest you to consult an allergist-immunologist, who will ask you in very much detail and may suggest you some investigations. He may also advice you to keep a food diary.Hope this will help you.Wish your daughter the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"SIR I AM SUFFERING FROM ALLERGY PROBLEM..MY NOSE BLOWS FOR 24*7..I CAN'T RESIST MY SNEEZING IN LITTLE DUST ALSO...COLD FOOD IS LIKE POISON FOR ME.....I CANT STAY AT COLD PLACE....MY HEARTBEAT STARTS BEATING REALLY FAST I AM AFRAID IS THAT A SERIOUS PROBLEM..??","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.From your history, I think you are having a severe allergic rhinitis.I would suggest you to take intranasal corticosteroids and montelukast for 2 weeks. Once inflammation of your nasal mucous membranes is controlled, they will become less reactive to external triggers such as cold, dust, etc.In addition, I would also suggest daily nasal irrigation with saline spray 3 to 4 times a day. Please avoid exposure to dust, cold dry air, smoke, air-pollutants as much as possible. Please avoid cold food & cold drinks also.I assume you don't have breathing difficulty.There are many possible causes for feeling of fast heartbeats, including but not limited to, some drugs (including some antihistamines for rhinitis), anxiety, stress, etc. I would suggest you to consult a physician if the cause is not apparent.Hope this helps you.Wish you best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"My son went camping last weekend, waking with chafed swollen lips, and itchy roof of mouth.

This is a swelling involving deeper tissues than skin and usually it takes a few days to disappear.I would suggest you to give your son an oral antihistamine & montelukast daily for 3-7 days depending upon response.Hope this will help you.Wish your son a fast recovery and best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"I've been having seasonal allergies and my doctor told me that they have been making me cough for the first time ever.  It started about 2 weeks ago.  3 days ago I started on an inhaler and Tessalon for the cough.  It was helping when I was at home for Monday and Tuesday.  I came to work Wednesday and the office that is under construction in our building was painting.  Our building doesn't have windows that open, so the paint fumes were flowing through the ventilation system.  Now my cough is just as bad as it was without the inhaler and Tessalon.  And in addition I've had a headache and my body hurts since leaving early yesterday, and I felt nauseated most of the day yesterday.  Could these new issues be from the paint fumes?  I also just realized the construction started about 2-3 weeks ago.  Could the cough be related to the construction?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.A construction site has lots more irritants like paint fumes, various types of dust particles, sometimes fuel smokes, etc.Most of them are actually not allergens, they do not cause allergies. But they are irritants. When one inhales them, they cause irritation of respiratory mucous membranes. This causes various respiratory symptoms like sneezing, nasal obstruction, cough, breathing difficulty, etc.So it is possible that cough could be related to the construction.Hope this was helpful to you.Wish you best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I ask u a question..my younger brother is 9 year old n he z suffering from asthma allergy since last 3 years..but now this allergy has turned worse..he z using levolin and budecort inhaler ..but somehow his coughing is not under control and he is complaining of chest pain as well..i m from jaipur..please sugest whum should i consult?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.If despite of using levolin and budecort inhalers he is having cough, it means his asthma is not under control.Before straightway jumping to increase medications, I would like to make sure that your brother is using the inhalers with right technique. A proper co-ordination between hand & breathing is very important for right use of inhalers. If he is not using a spacer with inhaler, I would suggest to use it. I put emphasis on correct technique and device so much, because without it, drug does not reach to the lung in correct amount.However, if the technique and device are correct, I would suggest to add tablet montelukast as a controller medication.I would suggest you to consult an Allergist-Immunologist in Jaipur, who may suggest him allergy testing after detailed history. Based on results of allergy tests, he may suggest specific allergen immunotherapy which works on immune system to modify the allergy response.Hope this will help you.Wish your brother the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"Dr, my 2 year old daughter is under telecast l kid tab treatment for the past four months. she is symptom free with the  drug usage. on missing one dose she developed wheezing.

They are used to treat both allergic and viral-induced wheezing in children.It contains two drugs: montelukast & levocetirizine.Side effects of montelukast are rarely reported in clinical practice. Sometimes a child may have nausea or vomiting. Levocetirizine usually causes sedation at normal dosages.If your daughter is not experiencing any of these side effects, you can continue the drug as your pediatrician has suggested.Hope this will be helpful to you.Wish your daughter the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"hello please help me. my name is lisa..I am 23 years old, and ever since i can remember i have always had stomach problems, constipation always, lactose intolarante, gas, abdominal pain, I got diagnosed with IBS at age 20 . now that im 23, 6 months ago i went to subway and ate chiken and dumplings, witch i had never had before, as soon as  I got home i started itching later that day my whole body was covered in big red welts. then my foot became swollen, I took benaeryl and the next day my other foot was swollen my hands and my eyes i coulnt even walk.. i went to the emergency room and they game me shots that made the swelling a little better.. it took about 2 weeks for all the marks on my body to go away..

I cant stop itching. am I allergic to all foods... ??? please someone help me..","Doctor":"Hello Lisa,Thank you for asking at HCM.There are two types of allergy tests - skin prick test (which you have been undergone) and serum tests (ImmunoCAP or RAST).I suggest you not to be worried by test results. These tests are not 100%. They only complement a clinician's decision about diagnosis of your food allergy. If you are dermographic, skin testing will give you what we call false positives (means even if test is positive you are not allergic to it). So in a dermographic person, skin testing is not a reliable test. So forget the results of skin test if you are dermographic!!Diagnosis of food allergy requires a very detailed history about your symptoms & your diet, right from very beginning when you had your first allergy symptoms. This requires a detailed consultation. After suspecting the foods you may be allergic to, you may be advised serum allergy tests to support the diagnosis. The best diagnosis of food allergy is by food challenge which is done at specialized allergy centers.I would suggest you to keep a food diary in which you can keep note of food taken (including ingredients) and every symptoms you developed, with time & date. This will help you and your doctor to suspect what is it that may be causing symptoms.Common food allergies are milk, wheat, peanut, tree nuts, soy, eggs, fish & shellfish. But one can be allergic to any other food substances from routine diet.Also, I should tell you that there are other gastrointestinal disorders which may mimic food allergy and there is food intolerance (in simple words it means one cannot tolerate some foods) also. A gastroenterologist consultation would be helpful to you if you don't have food allergy.So I would suggest you not to think that you are allergic to all foods! Also I would suggest you to take an antihistamine (levocetirizine or cetirizine or fexofenadine) and montelukast daily to control your symptoms.Wish you best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"i have allegies an cough n my chest gasping for airwent to dr  gave antibiotic, flonase so i had not taken my potonix for acid have woken up with it now but i also woke up wit gasping for air i have feel everyday when i cough mucos out but stil feel a bit in  their","Doctor":"HIThank for asking to HCMI really appreciate your concern and looking to history given here I could say that if this is cough then this could be allergic one thing I would like to say here that you have not mentioned your age and gender here this was necessary to advise you in right way, hope this information helps you, take care and have a nice day."},{"Patient":"I have recently been diagnosed with asthma and have had two attacks since January. It is not related to allergies according to tests. Is it necessary or take steroids every time I have an attack or can I heal it with my normal meds plus nebulizers?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.Necessity of steroids during an attack of asthma depends on severity of the attack; a severe exacerbation needs a short course of steroids. At time of an attack, your physician is the best judge whether you need steroids.However, if you are having frequent attacks, you may have to take controller medicines regularly (they are many - inhaled corticosteroids, montelukast, & others), which will prevent attacks and therefore reduce your requirements for oral steroids (inhaled steroids are safer than oral steroids).Apart from this, daily breathing exercises, an healthy diet & avoidance of smoke-dust-air pollution will help you on a long run.Hope this will help you.Wish you the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"I have recently started taking walnuts because of their omega 3 fatty acid contents, because I am suffering a bit more aches and pains , I am 82, I suffer with a blocked right nostril at night and wondering if I may have a small reaction to walnuts. I also have increased my fish meals, ie, Salmon, mostly I am trying to find out what is causing my nasal inflamation. Regards david","Doctor":"Hello David,Thank you for asking at HCM.Although both walnut & fish are known as major food allergy causes, your history is not typical of that of a food allergy/reaction.Most important thing, an allergic reaction cannot cause one-sided symptoms, in your case you have blocked right sided nostril. One-sided symptoms usually point to some local cause.Fish is considered a histamine-rich food, however, again, histamine would not cause one-sided nose blockade.One more thing, food allergy usually manifests as rhinitis symptoms within 1-2 hours of consuming food. So by keen observation, you can know that which food may be the cause.Thus, although both walnut & fish are considered highly allergenic, and they can be tasted for allergy also, at present I would suggest you not to worry and if you have significant one-sided nasal obstruction, I would advice you to consult an ENT specialist who will examine the nasal cavity.Hope this will help you.Wish you best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello,  i have been feeling pain in my stomach and gut.

Of course, your environmental conditions, dusts, smoke, air-pollution, allergens, etc does contribute to it. I would suggest you to consult a physician, if possible a pulmonary physician, who will examine you and may suggest some investigations like spirometry after examining you.Please don't worry.

Now she is prescribed Relent syrup 7 ml twice a day for 5 days and nasal spray Nasivion three times a day for 5 days. Does this look ok ? why would she be coughing so badly for last 3 weeks ? Is it allergy or cold infection which would need antibiotics ?","Doctor":"Hello.Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your daughter's history, it's runny nose & cough without chest congestion for last 3 weeks. I guess fever is not a symptom here.Firstly, I would not suspect a serious condition here. I would think of either allergy or post-viral cough (it is common to continue coughing for some weeks, sometimes more than a month, after viral infection). Regarding treatment, I would suggest an antihistaminic (such as cetirizine or levocetirizine) and montelukast daily for your daughter. This will take care of both nasal symptoms & cough.As nasal blockade is not a problem with your daughter, I would not suggest using Nasivion for more than 3 days. Rather I would suggest nasal saline spray daily to irrigate nasal cavities. Antibiotics are not required for viral infections or allergies. However, if your daughter develops fever or fast breathing, I would suggest you to consult a pediatrician.Hope this will help you.Wish your daughter a fast recovery and the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"hi my 7yrsold  son is having caugh,running nose and fever and moreover fever is especially evening 5-6 and early morning 1-2 after that it subsided itselft,i gave him cough syrup and paracetamol.morning ,afternoon he is ok ...during time he keep upon crying.advice pls","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for posting your query at our health forum. It seems your son has developed an upper respiratory tract infection ( mostly viral ) and hence has developed cough, cold and runny nose. It is better to wait for 2 days because antibiotic usage due to chances of developing resistance, is not prescribed right away. You can continue giving him Paracetamol syrup for his fever twice daily after food, and benadryl cough syrup, 10 ml twice daily. The benadryl syrup is only to be used when his coughing is continuous. It will make him slightly drowsy, so it is better he stays home during the treatment. You can try giving him some steam inhalation. It will help him recover from his cold soon. If there is a lot of congestion, then Oxymetazoline ( Nasivion ) Nasal drop can be used, 2-3 drops per nostril, to relieve the congestion. But also take precautions to not to use it regularly and only when he has severe congestion.If he's not recovering in a day or two, and also if his fever is high grade, it is better to start him on antibiotics. I will recommend Syp. Amoxycillin 10 ml once daily ( not more than 250 mg for his age, normally it is 125 mg/5 ml ) for 5-7 days depending upon his severity. But persistent high grade fever will warrant a blood test to rule out malaria/typhoid e.t.c, which can be planned by your local GP. However, don't be alarmed unnecessarily. I feel its VIRAL URTI and it will be relieved on proper usage of medication. If you have vitamin c tablets, you can give him one per day. It is helpful in cold.Hope this is helpful.Feel free to discuss further.Regards"},{"Patient":"My 15 year old son has a smooth hot rash that has just appeared on his leg.

As general measures, I would suggest your son to wear loose clothes, avoid sweating & apply cold packs when rash appears.

The next day he was stuffy so he took a childrens allegra, which helped. However, when he lays down to go to sleep he begins to cough and quickly it becomes an out of control cough which induces vomiting. Today he was fine all day except for the allergy symptoms, and at bedtime the coughing followed by vomiting. Ibelieve he has a post nasal drip he doesnt know how to cough up, hence the vomiting.

Steam inhalation 3-4 times/day2. Encourage him to drink plenty of warm water3. A mucolytic such as bromhexine or ambroxol or carbocystiene to relieve the secretions4.

A couple weeks ago we noticed a reaction towards the medicine and stopped immediately. With gym class and sports it is very difficult for her to breath and I m wondering if there are any more options","Doctor":"Hello.There are many options for childhood asthma. If your daughter is having moderate to severe asthma, I would suggest her to take daily controller medicines, which include montelukast, inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled combination drugs, and others.A good control of asthma will definitely allow gym class and sports activity to your daughter.So I would suggest to consult a pediatrician to make a good choice of controlled medicine for her and take it regularly.I would also suggest to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes, pollution, allergens, etc if possible.Wish her best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"My son is 5 .2 years old. He use to suffer from Wheezing frequently. He has been taking L Montus Kid for 1.5 years and now he has been switched to Montair tab 5 mg (to taper down the medicine). Also he is on inhalation - Foracort 100 for the same time, which is also in the tapering phase. Since the tapering has started since last week, he is feeling uneasy, sweats profusely and is also having a little cough. Could that be an effect of tapering? Is such long use of these drugs advisable? I continued as it did help him in his cough.","Doctor":"Hello.Increased wheezing & cough while tapering the controller medications (such as Montair & Foracort) may suggest either 1. it's not time for tapering or 2. tapering has been too rapid. or 3. there may be an intercurrent infection/trigger factor responsible for causing recurrence of cough & wheeze.So I would suggest you to discuss these factors with your pediatrician and modify the speed of tapering controller medications. Regarding your 2nd question, childhood asthma is a chronic condition and frequently requires such long term use. Every drug has side effects but with the doses that you have mentioned, I feel they are safe for long-term use if proper inhaler technique is used.One more important aspect of childhood asthma, please try to identify asthma triggers (such as smoke, dusts, cold temperatures etc) for your child and try to avoid them.I would also suggest to encourage him for breathing exercises which might be helpful in long run.Hope this solved your queries.Wish your sun the best of the health.Regards."},{"Patient":"my daughter is 25 weeks pregnant ,she is 39 about 16 stone,5ft 4in has asthma and felt unwell all the time with being breathless even using inhalers and feeling weak and sick ,tests at the hospital have come up with nothing,can you ? thanks from a worried mom.......","Doctor":"Hi,I had gone through your query and understand your concern.It seems that your daughter has poor asthma control.This is very important to have good asthma control during pregnancy since it may affect the child.If you could mention the name of the inhalers,it would help me to give you a precise suggestion.If I were the treating physician ,I would first confirm the diagnosis by objective test,check for triggers and follow up thoroughly for any abnormality related to pregnancy.Then I would I advise steroid inhaler twice daily and salbutamol inhaler as required for asthma and other medications if required.Since this is a prescription medicine ,so my opinion is :please consult with a respiratory medicine specialist to confirm the diagnosis and get treatment accordingly.Please do not worry.Asthma will be under good control with proper medication.Wish your daughter safe pregnancy."},{"Patient":"My son of 8YRS 6 MONTHS having asthmatic problem allergic to change in season, dust and cold is contineously coughing now almost 10 hrs.

After the death of my wife 6 months ago, I got a medium level depression (which I am treating with a daily intake of 1mg vitamin B12). I went to Morocco for work to change my mind. After about 6 weeks I got the flu there. Two brilliant local doctors confirmed to me that I had to take immediately an antibiotic because I supposedly had a pneumonia. I did it and promptly lost about 12kg in about one week, for lack of food intake possibility due to a totally blocked colon and suddenly strong stomach cramps and breathing problems. I returned quickly to Sweden where the emergency Dr. detected immediately asthma generated by a virus. I have managed to get completely rid of the asthma in the lungs since then.Now for the last 6 weeks about, my nose suffers from a strange problem. The problem started with a very strong liquid (non salty tasting) mucus discharge, followed by a total nose blockade. I tried Otrivin and similar products and Claritine with almost no effect.When coming home my nose is usually ok for the first 30 minutes. Afterwards the nose starts plugging until a total block of both nostrils. No mucus is running.

I am a Service Engr dealing with Photo copiers and Printers. During my work it is unavoidable to inhale the toner (dry ink powder) while cleaning the machine and in due course my nose was blocked and i used otrivin for five years twice a day (two puffs) to clear the passage. when i get cold the pain was unbearable. So 8 months back, I went to a ENT DOCTOR & He told that i was suffering from Medica Mentosa due to otrivin usage + Allergic rhinitis due to inhalation of toner and Polyps and I was operated. Now i am feeling good but if i happen to take a fresh copy of photostat copy in my hand or if i happen to read a news paper or book printed out of low quality ink i get a itching sensation in my nose. So i came to the conclusion that i am allergic to printing ink. Doctor, Can you suggest me a medicine that is free from big side effects? I am 40 years old put up at Chennai.","Doctor":"Hello sir,Welcome to HCM.I would suggest two options for you. As you have to deal with photocopiers & printers daily, you can take a combination tablet of antihistamine & montelukast daily. Another option is you can use intranasal corticosteroid spray daily.Side-effects will be least with the 1st option, but if you have severe nasal blockage/other symptoms, it will be good if you use intranasal corticosteroid spray for 2 weeks and then change to oral antihistamine-montelukast tablet.I suggest you not use decongestant nasal sprays (such as otrivin) unless you have severe blocked nose, and that too, not for more than 3 days.You can cover your nose and mouth with mask while dealing with photocopiers & printers. Please try to avoid dusts, smoke & pollution.Daily breathing exercises & pranayama will help you on a long run.Wish you best of the health.Regards,Dr Parin"},{"Patient":"hi doctor my 3 yrs old daughter suffering from asthma what is the proper medicine ? right now i am giving Budecort 100 & Levoline inhelar as per physicine prescribe is this safe for future? is this cure after acertain age ? age 3 yrs female weight -12 kg","Doctor":"Hi,I had gone through your query and understand your concern.Brief answer:Yes,these drugs are safe for asthma.Since the drugs are given in a very small quantity,the chance of developing adverse effects in future is very unlikely.Detailed answer:Asthma is a chronic inflammation of the airways.It never cures.But patient can remain symptoms free and lead a normal life if he/she takes medicine properly,avoid triggers and follow physician's advise properly.It is matter of hope that research shows around 50% of childhood asthma patients remain symptoms free and lead fully normal life without medications.So do not worry.Hope this answers your query.If you have additional queries ,please do not hesitate in writing us.Wish your daughter good health."},{"Patient":"Im 15 years old and i weigh about 150 pounds.

You may want add an anti histamine to this. They are usually available over the counter.Bronchitis may also be contributing to your coughing.

If so, how may I manage both shortness of breath and anxiety.Age: 37","Doctor":"Hi,I had gone through your query and understand your concern.No,this is unlikely to cause shortness of breath in asthma patient due to excessive asthalin use since asthalin acts by dilating airways and thereby relieves breathlessness.Rather excessive use of asthalin indicates that your asthma is not under good control.For asthma management,Physicians follow step care management.If I were the treating physician,I would check the diagnosis,inhaler technique,triggers and drug compliance first.If every thing is found alright,then I would think for stepping up like increasing the dose of steroid inhaler if required and other drugs according to asthma management guideline and clinical judgement.So my opinion is :Please consult with a respiratory medicine specialist to confirm the steps of asthma control and get treated accordingly.This is how you could manage shortness of breath and anxiety as well.Hope this answers your query.Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"Sir, i m a recently married women, since my marriage i m suffering from allergic asthma. i have discussed my disease several time with my family dr (a general physician) but i m not getting well.

Montelukast preparations- used as a maintenance therapy to relieve symptoms of asthma. This will also give protection from recurrent allergy.3.

If you must go, you should go armed with your asthma reliever puffer (salbutamol, albuterol etc..) - note that all puffers should be should be used through a spacer device or as a turbuhaler. It would also be a good idea to take an anti-histamine tablet. Loratidine usually does the trick and does not cause a lot of drowsiness.

While Z Pak (oral azithromycin) is indeed an antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial sinusitis - usually differentiated fro the above causes by the presence of high fever, severe pain behind the eyes, and thick greenish mucus - it would usually work. If it did not work for you, it is most likely that your symptoms were not caused by a bacteria. If you still have any of the signs of bacterial sinusitis (described above) you should see your doctor.

The best test would be a full blood examination including Hb, MCV, MCHC, RDW and serum ferritin levels. (Serum ferritin measure Iron stores)From these tests, you doctor will be able to tell if you are truly iron deficient. Iron supplements vary based on the amount of elemental iron the have in them. The more iron, the stronger the effect and the stronger the side effects (constipation etc..). If you have multiple allergies I would go for a pharmaceutical iron preparation as opposed to a \\"natural\\" Iron remedy. One last thing - the weight loss is pretty severe and its hard to blame allergies or iron deficiency.

Im curious if I possibly have lung cancer (mom died of pancreatic cancer about a year ago and ive been paranoid ever since) or if its just a muscle spasm or something that should go away relatively soon?","Doctor":"Young, tall, healthy men who have smoked are at risk for a spontaneous pneumothorax. This is when the lung sacks just \\"burst\\" and leak a little air into the surrounding cavity. This is a common cause of the type of pain you are describing. You would need to be examined (and possibly X-rayed) to rule this out. Cancer in you case would be EXTREMELY unlikely. If you don't have a pneumothorax, then the most likely cause of your pain, as you suggest would be muscle spasm or an inflammation of the lining of the lung - pleurisy. Also, a rare but important cause of shoulder tip pain is pressure on the diaphragm. If you took a hit in hockey you could potentially have a small bleed in the liver or spleen can be \\"felt\\" in the shoulder tip.

Anti-histamines are not really part of the initial treatment of asthma although there are some people with clear allergy-induced asthma who do get some benefit. Steroids taken by mouth are usually only for asthma \\"attacks\\". If you are feeling tight then it would also be reasonable to take a reliever (B2 agonist - salbutamol, albuterol) inhaler as necessary for temporary relief until you get the symptoms under better control. Remember that using a spacer with a \\"puffer\\" metered dose inhaler is crucial to ensure effectiveness. (or alternatively a dry powder \\"turbuhaler\\" is also acceptable).

Now i am taking HOMIOPATHy treatment form 1 year so that doctor suggest me to take ASTHELLIN rotacap. NOW plz TEL me which one is the better option","Doctor":"Hi,I had gone through your query and understand your concern.If I were in your situation(not as a medical graduate),I might have done the same.Being a graduate in modern medicine (allopathic),it is tough to comment on Homeopathy.But I can give you a clarification about why you should rely on modern medicine for the proper treatment of asthma.Modern medicine has improved to such level that one can have good asthma control if he /she follows physician's/specialist' advice properly and follow up at regular interval.Even he/she may remain symptoms free without medicine.Asthelin inhaler relieves your acute attack where as Forocort(steroid preparation) 200 inhaler prevents as well as control further attack of asthma.Since you took forocort via inhalation, only a very small amount of drug (less than 1 mg) enters into your body.So the change of developing adverse effects like weight gain,gastric ulcer pain etc are very unlikely.You might have other associated causes for weight gain like food habit,sedentary work etc.Moreover,steroid is sometimes used as pain reliever.So my suggestion is : consult with a respiratory medicine specialist to confirm the step of asthma control and get treated accordingly.Hope this helps you.Now the decision is your.Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"I have a allergy all over my body.

Infections and any associated fever can cause the pulse to increase.An infection would also contribute to your dizzy and tired sensations.You may need a course of antibiotics if the infection is thought to be bacterial.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hello, yesterday I had a piece of angel cake and everything was fine... a couple of hours later.. my arms and legs started itching.. so I took a hot shower.

Special pillow and mattress covers would help to reduce dust exposure as well.Since it is difficult to eliminate exposure to dust completely then you may need to continue on at least some of your medications.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Ive got these little dots all over my body, but especially on my hands, arms, ankles, insides of upper legs and shoulders.

Another reason can be recurrent colitis or GERD. I would advise you the following:-Upper GI Endoscopy as you have burning pain, it is recurrent.-CT scan of the chest and abdomen as sometimes there are hidden problems which can be detected only on CT .-MRI of the spine- as the disc prolapse can cause you such weird problems.Once the diagnosis is made, treatment is easy."},{"Patient":"i am allergic to dust and few fragrance so i have running nose all the time when i am  exposed to dust but during night the excess formation of mucas flows down my lungs and blocks the passage of air .. if i take a seroflo roto cap  i get relif but  i fell heavy and constipatio","Doctor":"hi,first of all you should avoid exposure to dust, smoke, cold air and even house dust as these may aggravate your problems.you should go for total and differential count of wbc  to rule out eosinophilia, you should also go for pulmonary function test, echocardiography, chest x ray to assess your cardiopulmonary status.you should start taking some anti histaminic like levocetrizine  , you can also take montelukast or sodium cromoglycate or even some oral steroids like dexamethasone , combination of these drugs is taken for better result for which you should meet a physician. you should take some hot drink like green tea or hot milk. start doing some regular exercises , aerobics and some pulmonary exercise, drink enough of water every day say about 10 glass to keep your muco cilliary action intact.if required then antibiotics can be taken in acute condition.you can also take some food supplements containing antioxidant like flavonoids in long term basis .thanks for consulting HCM."},{"Patient":"hello doctor, my name is cindy 36 yrs old,,50 kgs. about 5' height..,ive been coughing for 3 weeks now,,difficult breathing,,and recently hard to swallow,,throat is not painful nor swollen but my epiglottis seem to be sticking out and i can feel it when i swallow,,could i be allergic to something? please help..thank u in advance,,","Doctor":"Hi,This can be due to allergy or also due to upper respiratrory tract infection.

Although hepatitis A doesn't lead to chronicity, but incomplete recovery or reinfection cannot be ruled out. You should get a ct scan of abdomen to check around the hepatobiliary system as well as repeat all the liver function tests required for evaluation.

Fever and bumps, should be well examined  to check for any abscesses. If present, anti biotics specific against staphylococci would be most appropriate.

Moreover very little amount of steroid  is absorbed as it is used via inhalation.Therefore its side effect is almost negligible except  candidiasis.That is why your child is advised to gurgle his mouth with plain water after taking puffs which will prevent candidiasis.I presume that a diagnosis of probable asthma has been made and given proper medicine accordingly.Hope this answers your query.Wishing your son good health."},{"Patient":"Hello, My husband, Ron Vetere, is 67 yrs. old.

If your abdominal cramps are persistent, get an USG abdomen done and tell your problems to a surgeon. However, if by no arousal you meant no erection, it could call upon further investigation into your case. Specify if you have got any urinary symptoms occuring, like pain, frequency or burning sensation during urination. If yes, get an urinalysis done also."},{"Patient":"sir I have Khansi problem with chest pain from last two months. i used all syrup for khansi but i did not get any relief please sir suggest me good medicine for that . second is continuously sneezing 5 to 6 times with allergy my eyes also got allergic i take medicine two times from government hospital when i eat this i got relief if i leave it same problem remaining. please sir suggest to me good medicine for that","Doctor":"Thanks for your questions.I feel your inconvenience for these continuous cough and allergy.If I were your treating physician,I would look for details history like>Cough : Productive or not?>Smoking habit, > Allergy : dust,cold or any other particular allergens,> History of fever,>Breathlessness etc.Then I would perform some physical examinations specially your chest.Since you have been suffering from cough despite of having syrup  for  2  months,I may advice few laboratory investigations.After confirming diagnosis I would suggest medications.> For your second query: You may try to find out the cause of your allergy yourself like dust,certain food,occupational environment etc.Then try to avoid those conditions first.Use anti allergic medications if required as per your physician's advice.So my opinion is : Consult with a respiratory medicine specialist.Take care and get well soon :)"},{"Patient":"Hi.

Symptomatic treatment with anti histaminics, anti inflammatory drugs and analgesics could be sufficient, including some cough syrups in case the cough is of viral origin. Bacterial infections cause more severe illness. more fever, and pus like mucous.

These mimic heart attack and hence it is very important to rule out the heart problem. Get EKG, Eco -cardiography, stress test done if possible under the care of the Cardiologist. Get a Ct scan of the chest and upper abdomen to see for the lungs or colon problems. Severe colitis, diverticulitis too cause the similar problem of sudden pain, sweating and shaking.

But if allergen is uavoidable or allergen is unknown than we should consult allergy specialist for skin test to find out the list of allergen and after that treatment is done by desensatization of body by suitable vaccines.Your second query is for your sinusitis, for this I would like to say these sinus inflammation may be Allergic / infective. Sometimes there are some other nasal conditions like deviated nasal septum / septal spur / polyps / hypertrophied turbinates etc which are responsible for recurrent sinusitis. Therefore please consult your ENT doctor who will thoroughly diagnose the real defect which may be accordingly plan for treatment.I hope your query is answered.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, I m 24 years old male, having frequent wheezing attacks and sometimes severe if not treated at the early stages. I have been using Ascoril cough syrup for the past few years, which doesn t help to relieve most of the attacks. Also, i was afraid i could get addicted to puffs/inhalers so never had them. I was given with one of the three (budecort, Duolin & Asthalin respules) or sometimes a combination of two (budecort & Duolin) to relieve the breathe trouble. There were times i had taken medicine through vein injection as well. Per my observation, the causes were due to change in temparature, improper resting position when asleep. I have often experienced block when i try to do even a very little amount of work after food. Does this mean, i should eat less or shoudn t engage in any activities after food? As this has become frequent and doesn t seem to stop, is it okay to use an inhaler for permanent cure?","Doctor":"HiThank you for asking HCM.I have gone through your query.It is better to use inhaled drugs like duolin or asthalin which is a sympathomimetic and budecort which is a corticosteroid.Inhaled drugs will have very less systemic effects.The dose and frequency should be adjusted by your treating doctor.You will get a good remission with it.Then the dose can be titrated to low or can stop.You should recognise and avoid allergic causing agents also.But if you are not able to do so then an antihistamine and leukotriene receptor antagonist can be continued.Hope this may help you.Let me know if you have any further query."},{"Patient":"my son has eczema since he was 1 year old now he is 3 years n 4 months usually eczema shows during Nov 2 april and its like red circles on left n right limb and on right arm ND NOW My twin daughters have on off diarrhea with runny nose and rash on face do they all have some kind of allergy","Doctor":"hi, yes these symptoms may be due to allergy to some component of the food, as there is family history of atopy so there is maximum possibilities of these. these symptoms are also seen in niacin deficiensy but here these are most likely related to allergy. these can be due to henoch shonlein purpura .to diagnose the disease properly yo should go for total and differential count of WBC, platelets count, ESR, serum IgA level, C reactive protein , prothrombin time and bleeding time and also stool examination for occult blood. then you should meet a child specialist for its correlation , diagnosis and proper management."},{"Patient":"Hi I've woken upto a swollen face arms abdomen & legs.

The cold can sometimes be associated with an infection of the ear as well.Infections involving the respiratory tract can cause bleeding due to inflammation of the respiratory tract and this is the reason that you would have seen the blood on coughing.In terms of the blood in the ear, this is most commonly related to trauma or infection.

These can be in the form of blood tests or skin tests.If the source is not known or you cannot avoid it then the allergy would continue and you would need to continue the antihistamines.Though cetrizine is non drowsy some persons become sleepy with these medications.
