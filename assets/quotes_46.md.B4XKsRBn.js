This allows us to express terms of the sequence in terms of q and known values. Given that a_{6}=2, we can find expressions for a_{7}, a_{5}, and a_{9} as follows:- For a_{7}, since it's the next term after a_{6} in a geometric sequence, it can be expressed as a_{7}=a_{6}q=2q.- For a_{5}, being the term before a_{6}, it is found by dividing a_{6} by q, thus a_{5}=frac{a_{6}}{q}=frac{2}{q}.- For a_{9}, two terms after a_{6}, it is a_{6}q^3=2q^3.Given that a_{7}, a_{5}, and a_{9} form an arithmetic sequence, we use the property of arithmetic sequences where the sum of the first and last terms is twice the middle term, leading to the equation a_{7}+a_{9}=2a_{5}. Substituting the expressions for a_{7}, a_{5}, and a_{9}, we get:[2q + 2q^3 = frac{4}{q}]This simplifies to a quartic equation in terms of q:[q^4 + q^2 - 2 = 0]Factoring this equation, we find:[(q^2 + 2)(q^2 - 1) = 0]This gives us two possible sets of solutions for q^2, where q^2 = -2 or q^2 = 1. Since q^2 cannot be negative in this context (as we're dealing with real numbers), we conclude that q^2 = 1.Knowing q^2 = 1, we can find a_{4}, which is one term before a_{5}, thus requiring us to divide a_{6} by q^2.

Check possible combinations:   - For triangle ABC:     - Let AC = x and BC = y.     - The inequalities are:       [       AB + AC > BC implies 41 + x > y       ]       [       AB + BC > AC implies 41 + y > x       ]       [       AC + BC > AB implies x + y > 41       ]   - For triangle ABD:     - Let AD = z and BD = w.     - The inequalities are:       [       AB + AD > BD implies 41 + z > w       ]       [       AB + BD > AD implies 41 + w > z       ]       [       AD + BD > AB implies z + w > 41       ]   - For triangle ACD:     - Let AC = x and AD = z.     - The inequalities are:       [       AC + AD > CD implies x + z > CD       ]       [       AC + CD > AD implies x + CD > z       ]       [       AD + CD > AC implies z + CD > x       ]5. Trial and error with the remaining edges:   - We need to find a combination of x, y, z, w, and CD such that all the inequalities are satisfied.   - After trying different combinations, we find that:     - If AC = 36, AD = 27, BC = 18, BD = 7, and CD = 13, all the inequalities are satisfied.6.

Let M_n denote the smallest possible value of (AP^n + BP^n + CP^n)^{frac{1}{n}} over all points P in the plane. Find lim_{n to infty} M_n.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We are given a triangle (ABC) with side lengths (AB = 13), (BC = 14), and (AC = 15). We need to find the limit of (M_n) as (n) approaches infinity, where (M_n) is the smallest possible value of ((AP^n + BP^n + CP^n)^{frac{1}{n}}) over all points (P) in the plane.2. Using the Erdős–Mordell Inequality:   The Erdős–Mordell inequality states that for any point (P) inside a triangle (ABC), the sum of the distances from (P) to the sides of the triangle is less than or equal to half the perimeter of the triangle. However, this inequality does not directly help us with the given problem.3. Considering the Limit as (n to infty):   As (n) approaches infinity, the expression ((AP^n + BP^n + CP^n)^{frac{1}{n}}) is dominated by the largest of the distances (AP), (BP), and (CP). Therefore, we need to minimize the maximum distance from (P) to the vertices (A), (B), and (C).4. Finding the Fermat Point:   The point (P) that minimizes the sum of distances to the vertices of a triangle is known as the Fermat point (or Torricelli point). For a triangle with all angles less than (120^circ), the Fermat point is the point such that the total distance from (P) to the vertices is minimized.5. Calculating the Circumradius:   The circumradius (R) of a triangle with sides (a), (b), and (c) can be calculated using the formula:   [   R = frac{abc}{4K}   ]   where (K) is the area of the triangle. Using Heron's formula, the area (K) is:   [   s = frac{a + b + c}{2} = frac{13 + 14 + 15}{2} = 21   ]   [   K = sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = sqrt{21 cdot (21-13) cdot (21-14) cdot (21-15)} = sqrt{21 cdot 8 cdot 7 cdot 6} = sqrt{7056} = 84   ]   Therefore, the circumradius (R) is:   [   R = frac{13 cdot 14 cdot 15}{4 cdot 84} = frac{2730}{336} = 8.125   ]6.

(Two cells are adjacent if they share an edge or a vertex.)","solution":"If n=1, then the table can only be filled out in one way, and if n=2, then any filling is obviously correct. This represents 4! = 24 possibilities if we distinguish between fillings that can be transformed into each other by rotation and reflection, and 24 / 8 = 3 otherwise. In the following, we will deal with the case n geq 3.1987-12-440-1. eps1.a figure1987-12-440-2. eps1 . b figureFigure 1/a shows a valid filling for the case n=5. In figure 1/b, the differences are visible for the four possible types of adjacency. The lower left and upper right corner cells have no diagonal neighbor, so the numbers here can be swapped with the ones next to them. We claim that there is no essentially different filling from the four obtained this way, that is, by reflection and rotation, every solution can be transformed into one of the above four.Consider a valid filling, and let D=n+1. If d(x, y) denotes the length of the shortest path between the cells x and y through adjacent cells (i.e., as a king moves on a chessboard), then obviously 1 leq d(x, y) leq n-1, and from the filling, we get thatd(x, y) geq frac{|x-y|}{D}If equality holds for two cells in (1), then moving from x to y along the shortest path ( xn-2, quad text { i.e. } quad dleft(n^{2}-1,1right)=n-1thus n^{2}-1 is in the last row or the last column. We can assume that the first case is true, i.e., n^{2}-1 is in the last row.Now we will prove by complete induction on i thatA) if (i-1) n+1 leq x leq i cdot n, then x is in the i-th row and stands relative to the diagonal element, a_{i}, before or after it, depending on whether it is smaller or larger than a_{i}, as can be seen in the filling of figure 1.For i=1, this means that if x leq n, then x is in the first row. Sincedleft(n^{2}-1, xright) geq frac{n^{2}-1-x}{n+1} geq frac{n^{2}-n-1}{n+1}>n-2therefore dleft(n^{2}-1, xright)=n-1, and similarly we get that dleft(n^{2}, xright)=n-1. Thus, from two different cells of the bottom row, there is no path shorter than (n-1) to x, so it is indeed in the first row.Now let 11, so by the property of the rigid diagonal, the statement also holds for i. This proves statement B) as well.Finally, if i=n-1, then it is also true that the maximum element in the second row, M_{2}=2 n, is in the last cell. Then, however, d(n-1,2 n)=1, so we can only state that the cells of n-1 and 2 n are adjacent, so in the first row, n-1 is in the second-to-last or the last cell.Using the main diagonals starting from the cells of the bottom row, it can similarly be proven that the filling of the diagonals below the longest main diagonal can only be as shown in figure 1 (of course, it is possible to swap the first two elements of the last row). This completes our proof, indeed there is only the given type of solution to the problem.By reflection and rotation, 8 solutions can be made from each of the four solutions, so if we distinguish these as well, then for n>2, there are 32 different valid fillings for the table."},{"problem":"Fábio needs to obtain exactly four liters of water.

In this case, the slicing plane is parallel to an element of the cone, which is known to form a parabolic section according to the definition of conic sections.- When α < θ, the pattern on the floor will be one branch of a hyperbola, as the angle between the slicing plane and the cone's axis is such that it creates a hyperbolic section.Therefore, the correct answer is:[boxed{D}]"},{"problem":"Divide the natural numbers from 1 to 2010 into groups, such that the greatest common divisor of any three numbers within each group is 1.

Among the 2010 numbers, there are 1005 even numbers. According to the condition, it's clear that if we are to group them, each group can contain at most 2 even numbers. Therefore, at least frac{1005}{2} = 502 remainder 1 groups are needed, which means 503 groups are required. Next, we verify whether 503 groups indeed satisfy the condition as the minimum number of groups. Evidently, it does. We can divide the even numbers into groups as follows: (2), (2×2, 2×3), (2×4, 2×5), (2×6, 2×7), ..., (2×1004, 2×1005). In these 503 groups, after removing the common divisor 2, the remaining numbers are coprime (since they are consecutive).

We are interested in finding the probability of drawing at least one blue ball from Box A, which can be represented as event A. This event includes the cases where either one or two blue balls are drawn, thus A = A_{1} cup A_{2}, and since A_{1} and A_{2} are mutually exclusive events, we can add their probabilities to find P(A).- The probability of drawing exactly one blue ball (A_{1}) involves choosing 1 blue ball out of 4 and 1 red ball out of 2. The total ways to draw 2 balls out of 6 is the denominator:  P(A_{1}) = frac{{C}_{4}^{1}{C}_{2}^{1}}{{C}_{6}^{2}}- The probability of drawing exactly two blue balls (A_{2}) involves choosing 2 blue balls out of 4. No red balls are chosen in this case:  P(A_{2}) = frac{{C}_{4}^{2}{C}_{2}^{0}}{{C}_{6}^{2}}Combining these probabilities gives us the total probability of drawing at least one blue ball from Box A:P(A) = P(A_{1}) + P(A_{2}) = frac{{C}_{4}^{1}{C}_{2}^{1}}{{C}_{6}^{2}} + frac{{C}_{4}^{2}{C}_{2}^{0}}{{C}_{6}^{2}} = frac{14}{15}Therefore, the probability of drawing at least one blue ball from Box A is boxed{frac{14}{15}}.# Part (2): Probability of Drawing a Blue Ball from Box BLet B be the event of drawing a blue ball from Box B. The probability of B happening depends on the outcome of the transfer from Box A to Box B. We consider all possible outcomes of transferring balls from Box A to Box B and their impact on drawing a blue ball from Box B:- P(B) = P(A_{0})P(B|A_{0}) + P(A_{1})P(B|A_{1}) + P(A_{2})P(B|A_{2})Calculating each term:- P(A_{0})P(B|A_{0}) is the probability of drawing 0 blue balls from Box A and then drawing a blue ball from Box B. After transferring 2 red balls, Box B will have 3 blue balls out of 8:  frac{{C}_{4}^{0}{C}_{2}^{2}}{{C}_{6}^{2}} times frac{{C}_{3}^{1}}{{C}_{8}^{1}}- P(A_{1})P(B|A_{1}) is the probability of drawing 1 blue ball from Box A and then drawing a blue ball from Box B.

In the case of the most frequent schedule, the 12-minute wait could have occurred if Jancsi ran in just as a train was leaving, waited for five trains, lingered a bit longer - perhaps Juliska was sick that day - and left before the sixth train arrived. Thus,[begin{aligned}& 4d leq 12 < 6d, text{ from which } & 2 < d leq 3end{aligned}]On the other occasion, however, Juliska arrived at the end of the 20th minute, so depending on whether Jancsi started waiting at the same time as he observed the arrival of a train or just as a train was leaving,[6d leq 20 leq 7d]which gives[frac{20}{7} < d leq frac{10}{3}]Combining the obtained conditions, we get for the frequency of the trains that[frac{20}{7} < d leq 3]During the 30-minute wait, Jancsi could have observed the arrival of at least 10 and at most 11 trains. More than 11 trains would have required observing for at least 11d minutes, which is certainly more than 220/7 minutes, and conversely, fewer than 10 trains could only have been observed arriving in less than 10d - and thus certainly less than 30 minutes.Both scenarios are possible, for example, if d=2.9 minutes, which is just feasible. If Jancsi arrived 0.1 minutes after a departing train, then the tenth train arrived 2.8 + 9 cdot 2.9 minutes later, Jancsi waited 1.1 minutes, and then left with or without Juliska. If, however, Jancsi arrived at the station 1 minute before a train, and Juliska arrived with the 11th metro, then during his half-hour wait, Jancsi could have observed exactly eleven trains arriving."},{"problem":"3.

This straight line does not slope and is tangent at the point where x=2 intersects the circle.- Case 2: Slope ExistsAssume the slope of the tangent line exists. Then, let the equation of the tangent line be y = k(x - 2) + 1, where k is the slope of the line.The distance d from the center of the circle (0,0) to the tangent line is given by the formula d = frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + c|}{sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}, where ax + by + c = 0 is the general form of the line equation and (x_0, y_0) is a point through which the line passes. For our line, a = k, b = -1, and c = 1 - 2k, and (x_0, y_0) = (0,0), the center of the circle.Thus, the distance d from the center of the circle to the tangent line can be calculated as d = frac{|2k - 1|}{sqrt{1 + k^2}} = 2 (since the radius of the circle is 2). Solving this equation for k, we find k = -frac{3}{4}.Therefore, the equation of the tangent line, substituting k = -frac{3}{4} into y = k(x - 2) + 1, simplifies to 3x + 4y - 10 = 0.- Conclusion for Part (1)The equation of the tangent line l can either be x=2 or 3x + 4y - 10 = 0.

We will consider all cases in which this can be achieved.First case: all four chosen numbers are divisible by 3.Then the four numbers are chosen from the set {3, 6, 9, 12, 15}. From 5 different numbers, we can choose 4 different numbers in 5 ways (since we are choosing one that we will not take).Second case: all four chosen numbers give a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.Then the four numbers are chosen from the set {1, 4, 7, 10, 13}.

Line segments EF and GH divide rectangle ABCD into four smaller rectangles.There must be a smaller rectangle, let's assume it is AEOG (including the boundary, as below), which contains at least two of the given 5 points. Let points M and N be in the smaller rectangle AEOG, as shown in Figure (1).(1) If rectangle OHCF contains no more than 1 of the known points, consider any known point X not in rectangle OHCF and different from M and N.It is easy to see that the triplet (M, N, X) is either in rectangle ABHG or in rectangle AEFD.By the lemma, (M, N, X) is a good group. Since there are at least two such points X, there are at least two good groups.(2) If rectangle OHCF contains at least 2 known points, let the known points P and Q be in rectangle OHCF, and consider the remaining known point R.If R is in rectangle OFDG, then the triplet (M, N, R) is in rectangle AEFD, and the triplet (P, Q, R) is in rectangle GHCD, thus they are both good groups, so there are at least two good groups.Similarly, if point R is in rectangle EBHO, there are also at least two good groups.If point R is in rectangle OHCF or rectangle AEOG, let point R be in rectangle OHCF. We will examine the convex hull of the 5 known points M, N, P, Q, R, which must be within the convex hexagon AEHCFG, as shown in Figure (2).And S_{AEHCFG}=1-frac{1}{8}-frac{1}{8}=frac{3}{4}.We will now consider three cases:i) If the convex hull of M, N, P, Q, R is a convex pentagon, let it be MNPQR, as shown in Figure (3).In this case, S_{triangle MQR} + S_{triangle MNQ} + S_{triangle NPQ} leq frac{3}{4}.Thus, at least one of (M, Q, R), (M, N, Q), and (N, P, Q) is a good group.Since (P, Q, R) is in rectangle OHCF, it is certainly a good group, so there are at least two good groups.ii) If the convex hull of M, N, P, Q, R is a convex quadrilateral, let it be A_1A_2A_3A_4, and the other known point be A_5.As shown in Figure (4), where A_i in {M, N, P, Q, R} (i=1,2,3,4,5).Connecting A_5A_i (i=1,2,3,4), we have S_{triangle A_1A_2A_5} + S_{triangle A_2A_3A_5} + S_{triangle A_3A_4A_5} + S_{triangle A_4A_1A_5} = S_{triangle A_1A_2A_3A_4} leq frac{3}{4}.Thus, at least two of (A_1, A_2, A_5), (A_2, A_3, A_5), (A_3, A_4, A_5), and (A_4, A_1, A_5) are good groups.iii) If the convex hull of M, N, P, Q, R is a triangle, let it be triangle A_1A_2A_3, and the other two known points be A_4, A_5, as shown in Figure (5), where A_i in {M, N, P, Q, R} (i=1,2,3,4,5), connecting A_4A_i (i=1,2,3), we haveS_{triangle A_1A_2A_4} + S_{triangle A_2A_3A_4} + S_{triangle A_3A_1A_4} = S_{triangle A_1A_2A_3} leq frac{3}{4}.Thus, at least one of (A_1, A_2, A_4), (A_2, A_3, A_4), and (A_3, A_1, A_4) is a good group.Similarly, A_5 also forms a good group with two of A_1, A_2, A_3, so there are at least two good groups in this case.In summary, regardless of the situation, there are at least two good groups among the 5 known points.Next, we provide an example to show that the number of good groups can be exactly two.On the side AD of rectangle ABCD, take a point M, and on the side AB, take a point N, such that AN:NB = AM:MD = 2:3, as shown in Figure (6). Then, among the 5 points M, N, B, C, D, there are exactly two good groups.In fact, (B, C, D) is clearly not a good group.

Prime factorization constraints: Since the LCM of any three numbers must be (3^r cdot 7^s), each number (a, b, c, d) can be written in the form (3^{x_i} cdot 7^{y_i}) where (0 leq x_i leq r) and (0 leq y_i leq s).3. 3-adic valuation: For the LCM of any three numbers to be (3^r), at least two of the numbers must have a 3-adic valuation of (r). The third number can have a 3-adic valuation less than or equal to (r).4. Counting 3-adic valuations:    - We need to count the number of ways to assign 3-adic valuations to (a, b, c, d) such that the LCM of any three of them is (3^r).    - Let (v_3(a) = x_1), (v_3(b) = x_2), (v_3(c) = x_3), and (v_3(d) = x_4).    - We need at least two of (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) to be equal to (r), and the rest to be less than or equal to (r).5. Casework for 3-adic valuations:    - Case 1: Three numbers have 3-adic valuation (r) and one number has a 3-adic valuation less than (r). There are (binom{4}{3} = 4) ways to choose which three numbers have valuation (r), and (r) choices for the remaining number. This gives (4r) combinations.    - Case 2: Two numbers have 3-adic valuation (r) and the other two have valuations less than (r). There are (binom{4}{2} = 6) ways to choose which two numbers have valuation (r), and (r^2) choices for the remaining two numbers. This gives (6r^2) combinations.    - Case 3: All four numbers have 3-adic valuation less than (r). There is only 1 way to choose this, and (r^3) choices for the numbers.

Applying Legendre's formula:   According to Legendre's formula, the 2-adic valuation of (2^k)! is given by:   [   nu_2((2^k)!) = 2^k - S_2(2^k)   ]   where S_2(2^k) is the sum of the digits in the binary representation of 2^k. Since 2^k is a power of 2, its binary representation is a single 1 followed by k zeros, so S_2(2^k) = 1. Therefore:   [   nu_2((2^k)!) = 2^k - 1   ]3. Equating the 2-adic valuations:   On the right-hand side, we have:   [   nu_2(2^n cdot m) = nu_2(2^n) + nu_2(m) = n + nu_2(m)   ]   Since nu_2((2^k)!) = 2^k - 1, we get:   [   2^k - 1 = n + nu_2(m)   ]4.

If we write x instead of the \\"3\\" under the inner square roots, our expressions become functions of x:y_{1}=sqrt{2}+sqrt{2-sqrt{x}}-sqrt{2+sqrt{x}}, quad y_{2}=sqrt{6}-sqrt{2-sqrt{x}}-sqrt{2+sqrt{x}}Their values at x=0 and x=4 can be easily obtained. We find that at the former, y_{1} is positive and y_{2} is negative, and at the latter, it is the opposite, i.e., in the graph of both functions, the points corresponding to x=0 and x=4 are on opposite sides of the X-axis. It is natural to think that y_{1} and y_{2} vary continuously, so between x=0 and x=4 they take on every value between the two found values (and possibly others), including 0. (Intuitively: their graph is a continuous line, and thus it intersects the X-axis somewhere.) If we knew that y_{1} and y_{2} take the value 0 only once between x=0 and x=4, then this value of x would divide the interval from 0 to 4 into two parts, in one of which the function is positive, and in the other, negative, so its sign can be easily determined. By finding which x values satisfy y_{1}=0 and y_{2}=0 (i.e., solving these two equations for x), we find that for both functions, only the point x=3 can be considered. Here, the value of our functions is precisely the given two expressions. If, therefore, our assumption about the continuity of the functions is correct, then for x=3, y_{1}=0 and y_{2}=0.However, the correctness of this reasoning can only be demonstrated with deeper concepts and knowledge than those taught in high school.

Thus, (angle CBH = angle CMH).   - Since the line (AN) is the tangent to the circle (k) at the point (N), by the tangent-chordal angle theorem, (angle (CN; AD) = angle CMN).

Simplify the equation:   [   2x + 2y + 2z + 3 = 25   ]4. Subtract 3 from both sides:   [   2x + 2y + 2z = 22   ]5. Divide the entire equation by 2:   [   x + y + z = 11   ]6. We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation (x + y + z = 11). This is a classic problem of finding the number of solutions to an equation in the form of (x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_k = n), which can be solved using the \\"stars and bars\\" theorem.7. According to the \\"stars and bars\\" theorem, the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation (x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_k = n) is given by:   [   binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}   ]   Here, (n = 11) and (k = 3) (since we have three variables (x, y, z)).8. Substitute (n = 11) and (k = 3) into the formula:   [   binom{11 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = binom{13}{2}   ]9. Calculate (binom{13}{2}):   [   binom{13}{2} = frac{13 times 12}{2 times 1} = 78   ]Conclusion:The number of ordered triples ((a, b, c)) of odd positive integers that satisfy (a + b + c = 25) is (boxed{78})."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x) = x^{2-m} is defined on the interval [-3-m, m^2-m] and is an odd function, then f(m) =  ?","solution":"Since it is given, we must have m^2 - m = 3 + m, which simplifies to m^2 - 2m - 3 = 0. Therefore, m = 3 or m = -1.- When m = 3, the function becomes f(x) = x^{-1}, and x in [-6, 6]. Therefore, f(x) is undefined at x = 0, so we discard this case.- When m = -1, the function becomes f(x) = x^3, and at this time x in [-2, 2]. Therefore, f(m) = f(-1) = (-1)^3 = -1.In conclusion, f(m) = -1.Thus, the answer is boxed{-1}.Analysis: Since the domain of an odd function must be symmetric about the origin, we can deduce that m^2 - m = 3 + m. By solving for the value of m and substituting it back into the conditions, we can arrive at the conclusion."},{"problem":"Let's construct a triangle, given its perimeter, and the radii of two of its excircles.","solution":"I. Solution. Consider the problem as solved. The excircle of triangle ABC opposite to side BC touches the sides of the triangle at points D, F, E, and the excircle opposite to side AC touches this side at point G (Figure 1).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_4f43ef06636ad8220e47g-1.jpg?height=594&width=629&top_left_y=305&top_left_x=737)We know that the two tangent segments from an external point to a circle are equal, so BD = BE and CD = CF; therefore, the lengths of segments AE = AB + BE and AF = AC + CF are equal to the perimeter of triangle ABC. But AE = AF, so the length of each of these segments is equal to the semiperimeter of the triangle, s. Using this, we can complete the construction:We take a circle with radius r_a and arbitrarily choose point F on its circumference. We construct the tangent to the circle at F and measure the distance FA = s, which is given. Then, from A, we construct the other tangent to the circle (which is the line of the side AB of the triangle). The other excircle touches the lines AF and AB, and its radius is given, so we can construct this circle as well. (The center of the circle lies on the external angle bisector of angle FAB and on the line parallel to AB at a distance r_b from it.) Finally, we get the line BC by constructing the common internal tangent of the two circles different from AF. (The construction of a common tangent of two circles can be found, for example, in the problem 633 of the Collection of Geometric Problems I.) From the above, it follows that the constructed triangle ABC has one of its excircles with radius r_a, another excircle with radius r_b, and its perimeter is 2AF = 2s, so the triangle meets the requirements.The construction can be carried out precisely when point G is an interior point of segment AF. In this case, there is 1 solution; otherwise, there is no solution. (In the second solution, we show that G is precisely an interior point of segment AF if r_a cdot r_b < s^2. Since operatorname{tg} frac{alpha}{2} = frac{r_a}{s}, operatorname{tg} frac{beta}{2} = frac{r_b}{s},operatorname{tg}left(frac{alpha}{2} + frac{beta}{2}right) = frac{operatorname{tg} frac{alpha}{2} + operatorname{tg} frac{beta}{2}}{1 - operatorname{tg} frac{alpha}{2} cdot operatorname{tg} frac{beta}{2}} = frac{frac{r_a}{s} + frac{r_b}{s}}{1 - frac{r_a cdot r_b}{s^2}}This fraction is positive if its denominator is positive, so the triangle to be constructed exists precisely when s^2 > r_a cdot r_b.

Since (a) is a digit and we want the smallest such number, we can start by assuming (a = 1). This simplifies our problem to finding the smallest (n) such that:   [   frac{10^{n+1} - 1}{9} equiv 0 pmod{13}   ]   This is equivalent to:   [   10^{n+1} - 1 equiv 0 pmod{13}   ]   or   [   10^{n+1} equiv 1 pmod{13}   ]3. To solve (10^{n+1} equiv 1 pmod{13}), we need to find the order of 10 modulo 13. The order of an integer (a) modulo (n) is the smallest positive integer (k) such that (a^k equiv 1 pmod{n}).4.

Note that (overline{b a b} - overline{a b b} = 90(b - a)) is divisible by this GCD. Divisibility by 2 and 5 is determined by the last digit, which is (b), and it cannot be zero, so the GCD cannot be both even and divisible by 5.(|a - b| leqslant 8), so if the GCD is not divisible by 3, it cannot be greater than (2|a - b| leqslant 16) or (5|a - b| leqslant 40) depending on the case we are considering.Therefore, for the GCD to be greater than 45, it must be divisible by 3, and thus the original numbers must be divisible by 3.For the number (overline{b a b}) to be divisible by 3, the numbers (a) and (b) must give the same remainder when divided by 3. Thus, (|a - b|) can take the values 3 or 6, and consequently, the GCD must be a divisor of the number (540 = 3^3 cdot 2^2 cdot 5), and it still cannot contain both 2 and 5 simultaneously. If we are interested in a GCD greater than 45, it must be divisible by 9, and more specifically, by 27. This means the number (overline{b a b}) must be divisible by 9. When this condition is met, the digit (a) almost uniquely determines the digit (b) according to the divisibility rule for 9.Thus, for (overline{b a b}), it makes sense to consider only the numbers 171, 252, 333, 414, 585, 666, 747, 828, 909, and 999 (some of which do not fit because (a neq b), for example, 999). The remaining numbers form two arithmetic progressions with a common difference of 81 each. Since 81 is divisible by 27, it is sufficient to check that 171 and 585 are not divisible by 27, and the other numbers will also not be divisible.Therefore, the GCD is not divisible by 27, and 45 is the greatest possible value.## 2nd Variant#"},{"problem":"Given frac{2+3i}{i}=a+bi(a,bin R,i is the imaginary unit), find a+b=______","solution":"AnalysisUtilize the rules of complex number arithmetic and the definition of complex number equality to obtain the answer.

Consider the function ( f(x) = 25sin(4x) - 60cos(4x) ).2. To find the maximum value, we can use calculus by taking the derivative and setting it to zero.

Since we already established that b is the smallest, we conclude:[a > c > b]However, this conclusion contradicts the final answer provided, which indicates a need to correct the final step interpretation. Given the initial analysis, the correct ordering should be b  c, the correct relationship among a, b, and c is:[b  c, but the final selection should be based on these relationships. Therefore, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the final part of the solution provided. The correct approach and conclusion based on the analysis provided should carefully consider the relationships a > 1, b  1, along with the function f(x) being monotonically increasing in (0,1), leading to e^{0.2} > 1 + ln 1.2. This suggests a reevaluation of the options based on the corrected analysis. Given the constraints and analysis, the corrected interpretation does not align with the conclusion of option B as the final answer. The step-by-step analysis suggests a different relationship among a, b, and c, but the final selection of B as a > c > b was based on the provided solution's logic.

Model the Problem as a Graph:   - Consider each student as a vertex in a graph ( G ).   - Each desk with two students sitting together can be represented as an edge between two vertices.   - Since there are 26 students and each desk has 2 students, we have 13 edges in the graph.2. Graph Properties:   - The graph ( G ) is a 2-regular graph because each vertex (student) is connected to exactly two other vertices (students they have sat with).   - We need to ensure that after the students change seats, no two students who were previously sitting together are now sitting together.3.

Proof of Bipartiteness:   - Assume for contradiction that ( G ) is not bipartite.

Conclusion:   - The maximum value of ( N ) such that there exists a set ( S ) of ( N ) students where no two students in ( S ) have ever sat together is the size of one of the bipartite sets.   - Since the graph is bipartite and has 26 vertices, each set ( A ) and ( B ) will have ( frac{26}{2} = 13 ) vertices.The final answer is ( boxed{13} )."},{"problem":"Given that the domain of the function f(x) is (0, +infty), if y = frac {f(x)}{x} is an increasing function on (0, +infty), then f(x) is called a \\"first-order ratio-increasing function\\"; if y = frac {f(x)}{x^2} is an increasing function on (0, +infty), then f(x) is called a \\"second-order ratio-increasing function.\\" We denote the set of all \\"first-order ratio-increasing functions\\" as Omega_1, and the set of all \\"second-order ratio-increasing functions\\" as Omega_2.

Calculate the probability that the third roll is a six:   - Given that the fair die was chosen, the probability of rolling a six on the third roll is (frac{1}{6}).   - Given that the biased die was chosen, the probability of rolling a six on the third roll is (frac{2}{3}).   - The total probability that the third roll is a six is the sum of these probabilities, weighted by the conditional probabilities of having chosen each die:     [     P(text{third roll is six}) = P(text{third roll is six} mid text{fair die}) cdot P(text{fair die} mid text{two sixes}) + P(text{third roll is six} mid text{biased die}) cdot P(text{biased die} mid text{two sixes})     ]     Substituting the values, we get:     [     P(text{third roll is six}) = frac{1}{6} cdot frac{1}{17} + frac{2}{3} cdot frac{16}{17} = frac{1}{102} + frac{32}{51} = frac{1}{102} + frac{64}{102} = frac{65}{102}     ]The final answer is (boxed{167})."},{"problem":"An ellipse C_{1} has the equation frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+ frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1 (a > b > 0), its major axis is equal to the diameter of a circle C_{2} with equation x^{2}+y^{2}=4, and the eccentricity of C_{1} is frac{1}{2}.

The main form of deductive reasoning is the syllogism, which derives a conclusion from a major premise and a minor premise. From the perspective of set theory, the basis of syllogistic reasoning is: If all elements of set (M) have property (P), and (S) is a subset of (M), then all elements of (S) have property (P). The formula of syllogism contains three judgments: the first judgment is called the major premise, providing a general principle; the second judgment is the minor premise, indicating a specific case; these two judgments together reveal the internal connection between the general principle and the specific case, thus producing the third judgment, the conclusion. Deductive reasoning is a form of necessary reasoning, where there is an implication relationship between the premises and the conclusion.

In the first part of the solution, we will assume that in the sought eight-digit number N, we have crossed out the first four digits. These form a four-digit number, which we will denote as A. The remaining four digits of the number N form a four-digit number B, which is mentioned in the problem, and it seems that N=10^{4} A+B. The required property is therefore expressed by the equation 10^{4} A+B=2019 B or 5000 A=1009 B. Since the numbers 5000 and 1009 are coprime, the four-digit number B must be a multiple (also a four-digit number) of 5000, whose double is already a five-digit number. The condition of divisibility is thus satisfied by only one number B=5000. For it, from the equation 5000 A=1009 B we get A=1009, so in total N=10095000(=2019 times 5000).In the second part of the solution, we will consider all other cases of erasing four digits of the eight-digit number N. Then among them, there is no first digit of the number N, which we will denote as a. We will show that after such an erasure, the number N decreases by more than 5000 k times (so it cannot be a solution to the problem).Indeed, the number N with the decimal representation N=10^{7} a+ldots will turn (after the considered erasure of 4 digits) into a number with the representation 10^{3} a+ldots, which is certainly less than 10^{3}(a+1), for the announced reduction, it is enough to prove the inequality 10^{7} a geqq 5000 cdot 10^{3}(a+1).

Assume the bathtub can hold b liters of water. We want to know how long it takes for a full bathtub to drain, which is frac{b}{w}.On Monday, the bathtub first fills at a rate of v liters per minute, and then drains at a rate of w-v liters per minute. Together, this takes frac{b}{v}+frac{b}{w-v} minutes. On Tuesday, the bathtub first fills at a rate of 2v liters per minute, and then drains at a rate of w-2v liters per minute. This takes the same amount of time as on Monday. Together, this gives the equationfrac{b}{v}+frac{b}{w-v}=frac{b}{2v}+frac{b}{w-2v}Making the fractions have a common denominator, cross-multiplying, and simplifying yields w=3v. (You can easily verify this by substituting it into the equation above.) In other words, the bathtub drains three times as fast as it fills with one tap.Finally, we use the given information that Pjotr spent 45 minutes on both days. Substituting v=frac{1}{3}w into the formula for Monday, we get45=frac{b}{v}+frac{b}{w-v}=frac{b}{frac{1}{3}w}+frac{b}{frac{2}{3}w}=frac{9}{2} cdot frac{b}{w}.From this, it follows that frac{b}{w}=10."},{"problem":"Factorize: 2a^{2}-8=____.","solution":"To factorize the given expression 2a^{2}-8, we follow these steps:1.

How many total points were scored in the game?[i]2017 CCA Math Bonanza Lightning Round #2.1[/i]","solution":"1. Let ( x ) be the number of 2-point shots Adam made. Since Adam made a total of 10 shots, the number of 3-point shots Adam made is ( 10 - x ).2. Let ( y ) be the number of 3-point shots Mada made. Since Mada made a total of 11 shots, the number of 2-point shots Mada made is ( 11 - y ).3. According to the problem, Adam made the same number of 2-point shots as Mada made 3-point shots. Therefore, we have:   [   x = y   ]4. The total points scored by Adam can be expressed as:   [   2x + 3(10 - x) = 2x + 30 - 3x = 30 - x   ]5. The total points scored by Mada can be expressed as:   [   3y + 2(11 - y) = 3y + 22 - 2y = y + 22   ]6. Since Adam and Mada scored the same number of points, we set their point totals equal to each other:   [   30 - x = y + 22   ]7.

What is the solution to the original equation?","solution":"To solve the problem step-by-step, we begin by correcting the mistake made by Xiao Hong. She incorrectly solved the equation by treating -x as +x. Given that she found x=-2 from her incorrect method, we can use this information to find the correct value of a first and then solve for x in the original equation.1. Xiao Hong's mistake led her to solve 5a + x = 13 instead of the correct equation 5a - x = 13. By substituting her solution x = -2 into the mistaken equation, we get:[5a - (-2) = 13][5a + 2 = 13]2. To find the value of a, we solve the equation obtained from the mistake:[5a = 13 - 2][5a = 11][a = frac{11}{5}]However, this step contains a mistake in interpreting the problem's solution. The correct interpretation should directly address the original equation with the given incorrect solution. Let's correct this approach:Given Xiao Hong's incorrect solution x = -2, we substitute it back into the correct equation form, which she intended to solve, 5a - x = 13:[5a - (-2) = 13][5a + 2 = 13]Solving for a:[5a = 13 - 2][5a = 11][a = frac{11}{5}]However, the mistake was in the interpretation of the problem's narrative. The correct step is to directly correct the mistake in Xiao Hong's procedure, which does not involve solving for a but rather directly addressing the error in handling the equation. Let's align with the provided solution:1. Xiao Hong mistakenly solved 5a - x = 13 as if it were 5a + x = 13. Given her solution x = -2, we substitute it correctly into the original equation:[5a - (-2) = 13][5a + 2 = 13]2. To isolate 5a, we subtract 2 from both sides:[5a = 13 - 2][5a = 11]3. Since a is not the primary variable we need to solve for in the original problem statement, we recognize a misinterpretation in the steps. The original problem's solution directly finds the correct x without explicitly solving for a. Correcting this oversight:Given the original equation is 5a - x = 13 and acknowledging Xiao Hong's mistake, we directly correct the operation on x:[5a - x = 13]Since Xiao Hong obtained x = -2 by mistakenly adding x instead of subtracting it, we see that the original equation should directly lead us to the correct x without needing to solve for a first. The provided solution indicates that we should consider the equation as 15 - x = 13 to find x, which comes from correctly interpreting 5a as 15 given a = 3 from the context of the solution. This step was not clearly explained in the initial correction attempt.Therefore, the correct steps to reach the solution provided are:1. Correctly understanding Xiao Hong's mistake means recognizing she should have subtracted x in the equation 5a - x = 13. Without needing to solve for a, we directly address the equation with the given information that a = 3:[15 - x = 13]2. Solving for x:[15 - 13 = x][x = 2]Thus, the correct solution to the original equation, following the intended method, is:[boxed{x = 2}]"},{"problem":"B4.

Let's break down the solution step by step:1. Property of f(x+1): Since f(x+1) is an odd function, its graph is symmetric about the origin. This means that for any point (a, b) on the graph of f(x+1), the point (-a, -b) is also on the graph. 2. Implication for f(x): The function f(x) can be obtained by shifting f(x+1) one unit to the right. Therefore, the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the point (1,0). This is because shifting the graph of an odd function (which is symmetric about the origin) one unit to the right results in symmetry about the point (1,0).3. Analysis of g(x): The function g(x) is given as g(x)=ln(sqrt{x^2-2x+2}-x+1). To understand its symmetry, we consider a related function h(x)=ln(sqrt{x^2+1}-x), which is defined for all real numbers x.4. Symmetry of h(x): We find that h(-x) + h(x) = ln(sqrt{x^2+1}+x) + ln(sqrt{x^2+1}-x) = ln1 = 0. This shows that h(x) is an odd function, meaning its graph is symmetric about the origin.5. Symmetry of g(x): Given that g(x)=h(x-1), we can conclude that the graph of g(x) is symmetric about the point (1,0). This is because shifting the graph of h(x), which is symmetric about the origin, one unit to the right results in symmetry about (1,0).6. Intersection Points: Since both f(x) and g(x) are symmetric about the point (1,0) and they have 5 intersection points, these points must also reflect this symmetry. Therefore, we can deduce that x_{1}+x_{5}=2, x_{2}+x_{4}=2, and the middle point of symmetry, x_{3}, must be 1.7.

Since the perimeter is 8, we can write 4a = 8, leading to a = 2. Then using the eccentricity formula, we get e = sqrt{1 - frac{b^2}{a^2}} = frac{1}{2}.

Since A and B lie on the ellipse, we have frac{x_0^2}{4} + frac{y_0^2}{3} = 1. Without loss of generality, we can assume that x_0 = sqrt{frac{12}{7}}. The distance d from point O to line AB is independent of y value and is given by d = |x_0| = frac{2sqrt{21}}{7}.For a non-vertical line, if the equation of AB is y = kx + m, for points A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2) on the ellipse, we combine the line equation with the ellipse equation to get a quadratic equation for x: (3+4k^2)x^2 + 8kmx + 4m^2 - 12 = 0.Using the discriminant Delta, and ensuring that Delta > 0 for real intersections, we find that x_1 + x_2 = -frac{8km}{3+4k^2}, and x_1x_2 = frac{4m^2 - 12}{3+4k^2}. Since OA is perpendicular to OB, we have 0 = x_1x_2 + y_1y_2.

So, we decompose 2000^circ in terms of full rotations and the remaining angle:2000^circ = 360^circ times 5 + 200^circ,Hence, the sine of 2000^circ is equal to the sine of 200^circ since they are coterminal angles.sin 2000^circ = sin 200^circ.Next, we can express 200^circ as 180^circ + 20^circ and use the fact that sine is an odd function to get:sin 200^circ = sin(180^circ + 20^circ) = -sin 20^circ.Because sin is negative in the third and fourth quadrants and arcsin yields values in the range [-90^circ, 90^circ], we need to find a coterminal angle between -90^circ and 90^circ that has the same sine value as -20^circ.

By Lemma 2, we know that r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}, r_{5} must have 2 that are equal, without loss of generality, let r_{4}=r_{5}.(a) If A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3} are on the same side of the line A_{4} A_{5}, thenS_{124}=S_{125}=r_{1}+r_{2}+r_{4}, S_{24}=S_{235}=r_{2}+r_{3}+r_{4}.Thus, A_{4} A_{5} parallel A_{1} A_{2}, A_{4} A_{5} parallel A_{2} A_{3}, hence A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3} are collinear, which contradicts condition (1).(b) If A_{1}, A_{2} are on the same side of the line A_{4} A_{5}, and A_{3} is on the other side, thenS_{124}=S_{125}.Therefore, A_{4} A_{5} parallel A_{1} A_{2}, from which we can also get S_{145}=S_{245}, thus r_{1}=r_{2}. Since A_{3}, A_{4}, A_{5} are on the same side of A_{1} A_{2}, similarly to (a), it leads to a contradiction. This proves that n geqslant 5 does not satisfy the requirements.When n=4, take the four vertices of a unit square as A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4}, and let r_{1}=r_{2}=r_{3}=r_{4}=frac{1}{6}.

We will show that exactly one such circle exists.Let mathcal{G} be the surface of the sphere, A the point on k where it touches, B the other given point, mathcal{S} the plane containing k, and e the tangent line to the circle k at A in the plane mathcal{S}. Since mathcal{G} cap mathcal{S}=k, the points of the line e other than A are outside the sphere, so e is also tangent to the sphere (Figure 1). Therefore, if any plane mathcal{T} contains e and intersects mathcal{G} in a circle ell, then the tangent to ell at A is also e, meaning ell is tangent to k at A.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_437a9535b786f41a453ag-1.jpg?height=551&width=556&top_left_y=364&top_left_x=774)Figure 1If we choose the plane mathcal{T} determined by the point B and the line e, then this plane contains two different points of the sphere, so mathcal{G} cap mathcal{T} is a circle, and by the previous arguments, this circle is tangent to k at A.If, however, some circle m is such that the plane mathcal{U} cutting m from mathcal{G} passes through both A and B but does not contain e, then the line mathcal{S} cap mathcal{U}=f lies in the plane mathcal{S} and passes through the point A of the circle k, but differs from the tangent to k at A. Therefore, f intersects k at another point C different from A (Figure 2).

Solution. Using the notation from the first solution, let mathcal{E} be the tangent plane to the sphere at the point antipodal to A. We solve the problem using a transformation called stereographic projection.Assign to any point P on the sphere's surface, different from A, the point P^{prime}=mathcal{E} cap A P (Figure 3). We will show that this correspondence is a bijection between the sets mathcal{G} backslash{A} and mathcal{E}. If P in(mathcal{G} backslash{A}) is any point, then the line A P is not parallel to mathcal{E}, so there exists a unique point P^{prime} in mathcal{E}. If Q^{prime} in mathcal{E} is any point, then the line A Q^{prime} is not in the tangent plane to the sphere at A, because that plane is parallel to mathcal{E}, so the line intersects the sphere's surface at two points, hence there exists a unique point Q different from A where A Q^{prime} intersects mathcal{G}.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_437a9535b786f41a453ag-1.jpg?height=387&width=593&top_left_y=2273&top_left_x=755)Figure 3If ell is a circle on mathcal{G} passing through A, then the image ell^{prime} of ell under the correspondence is a line, because if ell is cut from mathcal{G} by the plane mathcal{T}, then the lines connecting A to the points of ell lie in mathcal{T}, so ell^{prime} is precisely the line mathcal{E} cap mathcal{T} (Figure 4). Conversely, if m^{prime} is any line in mathcal{E}, then the plane mathcal{U} determined by A and m^{prime} intersects the sphere's surface in a circle m passing through A, whose image under the correspondence is the line m^{prime}. Therefore, the correspondence is a bijection between the circles on mathcal{G} passing through A and the lines in mathcal{E}.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_437a9535b786f41a453ag-2.jpg?height=420&width=593&top_left_y=373&top_left_x=755)Figure 4The solution to our problem is now simple. Let the image of k under the correspondence be the line k^{prime}, and the image of B be the point B^{prime} not on k^{prime}. A circle on the sphere's surface is exactly tangent to k at A if and only if k cap n={A}, which means k^{prime} cap n^{prime}=emptyset, or that the lines k^{prime} and n^{prime} are parallel (Figure 5).

The stereographic projection has many other interesting properties. For example, the image of a circle on the sphere's surface that does not pass through A is a circle in mathcal{E}.

We know that the area of a triangle can be represented as frac{1}{2}|overrightarrow{a}| times |overrightarrow{b}| times sin{C}, where overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} are two sides of the triangle and C is the angle between them.2. Given that the area of triangle ABC is 2sqrt{3} and angle A is frac{pi}{3}, we can write the equation:frac{1}{2}|overrightarrow{AB}| times |overrightarrow{AC}| times sin{frac{pi}{3}} = 2sqrt{3}3. Since sin{frac{pi}{3}} equals frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, we can simplify the equation to:frac{1}{2}|overrightarrow{AB}| times |overrightarrow{AC}| times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 2sqrt{3}4. Solving for |overrightarrow{AB}| times |overrightarrow{AC}|, we get:|overrightarrow{AB}| times |overrightarrow{AC}| = 85. The dot product of two vectors is given by: overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = |overrightarrow{a}| times |overrightarrow{b}| times cos{C}, where overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} are two vectors and C is the angle between them.6. In this case, overrightarrow{a} = overrightarrow{AB}, overrightarrow{b} = overrightarrow{AC}, and C = frac{pi}{3}.

Since exactly 1 point is contested in each game, it follows that the total score of the tournament, which is 6.5 + p x, coincides with the number of games, which is frac{(x+2)(x+1)}{2}. In addition, the score of each participant is an integer multiple of 0.5, so we can write p = k / 2, for some positive integer k. Therefore:begin{aligned}frac{(x+2)(x+1)}{2} & = 6.5 + p x (x+2)(x+1) & = 13 + k x x^2 + 3x + 2 & = 13 + k x x(x + 3 - k) & = 11end{aligned}Since x and x + 3 - k are integers, we can conclude that x is a positive divisor of 11, that is, x = 1 or x = 11.

Therefore, we only need to ensure that log_{a}x is greater than sin 2x when x is close to pi/2. As x approaches pi/2, sin 2x approaches 0. This condition is easily satisfied if log_{a}x is positive and increasing.- For a > 1, log_{a}x is increasing and positive when x > 1. Since we need this to hold starting from values of x close to 0^{+}, we must instead look at the range where x is less than 1. For log_{a}x to be positive when x  1.In conclusion, the value of a must be greater than or equal to 1 to ensure the inequality holds for all x in (0, pi/2).

Thus, if p is the probability that we will reach (1,1) from (0,0), then the desired probability is equal to frac{1}{4}+frac{1}{4} p, so we need only calculate p.

For any positive integer m, if any element of the set {m, 2m+1, 3m} is fantabulous, then all the elements are fantabulous. Does it follow that the number 2021^{2021} is fantabulous?","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to determine if the number (2021^{2021}) is fantabulous given the properties of fantabulous numbers. Specifically, if any element of the set ({m, 2m+1, 3m}) is fantabulous, then all elements of the set are fantabulous.2. Initial Claims:   - Claim: (m) is fantabulous if (2m+1) is fantabulous, and (2m+1) is fantabulous if (m) is fantabulous.   - Claim: (m) is fantabulous if (2m) is fantabulous, and (2m) is fantabulous if (m) is fantabulous.3. Proof of Claims:   - For the first claim, if (2m+1) is fantabulous, then by the given property, (m) must also be fantabulous. Similarly, if (m) is fantabulous, then (2m+1) must be fantabulous.   - For the second claim, consider the chain (2m to 4m+1 to 12m+3 to 6m+1 to 3m to m). This chain shows that if (2m) is fantabulous, then (m) is fantabulous. The reverse chain shows that if (m) is fantabulous, then (2m) is fantabulous.4. Generalization to All Positive Integers:   - For any integer (n > 1), if (n) is even, we can divide by 2 to find another fantabulous number. If (n) is odd, we can subtract 1 and then divide by 2 to find another fantabulous number. This process can be repeated until we reach 1.5. Base Case and Inductive Step:   - Base Case: (1) is fantabulous.   - Inductive Step: Suppose all (k < n) are fantabulous. If (n) is even, (frac{n}{2}) is fantabulous, so (n) is fantabulous. If (n > 1) is odd, (frac{n-1}{2}) is fantabulous, so (n) is fantabulous.6. Conclusion:   By induction, every positive integer is fantabulous.

Given Information:   - Alexander has chosen a natural number ( N > 1 ).   - He has written down all positive divisors of ( N ) in increasing order: ( d_1 < d_2 < ldots < d_s ) where ( d_1 = 1 ) and ( d_s = N ).   - For each pair of neighboring numbers, he has found their greatest common divisor (gcd).   - The sum of all these ( s-1 ) gcds is equal to ( N-2 ).2. Objective:   - Find all possible values of ( N ).3. Initial Analysis:   - We know that ( gcd(a, b) leq |a - b| ) for any ( a ) and ( b ).   - Applying this to the divisors ( d_1, d_2, ldots, d_s ), we get:     [     gcd(d_1, d_2) + gcd(d_3, d_4) + cdots + gcd(d_{s-1}, d_s) leq (d_2 - d_1) + (d_3 - d_2) + cdots + (d_s - d_{s-1})     ]   - Simplifying the right-hand side:     [     (d_2 - d_1) + (d_3 - d_2) + cdots + (d_s - d_{s-1}) = d_s - d_1 = N - 1     ]   - Given that the sum of the gcds is ( N-2 ), we must have:     [     gcd(d_1, d_2) + gcd(d_3, d_4) + cdots + gcd(d_{s-1}, d_s) = N-2     ]   - Therefore, the inequality must be tight except for one pair where it is off by 1:     [     gcd(d_i, d_{i+1}) = d_{i+1} - d_i - 1     ]4. Detailed Analysis:   - For the inequality to be tight, we must have ( gcd(d_i, d_{i+1}) = d_{i+1} - d_i ) for all pairs except one.   - For the exceptional pair, ( gcd(d_i, d_{i+1}) = d_{i+1} - d_i - 1 ).5. Considering the Exceptional Pair:   - Let ( d_{i+1} - d_i = 2 ). Then ( d_i ) and ( d_{i+1} ) are odd.   - This implies there are two consecutive factors of ( N ) which can be written as ( 2n-1 ) and ( 2n+1 ).6. Checking for Other Factors:   - If ( N neq (2n-1)(2n+1) ), then the factors ( frac{N}{2n+1} ) and ( frac{N}{2n-1} ) are also consecutive and different from our original pair.   - We have:     [     gcdleft(frac{N}{2n+1}, frac{N}{2n-1}right) = frac{N}{(2n-1)(2n+1)}     ]   - And:     [     frac{N}{2n-1} - frac{N}{2n+1} = frac{2N}{(2n-1)(2n+1)}     ]   - This shows that equality does not hold here either.7. Conclusion:   - Thus, we must have ( N = (2n-1)(2n+1) ), which is odd.   - If ( 2n-1 neq 1 ), then ( 1 ) and ( p ) are consecutive and different from ( 2n-1 ) and ( 2n+1 ), where ( p ) is the least prime divisor of ( N ).   - Since ( gcd(1, p) = 1 neq p-1 ), equality does not hold there either.   - Therefore, we are forced to have ( 2n-1 = 1 ), which yields ( N = 1 cdot 3 = 3 ).The final answer is ( boxed{3} )"},{"problem":"4.

We simplify this expression step by step:[begin{align*}3ab-a+frac{1}{2}(a+b-5ab)+1 &= 3ab-a+frac{1}{2}a+frac{1}{2}b-frac{5}{2}ab+1 &= frac{1}{2}ab-frac{1}{2}a+frac{1}{2}b+1end{align*}]Using the condition ab=a-b-1, we substitute and simplify further:[begin{align*}frac{1}{2}ab-frac{1}{2}a+frac{1}{2}b+1 &= frac{1}{2}(a-b-1)-frac{1}{2}a+frac{1}{2}b+1 &= frac{1}{2}a-frac{1}{2}b-frac{1}{2}-frac{1}{2}a+frac{1}{2}b+1 &= frac{1}{2}end{align*}]Thus, the value is boxed{frac{1}{2}}.# Part (3)To verify Xiao Ding's statement, we check if left(-b,-aright) is also a \\"coexisting rational number pair\\" when left(a,bright) is.Given ab=a-b-1, we examine the pair left(-b,-aright):[begin{align*}-b times (-a) &= ab, -b - (-a) + 1 &= a - b + 1.end{align*}]Since -b times (-a) = a - b + 1, the pair left(-b,-aright) satisfies the condition for being a \\"coexisting rational number pair\\".Therefore, Xiao Ding's statement is boxed{text{correct}}."},{"problem":"4.

These lie in a grid consisting of 36 points in a 6 times 6 square. We choose one of these points as the first vertex. If we now choose the opposite corner point, we have defined a rectangle. Opposite corners cannot be in the same row or column, so we choose one of 25 other points. In total we have 36 times 25 rectangles.

Find the maximum possible value of k.","solution":"1. Initial Setup and Example:   - We are given 2021 points on a circle, each colored with one of ( k ) colors.   - We need to find the maximum possible value of ( k ) such that for every color ( 1 leq r leq k ), there exists an arc where at least half of the points on it are colored with ( r ).   - Example: If ( k = 2 ), we can color the points alternately with two colors, say 1 and 2. This configuration works because any arc containing half the points will have at least half of them colored with either color 1 or color 2.2. Proof that ( k leq 2 ):   - Assume for contradiction that ( k geq 3 ).   - By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be a color that appears at most ( leftlceil frac{2021}{3} rightrceil = 674 ) times. Let this color be color 1.   - The number of points not colored by 1 is at least ( 2021 - 674 = 1347 ).3. Definition of Arc ( Y_i ):   - For each point ( a_i ) not colored by 1, define ( Y_i ) as the shortest arc containing ( a_i ) such that at least half of the points on it are colored by 1.4. Claim 1: One endpoint of ( Y_i ) is ( a_i ):   - Suppose the contrary, and let the endpoints of ( Y_i ) be ( m ) and ( n ).   - Let ( z_1 ) be the number of points between ( m ) and ( a_i ) (excluding ( a_i )), and ( z_2 ) be the number of these points colored by 1.   - Similarly, let ( t_1 ) be the number of points between ( n ) and ( a_i ) (excluding ( a_i )), and ( t_2 ) be the number of these points colored by 1.   - We know ( z_2 < frac{z_1 + 1}{2} ) (otherwise, the arc from ( m ) to ( a_i ) would be shorter and suitable for ( a_i )).   - Thus, ( z_2 leq frac{z_1}{2} ).   - Similarly, ( t_2 leq frac{t_1}{2} ).   - Therefore, ( z_2 + t_2 leq frac{z_1 + t_1}{2} ).   - However, we also know ( z_2 + t_2 geq frac{z_1 + t_1 + 1}{2} ), leading to a contradiction.5. Claim 2: The second endpoint of ( Y_i ) is colored by 1:   - Suppose the contrary, and let the second endpoint of ( Y_i ) be ( m ), which is not colored by 1.   - Let ( z_1 ) be the number of points between ( m ) and ( a_i ) (both included), and ( z_2 ) be the number of these points colored by 1.   - We know ( z_2 geq frac{z_1}{2} ).   - Removing ( m ) from the arc ( Y_i ) results in a shorter arc, and since ( z_2 > frac{z_1 - 1}{2} ), the new arc still satisfies the condition, leading to a contradiction.6. Claim 3: Exactly half of the points on ( Y_i ) are colored by 1:   - Suppose the contrary, and let ( z_1 ) be the number of points between ( a_i ) and ( b_i ) (both included), and ( z_2 ) be the number of these points colored by 1.   - If ( z_2 > frac{z_1}{2} ), then ( z_2 geq frac{z_1 + 1}{2} ).   - Removing ( b_i ) from the arc ( Y_i ) results in a shorter arc, and since ( z_2 - 1 geq frac{z_1 - 1}{2} ), the new arc still satisfies the condition, leading to a contradiction.7. Application of the Pigeonhole Principle:   - For each arc ( Y_i ), consider the point ( b_i ). All ( b_i ) points are colored by 1 (Claim 2).   - There are at most 674 points colored by 1 and at least 1347 arcs.   - By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least 3 arcs with the same endpoint.   - WLOG, let ( Y_m, Y_n, Y_p ) have the same endpoint ( b_1 ).   - These arcs are on the same circle and end at the same point, so there must be 2 arcs where one covers the other.   - WLOG, let ( Y_m ) cover ( Y_n ). Let ( a_m ) and ( a_n ) be their starting points.   - Let ( z_1 ) be the number of points between ( a_m ) and ( a_n ) (excluding ( a_n )), and ( z_2 ) be the number of these points colored by 1.   - Let ( t_1 ) be the number of points between ( a_n ) and ( b_1 ) (both included), and ( t_2 ) be the number of these points colored by 1.   - By Claim 3, ( t_2 = frac{t_1}{2} ) (arc ( Y_n )) and ( z_2 + t_2 = frac{z_1 + t_1}{2} ) (arc ( Y_m )).   - Thus, ( z_2 = frac{z_1}{2} ).   - Consider the arc starting at ( a_m ) and ending just before ( a_n ) (arc ( Y_m - Y_n )).   - On this arc, there are ( z_1 ) points and ( z_2 ) of them are colored by 1.   - Since ( z_2 = frac{z_1}{2} ), this arc is suitable for ( a_m ), contradicting the assumption that ( Y_i ) was the shortest arc suitable for ( a_m ).8.

Let the center O of the given circle of radius r be the origin of the coordinate system, and the given line be the X-axis. Let the coordinates of the given point P be (u, v), and the coordinates of the point Q on the circle be left(x_{1}, y_{1}right), then the coordinates of the projection of Q, Q^{prime}, are left(x_{1}, 0right).

(This is always possible if P, R, S form a triangle; if P lies on the diameter R S, the construction of Q is simple, as P, Q^{prime}, Q form a 45° isosceles right triangle.) Let the line P Q^{prime} intersect this circle at point Q^{prime prime}. By the theorem of intersecting chords:R Q^{prime} cdot Q^{prime} S=P Q^{prime} cdot Q^{prime} Q^{prime prime}Comparing this with (1), we see thatQ^{prime} Q^{prime prime}=P Q^{prime}Based on this, the construction is as follows. First, construct the point Q^{prime prime} on the circumcircle of triangle P R S, for example, by measuring the distance P S from S on the extension of P S, and drawing a line parallel to R S from the resulting point to intersect the circle at Q^{prime prime}. Connecting this to P and drawing a perpendicular at the intersection with the diameter R S gives the points Q that satisfy the problem.The correctness of the construction can be verified by reversing the above reasoning.For a given point P, we get four solutions if the line parallel to R S intersects the circle at two points, two solutions if it is tangent (since one solution point Q and its reflection across the diameter R S are both solutions), and no solutions if it does not intersect.Let's examine for which points P the problem has a solution. A solution is possible if the line parallel to R S at least touches the circle. Since the tangent parallel to R S touches the circle at the point E where the angle bisector of angle R P S intersects the circle, the line is tangent for points P such that P T = T E. Therefore, the problem is solvable if P T leq T E. However, by a known theorem about the product of segments of a chord, P T cdot T E = R T cdot T S, so the solvability condition is:P T^{2} leq R T cdot T SIn problem 698 (KML XII., 3. sz. 78-81. p.), we proved the following equality for the angle bisector of a triangle: the square of the angle bisector from a vertex is equal to the difference between the product of the sides meeting at the vertex and the product of the segments on the opposite side. Thus, the solvability condition becomes:P T^{2}=P R cdot P S - R T cdot T S leq R T cdot T SRearranging gives:frac{P R}{R T} cdot frac{P S}{T S} leq 2Since P T is the angle bisector, we have:frac{P R}{R T}=frac{P S}{T S}=frac{P R+P S}{R S}The condition can be written as:left(frac{P R+P S}{R S}right)^{2} leq 2orP R+P S leq R S cdot sqrt{2}Thus, the problem has a solution for points P whose sum of distances from R and S is not greater than the constant value R S cdot sqrt{2}. The condition is satisfied by the points on or inside the ellipse with foci at R and S, semi-major axis frac{R S}{2} sqrt{2}, and semi-minor axis sqrt{frac{R S^{2}}{2}-frac{R S^{2}}{4}}=frac{R S}{2}.

A point C on the circle can be described using the parametric equations given by x = 1 + 2costheta and y = 1 + 2sintheta.

Thus, we rewrite our expression for distance:d = |2cos(theta + frac{pi}{4}) + 2sqrt{2}|.The maximum and minimum values of cos(theta + frac{pi}{4}) are 1 and -1 respectively. Therefore, the minimum value for the distance d occurs when cos(theta + frac{pi}{4}) = -1, giving us:d_{text{min}} = |-2 + 2sqrt{2}| = 2 - 2sqrt{2},but we can conclude that a distance cannot be negative.

Given: In a triangle triangle ABC with angle B > angle C, the altitude, the angle bisector, and the median from A intersect BC at H, L, and D, respectively. We need to show that angle HAL = angle DAL if and only if angle BAC = 90^{circ}.2. Construction: Extend AD to E such that AD = DE. Extend AH to F such that AH = HF. This construction implies that ABEC is a parallelogram because AD = DE and AB = EC.3. Properties of Parallelogram: In parallelogram ABEC, we have AB = EC and BC parallel EF.

This means a circle is symmetrical.- B: Rectangle - A rectangle can be folded along the line that bisects it either horizontally or vertically, and the parts on both sides will overlap each other. This indicates that a rectangle is symmetrical.- C: Parallelogram - While some parallelograms may appear symmetrical at a glance, they cannot be folded along a line in such a way that the parts on both sides of the line perfectly overlap each other without distortion. This is because the angles and sides opposite each other are equal but the angles are not right angles (except for a special case, the rectangle, which is not the general case for parallelograms). Therefore, a general parallelogram lacks symmetry in the context of this problem.- D: Isosceles Trapezoid - An isosceles trapezoid can be folded along the line of symmetry that bisects the non-parallel sides, and the parts on both sides will overlap each other.

If every match is a draw, then every player draws 8 matches and scores 4, which satisfies the conditions. Take n = 14, so there are 16 players in total. Suppose one player loses to everyone, and all the other games end in a draw. Then the first player scores 0 and all the other players score 1 + 14/2 = 8.

This means g(x)=x^{2}+ frac {2}{x} and h(x)= frac {1}{a}ln x share a common point.  Since g′(x)= frac {2(x^{3}-1)}{x^{2}}, it follows that g(x)=x^{2}+ frac {2}{x} decreases in (0,1) and increases in (1,+infty). Given that h(x)= frac {1}{a}ln x is an increasing function,  the two functions have a common point in (1,+infty), and there exists a common tangent line at that point. Let's assume the coordinates of that point are (s,t),  then we must have begin{cases} 2s- frac {2}{s^{2}}= frac {1}{as}  s^{2}+ frac {2}{s}= frac {1}{a}ln s end{cases}. By combining these equations and eliminating a, we get s^{2}+ frac {2}{s}=(2s^{2}- frac {2}{s})ln s.  Setting s=1 gives the left side of the equation as 3, and the right side as 0;  Setting s=2 gives the left side of the equation as 5, and the right side as 7ln 2approx4.85  10.  From the above, we deduce sin(2,3), which means 2 < x_{0} < 3, so m=2, n=3.  Therefore, the value of m+n is boxed{5}.  Hence, the correct choice is: boxed{C}.  This problem can be transformed into finding a root for the equation x^{2}+ frac {2}{x}= frac {1}{a}ln x, which further translates into finding a common point for g(x)=x^{2}+ frac {2}{x} and r(x)= frac {1}{a}ln x, followed by analyzing the monotonicity of the two functions. Then, by substituting integer values to compare the sizes of function values, we can determine the range of the x-coordinates of the common points, thereby finding the values of m and n. This solution demonstrates the transformation of the problem, the idea of transformation, and its comprehensive nature. Moreover, the final step of verifying the range of the zero point by substituting integer values is a point that high school students often overlook, making it a challenging problem."},{"problem":"XXV - I - Problem 11Let  X_n  and  Y_n  be independent random variables with the same distribution  left{ left(frac{k}{2^n}, frac{1}{2^n}right) : k = 0, 1, ldots, 2^n-1right} .

Suppose there is a sequence of operations giving all zeroes in the array; let r_{i} be the number of times we operate on row i, and let c_{j} be the number of times we operate on column j. It is enough to take all of these values to be residues modulo 2013. Clearly, a_{i, j}+r_{i}+c_{j} equiv 0(bmod 2013) for each i, j. In particular, r_{1}+c_{1} equiv a_{1,1}.

Customer Xiao Ming is ready to participate in this activity, and it is known that Xiao Ming's shooting accuracy rate is frac{2}{3}.  (1) Find the probability that Xiao Ming ends the game after shooting five times;  (2) Let X denote the amount of coupons Xiao Ming receives. Find the distribution table of X and its expectation.","solution":" Step-by-Step Solution:# Part (1): Probability of Ending the Game After Shooting Five TimesTo find the probability that Xiao Ming ends the game after shooting five times, we consider the scenarios where he either clears or fails the game:- Clearing the Game: The sequence must be hit, miss, hit, hit, hit. The probability is calculated as:  [  (frac{2}{3})^4 times frac{1}{3}  ]- Failing the Game: There are two scenarios for failing the game after five shots:  1. Hit, miss, hit, miss, miss  2. Miss, hit, hit, miss, miss    The probability for each scenario is calculated as:  [  (frac{2}{3})^2 times (frac{1}{3})^3  ]    Since there are two such scenarios, we multiply the probability of one scenario by 2.Combining these probabilities, we get:[P(text{Ending after 5 shots}) = (frac{2}{3})^2 times (frac{1}{3})^3 times 2 + (frac{2}{3})^4 times frac{1}{3} = frac{8}{81} + frac{16}{243} = frac{8}{81}]Therefore, the probability that Xiao Ming ends the game after shooting five times is boxed{frac{8}{81}}.# Part (2): Distribution Table of X and Its Expectation- Clearing the Game: The probability of clearing the game in various scenarios is calculated as follows:  [  P(text{Clear}) = (frac{2}{3})^3 + (frac{2}{3})^3 times frac{1}{3} + (frac{2}{3})^4 times frac{1}{3} times 2 = frac{128}{243}  ]- Failing the Game: The probability of failing the game in various scenarios is calculated as:  [  P(text{Fail}) = (frac{1}{3})^2 + (frac{1}{3})^2 times frac{2}{3} times 2 + (frac{1}{3})^3 times (frac{2}{3})^2 times 3 + (frac{1}{3})^3 times (frac{2}{3})^3 = frac{233}{729}  ]- Neither Clearing nor Failing: The probability of neither clearing nor failing after six shots is:  [  P(text{Neither}) = 1 - frac{128}{243} - frac{233}{729} = frac{112}{729}  ]Thus, the distribution table of X is:| X | 3 | 6 | 9 ||-----|-----|-----|-----|| P | frac{233}{729} | frac{112}{729} | frac{128}{243} |To find the expectation E(X), we calculate:[E(X) = frac{233}{729} times 3 + frac{112}{729} times 6 + frac{128}{243} times 9 = frac{1609}{243}]Therefore, the expected value of the coupons Xiao Ming receives is boxed{frac{1609}{243}}."},{"problem":"Determine all non-constant polynomials X^{n}+a_{1} X^{n-1}+cdots+a_{n-1} X+a_{n}, with integer coefficients, whose roots are exactly the numbers a_{1}, ldots, a_{n-1}, a_{n} (with multiplicity).","solution":"Let ( P(X) = X^n + a_1 X^{n-1} + cdots + a_{n-1} X + a_n ) be a polynomial with integer coefficients.Then ( P(X) ) is a solution to the problem if and only if[P(X)=prod_{i=1}^{n}left(X-a_{i}right)]First, suppose that ( a_{n}=0 ). Let ( i ) be the smallest integer such that ( a_{n-i} neq 0 ). Then we have ( P(X)=X^{i}left(X^{n-i}+a_{1} X^{n-i-1}+cdots+a_{n-i-1}right) ) and thus (5) is satisfied if and only if ( Q(X)=X^{n-i}+a_{1} X^{n-i-1}+cdots+a_{n-i-1} ) is constant or is itself a solution to the problem. The first case corresponds to ( P(X)=X^{n} ), which is a valid solution.We will therefore assume in what follows that ( P(X) ) is a solution with ( a_{n} neq 0 ). Under these conditions, we immediately deduce that we cannot have ( X+a_{1}=X-a_{1} ) and thus there is no polynomial of degree 1 that is a solution. We therefore assume that ( n geq 2 ).

Let ( k ) be the number of them that are -1 (and thus ( 0 leq k leq n-1 )). We can note that (6) then shows that ( k ) and ( n ) have the same parity.

Therefore, ( a_{2}=-1 ) and, since ( n-2 k=-a_{n} neq 0 ), the only possibility is ( n=3 ) and ((n-2 k)^{2}=1). From ( k leq n-1 ) and the same parity as ( n ), we deduce that ( k=1 ), then ( a_{1}=1 ) and ( a_{3}=-1 ), hence ( P(X)=X^{3}+X^{2}-X-X=(X+1)^{2}(X-1) ), which is indeed a solution.- If ( a_{n}=2 k-n+2 ): As above, we get this time[(n-2 k-2)^{2}+n=2-2 a_{2}]and thus ( a_{2}=-1, n=3, k=1, a_{1}=1, a_{3}=1 ), hence ( P(X)=X^{3}+X^{2}-X+1 neq (X-1)^{2}(X+1) ), which is not a solution.In conclusion, the solutions to the problem are the polynomials ( P(X)=X^{n} ) for ( n geq 1 ), ( P(X)=X^{n}left(X^{2}+X-2right) ) or ( P(X)=X^{n}left(X^{3}+X^{2}-X-Xright) ) for ( n geq 0 )."},{"problem":"By one magic nut, Wicked Witch can either turn a flea into a beetle or a spider into a bug; while by one magic acorn, she can either turn a flea into a spider or a beetle into a bug.

Understanding the Problem:   - We have a committee with ( n ) members.   - Each pair of members are either friends or enemies.   - Each member has exactly three enemies.   - An enemy of a friend is also an enemy of the member.2. Initial Observations:   - Each member has exactly three enemies, so the sum of the degrees of the vertices in the graph is ( 3n ).   - Each edge in the graph contributes 2 to the sum of the degrees, so the total number of edges is ( frac{3n}{2} ). This implies ( n ) must be even.3. Case Analysis:   - Case ( n = 4 ):     - If ( n = 4 ), each member has exactly 3 enemies. This means every member is an enemy to every other member. This forms a complete graph ( K_4 ) where every member is an enemy to every other member.     - This satisfies the condition that each member has exactly 3 enemies.   - Case ( n = 6 ):     - If ( n = 6 ), we need to check if we can partition the members into groups such that each member has exactly 3 enemies.     - One possible partition is to split the 6 members into two groups of 3, where each member in one group is an enemy to every member in the other group. This forms two complete subgraphs ( K_3 ) and ( K_3 ).     - Each member in one ( K_3 ) has exactly 3 enemies in the other ( K_3 ), satisfying the condition.4. Proof for Larger ( n ):   - Assume ( n > 6 ). Each member has ( n-4 ) friends and 3 enemies.   - If ( n > 6 ), then each member must be part of a complete subgraph ( K_{n-3} ).   - Since ( n-3 ) is greater than half of ( n ), each member must be part of a complete graph that consists of more than half the members.   - However, we can only form at most one ( K_{n-3} ), so only ( n-3 ) members can be in a ( K_{n-3} ). This leads to a contradiction because we cannot satisfy the condition for all members.5.

Define the problem and set up the coordinates:   - Given a line passing through ( A(1, 0) ) and perpendicular to the ( x )-axis, the line equation is ( x = 1 ).   - Points ( X ) and ( Y ) move on this line in the first quadrant.   - The condition ( AY = k cdot AX ) implies that the distance from ( A ) to ( Y ) is ( k ) times the distance from ( A ) to ( X ).2. Determine the coordinates of ( X ) and ( Y ):   - Since ( X ) and ( Y ) are on the line ( x = 1 ), their coordinates can be written as ( X(1, y_1) ) and ( Y(1, y_2) ).   - The distance ( AX = y_1 ) and ( AY = y_2 ).   - Given ( AY = k cdot AX ), we have ( y_2 = k cdot y_1 ).3. Find the intersection points ( P ) and ( Q ) with the unit circle:   - The line segments ( OX ) and ( OY ) intersect the unit circle ( x^2 + y^2 = 1 ) at points ( P ) and ( Q ).   - The coordinates of ( P ) and ( Q ) can be parameterized as ( P(cos alpha, sin alpha) ) and ( Q(cos beta, sin beta) ), where ( alpha ) and ( beta ) are the angles ( angle AOX ) and ( angle AOY ) respectively.4. Relate the angles ( alpha ) and ( beta ) to the coordinates:   - Since ( tan alpha = y_1 ) and ( tan beta = y_2 ), we have ( tan beta = k cdot tan alpha ).5. Express the area of ( triangle OPQ ):   - The area of ( triangle OPQ ) can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices at the origin and two points on the unit circle:     [     text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left| cos alpha sin beta - sin alpha cos beta right|     ]   - Using the sine difference identity, this becomes:     [     text{Area} = frac{1}{2} left| sin(beta - alpha) right|     ]6. Maximize the area:   - To maximize ( left| sin(beta - alpha) right| ), we need to maximize ( beta - alpha ).   - Given ( tan beta = k cdot tan alpha ), we use the tangent addition formula:     [     tan(beta - alpha) = frac{tan beta - tan alpha}{1 + tan beta tan alpha} = frac{k tan alpha - tan alpha}{1 + k tan alpha tan alpha} = frac{(k-1) tan alpha}{1 + k tan^2 alpha}     ]   - The maximum value of ( left| sin(beta - alpha) right| ) occurs when ( beta - alpha = frac{pi}{2} ), but we need to consider the constraints of the problem.7. Use AM-GM inequality to find the maximum value:   - By the AM-GM inequality, we have:     [     1 + k tan^2 alpha geq 2 sqrt{k} tan alpha     ]   - Thus:     [     left| frac{(k-1) tan alpha}{1 + k tan^2 alpha} right| leq left| frac{(k-1) tan alpha}{2 sqrt{k} tan alpha} right| = left| frac{k-1}{2 sqrt{k}} right|     ]8.

Find the product of the radii of these three spheres.Answer: 26.25Solution. Let the three spheres touch the plane and each other. We need to find the relationship between the product of the lengths of the sides of the triangle formed by the points of tangency of the spheres with the plane and the product of the radii of the spheres.Let O_{a}, O_{b}, O_{c} be the centers of the spheres, their radii r_{A}, r_{B}, r_{C}, and they touch the plane at points A, B, C with A B=c, B C=a, C A=b. The points A B O_{B} O_{A} form a right trapezoid with sides A B=c, B O_{B}=r_{B}, A O_{A}=r_{A}, O_{B} O_{A}=r_{A}+r_{B}, the bases of which are B O_{B} and A O_{A}, and B O_{B} perp A B, A O_{A} perp A B. Let, for definiteness, r_{B} geqslant r_{A}. Draw a perpendicular from O_{A} to the side B O_{B}, denoted as O_{A} D. The points A O_{A} D B form a rectangle, and O_{A} D=A B=c. O_{B} D=r_{B}-r_{A}, and for the right triangle O_{A} D O_{B}, we can write the Pythagorean theorem: c^{2}=left(r_{A}+r_{B}right)^{2}-left(r_{A}-r_{B}right)^{2}, and thus, c=2 sqrt{r_{A} r_{B}}.

Let a=BC, b=CA, c=AB be the lengths of the sides, and beta the angle widehat{ABC} (so 2beta is the angle widehat{BAC}).

It follows that the triangle B'CB is also isosceles, and that the two triangles AB'C and B'CB are similar, hence frac{CB'}{AB'} = frac{BB'}{CB}, or frac{a}{b} = frac{b+c}{a}, which simplifies to a^2 = b(b+c). If a, b, c are integers, we can assume b and c are coprime, otherwise their common divisor d would also divide a (from this relation), and by dividing a, b, c by d, we would have a triangle satisfying the same hypotheses, with a perimeter d times smaller. If b and c (and thus b and b+c) are coprime, and if the product b(b+c) is a perfect square, then both b and b+c are perfect squares: b = m^2, b+c = n^2, so a = mn, and frac{a}{b} = frac{n}{m}. According to the law of sines, frac{a}{b} = frac{sin(2beta)}{sin(beta)} = 2cos(beta). Since the angle widehat{ACB} = pi - 3beta is assumed to be obtuse, beta < frac{pi}{6}, so sqrt{3} < 2cos(beta) = frac{a}{b} = frac{m}{n} < 2. To minimize a + b + c = mn + n^2, m and n must be as small as possible, which gives n = 4 (since the interval (sqrt{3}, 2) does not contain any half-integers or third-integers), m = 7 (since sqrt{3} < frac{7}{4} < 2), so a + b + c = 28 + 49 = 77."},{"problem":"13.

Initially, all lamps are off. An operation can be performed on these lamps: each operation changes the state of one lamp (i.e., on becomes off, off becomes on).

The number of good arrays is 2^{t-1}.Proof of the lemma: In fact, for the same a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{t-1}, when a_{t} takes 0 and 1, the parity of the two resulting arrays is different, so exactly one of them is good. Thus, the total 2^{t} different possible arrays can be paired, with each pair differing only in a_{t}, and each pair contains exactly one good array. Therefore, the number of good arrays is half of the total, i.e., 2^{t-1}.The lemma is proved.We denote the set of all operation sequences that result in lights 1,2, cdots, n being on and lights n+1, n+2, cdots, 2 n being off after k operations as A class sequences; the set of all operation sequences that result in lights 1,2, cdots, n being on and lights n+1, n+2, cdots, 2 n being off after k operations, and where lights n+1, n+2, cdots, 2 n are never operated on, as B class sequences.For any B class sequence b, we can correspond all A class sequences a that have the following property: \\"the elements of a correspond to the same elements modulo n\\" (for example, when n=2, k=4, b=(2,2,2,1) can correspond to a=(4,4,2,1), a=(2,2,2,1), a=(2,4,4,1), etc.). Since b is a B class sequence, the number of 1,2, cdots, n in b must all be odd, and a is an A class sequence, so the number of 1,2, cdots, n in a must all be odd, and the number of n+1, n+2, cdots, 2 n must all be even.Thus, for any i in{1,2, cdots, n}, let b have b_{i} occurrences of i. Then a must and only need to satisfy: for any i in{1,2, cdots, n}, the b_{i} positions in b that are i must be i or n+i in a, and i must have an odd number (naturally, n+i will have an even number).By the lemma and the multiplication principle, b can correspond toprod_{i=1}^{n} 2^{b_{i}-1}=2^{k-n}different as, and each element a in A has a unique element b in B (which is obtained by transforming each element of a to its smallest positive remainder when divided by n) that can correspond to it.Thus, we must have |A|=2^{k-n}|B|, i.e.,N=2^{k-n} M text {. }It is also easy to see that M neq 0 (since the operation sequence (1,2, cdots, n, n, cdots, n) in B), thenfrac{N}{M}=2^{k-n} text {. }"},{"problem":"(5 points) Given that {a_n} is a geometric sequence with all positive terms, and if a_4 cdot a_8 = 4, then a_5 cdot a_6 cdot a_7 = （　　）  　 A． 4 B． 8 C． 16 D． 64","solution":"B  Key Point: The general formula of a geometric sequence.

If there is a line through which more than two of the given planes pass, then the number of regions formed is 8 - if the four planes pass through the same line -, or 12, if one of the planes intersects the common line of the other three planes.If there is no such line, then by translating one of the planes in parallel, a new - bounded - region is created: the interior of a tetrahedron whose four faces are the translated plane and the other three planes.The faces of this tetrahedron divide the space into 15 regions, since one region is connected to each vertex (4), edge (6), and face (4), and the 15th region is the interior of the tetrahedron.By translating the translated plane back to its original position, this bounded region disappears, and the unbounded regions remain, so we get that the four planes divide the space into at most 14 regions.Tóth Szilveszter (Tata, Eötvös J. Gymn., 11th grade)II. solution. Let's examine how the number of regions changes when adding an (n+1)-th plane to n planes. This plane intersects each of the existing n planes in a line; these n lines pass through the common point (points) of the planes, and the (n+1)-th plane is divided into at most 2n regions. Each of these regions defines exactly one new region, so the number of regions increases by at most 2n with the addition of the (n+1)-th plane. This is possible if there are no identical lines among the n lines, and at most two of the given planes pass through any line in space.Based on the above result, we get the following table:| number of planes (n) | number of regions || :---: | :---: || 1 | 2 || 2 | 2+2 cdot 1= || 3 | 4+2 cdot 2= || 4 | 8+2 cdot 3= |According to these, if four planes pass through a point, they divide the space into at most 14 regions.Remarks. 1. The first solution can also be explained more vividly: consider a tetrahedron, or the 15 regions into which its faces divide the space. If we move \\"very far\\" from the tetrahedron, it \\"shrinks to a point,\\" while the 14 unbounded regions remain, so the answer to the problem is 14.2. We can also reach the goal with another method. Draw a sphere around the common point of the planes. Each plane intersects the sphere in a great circle, which divides the sphere's surface into regions. Each region corresponds to exactly one such domain on the sphere's surface.The question, then, is how many regions 4 great circles divide the sphere's surface into. If we project the sphere onto a plane tangent to the sphere at a point P through which no circle passes, it is known that the image of the sphere's surface is the entire plane, and the image of the circles is a circle. Thus, we have reformulated the original question: into how many regions does the plane divide at most by 4 circles. The two problems are therefore equivalent, and the latter form is much better known.3.

Condition (i): The set ( left{ frac{f(x)}{x} mid x in mathbb{R} setminus {0} right} ) is finite.   - This implies that ( frac{f(x)}{x} ) can only take a finite number of values. Let these values be ( c_1, c_2, ldots, c_n ). Therefore, for any ( x neq 0 ), ( f(x) = c_i x ) for some ( c_i in {c_1, c_2, ldots, c_n} ).2. Condition (ii): ( f(x - 1 - f(x)) = f(x) - 1 - x ) for all ( x ).   - Let us define ( g(x) = x - 1 - f(x) ). Then the given functional equation becomes:     [     f(g(x)) = f(x) - 1 - x     ]   - We need to explore the properties of ( g(x) ) and how it interacts with ( f(x) ).3. Exploring ( g(x) ):   - By definition, ( g(x) = x - 1 - f(x) ).   - Applying ( g ) again, we get:     [     g(g(x)) = g(x - 1 - f(x)) = (x - 1 - f(x)) - 1 - f(x - 1 - f(x))     ]   - Using the functional equation, ( f(x - 1 - f(x)) = f(x) - 1 - x ), we have:     [     g(g(x)) = (x - 1 - f(x)) - 1 - (f(x) - 1 - x) = x - 1 - f(x) - 1 - f(x) + 1 + x = 2x - 2f(x) - 1     ]4. Analyzing the behavior of ( f(x) ):   - Since ( left{ frac{f(x)}{x} mid x in mathbb{R} setminus {0} right} ) is finite, ( f(x) ) must be of the form ( f(x) = c_i x ) for some finite set of constants ( c_i ).   - Suppose ( f(x) = c x ) for some constant ( c ). Substituting this into the functional equation:     [     f(x - 1 - f(x)) = f(x) - 1 - x     ]     becomes:     [     f(x - 1 - c x) = c x - 1 - x     ]     [     f(x(1 - c) - 1) = c x - 1 - x     ]     [     c(x(1 - c) - 1) = c x - 1 - x     ]     [     c x (1 - c) - c = c x - 1 - x     ]     [     c x - c^2 x - c = c x - 1 - x     ]     [     -c^2 x - c = -1 - x     ]     [     c^2 x + c = x + 1     ]     [     (c^2 - 1)x = 1 - c     ]   - For this to hold for all ( x ), we must have ( c^2 - 1 = 0 ) and ( 1 - c = 0 ). Solving these, we get ( c = 1 ) or ( c = -1 ).5. Checking the solutions:   - If ( c = 1 ), then ( f(x) = x ). Substituting ( f(x) = x ) into the functional equation:     [     f(x - 1 - x) = x - 1 - x     ]     [     f(-1) = -1     ]     This is consistent.   - If ( c = -1 ), then ( f(x) = -x ). Substituting ( f(x) = -x ) into the functional equation:     [     f(x - 1 - (-x)) = -x - 1 - x     ]     [     f(x - 1 + x) = -x - 1 - x     ]     [     f(2x - 1) = -2x - 1     ]     This is also consistent.Therefore, the solutions to the functional equation are ( f(x) = x ) and ( f(x) = -x ).The final answer is ( boxed{ f(x) = x } ) or ( f(x) = -x )."},{"problem":"Let f: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R} be an odd function, that is, a function that satisfies -f(x)=f(-x) for all x in mathbb{R}.

Here, the size of the angle domain containing the circle between the tangent segments drawn from A is 180^{circ} - alpha; similarly,E_{2} C E_{3} varangle = 180^{circ} - gamma, quad E_{3} D E_{4} varangle = 360^{circ} - delta,and the rays A O, C O, D O bisect these angles, respectively.The angles in question are:begin{gathered}A O B varangle = O A E_{1} varangle - O B E_{1} varangle = frac{180^{circ} - alpha - beta}{2}; C O D varangle = 180^{circ} - left(O C E_{3} varangle + O D E_{3} varangleright) = 180^{circ} - left(frac{180^{circ} - gamma + 360^{circ} - delta}{2}right) = = frac{gamma + delta}{2} - 90^{circ},end{gathered}their sum is gamma + delta - 180^{circ}, or 180^{circ} - alpha - beta, since for a concave quadrilateral, alpha + beta + gamma + delta = 360^{circ} also holds. Furthermore, similarly,B O C varangle + D O A varangle = 180^{circ} - beta - gamma = alpha + delta - 180^{circ}The 3rd figure differs from the 2nd only in that B is on the tangent segments A E_{1} and C E_{2}, and the concave angle of the quadrilateral is at B. Thus,begin{aligned}A O B varangle + C O D varangle & = left(180^{circ} - frac{alpha}{2} - frac{beta}{2}right) + left(180^{circ} - frac{gamma}{2} - frac{delta}{2}right) = & = 180^{circ} = B O C varangle + D O C varangle .end{aligned}![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_4f448013334490fa15f2g-2.jpg?height=762&width=1290&top_left_y=123&top_left_x=407)The 4th figure results in a cyclic quadrilateral. We do not deal with this case, as the meaning of the angles of the quadrilateral becomes uncertain here.III. In the last configuration to be examined, in the case of the 5th figure, the angle domain containing the circle at vertex B is the beta angle domain, at D it is the delta vertex angle domain, and at A and C it is the supplementary angle domain of alpha and gamma, respectively. Thus,begin{aligned}A O B varangle + C O D varangle & = left(O A E_{1} varangle - O B E_{1} varangleright) + left(O D E_{3} varangle - O C E_{3} varangleright) = & = 180^{circ} - alpha - beta, B O C varangle + D O A varangle & = left(O C E_{2} varangle - O B E_{2} varangleright) + left(O D E_{4} varangle - O A E_{4} varangleright) = & = 180^{circ} - beta - gamma .end{aligned}László Palla (Budapest, Piarist Secondary School) Béla Vizzvári (Budapest, Berzsenyi Dániel Secondary School)Remark. The problem aimed to draw the readers' attention to the fact that theorems can slightly change with the change in the situation, and also that a circle tangent to each side of a quadrilateral can be outside the quadrilateral, similar to the case of a triangle.Combining the results, we can say that if the circle is inside the quadrilateral (1st and 3rd figures), then the sums in question are equal. Furthermore, in the situations of the 2nd and 5th figures, the same expression was obtained for the two sums. In these situations, it could have been noticed that instead of the previous beautiful relationship, the differences A O B varangle - C O D varangle and B O C varangle - D O A varangle are equal, with their common value being 0^{circ}, i.e., A O B varangle = C O D varangle, and B O C varangle = D O A varangle. The proof of this is left to the reader.We also recommend that readers examine, for the sake of completeness, whether our figures cover all possible configurations."},{"problem":"Calculate: -1^{4}+16div left(-2right)^{3}times |-3-1|.","solution":"To solve the given expression step by step, we start with the original expression and follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS - Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division from left to right, Addition and Subtraction from left to right):Given expression: -1^{4}+16div left(-2right)^{3}times |-3-1|1.
