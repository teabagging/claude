I am 60 years of age, had played tennis competitively and often. I am told that there is little to be done but take ibuprofen for pain, exercise, but in time I will need a hip replacement. Is that all ther is? Thanks","Doctor":"Hi First I would like to make it clear to you that arthritis has nothing to do with Bone Density increase as such. Arthritis is an inflammation of the joint causing joint pain and limitation of movements. In early stage pain killers like Ibuprofen help but they cannot be taken for long due to it's side effects. For long term , if the pain prevents you from doing your daily activities it will be better to go for Hip Replacement."},{"Patient":"I m a 42yo white female, not obese, great health, but my left arm has been numb down to my 1st 3 fingers for about 4 days.

I am wondering how long I should take the Ibuprofen before I discontinue it if my pain does not go away entirely and should I consult a surgeon if my gait is not limited by the pain.","Doctor":"Hi I have read your history and in my opinion you are suffering from Arthritis of hip.

Her lipase level was 900.  She admits to drinking at least 6 beers every night.  She has also had stomach ulcers in the past.  The Dr in the hospital told her she needed to quit drinking as the high lipase levels were likely a result of excessive drinking.   Yesterday, her primary care Dr took blood tests again and said that all levels are normal but did not specifically mention lipase.  He thinks it's her ulcer returning.  How do we tell whether it's pancriititis or an ulcer.  She of course thinks it's an ulcer.  I'm concerned about her drinking.","Doctor":"Hi ! Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.One fact is sure which you should specifically counsel your friend is to leave alcohol totally, as irrespective of whether it is pancreatitis or a gastric ulcer, alcohol is detrimental and the cause of both these conditions. The pain could have been due to pancreatitis de novo or the gastric ulcer penetrating the posterior wall of the stomach to make the pancreas inflamed resulting in pancreatitis. In both the cases the serum amylase, and lipase could be increased along with alcoholism. However, high levels like a lipase of 900 points more towards a pancreatitis. If I were your doctor, after her condition is stabilised in the hospital, I would refer her to a gastro enterologist for a possible endoscopic evaluation of her old gastric ulcer. And I would also ask her for an absolute NO to alcohol to prevent further damage to the pancreas which sometimes results in very poor prognosis. She should continue with her treatment advised by the doctors of the hospital.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, I would advise you not to eat any kind of fast fried food from outside if you do. Many a times, ingredients used in food from outside might not be hygienic enough causing intestinal infections, and also might cause allergic reactions to the intestinal mucosa in many  I would also go for a stool routine test for ova and cyst and treat it if positive. Addition of more of roughage and liquids in your food might also help you.In case these measures do not help you out, I would suggest you to go for a gastroenterologist opinion for a possible endoscopic evaluation of your intestinal tract, and also a cardiologist opinion if need be.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I suffered a sprained ankle and was diagnosed with a knee sprain after an xray and an MRI. I was in an immobilizer for 8 weeks before moving to a hinged brace, and have been treated with Naprosyn up until about two weeks ago. After working about eight hours in a restaurant, I felt like my knee was going to give out at any moment, and the pain was so unbearable I wouldn t stand for more than a minute at a time. I was switched to Meloxicam and Tramadol for pain. It has been months since my injury, should my knee pain still be affecting me this way? It also tends to keep me awake at night. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi I have gone through your reports and description where you had dislocated your knee cap and relocated. Your MRI suggests knee sprain. In my opinion you had dislocated your knee cap and injured the capsule and ligaments on the medial side of your knee joint.

In my opinion you had calcaneal bursitis where the tendo achilles ( Calf muscle tendon) is attached. It has probably ruptured and is causing your symptoms.

Let me tell you one thing very clearly - Painful shoulders are very difficult to treat and 20 days of physiotherapy will not be of much help.

I am 77 years old, and from my family medical guide I think it may be degenerative purpura. Am I correct, and will I still be able to get my knee implant on that leg in ten days? It s HARD to see a real doctor out here in the boonies!","Doctor":"hi you have a red patch 2 x 6\\" where itching has stopped on application of steroid cream. In my opinion itching stops with steroid cream in all conditions but that is not diagnosis or treatment. I would advice you to undergo certain blood tests Like CBC. PT and PTTK  to note any infection or bleeding disorder. If the tests are normal the I don't see any reason as to why you cannot have knee replacement."},{"Patient":"hello sir i am suffering from stomach pain from last three months.doctor told me that i am suffering from stomach infection.after taking the prescribed medicine for fifteen days my loose motion is now under control  but from last two days i had 102 f fever in the evening .please give your opinion","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HealthcareMagic.I have read your query and understand your concern.It seems that your infection is going out of control.

This condition is called Traumatic coccydynia . In my practice I would start painkillers , muscle relaxants Sits bath twice daily and Gluteal + Spinal extension exercises.

My leg swelled up so I had an x-ray done but was told to just rest the leg. Around 3 weeks ago, after starting an exercise programme, the area of my shin that was bruised and swollen, began to bruise and swell again and appeared red & hot to the touch. My doctor said it was called Erythema nodosum and carried out blood tests. These have all come back negative to anything serious but my doctor has now discharged me. Is this something that will now just keep inevitably occurring when I exercise? Also, over the past few days walking has become difficult on the same leg due to a raised, red sore area on my big toe (similar place to a bunion but VERY painful)....could the two be linked? I am 29 years old.","Doctor":"Hi I have gone through your description and noted about the blunt injury on your led where you had no fracture. There is a strong possibility that you have damages the muscles in the area which have not healed. The second possibility is that you may be having gout ( increased uric acid in the blood) which will explain the painful swelling on your foot( big Toe). I suggest you get S Uric Acid and MRI Leg to assess the causes of both. In the meantime you can start any painkiller to relieve you of pain."},{"Patient":"My 9 year old son has just had his arm removed from a cast for a greenstick fracture of his forearm.

Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hi any injury in the back or hip will not cause breathing difficulty unless there is some other cause / Injury in chest.

Although she is uncomfortable, but not like at night time.","Doctor":"hi i have read the details as described by you about your daughter's  injury. If she has bruise on the leg with scrape wound , it is because of bleeding in the leg due to injury.

I would like to know if you were operated and what was the nature of operation. In my opinion from  your description , I think that probably sacrum has malunited ( united in different position) . The nerve - Sciatic nerve passes very close to sacrum and hip and it might have been damaged partially. I suggest get an X Ray pelvis including SI joints and both hips and NCV Studies  for both legs. Start painkillers , Pregabalin and Spinal Extension exercises at present."},{"Patient":"Hi Have tendonitis in right ankle and wearing airboot for the past 4 weeks after PRP Injection.

Stress Fracture occurs when uneven and unnatural pressure is applied on the foot for a prolonged period of time . It also indicates weakness in the bones.

In my opinion , you have pressure on the nerve supplying this area ( C7 T1) ,which may be arising from your neck ( Disc prolapse) of from your shoulder ( Thoracic outlet syndrome).

Im wondering if there is a difference between a torn disk, herniated disc, bulging disc. are they different or basically mean the same thing.. ? a mri has shown 2 tears with mild bulging in my l5 s1 disc and herniation in l4 l5? what should I expect from this? I have already had surgery on l5 s1 in 2009. just wondering if I will need another surgery for this?","Doctor":"hi the various conditions you have described as  torn disk, herniated disc, bulging disc. are stages of the same processes. First annular ligament is torn and a part of disc bulges out , then it goes beyond the boundary of disc  into neural space( herniation ). Only these conditions don't determine whether you need to be operated or treated conservatively. Majority of disc diseases do not need operation. I suggest you take pain killers , muscle relaxants and physiotherapy, and if there is no relief then go for orthopedic consultation."},{"Patient":"I have a very distinctive loud squishing sound coming from one of my knees.

My ankles were swolen, one went down the other has stayed since March 8, it is now April 25 and there are red spots on my ankle. I saw a Dr. in Venice about two weeks after the March 8th flight who sent me to the emergency room. They did a blood test and said nothing indicated anything serious. I think it has improved a little, I got a blood thinner from the pharmacy, approved by the Dr. in the emergency room. I am now ready to go by bus to Prague, 2.5 hours and after a week, fly to London from Prague, 2.5 flight. Should I wear compression sox? This is on my right leg.

You are having swelling in the foot after a long flight. one month or more you noticed red spots also on the swelling . All your ER Reports are normal. In my experience this kind of swelling after long flight is common and is generally relieved on bed rest with legs above the level of heart. Sometimes swelling on one side could be because of Deep Venous thrombosis /varicose veins.In both cases compression stockings are going to help you so use compression stockings on long sitting journeys. Also get a color Doppler to assess any  Deep Vein Thrombosis / varicose veins  .Continue Blood Thinners also till the diagnosis is confirmed."},{"Patient":"To whom this may concern, My fiancé experiences severe ( on a scale of 1-10; its a 9) pain that can be debilitating at times.

If I just touch the area, it feels numb, like my face does at the dentist. There is no visable bruising. I have tried icing the area, but the weight of the ice hurts.

Not sure if I should go back to get meds changed?","Doctor":"Muscle spasms of the back are often related to inflexible muscles related to the lower back complex (example tight hamstrings, trunk flexor muscles) along with a weak core and back muscle complex.Also a poor hydration status(inadequate intake of fluids and electrolytes commonly seen in exercising athletes, hot humid climate or decreased intake in cold weather)  can contribute to muscle spams.Dryness of the throat could be due to the Diazepam and decreased hydration status also.The muscle relaxant and Diazepam have been given to relieve the muscle spasm , changing the medicine is not the solution to your problem.For a long term solution I would advice you to go through a proper flexibility program along with a core and back strengthening program with adequate water and fluids intake.A physiotherapist would be able to address this issue."},{"Patient":"hi, to begin with i have had back pain that has got much worse from october last year and have been diagnosed with hypermobility syndrome which causes me chronic back pain the worst thing is i look fine to everyone and can do anything still as i can move too easily im not hobbling around like most people associate with back pain and this leaves me really upset as signed off work and i know how people judge but when something aggravates it (like sitting/ hovering etc for short amount of time) its incredibly painful deep deep within my lower back and this can set off a whole day of pain and rarely a time im not in pain or taking pain killers - for sometime now i have been getting really tenderness in both my breasts on the sides and especially when i lie down and overnight & esp in morning &when i get up it gets better throughout day and then when led down again they get more and more tender and sore during the night to be fair it only hurts to nudge them in the day as gets better one been up and about but after sleeping/lieing down will be v.sore. i have been to breast clinic and they dont think anything to worry about in relation to cancer but this does not resolve the issue it has been going on for too long for it to be from pregnancy. i have seen people mention FMS and it makes me think i have major back problems , my knees often hurt and had breast pain for some time (i know i have hypermobility syndrombe but looks like they could be connected i dont know with other areas of pain im feeling rather distressed and upset. many thanks for any advice","Doctor":"Your query does not make it clear on how was the diagnosis of Hypermobility syndrome made.The condition of Hypermobility syndrome would generally make you more prone to injuries rather than having generalised pain and tenderness therefore it would be more pertinent to have yourself examined by a Rheumatologist who would examine and prescribe you certain tests to confirm the diagnosis as well as rule out any other connective tissue disorders.Regarding the Functional Movement screening(FMS) in your case can be done after the confirmation of your condition by the Rheumatologist , I would suggest a proper strength and conditioning program with least emphasis on flexibility to build up your muscles and contribute to overall joint stability."},{"Patient":"I ve recently started working out and have lost some weight about 20 lbs.

This muscle pulls your big toe in--toward the midline of your body. If you are sure that the bump is in a muscle, the abductor hallucis muscle is the most likely candidate. It could have been injured and now wants to cramp. If the bump you see is bluish in color it could be a collection of blood from the injury--a hematoma. Massage will help the body reduce this. Another possibility is an injury to the navicular bone in the same general area. This would feel harder than the muscle and will not go away with time or massage. Finally, and least likely if the bump is truly on the inside of the arch and not on the bottom of the arch, is a condition called plantar fibromatosis.

Wear a good ankle and lower leg brace that will keep the Achilles tendon immobilised, and prevent a limp. Also do lower leg calf muscle strengthening exercises every day. It may take 5-6 years to show improvement, but be patient. When at home use an ankle strap (you will get these in a good sports shop). These are the only things that will help but will take time. But do stay in touch with your orthopedician. Newer treatments and minor surgical methods are always being discovered.

I had an injury to my right shin over 15 years ago. I hit a fire hydrant as I was riding my bike which caused my chin to get caught in between the two. My chin was facing outwards and the fire hydrant smashed my shin which caused in to push my skin in, as a result I had a slight indentation and severe swollen. Over the years I was told I had nerve damage due to the accident, and I always had a very slight indentation. A few days ago I noticed my shin was very sore. It has been sore for a while but it went away and never thought twice about it. Just recently I go to rub it because it was sore, and I realized I have a massive indentation in my leg. It is very noticeable especially when you feel it. I am confused because it was many years ago and now it is taking affect. Thank you","Doctor":"Hi you had a minor accident  injuring your right  shin about 15 yrs ago and you feel indentation on your shin which is  increasing now. At that time you were told that you have nerve damage .

Do you suggest I run at low pace or fast pace? The course is 70% downhill.","Doctor":"Hi You have ITBS- an overuse injury. It is good that you have restarted your training with less intensity . This may give you some respite from this injury. Running downhill may increase your chances of ITBS since the Ilio tibial band is used more on running downhill.

I have been taking Aleve during the day. It has been a week and it just not seem to be getting better. The bursa sack is swollen and the area of pain restricts my movements. The swelling goes up and down but returns each night. There are days when it seems better but not much and it has been a week and overall it is a small improvement and the pain at night is destroying my sleep.

To recapitulate: 18 months-pain from belly button to --- as described - to groin- swelling- feeling of pushing- night sweats- This can not be due to IBS.There has to be a reason for this. I would advise you to go for a PET scan also along with an MRI of the abdomen and upper leg. This will definitely help to find out or rule out the cause. Also important is a clinical examination , I mean real physical examination to confirm by a Doctor the severity of the swelling - to confirm it is really present and its relation to the other findings. Also go for the blood and urine and stool tests - rule out diabetes, typhoid.Blood culture and sensitivity does help sometimes.Occasionally the findings of osteomyelitis does take some time to be picked by the CT or MRI.

Recurrent dislocation will require quadriceps strengthening exercises  and if recurrence persists then operation."},{"Patient":"Hello, my name is charley, i am currently writing to you as my girlfriend has suffered from a minor disk bulge L5, but seems to have gotten worse, no doctor has been listening to her and all they do is traction and acupuncter but if anything has made her feel worse, her new doctor has sent her for more scans as he thinks it could be a fracture in her sacrum!

I dont know what to do i am scared for her, please any suggestions and am i worrying over nothing? Thank you for your time","Doctor":"Hi Charley. Your girl friend has Disc Bulge L5 which is getting worse and has no feeling while having sex. It is quite possible that there is a severe pressure on her disc and the transmission of sensation at that level is reduced .I would strongly recommend a MRI scan and NCV Studies to see the pressure on nerves."},{"Patient":"I have been having back pain.

I haven t taken the ring out because in don t want to trap the infection, but I might soon since I am pregnant and my skin is stretching","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for your query.You are 28 weeks pregnant , that is you are in 3 rd trimester. So you can safely take antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines under the guidance of a Doctor ( pregnancy-safe medicines ).The ring being a foreign body has to be removed.The area to be applied with liquid povidone iodine 4 times daily.Start antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines immediately under the guidance of the Doctor.

What does this sound like it could be? Thanks","Doctor":"Hi You have pain or feeling of tightness in your toes when you lay down on your back .This is probably due to pressure on the nerves in your spinal cord which in some cases increases on lying down on your back. Take pain killers ,muscle relaxants , and if no response in 2 weeks time , go for MRI Lower Back ans NCV test."},{"Patient":"i have really bad chest pain due to a muscle spasm that started in my neck that i didnt treat properly that traveled now to my chest. im currently taking a muscle relaxer a day plus ibuprofen but it doesnt seem like its helping much is there anything else i can take that will help me more?","Doctor":"Hi there your symptoms point towards a pathology in your cervical spine particularly pressure on C5 nerve root.

I had a cervical fusion of my C6-7 in 2012, but I really want to know if these pains are related?","Doctor":"Hi ,in cases of Fusion  C 6-7 , generally symptoms are pain in the neck and pain in arm on inner side. So arm pain may be due to involvement of cervical nerves but thigh pain is not explained by it. So I would rather go for MRI Lumbo sascral spine and S Vit B12 levels in blood.

JOYCE","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.Yes, this can be a recurrent problem.I would advise you to get the barium study for the colon and intestines in real time ( with fluroscopy) to see the motility problems. Colonoscopy can not find the motility disorders.Also go for CT scan of the abdomen: this is to find any other problem with the other structures like lymph nodes and so. This time too antibiotics can definitely help and start under the care of a Gastroenterologist.Remember one thing , a proper diagnosis is very important for the proper treatment and to avoid the recurrence."},{"Patient":"I have been on antibiotics for eight days my jaw is so swollen I cannot open my mouth to chew food some days pain is more intense than others. On ciprofloxacin started on clindamyacin and they switched me after a trip to er. I m about to take both because I m tired of hiring and this has cost me both of my jobs. Need help please advice.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern and advise you not to take both these antibiotics together. Ciprofloxacin has higher antibacterial coverage than Clindamycin so stop taking Clindamycin and complete the course of Ciprofloxacin.In addition, the description of the symptoms suggests that you are probably having trouble with the lower third molar or wisdom tooth. It might be impacted or infected causing the symptom. In that case, only antibiotics will not help to relieve the problem.You should make an appointment with the dentist and go for clinical examination of the oral cavity along with x-ray of the lower third molar area on the side of jaw where the pain is. If it is indeed the cause, you should get the tooth extracted. In addition, if you are having pain and not able to chew probably, you should take analgesic such as Ketorolac 10 mg (Ketorol DT) thrice a day.I hope this information helps you.

Diarrhoea, nausea and severe fatigue and weakness, headaches occur 1/2 times a day and are usually located on the right. I noticed yesterday that my upper arms were boiling hot, as was my neck - felt similar to fresh sunburn. My doctor has hinted at kidney problems (family history too) but any idea of what this could be? Much appreciated!","Doctor":"Hi , after reading your summary , it seems that injuries to your knee  or joint pains have no direct correlation to your (R) Upper quadrant abdominal pain radiating to your back. Yes, Your doctor is on the right track, so should follow his line of investigation and therapy."},{"Patient":"I have received prolotherapy, prp (which did temporary relieve all pain in my knee, but has since returned), and two stem cell procedures using adipose tissue and spaced a year apart. All this was following arthroscopic surgery, physical therapy and cocks comb injections which provided no relief. The arthroscopic surgery made the knee even worse. After the second stem cell procedure, the pain tripled in severity and the physician instructed me to take three Motrin three times daily. After no relief in pain, he told me to increase the dosage to six Motrin three times daily, but again no relief. During the adipose tissue harvesting, he had an observer present who later left with some of my stem cells, but without my then knowledge or permission. In addition, I see that lidocaine from Hospira that was used might be part of a lot that was infiltrated during manufacture with metallic particles that could lodge in injection sites or be carried to other sites and cause severe pain, stroke, or other adverse effects. I have been complaining about increasing pain at all injection sites (knee, tibia, sole of foot), but have not had any success with resolving the issue. I did receive notice that Hospira manufactured the Lidocaine, there was no record of the lot number and that the facility did not receive a notice that they were part of a recall. I was a self pay patient and all is far worse following my August 2014 treatment than I was before treatment. The doctor said that he is sorry he couldn t help me and has me talking to a nurse who I have not heard from in two weeks. I recented made an appointment with an orthopedist at a nearby tertiary hospital who spent 8 minutes with me. He asked me to tell him what the problem was, never looked at my knee, took new xrays to the tune of 1100 and then stated that he would not operate on my knee. He told me that he was going to have me see another doctor who specialized in spinal surgery (I have a 22 degree curve that does not cause pain). The office staff was not alerted to this when I asked immediately after and told me that I would be called back. This was over two months ago and I am still waiting. I have a consultation with another doctor in June for evaluation for a TJR, but am now using a cane, walker and almost ready for a wheelchair. Before the last stem cell treatment and prp I still was walking without much pain so my hypothesis is that something in the lidocaine must have initiated the pain since every spot injected hurt and continued to and even resulted in a ruptured quadracepts tendon where injected when he tried to even up my posture. I will be calling Hospira to find out whether the bad lots of lidocaine were purchased by the facility that I had the procedure done at and take it from there. What is your perspective of my situation?","Doctor":"Hi It seems that you have been suffering badly from pain at multiple sites, which you have correlated to injection sites. One doctor you saw recently has a  different opinion ,pointing towards spine pathology. You said that injections were given in the knee joint then why tibia or soles be involved. There is a pathology in your back bone causing curvature of spine, possibly Canal stenosis which can explain all your problem. I would suggest you undergo an MRI of your back and NCV of your legs to assess the nerve pressure."},{"Patient":"I have upper left quadrant pain in the abdomen.

Your concern is that you still feel numbness ,tightness and pain in your hands after 15 yus of 3rd degree thermal burns. In this type of burns- nerve endings which are responsible for our feeling of , touch , pain , position , heat etc are all damaged.

What should I do?","Doctor":"hi you had an injury with softball in your leg about 9 days ago and have been diagnosed with pneumonia a week after this injury . Now you have swelling and redness in the injured area and you are suspecting cellulitis since it is red ,swollen and warm to touch. I would think that probably a hematoma ( Collection of blood) ,had formed at the time of injury which went unnoticed since it did not cause any problem,and mow it is getting infected. I would recommend aspiration to see if any abscess is there and if present would drain it. Antibiotics will continue if pus if there."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 19 years of age and I have been having chronic back pain in the lower and mid part of my back. I have been to physical therapy as well as seeing a chiropractor, but those only seem to be temporary fixes. My question is what do you think is wrong with my back. Other doctors said it has to do with a muscle. Its frustrating to me because, whenever I do visit the doctors or physician assistant they tell me the same thing of going to therapy regardless of me telling them i have been there and nothing seems to work. I am looking for something that can help rid the pain in my back since that i have had for about 6 or 7 years now. Also as a side note I have been diagnosed with a minor form of scoliosis I am not sure if that has something to do with it. Thank you, Austin","Doctor":"Hi Austin you are 19 and have been suffering from back pain for 6-7 yrs, with minor scoliosis, pain relieved temporarily after visiting a chiropractor.To me , you are suffering from ,what we call \\"growing pains\\" in the spinous preocesses of vertebra. you need mild pain killers , spinal extension exercises and hot packs-- the pain will wear off gradually."},{"Patient":"I have a noroma on 2nd and 3rd toes on right foot and also have pain in my foot pad (feels mushy and painful).

What will the Dr. (Dr. Bridge) do about this?","Doctor":"Hi. You have a neuroma 2nd and 3 rd toes (R) and pain in foot pad, orthotics are helping you in pain. With this condition in , acknowledged in CT Scan ,I would investigate further with MRI. In painful Neuromas  I would give local infiltration of steroids to reduce their activity and since the foot pad pain is part of the same process, it will be relieved also. If there is no relief with local steroids then i woiuld go for operation."},{"Patient":"I hit with a softball just below my knee 2 days ago and have iced it and taken ibuprofen throughout the day, my whole lower leg is swollen and firm, a large bruise is forming and sometimes it feels like someone is pinching me under my skin.

Do I need to see a doc or should I wait and see how it progresses over the next few days?","Doctor":"Hi you have been hit by a softball below knee and are having large bruise and swelling.It is painful and walking and bending knee is difficult. To me it appears that you have probably torn some muscle like gastrocnemius and there is hematoma( blood clot fromation) with spread to Calf causing pain and disability.

Your anxiety / pain / fear can temporarily increase blood pressure. You are advised to take Blood Pressure on three different days , it may settle by this time. If the BP does not come down , get an opinion of a cardiologist and a treatment for the same. The pain in the abdomen may be really due to pulled muscles as you rightly suspected.

Occassionally if feels as if there is sort of a burning/tingling feeling above and around my navel. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello dear,Given the medical history of peptic ulcers, stomatitis, diverticulitis and microscopic colitis, the symptoms as mentioned in your post can be attributed to accumulation of gas secondary to increased acid production in the stomach.Symptomatic relief can be obtained with intake of Pantoprazole preparation (to be taken twice a day before meals) & antacid gel (to be taken after meals).They prevent formation of excess acid in the stomach & provide symptomatic relief.And it is also needed that you take certain precautions regarding your diet & lifestyle, such as:1. Take soft, plain, non-spicy foods.2. Drink lots of water to maintain adequate hydration.3. Avoid fast foods & gas producing food products like cabbage, etc.4. Avoid smoking & alcohol.5.

If you have a problem in healing of wound particularly around ankle( ankle region has poor muscle coverage and skin is liable to non healing), then the best option is one which avoids load on skin  by reducing the area and fusion will give you a painless joint.

Welcome to HCM.Blood & leukocytes in urine indicate urinary tract infection.As you have mentioned about abdominal & back pain, there can be a stone causing this and acting as nidus for infection.Stone in ureter causes obstruction to urine outflow, smooth muscles in ureter contract excessively to overcome this obstruction & so is the pain.Ca-oxalate stones are quite common & these stones have spikes on their surface. These spikes cause mucosal trauma in urinary tract producing blood in urine.To such patients in my clinic, I advise ultrasound abdomen & pelvis, X-ray KUB, renal function tests, CBC, urine routine & BSL.Treatment is done accordingly.For temporary pain relief, smooth muscle relaxants like drotaverine, pain killer..diclofenac, tamsulosin are prescribed.Hope this helps.Wish you speedy recovery.Thanks.Regards."},{"Patient":"my son has a 0.3cm linear lucency yet the doctor is sending him home with his foot unwrapped and telling me to force himn to walk on it we have an appointment on Thursday to see a foot specialist but im afraid it may be something serious what would you suggest would be the best thing to do ?","Doctor":"Hi there , it is not clear as to why you took your son for examination.

I was in a car accident in 2004, broke left radius and ulna. Metal plates and screws were placed on both bones. You have always been able to feel the plates and screws through the skin.

In the last 10 years, the bone has grown and there is a visual curve to my forearm. I asked the Dr that I go to if there was anything I can do about it and he says that there is nothing I can do about it, the bones have most likely grown around the metal (he looked, didn t take xrays) and I will not be able to find someone to take out the metal, because even though it causes so much pain, taking the metal out would require possible re-brake and the bones wouldn t be strong enough to endure this. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hi while a I understand your concerns , the plates usually don't cause any pain , particularly if the fracture has united. It will be better to look for some other cause of pain and swelling.

Shin being sub cutaneous bone is more prone to bruised .The dent you are feeling is not a dent in the bone but in the soft tissues and the swelling must be increasing in the evening causing more soreness. Use cold compresses and a creppe bandage to support the bruised area . It might take 3-6 weeks for full recovery"},{"Patient":"Hi. Sorry to bother you.

I have had so many MRI s, xrays, cat scans. I have been told by a neurologist that I have brachial plexus. I had a nerve conduction study done because they thought it was carpel tunnel. I have been have numbness from my shoulder, under my arm, and down to my right hand for 3 months now. It really is making me nervous because this doctor told me there is nothing to do about it except sit it out and it may take up to a year to heal. the pain is nonstop all day and night. I find myself pulling my arm to my chest and raising my shoulder up to ease the pain. That last about 15 seconds and it comes back again. The doctor that performed the nerve study is not my favorite doctor, I have seen him before, years ago for neck pain I stopped going to him because he was not helping me at all. The neurologist I am seeing now is the chief of neurology at one of our hospitals in my town. He was suggested to me by a friend. I do like him but I am not sure I agree with him on this. When he called me he said the report that the doctor who gave me the test said it was not carpel tunnel. I did mention to the chief that I do not care for that doctor I have seen him before and I do not like him. The chief said well than in a couple months go to another neurologist for another nerve study in 2 months. This makes absolutely no sense to me. I am in constant pain and feel like no one is listening to me. I really do not know what to do next. One reason I am so concerned is that 15 yrs ago I hurt my back, went to see about 8 doctors, no one wanted to touch the problem well one doctor wanted to put me in a full body cast for a year. They are all nuts. I went to Johns Hopkins in MD. The chief of orthopedic said looking at all the paperwork & xrays the whole thing he said the doctors in my area are barbaric. I had the surgery performed there and have been great ever since. I need a spinal fusion. If you are wondering I live in Clarks Green Pa. the biggest town near me Scranton Pa. I would love to hear your feed back. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Debbie","Doctor":"Basically your nerologist is right whrn he says that you have to sit it out. The pain caused by Brachial Plexus injury is sometimes quite severe and may not respond to usual Medicines. Some medicines like gabapentin may help. You should discuss this with your neurologist"},{"Patient":"My daughter is 15. The Dr was concerned she as showing signs of early appendicitis 2 days ago but her blood tests were normal.

But, the pain has come and gone...like cramping.....strong at times...lower right......I can lift her leg bent at the knee like the Dr did and it doesn't seem to bother her.","Doctor":"Hi! Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Even though a case of appendicitis could not be ruled out without a physical examination by the treating doctor, the pain could also have been due to a pre menstrual pain. If I were your doctor, I would also go for a urine routine/microscopic test to rule out an asymptomatic UTI (urinary tract infection), a routine stool test for ova and cyst, and if considered necessary, an ultrasound abdomen to rule out any other pelvic pathology. Further management would depend on the close watch on any changes in the clinical findings, and related investigations.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.I must tell you in the beginning that the treating doctor of your friend would be the best judge to tell you what she has got, because the differential diagnosis though can be guessed from the partial history, confirmation could be done only by a detailed physical examination and related investigations.If the doctors assume that it is the appendix, then they would go for a surgery and the tissue for histo-pathology. However, history of loss of weight is perplexing in that simple appendix might not give rise to significant weight loss as you described. Mostly chronic inflammatory diseases or some other kind of pathological process could land the patient up in gross weight loss. She would have to be investigated more to know the cause of weight loss, which could also be due to the history of stress you wrote.

By checking uric acid level in blood you can rule out this. Taking uricosuric drugs like Allopurinol or Probenecid is helpful not get further attacks by reducing uric acid levels in blood.

When I went to the emergency room, they said the situation was severe; however, the fractures seemed to be aligned and might heal on their own. After a couple of bad consultations, I went to John Hopkins. They want to perform surgery asap along with ENT surgery. They also said that they usually do surgery two weeks after the injury. I am older and am having a lot of pain and paralysis, but I m concerned about the major surgery on my face. What are my options?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Paralysis and extreme pain are expected after multiple fractures including your nose, orbit and jaw. However, surgery might be necessary because all fragments of all bones cannot be aligned perfectly without opening the bony structure of the face and aligning the bones with each other. After aligning, they must use plates, screws or wires to maintain their correct position and heal the fracture sites which might not be possible without surgery.Maxillofacial surgeries in accident cases provide good results and as ENT surgeon will be present during the surgery, the nasal bones will be put in correct position by the specialist of nose. Thus, I would advise you to go for surgery as soon as possible to avoid malalignment of the fractured bones and their healing in the wrong way.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic. I wish you speedy recovery!Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"Hello im 31yrs old. I recently fell off a loading dock at my job and fractured my elbow.

Do you think this time frame of healing an infection is normal? At what point would you consider getting a second option?","Doctor":"Hello thank you for writing us here. Well the would healing takes time depending upon the size of incision, your immune level and blood supply to the foot. Antibiotics are given because surgeries like that are more likely to be infected and because while preforming the surgery, the blood supply of bone is cut off and because of that, the antibiotics don't show much effect as they don't reach the bone to that extent when they show their effect. Multiple shots are required for proper effects.

And the abdominal hardness and weight loss could  be due to your excersise.Another possibility is that of a cancer on the abdomen, that can present with all these features, but that will depend upon your age. If it is on the higher side (>45yrs) then chances are more.So, I would suggest that you get an ultrasound scan of your abdomen to help reach a diagnosis.

You can take ibuprofen which is a good analgesic. and also make sure you don't exert too much pressure in your leg or do heavy exercises or get indulge in sports which could cause injury again at the same place. take some rest and you'll be better in a couple of weeks.Best regards,Dr Gunjan"},{"Patient":"Hello- I have had an ache in the right middle side front for months. The severity comes and goes, but is always in the same spot, just below my ribs and slightly inside.

It aches at various times, I even notice while I m sleeping. A couple of days ago it was the worse I ve felt it with a sharp stabbing pain that was painful to touch.

His feet are turning inwards when he walks. I took him to the gp and he was referred to orthopaedics at london guys hospital.

People look at my son and everywhere i go i always get asked by someone who is being kind whether i give him vitamins or i have seen someone about it. I was hurt today when one child tried to copy how he was walking and he laughed. This is heartbreaking to see. Someone mentioned physiotherapy to me. D o you think that this is something i could try and look into. He is getting taller but i am not seeing any progress. thank you","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for writing us here.It's a congenital deformity called pes valgus or club foot. Don't massage or go for physiotherapy because it won't make any improvement. It would require a minor surgical procedure for the correct fixation of bones and the recovery would be within 4 to 6 weeks. I highly recommend you to see an orthopedic surgeon for this. Physiotherapy and massage would fix the bone because I've seen few patients who used to massage their limbs and now they cannot move them properly. You can take your time and I highly respect your decision what to do next.Best regards,Dr Gunjan"},{"Patient":"When younger, had a super-chiropractor who was always adjusting me for thyroid and adrenals.

You might had taken calcium supplements for the fractures, isn't it? most likely your kidneys tried to excrete the excess of calcium which ultimately got deposited and causes pain in the lower back/ kidney area and also in the flank region. I would suggest you to have an ultrasound done for the diagnosis and also drink plenty of water so if you have stone in kidney, it could be excreted out. I wont suggest any medication for now as it would require special investigations to be done. you just need to drink 5 to 10 liter of water everyday to get relief from your symptoms.best regards,Dr Gunjan"},{"Patient":"building up to much mucus in my chest cause me to have short of breath . every time i take calcium I have a hard time to breath and i can not get air in mine lungs so i stop take it .

I would suggest you to take Bromhexine twice a day so you don't have too much mucus formation and also it would melt the mucus which is forming giving you clear airway and would help with your symptoms. Also consult your physician to reduce the dose of calcium supplements and instead you should take more amount of milk and have sun bath more often for getting strong bones. sunlight is very important for this and It would also help you to get better skin and little tan which is beneficial for your overall health.best regards, Dr Gunjan"},{"Patient":"hi.. i m 29 year old and married , i have no child. my prob is last 2 month, after one-two week of period. stree in lower stomach , cant stand for long time, feel tired, sometimes strees in waist. may i know the reason.","Doctor":"Hi!

I would suggest to first clear yourself from a dentist as you have recently got a surgery done in the oral cavity and if the surgical site is not healed adequately and if it is having infection, then you can feel the pain you are having right now. If the oral surgical site is healed well, you should visit an ENT specialist to look for any infection in the ear. If any oral or ear area is infected, you will have to take antibiotics to eradicate the infection. If you are in pain right now, you can take Ibuprofen 400 mg up to thrice a day to have relief.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic. I wish you feel better soon.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"Hi Im a 31 yr old woman who has been having spasms on the right side of my face from my temple to my jaw for over a month now. It wakes me up at night and causes my face to hurt. I have been seen in the er and seen by a reg doctor with no answers. I don t know what to do. Im tired of hurting and not sleeping. I haven t been drinking soda and haven t been stressed other than the pain so I know that s not reasons for this.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. It is possible that your muscle in the area of cheek to jaw over the right side of the face is having problems with stimulation and relaxation. It is also called Myofacial Pain Dysfunction Syndrome (MPDS).You can take muscle relaxant medicine such as Paracetamol 500 mg + Diclofenac Sodium 50 mg + Chlorzoxazone 250 mg (Dan-MR) twice a day for 5 days. In addition to the medicine, you can apply Diclogesic Sodium gel (Volini) locally over the area.In addition, you should make an appointment with the dentist to look for any decayed tooth in the oral cavity as an infected or impacted tooth over the side of pain can cause such pain. If such infection is present, treatment of that tooth with root canal treatment or extraction depending on the extent of decay can relieve the pain.I hope this information helps you.

This past October, I started to have vague right hip pain, which has gotten worse. February of this year, I had a nuclear medicine whole body bone scan done. The results came back as degenerative changes in the left and right hip, but more prevalent in the right hip. It was recommended that I repeat the bone scan, which I did on June 3, 2014. The results came back showing that the same affects were happening not only in my hips and pelvis (right hip more prevalent) but also in both of my shoulders ( right shoulder more prevalent) and the front part of my skull had thickened also. I was told that my scan was fine and no changes had occurred and to repeat the scan in six months. I found this to be questionable, simply because there was an obvious change within the three months. Both scans were done to rule out metastatic disease. Radiotracer activity in the second scan was noted in places that did not show up on the first scan. I want to know; do I have anything to worry about and should I get a second opinion. My right hip bone and joint have been hurting constantly, mostly at night.

I noticed it around November last year, and it s become much larger since April of this year. It s painful, tender, and I have sharp shooting pains down my left arm all the way to my finger tips. I had a CT scan at the beginning of April (when it started getting worse). The ER doctor said it was a non-cancerous tumor/lipoma, and to follow up with my PCP and a neuro surgeon. The neuro surgeon referred me to an ENT surgeon, sent me for an MRI and nerve conduction survey. The ENT surgeon said he would remove the mass after I had the MRI. A week and a half later I had the MRI, went back to the ENT, who then said he did not see the need to remove it. I went back to my PCP because the mass conttinues to get larger and more painful. He referred me to another ENT surgeon for a second opinion. Last week I had the nerve test done, which confirmed that everything I am feeling is due to the mass on my neck, (which we had already determined), the next day I had a CT with contrast of my neck. Today, I had a thyroid ultra sound and a CT scan of my chest, also with contrast. Since these tests, the mass is even larger, even swollen down into my left breast area. I have an appointment with my ENT in a few days.

You should have a regular follow-up with your dentist, oftalmologyst, and rheumatologist.Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM.The treatment of Sjogren syndrome, is complex as the disease is manifested with a wide range of symptoms.First you need to use artificial tears, ophtalmic lubricating ointments, or local cyclosporine drops to avoid eyes drying. You should avoid some medications (with anticolinergic effects), such as phenotiazine, three cyclic anti depressive drugs, anti Parkinson drugs, antispazmolytics (buscopan), etc. You should avoid smoking.You may use Pilocarpine for your dry mouth. You should drink water frequently during the day, or other beverages, except sweety ones to avoid caries. You should have a regular follow-up with your dentist and oftalmologyst.You can use hydroxycloroquine (Rutor) 200 mg per day, which may help you with myalgias and arthralgias.As you have begin to have bladder problems (extraglandular manifestations), you may need a more specific treatment such as glucocorticoids, or imunosuppressors.You should discuss this with your treating doctor about the dosage, and the follow up plan.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

Tender to the touch. No major bumps that I can feel, no sore throat, no trauma. Pain extends from below left side of my chin down to collar bone. Should I be concerned.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Pain in only one side of chin can occur if any of the lower front tooth on the left side is infected. Sometimes infections in front teeth are not in the form of decay but if you have injured the tooth many years ago, it may remain symptomless for many years but keeps developing cyst within bone surround tooth which presents as pain at any point of time. Even if you have had injured the tooth and made it nonvital when you were kid, you can have pain now. This pain can be referred to collar bone as the nerve supply of both areas is same.As you are not having sore throat or any lymph node swelling, I would advise you to visit a dentist for examination of the lower left front teeth along with an x-ray (IOPA) of the tooth. If you are in pain, you can take Ibuprofen 400 mg or Ketorolac 10 mg when needed to maximum of 3 tablets per day.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic.

I just read about it and would like to know what you think?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Yes, CMV (cyto megalo virus) can cause sore throat, enlarged glands in neck, cold etc. But it is not commonly infecting virus. CMV infection is common with immunosuppressive conditions like HIV infection, patient taking steroids or chemotherapeutic drugs, malnutrition etc.. So if you are having any of these conditions then chances of CMV infection is high otherwise it is low. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Age is 36 years, height 5 11 and weight is 15 stones and am generally healthy.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are having nerve compression in sitting position which is causing you pain especially in sitting posture. You should first try below mentioned non pharmacological measures for pain relief. 1.Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. 2. Avoid sudden jerky movements like bending, side movements etc. 3. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. 4. Avoid bad postures in sleep. You will mostly improve with all these in 1-2 weeks, if not improving then consult orthopedic doctor and get done x ray of lumber spine to rule out compression. Hope I have solved your query.

Yes, you should definitely consult doctor and get done clinical examination of thighs and groin area. Sudden onset of groin pain is commonly seen with torsion of testes. You are having increasing pain with tenderness on touching, so you should definitely consult doctor and get done clinical examination of lower abdomen, groin and ultrasound examination of abdomen and scrotum to rule out 1. Torsion of testes 2. Stone in urinary system. 3. Infection. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I have had severe TMJ pain and symptoms for many years but the small painful bump just popped up this morning. Is this related to TMJ? When I touch it, it does feel like muscular pain (very painful when touched). Just a little worried it could be something more serious.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Painful bump in front of ear could be due to infection of the ear or related to TMJ. It would have been more helpful if you had mentioned exactly what problem you have been suffering from related to TMJ for several years.However, if you are having pain in opening and closing jaws, side to side movements of lower jaw, while chewing, if the joint makes clicking/popping sounds while opening, then it is more likely that the lump is related to TMJ. You are already suffering from TMJ problems, so it is more likely the cause. In that case, you should visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for physical examination of the joint and further investigations to pinpoint the cause and treat it. If you are having pain in ear, suffering from cold, no TMJ related symptoms etc., then the infection is more likely to be located in the ear. In that case, visiting an ENT specialist would be helpful. Do not worry regarding anything serious as the bump is in the lymph node area and painful, so it is related to infection and can be cured with course of antibiotics. As you are in pain, you can take Ibuptofen 400 mg or Ketorolac 10 mg up to thrice a day to have relief. I would caution you against doing heat application over the area, as the infection may worsen.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HCM.

I have looked at all the symptoms and purity much can relate to all of them. However I also get tightness across my back like a muscle spasm. I feel like I am going to faint. Weakness in legs. Etc. I have put this in the past down to panic attacks. And I have learnt how to deal with them. How do I find out what might be wrong. I am tired of feeling unwell. Thanks Michelle","Doctor":"Hello Michelle,I can understand your concern. All your symptoms like pain near your right ear, jaw locking, vertigo like symptoms such as dizziness, feeling like fainting can be associated with the TMJ (Temporomandibular) problem.TMJ is a joint of jaw that helps in opening and closing of jaws and side to side movements of the lower jaw. When this joint is affected, the muscles of chewing and associated with TMJ can cause pain. The problems related with TMJ can include subluxation, dislocation, MPDS (Myofacial Pain Dysfunction Syndrome), degenerative joint disease etc. Many times the problems with TMJ are misdiagnosed as infection in ear as the symptoms are very similar and location is same.I would recommend you to consult an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for physical examination of the joint along with x-ray or CT Scan. If the specialist clears you of any joint related disorder, then you should consult an ENT specialist for ear related infection or disorder. If you are in too much pain right now, you can take Ibuprofen 400 mg or Ketorolac 10 mg up to three times a day as per your need. Eat soft diet and try not to open your mouth too wide until you see the specialist.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HCM.

Clindamycin is commonly given antibiotic for tooth and oral cavity infections. It does cause joint pain as a side effect. However, developing joint pain after 2 weeks of starting the drug and having it constantly for months cannot be related to the side effect of this medicine as the medicine has left your body by now.As your blood tests are also coming normal, infection and other blood related disorder can be ruled out. However, if you consult an orthopedic surgeon or pain management clinic, some light can be shed on what you are suffering from and it can be treated.I hope this information helps you.

The gas shadows can lead to a probable diagnosis , If positive get another test called  Enteroclysis- a barium study to get a proper diagnosis. *Get an ultrasonography of the abdomen to see for any mass, lymph node, any evidence of another disease like tuberculosis. You can get a confirmation by CT scan.*Get a consultation with Gastroenterologist.

As the bleeding has stopped and no other discomfort is there except some pain and swelling, you can give it some time to heal.Having some pain and swelling is common after injury to any facial site. As face has high blood supply, the bleeding and swelling looks always severe than the injury itself. You can do ice compressions over the area and keep pain in control by painkillers and wait for some days for the injury site to heal.However, if the pain or swelling worsens, you develop fever or other discomfort, a physician should be consulted as these are sings of infection in the injury site.I hope this information helps you.

I can understand your concern. Our long bones are having growth plates at their growing ends.. These plates are the reasons why we grow height. After the age of 18-20 years, these growth plates fuse with parent bone and so other height will no longer increase.Since you are 18 years old, you might increase your height for next 1-2 years. You are doing correct things for increasing height. Additionally, start protein powder with milk twice daily instead of plain milk. Also do stretching exercises like swimming, cycling etc. Don't worry, you will gain height upto 20 years.. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Cancerous lesions are very slow to grow and they are noticed accidentally not causing any pain.What you have may be Acute Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis (ANUG) which is a bacterial infection of gum and is spread very fast. It is usually self limiting and decreases and disappears on its own. Using mouthwash can give relief in pain for a while and prevents from further acquiring infections.As you are going to a gum doctor (Periodontist) in two weeks, you will be examined for any lesions in mouth and will be treated.

These lymph nodes become swelled and painful when ear or TMJ (Temporomandibular Joint) area is infected.As you are already having sinusitis and fever, there are more chances that you have infection in the ear or because of the sinusitis, the lymph node is swollen. You can take Azithromycin 500 mg (Azee 500) once a day for 3 days. Acetaminophen 500 mg or Ibuprofen 400 mg can be taken for fever up to thrice a day. You can use over the counter decongestants and antihistamine such as Levocetrizine 5 mg (Levocet) once a day for 5 days to clear the congested sinus. Also refrain from rubbing the lymph node.If you do not find any relief in the lymph node swelling and fever in 3 days, then ENT specialist should be consulted for examination and investigations regarding ear infection.

I m wondering if you can shed any light on what might be going on with me. For the past several years, I ve experienced joint pain symmetrical joint pain in the lumbar spine, sac joints, knees and sometimes ankles and toes. There is no apparent swelling and Osteoarthritis has been ruled out. My thighs and calves often feel fatigued as if I ve run a marathon, when I haven t done anything to cause it. I run low grade fevers off an on, sometimes when I feel well otherwise. I also am tired all the time, sometimes absolutely exhausted. My symptoms flare and tone down. I have headaches as well as migraines. I have started breaking sometimes when I m in the sun. I also get pustules on my skin during the summer which look different from the breaking out in the previous sentence. My hair which has always been very thick is thinning considerably. My BP runs on the high side. My ANA is negative, my sed rate is normal. Drs have noted livedo reticularis, small fiber peripheral neuropathy and macrocytic normochromic anemia, but that s pretty much my different diagnoses, which don t explain most of the symptoms. I have had extensive blood tests. RBC morphology was abnormal (Anisocytosis slight, Poikilocytosis slight, Macrocytes slight) IgG was low, Uric Acid Serum low, Phosphorus Serum low, MCV high, MCH high, MCHC low, RBC Low. I have found the rheumatologists I ve been to aren t very open to possibilities when all the autoimmune diseases are ruled out, even though they do run on my paternal side of the family which consist of RA, Lupus, Takiatsyu s Arteritis, Sjogren s, Polyarteritis Nodosa, Addison s, and Hashimoto s. I would appreciate any expertise you can shed on possibilities to be tested or treated for. I currently have a neurologist 2 hours away and a Rheumatologist in that area as well. My Dr here will likely order any test I request. It seems everything has been ruled out according to my labs, but there has to be something that has been missed or not yet tested for.","Doctor":"hihope this msg finds u in good health. i have gone through your complaints and under stand your concern. u seem to be having some sort of vitamin or hormonal imbalance which might be causing multiple complaints.  osteoporosis seems to be more likely that might b causing calcium deficiency in ur body.i suggest u get an detailed blood profile done including calcium and magnesium. . dexa scan for bones.nothing to worry about. hope your question has been answered. if u have any follow up queries, feel free to consult me anytime. thanks Take care god bless"},{"Patient":"I have had increasing pain in my left chest just under the breast for two weeks.

Any ideas, trying not to get anxious, could use some ideas.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out cardiac chest pain in your case because it is commonly seen in left side of chest. So first get done ecg and 2d echo. If both are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes uncontrolled stress and anxiety can also cause similar kind of chest pain. Your involuntary finger movement is absolute seen on stress and anxiety. So consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You will need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, you will be alright with counselling and anxiolytic drugs.  Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My left leg is 5 cm shorter than my right.

Welcome to HCM.This can be due to infection causing inflammation of bowel & pain.But as you have mentioned lower back pain, it is more likely due to a stone in urinary tract.This stone causes obstruction to urine outflow, so smooth muscles in urinary tract contract excessively to overcome this obstruction & so is the pain.Many such patients come to my clinic to whom I advise ultrasound abdomen & pelvis, X-ray KUB, urine routine, renal function tests & CBC.For temporary pain relief, smooth muscle relaxants like drotaverine and diclofenac, tamsulosin are prescribed.Definitive treatment is done accordingly.Hope this helps.Wish you healthy life.Thanks.Regards."},{"Patient":"I had third degree burns on my left upper thigh and left arm in 1994.

In 1996, I contracted Ross River Virus. My GP dismisses the aching as age-related - I am 65.

As both are acting together the pain level is high. Lets say on a VAS scale as between 5-8.Now the reason why hot packs helps is because it leads to improve the circulation and provide the soothing effect.

My doctor seemed very concerned and a little puzzled. He took my blood, then declared I had acute pharyngitis and almost hospitalized me, but gave me an abx shot, made two housecalls, and gave me another shot a few days later. I lived, but it was a week of being very very sick. Less than a year later, I got the stiff neck again. Hoping it was a crick, I went to a chiropractor. As soon as he snapped my neck, an overwhelming feeling of sickness overcame me, and the fever ensued. I got to 105 again, and my throat got sore. I went to a doctor (this was a different town, so not my regular doctor. He was rather detached and uncaring since I needed help to walk I was so weak) He gave me abx shot. The fever would not get below 103.5 no matter how much tylenol and motrin I took. It stayed around 105 and a smidge above for 5 solid days, even with all the medicine. I began having horrible cramping spasms in some tube in my belly every 17 seconds and then vomited bile every 20 seconds for 24 hours exactly. It was like being in labor, wave after wave of acute squeezing, then profuse vomiting. It was horrific. I filled up 2 small trash cans with bile and was profoundly sick.

After about 30 mins I noticed by butt started to feel a little sore and stiff but for every other part of my body it felt comfortable so I just ignored the soreness. After about an hour and a half more spread out throughout the day of doing this I still felt sore and stiff but there was no pain and it disappeared almost as soon as I stood up. I got on the bus and went home with no problems big enough to remember. That was Friday, on Saturday I started to notice in my tailbone area it was sore and stiff (like before at school) but there was no pain until later in the day and it was very minimal; 1-3. On Sunday I started to notice it was getting worse and by the later part of the day was so bad I would have to adjust my sitting position every few seconds and started to take acetaminophen to help get through the day. There is almost no pain whatsoever when I stand or lay down but sitting for more then a minute felt like torture. It is now Monday for me and I have not taken any acetaminophen as of yet and I feel a lot less pain then yesterday (from 7-8 to 4-6) but it is still there.

And if not treated promptly, arrhythmia can be life threatening. So consult cardiologist and get done 1. Ecg 2. 2d echo 3. Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of ecg). You may need anti arrhythmia drug on the basis of these reports. Don't worry, you will be alright. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of stress and anxiety related symptoms is more. But better to first rule out heart diseases for your palpitations and left sided discomfort. So get done ecg and 2d echo. If both these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. No need to consult neurologist. Better to consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on it's solution. You will definitely improve with anxiolytic (destressor) drugs along with counselling sessions. You can continue b 12 and propranolol till you consult psychiatrist. Don't worry, you will be alright. Avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hello! I may be being a tad over cautious here, but last night I fell on the stairs; my upper right thigh had a direct impact with the edge of a stair. It hurt however I slept it off- today was okay, but about 12 hours ago my thigh began to throb. I can no longer bend my leg without pain. I can stand on the afflicted leg, but attempting to crouch on it is impossible, as is crossing my legs and I m getting severe pain using it to climb the stairs. I do not have any bruises or swelling, but the pain I m having is unusual for a simple knock to the thigh. Could you give me some advice? Thank you!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. It is quite possible that you might be having hair line feature that is causing this worsening pain and symptoms after 12 hours of fall. So in my opinion, you should first get done x ray of affected thigh to rule out hairline fracture. If x ray is normal then no need to worry for this. Sometimes inflammation in the injured muscle can cause worsening of symptoms after 6-10 hours. So avoid movements especially weight bearing. Apply warm water pad on affected areas. Take painkiller and anti inflammatory drugs. Take proper bed rest with minimal mobilization. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these in 1-2 weeks. But better to first get done x ray to rule out hairline fracture.Hope I have solved your query .I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

(Between knuckles on both sides of hand). Pain goes down both fingers. Hand feels tight. Hurts most of day especially when gripping or twisting. Any information would be appreciated. I was shocked that mri was normal.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Since your MRI and x ray is normal, no need to worry for major musculoskeletal cause for your hand pain. Sometimes, calcium, vitamin D3 and vitamin B12 deficiency can also cause similar kind of hand pain. So get done blood reports for calcium, vitamin D3 and vitamin B12 level. If there is deficiency then you have to start supplements. Application of warm water pad and ice packs alternatively will also give you symptomatic benefit. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have been going through parmenopause Sp? my lower back is constantly hurting, my right lower abdomen is hurting. it is sometimes hard to breath when standing and sitting. the abdominal pain is getting worse. I put a call into my dr. my lower back pack is the worst.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Paramenopausal women are at increased risk of osteoporosis due to low estrogen and progesterone. This osteoporosis is the most likely cause for your lower backache. So consult orthopedic doctor and get done clinical examination of your back and x ray of lumber spine. If it is osteoporosis then you have to start supplements of calcium and vitamin D3. Right lower abdominal pain is mostly due to ovaries. So get done ultrasound examination of abdomen for this. Also consult gynecologist and get done hormone levels to rule out hormonal imbalance. You may need hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I was on hydrocodone all last year and since I broke my ankle I ve been in pain once off pain meds! I have to travel this week so I m scared of not walking. My ankle is still hurting! However my previous MD is not up here in Michigan where I moved. Otherwise I would have contacted him. Dr s extremely limited here!","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should consult orthopedic doctor for your ankle pain. You broke your ankle before 1 year and still getting severe pain if you stop your painkiller. This suggest that either there is poor healing of fracture or there is nerve impringment (nerve in between two fracture segments). So consult orthopedic doctor and get done clinical examination and MRI of that ankle joint for the diagnosis of above mentioned possibilities. You may need re surgery for proper fracture healing.

I am trying to get rid of the water retention. Can I use hydrochlorothiazide 25 MG for both. I have to take a least 2 a day to get rid of 80% of the water retention. I have been taking Amlodipine 2.5mg once a day. then I took all 3 but I think that is too much, so I am going to try dropping the Amlodipine. What do you think.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Don't try to drop amlodipine dose. Hydrochlorthiazide (HCT) is diuretic drug. It has no effect in blood pressure reduction. It increases urine out put, thus relieves pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs). So you can take it twice daily for 1week then once a day. Yes, you can take amlodipine along with HCT. Combination of both will be beneficial for you. Don't stop or taper down amlodipine otherwise you will get high blood pressure.

Now he is saying he feels cold inside, has a headache, whole body aches and its sore to touch, muscle and joints hurt, gets dizzy if standing to long, and has been falling asleep on and off all day","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Food poisoning causes gastritis, vomiting and diarrhea. Vomiting and diarrhea causes loss of fluid and electrolytes (sodium and potassium) from the body. Gastritis and vomiting cause less appetite and decreased oral intake. So overall patient is dehydrated and sodium, potassium depleted. These can cause all the symptoms like headache, generalized body ache, muscle and join pain, giddiness, sleepiness etc. Best treatment for this is oral rehydration solution (ORS) and fruit juices. So ask your fried to drink plenty of fluids orally including ORS (2 liters per day) and fruit juices. Better not to take hot, spicy and outside food. Don't worry, your friend will improve with all these in 2-3 days. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your friend.

It is not a cramp or rls but a pulsating slightly burning uncomfortable pain that wakes me from sleep. As soon as I get un the pain goes away. I was wondering if there is any correlation between the two? Thank you","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. No, Allegra can not cause such pulsating leg pain. Allegra is having fexofenadine. It is antihistamine. It has nothing to do with such leg pain. So there is no correlation between your Allegra ingestion and this chest pain. In my opinion, you should get done left lower limb arterial and venous color doppler to rule out DVT (deep venous thrombosis) and varicose veins as both of these can cause similar kind of unilateral pulsating pain. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have a full thickness tear of anterior tibiofibular/syndesmotic ligament in my ankle confirmed from mri scan. Also the xray shows widening of the tib and fib. Would this require a screw?? The surgeon suggested will be hard to know until they have a look inside.. Do you have anything to add? or opinions? Thankyou Rick","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should wait for spontaneous healing rather than jumping directly to the surgery. In 50% cases, such Complete tear can be heal with 1. Avoidance of weight bearing 2. Complete bedrest. 3. Ankle cast for immobilization. 4. Painkiller and anti inflammatory drugs. Do all thesethese for 4 weeks and get done repeat MRI. If it is healing then no need for surgery. But if it is non healing then get done arthroscopic surgical repair of this ligament. In this, screws are needed. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. Progressive systemic sclerosis is an auto immune disease. There is no cure for this disease but with immunosuppressive drugs like corticosteroids, methotrexate, azathioprine etc, you can control the disease activity and reduce your sufferings. So better to consult rheumatologist and discuss all these. You will need combination of immunosuppressive drugs in taper down fashion with close monitoring. You have to take these drugs for life long. So consult rheumatologist. It is very difficult to assume life expectancy in this disease. But with proper treatment, patients can live upto the age of 45-50 years. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

It s been that way for about 7 years. The pain comes mostly when it s subjected to wind or cold weather.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should definitely consult doctor and get done clinical examination of your right axilla. Recurrent lumps, discharging fluid etc are more suggestive of lymphnode enlargement and discharging sinuses. This is commonly seen with tuberculosis and other bacterial infection. So get done microscopic examination of discharge and ultrasound examination of axilla. If lymphnodes are enlarged then you will need fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Also rule out diabetes because uncontrolled sugar levels can also cause such discharge. For your leg pain, get done x ray of lumber spine to rule out nerve root compression. Consult doctor and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I do have a lot of excess tissue around my lump, causing a more prominent breast on my left side opposed to me right (which is flat with no lump). I do have a history of cancer in the family in both sides; my dad s mum has had breast cancer and my mums dad died of esophagus cancer which had spread. We don t know my dad s dad so are only aware of 75% of my genetic pool.

I can understand your concern. Yes, you should definitely concern for this lump in pectoral region. You are having strong family history of cancers especially breast cancer, so we should definitely investigate your lump. So consult doctor and get done clinical examination of this lump. Also get done mammography and ultrasound examination of left breast and axilla to know the exact size of the lump and axillary lymphnodes are involved or not. You may need fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) or excision Biopsy of the lump to rule out breast cancer. Your bloating is mostly due to GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease).

Take painkiller and anti inflammatory drugs. Wear crap bandage also. For menstrual abnormality, possibility of hormonal imbalance is more.

You should first try non surgical measures like physiotherapy, warm water pad application, Avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid sudden bending and change of posture.

RF, CCP, ESR, LUPUS ARE NEGATIVE. slightly elevated CRP now and in the past. I feel lousy!! any thoughts? 63 yr old female","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. As your tests show negative for RF, ESR, CCP, Lupus, you do not have rheumatoid arthritis. I can describe you how you can differentiate between arthritis and fibromyalgia. Arthritis is a degenerative joint problem associated with the aging process. It is related with the bone pain. So if you think that the pain you have is increased while having joint movements or the joints make sounds while moving them, then you have osteoarthritis.Firbomyalgia is a disorder associated with muscles. Joints or bones are not involved in this pathology. In addition, this disorder is associated with sleep problems, excessive fatigue, and specific trigger points which will start or increase pain in the muscles. In addition, if you will stay inactive, sit in a place for a long time or after waking up from sleep, you will feel the joints are unable to move and then eventually it will improve.However, both diseases will require long term analgesics to control pain. You can visit a pain clinic or neurologist for alternate ways to manage pain.I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing HCM. I wish you feel better soon.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"I need to find a doctor in North Carolina who will treat a labral tear.

Q......Why my steroid treated leg started to swell and is more painful than the one that did not have steroid treatment ?","Doctor":"Hello I have studied your case,For gout you may need medicine accordingly and diet restriction.For gout you may need medicine like  febuxostat you need to continue according to blood uric acid level consulting his treating doctor.Acute flare can lead to leg swelling.Ideal time for sleep should be from 10 pm to 4 am for good rest for your organs. Food to be avoided in diet includes AlcoholAlcohol reduces the ability of your body to excrete uric acid via the kidneys and urine. If your gout is severe or you are having an attack, avoid alcohol completely. Increase your daily intake of water. As the water is turned into urine, it carries uric acid out of your body. Institute of Medicine recommends that adult men drink 3 litres of water daily; women should drink 2 litres.Processed CarbohydratesProcessed carbohydrates and sugars take the place of healthy carbohydrates, such as fruits and vegetables, in your diet. Although no direct link has been established between sugar intake and gout severity, high sugar intake can contribute to obesity, a risk factor for gout. The fibre in fruits, vegetables and whole grains may also help carry excess uric acid out of your body.Hope this answers your query.

I will be happy to answer your queries. Wishing you good health.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi...I am 24, 5ft 4\\", and I am 160lbs. I have no medical history. I do have breast cancer in the family.

Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answring your query.It could be just a simple intestinal infection specially if you eat from outside. This could be detected by a stool test for ova and cyst and could be treated if positive. Apart from this, because of the history of tuberculosis, if I were your doctor, I would advise you to rule out subacute intestinal obstruction by getting a CECT scan apart from a physical examination of the abdomen at the time of pain. Further management would depend on the reports of investigations. I would also advise you not to smoke because of the very many complications which could harm you in the long run.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

It would have been helpful if you had mentioned what surgery you have been through and for what disorder. If you have had surgery in the head and neck region under general anesthesia, then you must been put on the wooden block under your shoulders and back to raise the surgical region and have better vision and accessibility for the surgeon. If that is the case, then due to being still on the wooden block for long time may make muscles stiff and you may feel pain in all the areas you have mentioned. The wrist pain may be experienced due to injection of IV anesthesia and medicines. If this is the case, then analgesics that you must have been prescribed after surgery and local application of Diclogesic Sodium gel (Volini) can help.If the condition is not what I have thought, then you should discuss the problem with your  surgeon for other possibilities.I hope this information helps you.

There has never been any pain or soreness. A massage therapist told me that it was an accumulation of toxins. Most of the time it disappears after I get a massage. It is on a off and on basis so i can t relate it to anything, for example infections or meds. It doesn t just appear when I m sick either. Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. It seems that you have developed a cyst in the area concerned. It is definitely not accumulation of toxins as there is no medical condition that can be described with these words for swelling. Cysts are fluid filled cavities that are lined by a layer of cells (epithelium). They are usually painless unless infected and they usually disappear on their own when they rupture and then reappear as they again collect the fluids. They do not recur only if they are removed along with the lining. As long as the lining will be present in the body, it will keep recurring.Thus, I advise you to visit an ENT surgeon due to its presence in the neck area to confirm the diagnosis of the cyst or something else. Based on the confirmed diagnosis, treatment can be advised. I also caution you against massaging the area repeatedly until the diagnosis is made.I hope this information helps.

My father is sick. he is suffring from hard swllon in just upper right site of neck. he is taking the antibiotics (Amoxy+clavulanate K+ 625) but not treat succesfully. pain is more. what can i do for complete treatment?","Doctor":"Hi Sushil,I can understand your concern. Painful swelling on the upper side of the neck can be due to either throat or tooth infection. Both infections can be controlled with the antibiotics that is prescribed to your father by the doctor. Amoxicillin and Clavulanic Acid combination is a very strong antibiotic that combats almost all head and neck region infections. However, antibiotics do take about 36 to 48 hours to reach the desired level in blood that is needed to decrease the load of bacteria and intensity of infection. Thus, if your father has just started medicines, then he should wait for a day or two to have the effects and finish antibiotic course. For the relief of pain, he can take Acetaminophen 500 mg or Ketorolac 10 mg up to thrice a day. If the swelling and pain still persists after the end of course of antibiotics, then an examination of swelling in relation to neck problems by ENT specialist should be done. In absence of throat or neck problems, a dentist should be consulted to look for focus of infection in the oral cavity.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HCM.

This person is 60 yrs old and has just had hip replacement surgery on the left side. The right hip will need to be replaced in the next two years. Bone on bone, the same with the left. The doctor and physical therapist have both given a nod to return to cycling. I believe it is the repetitive cycling on a daily basis for years that has caused the breakdown in the hip joints to begin with. Am I correct in my thinking on this? Thank you so much.","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history.As per the history mentioned , the assumption can be made but cannot be drawn onto the same. As the pathology of the hip joint may be something different like the RA hip or the OA hip. Also, due to cycling there is more of the strain at the knee joint and lest at the hip. The hip joint may have had some past injury as well.Now since he has undergone one side hip replacement, I feel he needs more of the Strengthening of the hip muscles. Which by doing cycling can not be achieved.performing a proper hip strengthening exercises can help alot to the muscular system and in turn help support the skeletal system as well.Regards Jay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I had an accident 3 months ago and the shock and trauma caused a lot of nerve and muscle aches. I have been under a lot of stress, I am also a very emotional person. Two cervical vertebraes were herniated and a lot of numbness and tingling on the fingers of the right hand. My neck, shoulder, right arm and scapula were affected I tried physiotherapy but that was too painful as I couldn t even be touched. I started seeing an osteopath who has been helping me, I have slowly started to get better however as soon as I feel stressed or get nervous a bit,the pain comes right back. I feel very tired and down and continuously feel like vomiting yet I don t but the nausea feeling is always there. My mind is continuously thinking and worrying of some sort but this nauseated feeling is starting to concern me. Can you please suggest what I can do and how do I go about finding out what is wrong with me. Thank you!","Doctor":"hi,thank-you for providing the brief history.As you have herniated disc in the cervical spine and also the pain is high in nature. The first advice is to provide a stability to the skeletal system of the cervical spine by using a hard collar.The next step is to take a proper guidance of a physician an take anti-inflammatory medication.The followed by step will be to undergo physical therapy like TENS therapy and therapeutic ultrasound therapy. No neck mobility is performed until the symptoms are lowered.Also an MRI is of due importance to understand the extent of the spinal column disc injury.regards Jay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Hi I have this chin quivering problem since my birth ...it starts automatically and stop as well...but after it starts I can not stop it even if I try....this problems is genetic in my case as I think because my two paternal aunts too have this problems. ..so I just wanna know can this be cure as I feel so uncomfortable in ftont of people as they only notice my chin so get nervous too.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. I can think of more than one possibilities for your case. Firstly, if we consider more common causes, Vitamin B12 deficiency and spasm of the chin muscle can be considered. Vitamin B12 level in blood can be determined by a blood test. If deficient, supplements can be taken which will restore the level and help in suppression of the trembling. Muscle spasm can be diagnosed by specific muscle tests done by an expert, in your case, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon. If it is found to be the cause, physiotherapy to strengthen the chin muscles and muscle relaxants can help. However, there is a rare disorder that causes chin trembling and is hereditary in origin. It is called \\"familial or hereditary trembling of chin\\". An oral surgeon can examine you for that and can help you understand the problem in detail. If this is the cause, then unfortunately, nothing can be done to stop the quivering as the defect is in the gene and cannot be corrected.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HCM. Take care.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"Uncle fell few days ago and bruised his lower right leg on outside it was a little swollen but today about 4 hrs ago he sad it started to be painful to the touch and hot not sure what to do.

At times also I could just be standing and my knee just pops similar to cracking your knuckles. I have pain with just walking and I am unable to bear wear weight.","Doctor":"Hello, I have studied your case. According to your symptoms and findings there is osteoarthritis of your knee.You can start cartilage protecting medication like chondritin sulphate, that you need to take for couple of months.I will advise to do X ray knee and if required MRI knee can be done and if there is severe destruction of menisci then arthroscopic shaving can be done.Physiotherapy like ultrasound and tens will help, along with knee exercises.Life style changes will help in reducing pain which include,LOAD REDUCTION : Protecting the joint from excessive load may slow down the rate of cartilage loss. It is also effective in relieving pain. The heavier you are, the more stress you put on your joints. Weight reduction for obese patients, wearing shock-absorbing shoes, avoiding activities like climbing stairs and using a walking stick are worthwhile.ACTIVITY MODIFICATION -It is important to maintain as much activity and joint motion as possible, but impact activities will aggravate arthritis. Running and jumping will often accelerate cartilage loss from the joint. The key is to focus on low impact activities, such as swimming or cycling.  USING CANES: Assistive devices can make it easier to go about your day without stressing your painful joint. A cane may take weight off your knee or hip as you walk. Carry the cane in the hand opposite the leg that hurts. ANALGESIC MEDICATION : Simple over the counter medications like acetaminophen is sufficient in most cases. If this fails to control pain, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug may be better.   VISCOSUPPLEMENTATION: Hyaluronic acid injections given into the joint (especially large joints like knee joint) in prescribed dosages will give good short term pain relief in arthritic joints ranging from 1-2 years.Hope this answers your query.
