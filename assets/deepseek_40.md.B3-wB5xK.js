For that, I suggest you take Levofloxacin like the antibiotic course for 2-4 week. Drink more water and more fruits. The chymotrypsin containing tablet also should be taken for two weeks. If still, blood persists than MRI pelvis can be planned for further workup. Meanwhile, try to ejaculate semen every 4 days to decrease inflammation. Hope I have answered your query.

That is why I told you HEAD ON. Positive imagination is psychotherapy way. Close your eyes. Imagine that you are in the panic creating situation.

Clive Spiegel Psychiatrist greetings, I have to discuss the case of my daughter who is now 25 years old is elder among all. her name is X. she Is not like a complete normal child. I have three other children, 1 son and 2 more daughters who all are very intelligent and good. X is very aggressive, left studies, don't care about her personal hygiene, don't know how to react and how to be like in a gathering, she shouts and gets angry over pity nothing. she is hormonally ok and C.T scan was also normal we had her checkups with psychiatrists but each time condition gets worsened. she talks to herself in her room or even in public, she is too fat also. doesn't care about herself. fights with her siblings and also with me a lot even pinches and hurt us all and my other children. she has developed a habit of collecting things from a needle to even a food items, after having her own she even takes other's things she has habit of stealing and hiding things. shouts a lot and sometimes love isolation but sometimes wish to sit with all but when she does so she keeps on murmuring in public.well there is little background behind all this, as my husband is a great Father and husband but initially and even now we always had clashes regarding our relatives and in-laws. before her birth while I was expecting her I was under extreme stressful conditions. I had a forceps delivery of her which seemed to be normal. it took her some minutes to breathe for first time. until she was 5 years old she was or seemed to be all normal but suddenly I started I realized she was a little different from other children of her  age. her father is very short tempered and she was also a victim to it. her father don't allowed me to have regular terms with my family so in this way our  social circle got reduced. she loved to visit her relatives of both side mine and my husband but only my husband relatives used to came and stay with us and eventually her performance in school got poor and she failed in 2nd grade. I used to respect and serve my in-laws a lot but everytime there was something which my husband took as a cause of fight with me after his relatives are gone. my first baby i.e. X is witness of our many fights while with birth of my other children time changed and my husband's temper improved. I don't mean to say he is bad person as I said he loves his children a lot and is extra-ordinary caring but is too aggressive as well but reacts un relevantly in situations when there is no need of scold in way that he does but he do and sometimes he need to scold but doesn't. he loves me too but don't likes my family and the case is my children loves my family and this is always cause of conflict in our home. he don't allow much to weddings and parties of my family although my children wishes to and my daughter X also wished to and now the situation is she is a little clever in a way that she know in front of whom she can react like differently and in front of whom she have to react in normal manner. as in our home her father is the only person she fears of and when he asks her not to shout etc she obeys him but reacts oppositely to me and my children. because of her we all are very disturbed. my two children are medical students and one is engineer student. we kept on getting her chekups but we have got no visible results. on the advice of a psychiatrist we had given X Aripiprazole but this drug made her a bit slow and sleepy although her mood developed and her habit of collecting things was also removed but then as she became too slow we left the drug after consulting the same doctor. we don't know what to do now as she is too old now marriage seems an impossible for her and I am worried what will she do or what will happen to her after us.

She is 40 (my age), successful and has her own posh house, full time maid and lives alone. I stay over at her house very often at her behest (she gets very upset when I go back to my house for a day or two) so have observed the following symptoms up close: •     Tension, inability to control anger, lack of life satisfaction •     Sleep problems •     Headache, chronic pain and migraine •     Low and depressed mood, frequent crying spells, tearfulness, increase fatigability, negative thinking, ideas of self harm (increased at PMS)•     Suspiciousness, unusual and odd thinking, irritability, self absorbed behavior with family members•     Overspending in bouts (typically clothes, later doesn’t wear purchases), increase energy at times – goes for tennis or jogging at 5 am or late evening (constantly told by mother that she is unattractive and over weight, that she is a failure in relationships that is why men leave her)•     Ideas of increased self importance due to owning her own posh house and having a full time maid at one’s beck and call: yells if any command is not obeyed instantly – thus expects implicit “obedience” from everyone around her, even strangers e.g. mall/restaurant service/etc.1st Major problem with ex-boyfriend: not letting go of “abusive relationship”She was dating a guy Amitav 4 years ago who got engaged to her without telling his parents, then she got cancer so was in touch with an old boyfriend (now married) which led to various issues. Amitav has not held a job since then, was sponging off her constantly as she paid for all their holidays, meals, bought him expensive gifts. I finally got her to leave him a few months back (lived with her for a full month to support her), but he kept chasing her and has now got very increasingly abusive in his emails and sms to her (calls her whore etc). He abuses her so badly that she falls sick and her periods get either infrequent or happen too often. One day I came home and she had actually invited him over, saying never mind I love him it’s ok. She talks about him every day under some excuse or the other, despite my telling her that she needs to put him in the past. Finally he has stopped but now she misses his attention. Yesterday she screamed at the maid because she was late coming back from her first visit to family, called her a bloody bitch and then was screaming her head off full day at home. At night she knocked on my door at 2 am, dissolved into tears and requested me to sleep next to her as she was missing Amitav very badly.2nd Major problem with family/maid: unreasonable and short temperedShe is very short tempered and abusive with her close family, and snaps at the tiniest opportunity, and flares up when they say anything to her (wanted to borrow ragged jacket for US trip from niece, sister said it would not suit her so she lost her temper and bought/carried 4 jackets with her on trip). She screams at her full time maid for no reason and flies off the handle. I find it very difficult to witness her temper and she gets angry that I am not supporting her as she feels she is justified as the maid or family members who are the one misbehaving. She keeps citing examples where she has done a lot for the family and feels that they constantly misbehave with her. They are fed up with her short temperedness.3rd issue: Now facing problems at work: dark mood swings/suicidal thoughtsShe has now started facing problems at work as the top management does not like her interference and she is getting suicidal. She gets black moods lying in bed crying her eyes out saying she doesn’t want to live, made worse by her infrequent spotting period. She screams so badly that I find it very difficult as I don't like people screaming but I don't want to leave her as she has become emotionally dependent on me. She keeps crying for her old ex even though he is abusive with her as she feels he loved her and she will not get anyone else. She is exhibiting clear addiction to him. Yesterday she confided at night that she kept calling and smsing him as she was feeling lonely, thankfully he hadn’t responded. Please suggest further course of action.","Doctor":"HiThanks for using healthcare magicI think, she has underline borderline personality disorder and that mood swings are part of the it.

However, it is advised that it should be used only for short duration. Long term intake can lead to dependence.However, in your case, I won't say that you have become addicted as of now. Your not falling asleep might be because of the fact that your depression/ anxiety is still persisting. Also, many people develop a psychological dependence that they can't sleep with out the sleeping pill. I would suggest that you should discuss regarding this with your psychiatrist. If needed you anti-depressant medications might need a review. Its better to stop sedatives as early as possible so as to prevent any chance of dependence. Zolpidem has to be tapered when you are trying to stop it. Hope this information was useful.

As a father, you can discuss his problems on a regular basis with him. Give him time to open up and let him speak whatever he wants to. You would really be helpful, if you could just listen to him without being judgmental. Slowly you can motivate him to seek treatment. Also exercising on a daily basis is advisable.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"I am a 30 yr old female and when I first wake up in the morning my heart rate is 84, but during the day it stays around 96bpm. I suffer from bad panic attacks and lately have been obsessing over my pulse. Today I got anxious after I ate and my pulse went to 120. Should I be worried or is it just anxiety causing the increase in my heart rate? After I calmed down it has went back down to 96bpm. I do not suffer from dizziness or shortness of breath. But, I do suffer from many panic attack symptoms while suffering an attack. Is there any advice on how to quit obsessing over my pulse? Should the 120bpm while having an attack alarm me and should I see a doctor over it? Thanks","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. There are certain things you should know. Fear is fearing something which is present. Apprehension is imagination.

Now, in your case, pulse and heart rate is a bit high because of your apprehension and anxiety. Checking pulse is not a bad option, because you have the problem here. What you have to change is, the anxiety and apprehension. You should tell me what are the causes of your anxiety? For how many days it is present etc. For now start with drinking plenty of water, meditate whenever you can and deep breath, exercise daily.

I suggest you not to worry much. Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity that can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, feelings and sense of well-being. Depressed mood is not always a psychiatric disorder. It may also be a normal reaction to certain life events, a symptom of some medical conditions, or a side effect of some drugs or medical treatments. This is what you should know. Depression need not be treated with medicines, in the first hand. It requires life style changes so that the mind acquires the capacity of coming out of the current negative feelings.

I'm trying to get a second opinion on behalf of my doctors choice getting mri of my genital rectal area. I'm going to be very descriptive in my message in hopes to solve my problem so bare with me. I had an injury about a year ago and I'm still having problems. I've been to multiple doctors with multiple tests and they're still no conclusive answers. tests such as cat scans MRI and physical examination of the rectum with no answer.  I was going mountain biking and I crashed on the bike frame on my groin and I felt a pop. But i thought nothing of it and walked it off. ( im now going to be semi explicit about my intimate relations with my partner).  during intercourse i felt that same \\"pop\\" in left side in my perineum and felt a horrible pain in my left testicle shooting down my leg and in my lower left abdominal/sigmoid area. this immediately stopped my erection and my genitalia shrunk drastically. i panicked and thought i may have ruptured something. went to the hospital that day and had an ultrasound on my testicles. they were still getting blood. so i thought nothing of it. i did a self rectal exam and found a small pea sized green lump around my perineum/anal area, thought it might be a hemmroid. but it just got worse over time. so here i am a year later with no answers. since this episode it has triggered major depression and psychological symptoms which im proud to say have subsided tremendously. but im now single because of the incident. so here are the tests that ive been through: cat scan, to see for any internal bleeding or hernia/ results negative. mri of spine /results nerves are completely unharmed. plenty of rectal exams/ results feels normal and same with prostate. checked for ininguil hernia/ no hernia except some minor swelling in spermatic cord. ultrasound of bladder/ results slight urine retention which is abnormal for my age given no enlarged prostate. physical exam and probing of abdominal area/ results no feelings of protruding organs. multiple blood tests/ results normal. Here are the symptoms im having to this day/ throbbing pain in left abdominal/ left testicle that radiates down my inner left leg. muscle spasms in lower left abdominal/ left inner leg/ rectal area/ bladder/ perineum/ penis. urinary dysfunction- hard to push out last bit of urine. bowel dysfunction- hard to pass stool, and when i do, the first part is very dry and lumpy and always has a curve fallowed by abnormaly long stool as in about two feet long. scrotum is tight and cold and is relieved once unrinary/bowel evacuation is complete. which my scrotum was always loose and comfortable before the injury. a feeling of rectal fullness even after defacation. feeling as if something is hanging out but nothing is. my diet is very healthy and full of water and fiber, so constipation is not the problem. feces looks healthy but looks like it gets stuck in a certain part of the sigmoid. There is clearly something that isn't working and i need to find out what happened. hopefully after reading this large description I hope you can have a certain condition in mind. my doctor has giving me the choice of either a colonoscopy or MRI of pelvic region. which is the best choice? which specialist will be most helpful? can you think anything that all these problems could be? like a bowel obstruction, rectal prolapse, collapsed bowel/bladder? keep in mind when the injury (pop) occurred i was in a squatting position with erectile blood putting quite a bit of pressure on my pelvic floor. so what in the world happened to me? im desperate for answers. thanks for reading and the advice.","Doctor":"Hello, It may be due to trauma or injury.

Bst rgds Camilla","Doctor":"Hi Camilla,Mirtazapine is an effective anti-depressant with sedation and increase in weight as its significant side effects. As an antidepressant, there are many alternatives to mirtazapine. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like escitalopram, sertraline, etc are effective and safe. It causes lesser weight gain than mirtazapine but is not as effective sedative. Bupropion has least association with weight gain. However, is also not sedating.As you have mentioned that your sleep problems are triggered by depression, I think starting these anti-depressants with short term sedatives will solve your problem.Sedating anti-depressants include agomelatine and tricyclic antidepressants like amitryptilline.

If someone is in stress for long period like for years, then it could cause somatic symptoms like headache, bodyache, etc. In you case, bloody diarrohea is due to infection, not due to stress.Thanks"},{"Patient":"i cry everyday .i have the best parents . the best family .still i dont know the reason why i cryi am in 12 standard . i am very stressed . because my exams are near and because of crying i am loosing my concentration please help . i feel like dying","Doctor":"Hi,You seem to be under lot of stress.

In addition, he will not do any physical labor, which includes picking anything up after himself.  If I could attach a picture of his home office here, I would. It appears a hoarder is living there.

Whether it is due to his personality or due to some psychiatric disorder is difficult to comment from the information provided. Hoarding as a behavior can occur in obsessive compulsive disorder as well as anankastic personality disorder.I would suggest you to seek a psychiatric consultation for your husband in person.

You can rewire your brain by staying happy by rewarding your brain with activities you like ,music ,food etc.Slowly and steadily you will get out of your inferiority just by ignoring obsessive sexy thoughts.

Now currently on loxapine 10mg and paroxetine. Is treating acute psychosis with loxapine and SSRI a correct treatment for acute psychosis? Is there any chance of complete recovery? How is acute psychosis different from schizophernia?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query.I understand that you are concerned about the treatment of your psychiatric problem. Regarding the medication that you are on, Loxapine is an anti-psychotic medication which is used to treat psychotic disorders like acute psychosis. But Paroxetine is an anti-depressant medication used to treat depressive and anxiety disorders. I'm not sure why you have been prescribed an anti-depressant when you have mentioned that your diagnosis was acute psychosis. Please clarify this with your doctor.The difference between acute  psychosis and Schizophrenia is that acute psychosis occurs suddenly and lasts only for a short duration (usually less than a month), whereas Schizophrenia is a chronic condition, usually characterized by relapses. Acute psychosis has a good chance of complete recovery, but Schizophrenia usually requires long-term treatment and monitoring.Wish you all the best.Regards,Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"Hai doctor , I'm taking sizodon 0.5mg and nexito 10mg , I had two attacks of depression while I was studying  , first one 6 yrs back and other 2 yrs back , l was studious nd used to get up early in the morning for studies , bt after this event I lost the drive to get up early and infact lost the drive for anything .but some how I managed to get through my pg entrance exam nd I'm doing ophthalmology pg , bt I'm afraid will I I be able to cope up with the hectic schedule here","Doctor":"Hi,It seems that you are suffering from recurrent depressive disorder and are suffering from depressive symptoms even at present. Nexito (escitalopram) is an effective treatment for depression. Had I been your treating psychiatrist, considering your current state, I would have increased the dose of escitalopram gradually to 20 mg/ day. I am not sure about why you had been put on sizodon (risperidon).

Before I go ahead and tell you about the treatment, one caution-- you must seek a formal psychiatric consultation in person for proper diagnosis and prescription. Self treatment is not what I would recommend.For deciding the exact drug, many factors need to be kept in mind. I would like to know your age, and whether you are suffering from any other medical disorder. Considering you are free from any medical condition, I would recommend one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like escitalopram or sertraline initially, gradually increasing the dose depending on the response.These are generally safe with very few side effects. The important thing to remember is that the medications will take time to act, the response will be gradual. Once your symptoms are over, they will have to be continued for few months after that in order to minimise any chance of recurrence. Hope this information was helpful.

He does not have insurance, and we can't afford an out of pocket doctor visit. Saturday he was complaining that he felt dizzy, and was also confused. That night, he started hallucinating. He was very upset by what he was seeing, I eventually called 911. Four cop cars, a ambulance, and fire truck later, we were told that it was probably a side effect of his meds. It happenened again two nights later, but I was able to calm him a bit. I'm not a doctor, but I think it is being caused by the sertraline, and trazadone together.

Dementia is a broad category of brain diseases that includes any disease that causes loss of cognitive ability (the ability to think and reason clearly) that is severe enough to affect a person's daily functioning. It must also be a worsening of functioning compared to how the person was previously. The most common form of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Other common forms of dementia include: Lewy body dementia, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, normal pressure hydrocephalus and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. But whatever may be the form of dementia, hair cut is not related to the form, it is related to the patient. You and your people know the patient better than we here. You must have tried all conventional methods. A visit to the hairdresser, or a hairdresser coming to the house may be a better alternative. Many people with dementia continue to enjoy having their hair cut and styled and this can continue to be a pleasurable experience. It is like feeding a 2 year old child. You do so many roles to make the child eat. Discover some role and act it out and do the haircut.Hope this answers your query.

Your anxiety and depressive thoughts regarding the removed gall bladder could have become the reason for the mood swings. In fact, gall bladder removal has become so common a surgical procedure. Negative thinking or apprehensions about body ailments could trigger mood swings. The pain under your ribs could possibly be due to acid reflux.

I do have a PayPal account but my Disability Benefits only comes in on Feb 27th. Sorry for wasting your time! Hi There! My sister is having a SCAN as the doctor wants to be sure she has diverticulitis ! I just found out about this (she went to the doctor s yesterday and is presently on a liquid diet until she can get her SCAN). The reason I contacted her today was because I am having problems myself with my bowels. I know for a fact I m low in fibre and I rarely drink water (just boring to drink). I wanted to know if taking probiotic supplements would help (as she swears by it)! I looked up this disease and I couldn t believe it! My systems also came on, all of a sudden. I haven t voided in almost 2 weeks (we went to Red Lobster for seafood). There was 2 days where I had such severe diareah but it was just liquid form and I only went once. What I couldn t believe is that it came on all of a sudden for my sister as well as myself (I have all the symptions too). To make things worse, I suffer from depression, severe anxiety and panic attacks and worse of all.... agoraphobia . My daughter and her 15 yr old Grandson just got tested for a bowel problem (which also sounds like this disease). The only reason I want him to get a second opinion is because, (you won t believe this), my husband has Chrohn s Disease. He only has about 4 inches of bowel left but he is in remission. He was diagnosted in his mid 20 s (and is now 57). He now has a permanent colostomy as the disease was all in his rectum, which had to be removed. They didn t have the medication to treat Chrohn s like they do today. His youngest sister was then diagnosed with Chrohn s disease about 5 years ago. T She s having a hard time and won t even consider a temporary colostomy to give her bowels a break! This is all too weird! As I did research, it is a type of bowel disease where most doctors feel there is no cure for...Wow!! I do have a question: if my husband has Chrohn s disease, would probiotic supplements be okay for him to take daily as well?? Good luck to the doctor that will answer this email! Thank you for your perusal and I m anxiously awaiting your reply! Carmen","Doctor":"hi...thanks for the query! The simlest answer to your query is Yes! though not proven conclusively but probiotic supplements are helpful in Crohns disease & are definately good to prevent problems like constipation, diverticulities. Secondly as you are suffering from anxiety disorder,it is very likely that sudden onset of your symptoms similar to those of your sister are manifestation of underlying anxiety only!

Hence you should consult a Psychiatrist to know about how to manage a child with AS & ADHD including role of medications like atypical antipsychotics. good luck"},{"Patient":"hi, my husband had typhoid 3 weeks before for which he had taken the complete treatment. but now he has sexual problem like weakening in erection which was never before. Is this due to typhoid? when it was corrected and we gain our normal sexual life?","Doctor":"Hi, Typhoid is not known to cause erectile dysfunction.

Yes your concerns as well as suspicions are correct. At 40 years age, one does not suddenly starts wetting bed. There can be few causes to this behaviour. First, does he drinks too much alcohol on a regular basis or consumes any intxicating drug before sleeping at night? Becasue intoxicated state can be the simple explanation for inability to get up to pass urine at night. Secondly if this has been a long standing behaviour as per you, has he suffered any traumatic experience? Does he suffers from frequent nightmares? This bd wetting may be due to re-experiencing stressful experiences which occurs in reaction to severe stress/post traumatic stress disorder. In any case, evaluation by a doctor preferably a Psychiatrist will be certainly helpful. Good luck"},{"Patient":"dear sir my name is vikram my brother suffering from mental illness since six years  his symptoms are like this he won't take both, brush etc. he getting angry on others, destroy all the things in house these are the few about him. please give me suggestion.thanking you sir","Doctor":"Hello Vikram. thanks for this query. How old is your brother? From your narration I get the impression that this behaviour is ongoing for last 6 yrs or so. Have you also noticed your brother to be smiling, muttering, gesturing while alone? Does he gets excessively suspicious of everyone including complete strangers? Does he talks complete illogical or non sensical things? If answers to these questions are affirmative, then he may be suffering from a Psychotic illness probably Schizophrenia. This illness if detected early can be easily managable & treatment with Antipsychotic drugs leads to resolution of psychotic symptoms. So that patient can resume/lead a normal to near normal life. Hence it is imperative on your part to consult a Psychiatrist as early as possible for a detailed evaluation & promptly starting treatment. Good luck & wishing your brother a speedy recovery."},{"Patient":"My father in law is suffering form anxiety and depression. Very often he talks about death and at times cries.He does not want to talk or interact with people.He sleeps when put under the influence of sleeping pills. His condition is getting bad with each passing day.I am worried.kindly advise.","Doctor":"Hi, Going by what you have mentioned your father seems to be suffering from depression, with significant severity. I would have liked to know if he suffers from any other disease like hypertension and diabetes too. Only taking sleeping pills will not help his depression. He needs regular anti-depressants, like sertraline or escitalopram. The medications can be increased in dose gradually depending on the response. Sleeping pills can be given in initial phase of treatment, but with caution and should be tapered off later. I would advise that your father in law visits a psychiatrist at the earliest.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"hiis it a sign of depression when i talk to myself very frequently. i kind of did something i should not and ever since i have been having trouble to sleep as i think i am going to die. i also get these head aches and its really annoying me now because in school i lack concentration and my mind wanders off very often these days.","Doctor":"Hi,Going by what you have mentioned, you are under stress definitely. Whether this is because of depression or anxiety disorder will need further information like duration of these symptoms, how you feel, whether you have lost interest in doing things which you liked once, appetite loss, etc. In any case, you will be needing treatment either in form of medications or therapy sessions. I would advise you to consult a psychiatrist. You might need treatment with one of the SSRIs like sertraline, paroxetine, etc. You can also start to exercise on a daily basis. Best wishes."},{"Patient":"Hello, I have been taking Nexito 10 Mg for my depression and I have been taking 2 tablets a day since a month. I noticed severe mood swing yesterday and also had high suicidal tendency and attempted to hang myself, fortunately the cloth tore apart and I fell down. I realized that I was unconscious for a while and when I gained my conscious I noticed pain in my hand and head as I hit the ground. After a while, I was weeping and had a push with in to end my life. I took 12 tablets of Nexito 10 mg and went to sleep as I was under the impression that this would make me to sleep sound and I may overcome the tendency. My question is that, while I am under medication and been taking Nexito 10 mg for a month, why do I still have these mood disorders?","Doctor":"Hi,I read your query and can understand what you are going through. You seem to be suffering from severe depressive episode and are having suicidal ideas as a result. Since you have attempted suicide, I would consider this as an emergency situation and would advise you to talk to your family members immediately and preferably get admitted in a residential care facility. Although you are taking antidepressant (nexito, 20 mg/day for a month), still you are having symptoms.This means that may be now, your medication needs a review and some other anti-depressant like venlafaxine can be tried. You must immediately contact your psychiatrist and talk to him about your suicidal attempt.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"hi, my name is mary. i have a younger brother who was hit in the head by a metal pipe when he was 5 years old. he got 46 stiches..6 on the outside and 40 on the inside.  when he became a teenager he started to become a different person.  he would get very angry and he would snap at us for no reason at all. and it is getting worse.he got married 2 years ago. he gets mad at his wife for stupid reasos and he starts texting her and calling her all kinds of na  mes then he starts texting my sister and my mom terrible things about his wife.  the hospital never took an mri or xrays..i keep wondering if he could have some kind of brain damage, he is 35 years old.","Doctor":"Hi,I read your query in detail and can understand the concern you have for your brother. A brain injury can many a times lead to long term impact and depending on areas involved, it can lead to personality changes as well (even without any motor or sensory deficit). Loss of inhibition, irritabilty, change in personality are common changes following head injury. As a psychiatrist, I would advise a brain scan (MRI) to see if there are any residual lesions and which area was affected. Psychometric testing for cognitive functions could also be done. Depending on all that, a course of low dose anti-psychotics could be useful for your brother. Try fixing an appointment with a local psychiatrist for the needful.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"I am on 10 mg. Lexapro for depression and feeling anxious.  Am on it for about 5 weeks and feel much morerelaxed.  I am 70 years old and my sex drive has increased tremendously.  Why is this?  Everyone saystheir sex drive is diminished.  I am not complaining, just asking.","Doctor":"Hi,Its good to know that you are recovering from your depression and are feeling better. Generally Lexapro (escitalopram) is not associated with increased sex drive. In fact, it can lead to decreased drive as one of its side effects. It can cause increase in ejaculation time though. Depression causes a decreased sex drive. Increased sex drive can be from the fact that your depressive symptoms are receding and you are feeling better in general. Hope this information helped. Best wishes."},{"Patient":"Hello I am 56 yr old female who w tagged as bipolar in my 30's. I have recently switched psychciratrists and altering my meds and a change in and clear up my confusion and anxiety. I just started a new job after 2 years of looking for work and not finding it.  Right now I am about to lose this job due to the confusion I obviously have. I need to get my head cleared up and my anxiety under control.  Can you  help?","Doctor":"Hi,I read your query and can understand your concern. Anxiety is very common in people with bipolar disorder. I would have liked to know how frequent are your manic and depressive episodes. More importantly, you haven't mentioned what medications are you currently on, as it will be difficult to comment as such without that bit of information. In general, you might be needing one of the  mood stabilisers like valproate or lithium in adequate dose. To take care of your anxiety, benzodiazepines may have to be added. SSRIs might be needed and indicated if you didnot have any recent manic episodes. You can also start some form of behavioral therapy for relaxation. Doing some relaxation exercise like progressive muscular relaxation will definitely help. Discuss all your issues with your treating psychiatrist.Wishing you a speedy recovery."},{"Patient":"My son just turned 17 a week ago. He has been on Prozac 20mg po daily for approx 2 months. His mood has  improved, but he has become very tired. He does take it at night. I will talk to his DR that prescribed it but am concerned what other antidepressants are available for teens. Most literature I read does not advise most antidepressants for teens.","Doctor":"Hi,I read your query and can understand your concern regarding adverse effects of antidepressants on your son. Your son has shown improvement on prozac (fluoxetine), although, he still seems only partially improved. First of all, regarding your concern about anti-depressants in teens, SSRIs like Fluoxetine, escitalopram and sertraline are actually safe enough options. They help in overcoming the symptoms of depression in adolescents very well and are actually recommended. After all, you won't want your son to continue feeling depressed. Regarding your son's current set of symptoms, he can be started on some kind of non-pharmacological treatment like Cognitive behavior therapy if someone in your area is qualified enough for that. He can be taught relaxation exercises. Alternatively, dose of fluoxetine can be increased further.Wishing your son speedy recovery."},{"Patient":"My friend's wife is very aggressive and angry in nature and shouting on my friend on each tickling issue.

Its difficult to say what actually is the problem based on the information given. You can advise your friend to talk to your wife about it, try to find what is leading to anger. You can ask him to look into their interpersonal relationship and sort out any issues. If she is ready and agreeable, preferably seek a psychiatric consultation in person.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"My boyfriend told me that he masturbated this morning and the color of the ejaculate was an orangish-red.  It was also more watery than usual. He is 39, suffers from E.D. frequently.  He has an over-active thyroid and drinks about 4 beers a day.  Otherwise he is healthy.  Should he be concerned?","Doctor":"Hi, For one single episode of abnormal colored semen, he may need not to worry. But if such repeated abnormal red colored semen ejaculation persist than it is hematospermia. Seminal vesicle inflammation or prostate inflammation might be the cause for that. I suggest you investigate with USG pelvis with special emphasis on genitals and accessory sex organs. Semen culture also should be done. Kindly revert with reports once done.

First of all, masturbation in normal and doesn't lead to any physical or mental weakness. Once a person becomes sexually mature, its physiological that either he has sex, or masturbate or he has nightfalls (wet dreams). So, you need to stop worrying from that point of view. Now, regarding your weakness, it might be possible that you may have some other problem that is causing it. Anxiety itself can lead to weakness. Many medical disorders can lead to it. I would suggest that if your problem regarding weakness is persisting, seek a psychiatric consultation. You might need to undergo some baseline investigations like complete blood count, blood sugar, etc. and proper treatment  for any cause need to be instituted.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"My 68 year old father said to my mum and I that a television presenter looks at him  for real, he said it started happening around  6 months ago, its gotten to the point that my dad has to leave the bedroom to change somewhere else because he thinks the people and especially the television presenter will see him change clothes, i am worried about my dad,  do you know what kind of thing he mightt be going through or suffering from,?

I would advise you to seek a psychiatric consultation. Had I been your psychiatrist, I would have evaluated him completely for any medical disorder like hypertension, diabetes, any cardiac illness, etc. He will be needing to undergo a brain scan (MRI) to rule out any focal brain lesion. Psychometric testing for cognitive evaluation will be recommended.

Now after 5 more days of increased dosage, he is his usual calm and quiet self. How long should he take the medication? Will one month s treatment be enough? He doesn t have diabetes or hypertension. Will taking this drug increase the risk of diabetes or hypertension?","Doctor":"Hi,I read your query. Before I go on to answer, I would like to mention that I would have wanted to know if your father is suffering from any forgetfulness too. That would be important because in that case it would be important to treat him accordingly  with some anti-dementia medication.  Currently, it would be difficult to say how long he would need olanzapine. It would be required to review him periodically and take a decision accordingly. Olanzapine doesn't increase the risk of hypertension although  long term intake can lead to dyslipidemia and increased risk of diabetes. However, regular monitoring will help in taking care of that.

Thanks.R.P Singh Sikar (raj.)","Doctor":"HiThanks for healthcare magicIn OCD, we use anti-obsessional drugs like fluoxetine, fluvoxamine or clomipramine. Usually we start with one drug at a time and gradually increases the dose. In your son case, both drugs at minimum dose, better to increased one to higher level and then start another. I would suggest increase dose of fluvoxamine 50 to 300 mg gradually according to symptoms and then add clomipramine. Rest, you can discuss with psychiatrist.Thanks"},{"Patient":"My mother suffered x2 heart attacks in 24 hours followed by a double bypass. Her personality has changed so that she has become mean to her caregivers, her youngest daughter and grand daughter. She has also Ben hallucinating. The only pain med she is taking is Tramadol. She has also started cursing which is unusual.","Doctor":"Hello,More like delirium or psychosis.If there is no disorientation to time/ place and person, then one can safely rule out delirium.For psychosis- this is also quite common under such conditions and can be managed effectively in short time. There is no need to be scared or loose heart. She should be put on anti psychotics- haloperidol 0.25-2mg at night is usually sufficient. Or olanzapine 2.5-5mg. Both are preffrably given at night.So, check if she has delirium or psychoais and start meds. response comes in two to three days.I hope this helpsPlease feel free to ask more queries for clarification.Dr. Manisha GopalMD psychiatry"},{"Patient":"helloHello im actually asking a question for a female friend. Shes 32 and does stress out and has anxiety at times. But she complains about chest pain(tightening pains) on the left side over her breast which id assume thats her heart. She has rapid heart beats sometimes, sweats and overheats, pain in her back and fuzzy feelings on her right arm and leg all when her heart acts up. She does have some kinda valve heart disease if i remember correctly which has something to do with the valves not opening or shutting enough to give the heart blood. I think thats what it was. Anyways she said doctors always tell her she just has anxiety but theres gotta b more to it then just that. Shes scared and it worries me. Its a good friend of mine.","Doctor":"Hello,This is more lilely an organic case in which the heart is not well enough and in events of stress - becomes more vulnerable and has such presentation. She should definitely get her stress test done- TMT which will determine the capacity of her heart muscles to endure physical stress. She should also get blood pressue reading, an ECG and may need an ECHO as well. One should always investigate such conditions throughly (in cases where there is already a compromised heart). Only after ruling out any new cardiac problem one should move to psychological reasons to blame for the symptoms.So, it is more like a mixture, but first and foremost it is necessary is to take care of heart ( as this can affect life directly).she can take sertraline 25mg in morning for her anxiety.  For acute attacks- clonazepam 0.25mg usually suffice. Can be kept under the tongue for faster response.Hope the reply is usefulDr. Manisha GopalMD psychiatry"},{"Patient":"i am having a really hard time concentrating on tasks i have been like that since i was little and in school i always start things but have hard time finishing them. i dont know what to do but it is ruining my life i need to fix it but not sure how to go about doing it... please help :/","Doctor":"Helli,This looks like hyperactivity disorder- ADD or ADHD.

Going by what you have mentioned, you have social anxiety and can be more than that in form of generalised anxiety disorder. However, the good news is that your condition is amenable to treatment.

I apologize for being so late with my reply to you to acknowledge that I received your answer and that it was very reassuring and helpful to me, thank you so much. I am hoping to post my second inquiry to your message boards again. I have OCD(obsessive compulsive disorder)and it has progressed over the years and getting worse. I don’t know what causes it or why there is such a thing let alone why it happened to me? But I check certain things in my home before I leave the house whenever I am going anywhere. I have to have some things a certain way in the cabinets in the kitchen and in my bathroom. I want the laundry to be folded just right and to be put away just so. And it takes me such a long time to get ready to go somewhere, what I mean is it interferes with my personal hygiene routine. I wasn’t always like this and I can’t even remember how I used to get ready for anything before. I have tried medication for OCD before and it made little difference plus the medicine gave me headaches. I have been told by a counselor in the recent past that there really isn’t any medication to treat OCD. I have problems with depression, OCD, mood swings, anxieties, fibromyalgia, sinuses, allergies and I was diagnosed with a Vitamin D deficiency during the late summer of this year. I found out the hard way that I am allergic to Vitamin D pills or capsules because unfortunately for me it caused me to break out with hives and itching. Which I am still dealing with although it is not as bad as it used to be but that is another situation and story for another time later. I had been prescribed Buspar for anxieties and unfortunately it also contributed to the itching so I could no longer take that medication either. I was hoping to write to you about the problems that I have been having and experiencing with OCD and with personal hygiene. I have a very hard time convincing myself that I am clean, I cannot take a quick shower. It is taking too long for me to shave, shower and shampoo, therefore there are days when I am not even practicing personal hygiene. Because it is taking up too much time and I have other things to do. I really don’t have any place to go to on an everyday basis anyway so the only time I am getting cleaned up is for a doctor’s appointment, on a day I go to the store for grocery shopping and sometimes for taking care of some errands or for a family get together. Taking a shower and washing my hair should not be such a task or a hectic chore but sadly for me it is. I really don’t feel good about myself anymore, I can’t convince myself that I am lathered up with soap, that I am rinsed or that I am clean. Each part of myself from head to toe that has to be washed and cleaned to me it is as if it is mandatory to really pay attention to making sure that I am not scrubbing but going over myself with a wash cloth so many times. And it is the same thing when I am washing my hair and scrubbing or scratching my head with my finger nails and making sure that I am thoroughly rinsed, also what is taking up so much time is the shaving. The shower stall that I have in my bathroom is what you would call a telephone booth. I am used to a shower stall and bathtub combined with a shower curtain so that I have room to wash and shave my underarms and my legs. That is what I always had no matter where I lived up until I moved to in ’07. But when I am in the shower stall that I have where I live now I just feel like I am boxed in. I don’t know how many times I have accidentally busted either one of my elbows and since then one of them in particular doesn’t feel right when I have my elbow up on the table. I have tried so many ways to shower differently and it never works. I don’t think anyone here would care to read how long it takes for me when I am in the shower. If I shave in the shower then I end up with razor burn under my arms and cutting myself whether it is my underarms or on my legs. I have sensitive skin but if I shave before I get into the shower then I do so by filling my bathroom sink with water and getting the necessary areas wet and applying shaving cream. And then I have trouble convincing myself that I am shaved, I’m still feeling stubble under my arms and I would think that when a woman shaves under her arms. Well, then that part should be clean and completely hairless. And I shave my legs and I have to go over them again because shaving them just once apparently isn’t doing the job. These problems that I have been experiencing are a real pain and I can honestly say that I wasn’t always like this. I don’t have or more to the point can’t afford an alternate method to shaving. Such as being able to afford going to a salon or a dermatologist for hair removal. Wax treatments from what I have come to know and understand are expensive and also are very painful. And I am very sensitive anyway, my dermatologist has also told me when I consulted him about this that there is no such thing as permanent hair removal. That body hair can be removed but it is only temporary and eventually it will grow back. I have been curious about the “Try No No” or the “No No Plus” as well as the “Flash ‘n’ Go”. I would like to know if either one of them are legitimate? Are they genuine? Both of them do have a payment plan to pay for them although they are both expensive with a money back guarantee. And the “Try No No” does get advertised a lot. I talked to my family doctor about the “Try No No” during one of my previous appointments with her and she said that her husband had checked a website about it and he read the reviews. She told me that the reviews stated that the “Try No No” does not work. But I do have to wonder what do a lot of other people think? Does anyone here on these message boards have a different opinion about it? I hope that someone here can or will eventually post a response, I would really appreciate it a lot if a member and/or a doctor on the site could help me or at least could give me some helpful advice on what I should or could do. To make my life a little easier, I have tried counseling in fact I have been through counseling for several years. It has got to the point that I have just got sick and tired of counseling and getting up to get ready to go to a counseling session every one to two weeks or so. Talking to a friend or a counselor about my problems, worries, concerns, fears and sadness is really great and it helps but only for a short while. I apologize for going on into so much detail and for composing what turned out to be a very long message. But I felt I had no choice in order for me to explain my situation so that everyone here would understand. In hopes that I would receive a really good, positive and helpful answer to my inquiry. I hope everyone here has a good day, thank you and take care.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.

You can then reflect upon them or discuss about them to your therapist.Wish you all the best.Regards,Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"HI ITS MY SIXTH MONTH...

Job loss, poverty, and loneliness are a big part of it.The new symptom du jour   is the sudden onset of violent images of myself being \\"attacked\\" by myself.

The question here, is about your motivation to be an extravert - 'why do you want to be an extravert in the first place'? Usually we tend to equate being extravert with being happy. However, we need to know its possible for you to be happy even if you are an introvert. A second issue might be related to gaining approval - how you believe you absolutely need other's approval for you to be happy. I would suggest that you meet a trained psychotherapist and discuss these issues who could help you in your process of self-discovery. A major aim would be to be who you are and to be happy in being so. All the best!

Don't read too much into the loss of memory. As long as she is happy and enjoying life and socializing and driving safely, then I strongly believe that the case is not dementia at all. Consult your doctor if need be.Hope this answers your query.

Is it alright to take Clonazapam every 4-5 hours as I am worried about dependency. My doctor has me on Effexor as well as sequel which he upped from 50 to 100mg.","Doctor":"Hi,I do understand that you are having anxiety and not able to control it. Generally, clonazepam takes care of anxiety and gives you relief. However, its important that the condition as such is treated. You are taking Effexor (venlafaxine) and sequel (quetiapine) for you problem and if still you are developing anxiety, I would like relook at the dose of the medicines. If the dose of effexor could be increased (I cant comment as you haven't mentioned its dose), that would be a good option.Taking clonazepam every 4-5 hours will take care of your anxiety but will not stop further development of anxiety. In addition, gradually you might need the urge to increase the dose as well. So, I would advise you to discuss this with your psychiatrist, and not take clonazepam so frequently without proper supervision.Hope that helped.

Now, I'm not sure whether he had any psychotic symptoms in addition to his depression for which he needed an antipsychotic. You have to clarify this with his doctro.Also, if he is continuing to take excessive alcohol, this is only going to make his problems worse.

Since a few years ago, I have been quite aware of the fact that I have a high probability of being a high-functioning autistic. I did some research at my local autism centre and everything seems clear, but my parents - especially my mother - continue to deny the allegations, saying that I m just making excuses and that you re not autistic or whatever, you re just stupid . Here are the things I have discovered. - I stayed in kindergarten 6 months longer than I should have been due to my development delay problems (late speaking, wearing diapers until I was 4, etc). Even before then, I apparently had a special needs carer/tutor lady come into my house. - I am socially anxious, and have trouble socializing or interacting with other people unless it is completely necessary. Up until I entered high school (13 years old), I was not very social and only talked to a select group of people. - I did not speak until I was 5, and according to my mother, when I did speak it was just simple phrases like Yes or No , and even then it was only to certain people such as member of my family (Mother, father, older brother by 2 years). - Every school I have been in has placed me in their GATE society (the Gifted and Talented programme), and they have placed me in nearly every annual Creative Writing programme held at school, and after reading all the Gifted information that the school provided there s a fine line between Gifted and Autistic. - I don t know if you ve already observed it from here, but I have this extended vocabulary which I sometimes wish I didn t have. Sometimes I think I speak like I have Asperger s Syndrome. - There s this online autism test created by Simon Baron Cohen that was featured in (I think) Embarrassing Bodies. I took it and got a score of 35. I d really like to get a diagnosis so at least I m aware of whether I m autistic or not.

Thanks for your query.I understand that you are wondering whether you may be having a diagnosis of Autism / Autistic Spectrum Disorder. However, a detailed history (including a childhood history from your parents) and a detailed psychological assessment is necessary to make a definitive diagnosis of an Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Usually, Autistic Spectrum Disoders get diagnosed early in childhood itself, with one criteria being that the onset of symptoms should have been before the age of 3 years. If you would like to clarify your doubt, I would suggest that you consult a psychiatrist in person for a detailed evaluation.

I am on Paxil (quite awhile) Doxepin, Lamictal and quite a few vitamins and diabetic meds. No med changes in at least 3 months. I have been diagnosed for months now with severe PTSD (years for PTSD and depression), depression, unknown borderline personality disorder and bipolar DO. I have been able to have social security disability; had to quit my job at the end of May last year..I had little concentration; memory, etc. I am now seeing that very simple things are forgotten...reaching for (right at hand) a slip of paper to write down a item needed from groceries that I just thought of; the meeded info is gone and I cannot get it back. Occasionally find myself not recognizing usual landmarks that I have known for years..it is just for a split second but scary ... not able to focus on driving and have had a few close brushes with backend collisions. I have had 2 brain CT s in the last year and a half; the last one about June of 2013. I spoke with neurology and they truly believe this is PTSD and anxiety; no issues with the scans. I am now having alot of bone pain in my pelvis area left hip and femur and rt hip and midback. I can no longer lie on either side while sleeping due to back pain; need to lie on back. I am a Oncology nurse (or was for 25 years)..so you know what I worry about. I have a doctor appt feb 3rd but I have no insurance so unsure if I will be seen. I have considered the ER if pain worsens. right now I can get by on ibuprofen 600 mg every 4-6 hrs; occ switch to tylenol........My life is really ok; I keep myself busy and , volunteer on the phone for a couple of agencies a few hrs a week; got to the YMCA at least 4 x a week and have done that for over a year now...I am obese and working on that.

If you are not getting any benefit with paxil or doxepin, then you can try venlafaxine. It is one of the best antidepressant and has good effect on depressive as well as anxiety symptoms. You can also take help of psychologist for relaxation exercise.Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hi. I'm a 31-year old female. I'm overweight & have high blood pressure. I also have anxiety/panic attacks & have just been diagnosed with ADHD. I currently take Quinapril 40mg once daily & Sertraline.

I know that I'm NOT taking the Vyvanse again. Id rather just deal wit my ADHD on my own.","Doctor":"HIThanks for using healthcare magicAt 31years of age, Anxiety disorder may be due misdiagnosed as ADHD. In that case, you need just antidepressant and low dose benzodiazepine. There is no need of taking vyvnase. It consists of amphetamine and it is a stimulant. What ever symptoms, you got, is due to amphetamine and better to avoid it. With sertraline and relaxation exercise, you would improve.Thanks"},{"Patient":"My niece has been diagnosed bipolar just a month ago. She has attempted suicide twice and been hospitalized 4 times in the past 2 to 3 months. She is also cutting and anorexic . She was on a medicine that has seemed to help and recently wanted to Change it due to gaining 5 pounds. She was given the new medicine and 80 pills to help her sleep better. She quickly declined and called her mother to come to her aid. Her mother was on her way to her apartment (30 minute drive)and she decided to take the rest of her sleeping aid (75) pills because she was so upset with herself about going downhill again. Quickly she realized this was so stupid and she had her roommate rush her to the hospital. She is fine and being released today from the hospital. I feel her parents are going to give her an altmatuim and make her move home.mi have asked what professionals have advised and they say they are making the discussion themselves. I am worried that this will put her in a huge tail spin and send her off the deap end. I have asked them to consider a family intervention with a professional to determine what should be done next. Do you feel a person who is newly diagnosed and not yet stable on medication should be backed in a corner? I feel there is so much going on between the parents and her that they need others to help convince her what should happen next. She is 20 and can refuse all help. I feel there is just a small window of time to convince her, before she shuts everyone out. What do you think?","Doctor":"HIThanks for using healthcare magicI think, she has underline depression or borderline personality disorder which may have been misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder and she needs psychiatrist consultation. She needs proper treatment with antidepressant and with that, her suicidal ideation would decrease.

Dysthmia, Panic Disorder, ADHD and Borderline Personality Disorder. I think ADHD, and BPD are primary. I probably actually have both. Through great research I decided I wanted to try Abilify, and I asked a Medical Practitioner, and it works very well with certain symptoms. Especially it stops me from losing emotional control and having stress induced emotional outbursts where overwhelming surges of emotion (easily triggered) overpower my better reasoning. For this it is 100% effective, incredible. Literally I have been on it for a year now and not lost emotional control a single time. Part experimenting, part by flook (ie luck) I discovered that 400mg per day of Modafinil significantly augments the effects of the Abilify. I do not only not lose emotional control now, but I don t feel overwhelmed by stress and negative emotions in the first place. I feel well, positive and able to cope with life. For the first time I am also motivated, and my concentration has improved quiet dramatically. I have had various tests, and know that physically I am in good health (blood tests all fine etc). But I am not sure what to say to a doctor, that basically through experimentation (without informed medical supervision) I have stumbled across a miraculous combination of medications. Literally like I am basically cured of my problems on this combination. I have spend decades of my life FAILING to find such a combination, and finally I have it. I have been on Disability for these problems for 1.5 decades, now I believe I am fit enough mentally to consider working. As I have been keeping my Modafinil use a secret- what should I do? Its not an approved indication for it. My belief is both the Abilify and Modafinil are likely improving the functioning of various areas (especially the medial area) in my prefrontal cortex. Abilify modifies various serotonin receptor types in the PFC and Modafinil, apparently increases Dopamine, Noradrenalin, and indirectly Serotonin in the PFC. Basically they are both PFC enhancing medications (if you read the latest literature and research). I don t know how to explain it to him, but it was from reading THOUSANDS of pages of scientific literature that I suspected my problems likely occur due to Prefrontal Cortex under-activity , especially Medial and perhaps orbit-frontal areas in regards to the emotional and stress intolerance aspects of my problems Any advice you can offer would be appreciated.","Doctor":"HiThanks for using healthcare magicYou are right behind your logic that your problem is related to prefrontal cortex and you need medication that could maintain the balance between serotonin and dopamine. In that, you can use an antidepressant like paroxetine or stimulant like modafinil which would increase the level of dopamine at frontal cortex. Abilify consists of aripiprazole and it is a partial agonist  of dopomine. You can take it in low dose with modafinil and antidepressant.Thanks"},{"Patient":"Sir, I m Rajiv Sinha from India state Chattisgarh, place manendragarh. I have recently married.

I have always suspected that she may be bipolar.  She is 55 years old. Every since we were young children she has always told lies. Now as an adult she lies constantly. I have always just overlooked her lying until recently I've started to question her on the stories she tells. She almost lives in a fantasy world when it comes to reminiscing bout our childhoods. I just tell her that  I don't remember what she's talking about. Should I come right out and tell her that I don't believe her? What really set me off over the holidays was my sister is a collector of vintage Christmas ornaments. She gave a box of ornaments to my 35 year old son and told him that they were his grandmothers ( my mother who is deceased )  these ornaments were never my mothers!  When I told her that I don't remember ever seeing these ornaments while we were growing up she replied mom gave them to me a long time ago. I don't know how to deal with her anymore. Do you know of any good books on dealing with someone like this?Thank you","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query.I understand that you are experiencing some difficulties in dealing with your sister. You have mentioned that she has been diagnosed to have \\"hyper mania\\", but in psychiatric diagnosis there is no such diagnosis as hyper mania. There is a possibility that she may be suffering from mania or hypomania, which are classified under Bipolar disorder. Regarding the lying, there can be a variety of reasons for this - and just based on this symptom, it is not possible to arrive at a definitive diagnosis of her condition. I suggest that you discuss with her psychiatrist to clarify what her actual diagnosis is so that you will know how to deal with her better. In case the frequent lying and making up of fantasies are due to a psychiatric illness, then it would be best to ignore this and rather ensure that she is recieving appropriate medication for her illness.Wish you all the best.Regards,Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"l am suffering from extreme highs and lows... bouts of getting angry over the slightest thing and not being able to et over it...  l am crying at least once a day... and could burst into tears at any given moment. l am fine at work as that keeps me sane, but still could cry when l'm on my own. l try to kill  myself on Nye by taking a heap of pills. l am having friend trouble and have 2 of my closest friends not talking to me.

Lets start with some basic facts. Masturbation is a normal physiological process and masturbating on a daily basis doesn't lead to any physical, mental or sexual weakness. However, from what you have mentioned, it seems that you are suffering from depression and that is leading to you having a lot of negative thoughts. Your feeling of sexual anhedonia can very well be part of depression. Your  situation is highly amenable to treatment. What i would recommend is that you should immediately consult a local psychiatrist. You need to be started on some anti-depressants together with regular supportive therapy sessions.  Wishing you speedy recovery. Best wishes."},{"Patient":"I was recently ,well 5 months ago rushed to hospital and admitted to ICU for drug overdose. , from Barbituates,Meethedone,TCA .I can assure you I take none of these drugs .I am very interested in finding out what TCA stands for ?

Thanks for your query.I understand that you are going through a difficult time due to your problems. Now, I'm not sure in what context the abbreviation TCA was used, but with regards to psychiatric medication, 'TCA' stands for Tricyclic Antidepressant. Tricyclic Antidepressants are a class of anti-depressant medication used in the treatment of depression. You have also mentioned that you are taking Seroquel (Quetiapine) - which is an anti-psychotic medication and Lyrica (Pregabalin) - which is an anti-anxiety medication. Since you have mentioned different calsses of medication and since you have provided very little information about your symptoms, it is not possible to arrive at a definitive diagnosis for your problems. So, please discuss with your prescribing doctor regarding your diagnosis and the indication for your medication.Wish you all the best.Regards,Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"Hi.

This morning my stool was yellow and slimy.  I am just so exhausted and frustrated.","Doctor":"Hello, this looks like anxiety disorder and may be due to this \\"uncontrolled anxiety\\"- the blood pressure is also not responding adequately to its meds.I have seen excellent response with. paroxetine 12.5 to 37.5 mg in similar cases and the effect usually comes in a week.  there is an early response in palpitation and symptom of racing heart and with time the anxiety dissolves completely. you may need something to sleep for initial few days but later this is not needed. Sleep gets better with 0.5-1 mg clonazepam or 10mg zolpidem. in day time the anxiety can be managed with toficalm or etizolam for a week or two, can be stopped later.You should also get your blood test and kidney function test done and may also get an ECHO of heart to rule out other factors for racing heart  and palpitation. With the above regimen I am very hopeful that you will get better.Wish you good luck!Dr. Manisha GopalMD Psychiatry"},{"Patient":"I am currently supporting a person, full time, in my home, who has a mental health disorder.

The anxiety causes me to sweat profusley and when I get really anxious I feel like I have to urinate all the time.  My underwear keeps getting wet and I am not sure if it is just sweating from the anxiety or if I am having bladder problems becuase I need to urinate all the time.  This morning I went to the bathroom and there was a little wet patch in the middle of my underwear, also I have a funny odor around my vagina which is sort of fishy smelling. For a while, I was having very thick discharge and went on a medication for yeast infections.  The fluid on my underwear today smelled fishy and salty.

The symptom of increased sweating can very often be a manifestation of anxiety. However, there can be other medical causes like thyroid problems, etc.  The incontinence is unlikely to be a symptom of anxiety. Regarding the foul-smelling vaginal discharge, it is likely that it is due to an infection.

Behavior is normal except for he sleeps late in night n so rises also very late. Tries to stay secluded. Does meditation etc but never in a disciplined way. One night few days back he took a bath at 2am. He is emotionally detached with every one or atleast tries to be.We want him to meet you but before tht wanted to confirm if u see any psychological abnormality in this case.Would appreciate ur immediate response and some contact details.Thanks,Deepika","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. The behavior pattern is little worrying. Normally every people should show some inclination towards spirituality at the beginning of adulthood. Your brother's behavior in that context is normal. But the activities are a bit abnormal. We can say morbid faith disorder. Not fully. Engaging him and taking him to another place for some one month or so should help change the attitude. Also take him to a place where troubled and challenged people live. He might need psychotherapy.

I have found that this problem (which I can only describe as dyspepsia) is often worsened by alcohol.I drink frequently, but generally nothing stronger than Lager (which at most is 4% against my usual lager that is just 3.8%)I have found that meditation and relaxation techniques make the problem easier, but nothing seems to cure it completely. This is an issue that started literally overnight several months ago, and it is driving me crazy :(I have been told that it is anxiety, but this started before I suffered with anxiety, and is not cured by any anti anxiety medication... I think, I just want to know what it is, and how to make it go away. Kind Regards,Alexander","Doctor":"HiThanks for using healthcare magicI think, you have generalized anxiety disorder and you need continuous treatment with antidepressant and benzodiazepine.

Every teenager face role conflict. gender conflict, family conflict etc. Just keep yourself engaged for a couple of days and it will be alright.

Thanks for your query.It is very unlikely that the fall and head injury you had when you were a 6 month-old baby is related to your current problems. Falls are very common during childhood days and it is improbable that this is causing your depression or interfering with your memory.Genetic factors (DNA) is one of the factors which can be causative for a wide range of psychological issues.

If you wish to stop it cold turkey, the withdrawal starts after a couple of days, is milder than that for other opioids and is gone in around ten to fourteen days. It does not require IV drip and sedation which have the risk of other complications. If you taper it off very gradually, you will not have any significant withdrawal symptoms and will not require hospitalization.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"Hi my name is Beverly.

Such people often display snobbish attitude and are often condescending towards others.  If a person is suffering from Narcissistic PD, such behavior will be generalized towards all, including close family members.

Both alcohol and benzodiazepines act on GABA receptors which have a role in anxiety and so make you feel better initially by cutting down anxiety. But when the blood levels fall, anxiety returns. The best treatment for you would be to start a SSRI antidepressant like Paxil or Zoloft or any similar medicine. It will cure the anxiety without the risk of becoming dependent again.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"Our married daughter in her early 40 s lives interstate, 12 plus hours from us & our 2 sons.12 months ago she sent me a text message requesting I have no further contact with her,her husband & our 3 young Grandsons she stated she is suffering Post Traumatic Disorder Syndrome equal to a soldier returning from war. She blames me for abusing her as a child & again the past 5 years. My husband & I have noticed a slow decline in her mental health the past 5 years, a few years ago I offered to go & help with the children etc as at that stage she wasn t well & blamed her unwellness on mental fatigue due to lack of sleep as the 2 youngest boys are 18 months apart the elder one 6 years older. She said neither of the little ones would sleep at night. She cried when I offered to go to her, she could tell me enough how thankful she was & how much she loved me. During that visit a few days before my husband & I were to come home she entered the room I was in closed the door she lent against the door to prevent me from leaving & verbally tore me to shreds for it seemed like an hour or 2 but maybe 3/4 of an hour. Every time I tried to talk she would harshly tell me to be quite & listen as I never listed to her all her life, I was in tears her husband was sleeping after night work, my husband didn t realize there was an issue behind the closed door upstairs. She accused me of things that never ever happened, greatly exaggerated incidences etc. Since her text message informing me never to contact them she has spoken to her father occasionally but when he mentions how much we miss her & our Grandson & we love her greatly would she please let Mum talk to our Grandsons. She instantly becomes very aggressive & tells my husband exaggerated or completely false accusations about me. My husband & I attended Counselling to try to understand & accept I am unable to have contact with my precious daughter & Grandsons. Our eldest Grandson was 11 years old last year when this began he was extremely close to us he would always get very upset even feeling sick when it was time for us to come home after visiting them he would beg us not to go home. Prior to last year we tried to visit them twice a year for about 2 weeks at a time. After the time she barracked me & abused me harshly we never stayed in there home again we took our caravan & stayed in our van. WE did send our Grandchildren a birthday present each last year as all there birthdays are early in the year. After about 4 months no contact with them my heart ached so much for them all I phoned there home leaving a message telling her how much she means to me ,I love her greatly,apologized for phoning when I had been told not to make any contact, but said I just ached so much for them & just had tell her in my own voice how much I loved her & always would, I promised I would not ever phone again without her permission. I have kept my word. 2 weeks after I made this phone call I received a letter by registered mail from her husband who we always previous to her text message to me we got on really well we have always felt he was a very fair honest understanding man. His letter to me stated if I ever attempted to contact her or them again they would have no choice but to take a restraining order out on me. he stated they were moving house & we would not know where they would live. Our daughter changed her mobile phone number, the only contact we have available is our son-in-laws mobile number. I never have tried to contact them since. Our daughter has phoned my husband on occasions & has told him he can phone her husbands mobile anytime, he has only done so twice as every conversation with her she ends up making false accusations about me & he becomes very upset a stressed. he & I discussed many times prior to last Christmas how we both hurt so much missing contact with our Grandsons, eventually my husband said the boys need to know we love them & we both felt we wanted to post Christmas presents to our daughter & family. My husband phoned our son-in-law hoping to have a good talk with him how our daughter was & if we could both talk to our Grandsons plus about sending presents to them all or at least to our Grandsons, Our son-in-law did not talk to my husband long enough to be asked any questions, he put our daughter on to talk, my husband asked her what suburb did they live in, she would not tell him, he asked if we could send Christmas presents & if the 3 boys were still interested in there favourite play games, she said yes they were. My husband said he would go shopping & buy them some for Christmas so where could he post them too. Her reply was she would have to think about it. She allowed her 3 sons to talk to there Grandad all were very happy to talk to him. My husband when talking to the eldest one asked if he could have another talk with his Dad. With that our daughter came back on the phone asking why did he want to talk to her husband again etc etc & made up what seemed like excuses why it wasn t possible. She then went down her path of accusing all her problems etc etc is caused by me & my constant abuse. She would not listen to my husband who knows & tried to tell her it wasn t right. They are very devoted Christians, we are also but not as devoted as they are. Last December our daughter phoned my husband at work, he couldn t talk very long, she informed him she & her husband did not want presents from us. She told my husband then that Mum (me) made our Grandaughter who lives with our ex daughter in law . She is our only other grandchild aged 7 she lives a long way from us but we see her regularly when she comes to stay with her Dad ( our son), Our daughter told my husband I had made our Grand daughter use not her own fathers phone but our other sons mobile phone to phone our daughter as I was trying to find out where they lived. This accusation was so far fetched as our son only has a work mobile has it all the time as he is on call 24x7 he was 3 hours away all the weekend our daughter claimed I had our Granddaughter make this phone call. I am at my witts end why my daughter makes up these story s blaming me for anything & everything. Just prior to Christmas we sent our Grandsons presents to our son in laws parents address as that was the only address we new to send it to, we included a card with love a best wishes to our daughter & son- in-law from us both. Christmas eve we received an email from our son-in-law stating how disrespectful we are to our daughter & him as our daughter had requested not to contact them, how dare I go against our daughters request that we do not send any of them Christmas presents or involve his parents she had request we were not to do.My husband was not told this at all. The email told us they were undecided if they would give our presents to there sons. We felt totally devastated. This is NOT what our daughter told her father. My husband & I want our daughters mental health to recover but do not understand why or how our daughter has reason for this vendetta against me. We did not reply to the email. We have 2 sons younger than our daughter I talked to each of them individually & insisted if they felt I miss treated there sister in any way I needed to know so I could seek further Counselling as I want our family all reunited. both sons insisted it is her problem not mine, I was & always have been a good caring mother to each of them. One son has suffered major depression for quite a few years he did on occasions take a step back from my husband & myself but never said he never wanted to see us again, at one time he did blame us alternately,it would be me other times my husband for his depression, we stood by him helped him seek medical help. He finally accepted it was his problem & he has been well for several years now, he came home from staying with his sister a few years ago & said to me, Mum you have bigger worry s with her than you ve got or had with me. He has not wanted to get involved in his sisters issues with us as he said it is not his problem or ours it is her problem she has to accept that & deal with it. we understand he knows his ability to cope with certain situations we do not burden him with his sisters problems. He did tell us she contacted him & asked him not tell us they were communicating etc, finally he told us as he knew how worried we were for her. He told us they occasionally communicated for over 6 months he told her that we all only have one & Mum & Dad neither of them (us) have good health. You need to accept them as & who they are as they done the best they could under difficult circumstances when they where kids so let the past be the past. She hasn t spoken to him since. Our other son at the beginning phone her several times left messages that he heard she wasn t well he was wonder how she was. She never returned his calls after she changed her phone number he did phone her husband a few times leaving a message he was concerned how they all were but he never heard from them. I did tell my Councillor of the issues I had rearing my children especially anything to do with our daughter, she was not cause us any great concerns or disputes He confirmed I done nothing beyond normality as a parent. I have asked my daughter for forgiveness years ago when she started to change towards me I could feel there was a wall started to build between us , that maybe there where occasions if I had my time over again as a mother I would react differently but at the time I done what I thought was best for each of my children if unintentionally there where things that has now affected her I am greatly sorry & asked her to forgive me. Nothing came from my attempt to help her & understand where she was at. I did tell my son in law about this time I felt my daughter needed help, he didn t answer or ask me why. I never broached the subject or took it any further with either of them. My big question right now as it is approaching our Grandsons birthdays soon, what do we do? We do not what them to feel we don t love or care for them we have no idea what reasons they have been given that we don t phone them, visit etc etc. We don t know if they did receive there Christmas gifts. What do you advise us to do in regards to there coming birthdays. Our Councillor is off on sick leave so have not been able to meet with him for quite sometime we live in a small country town & have our name on the waiting list to see a visiting Physiologist. When our eldest Grandson was about 3 our daughter when going overseas for work for a week asked me to care for her son at there home during the day when her husband was at work. I happily did & there were no issues what so ever. A year later they came down to visit & they happily left there son with my husband & I for a week, & we travelled back to there town 12 hours away over 2 days greatly enjoying time with our Grandson as they needed to return home for work. If I was or am the Mother she claims I was to her why was she happy to leave there son in mine & my husbands care on both of these occasions? I hope you can make some sense out of my troubles. I am desperate for help.","Doctor":"Hi,At times, people with mental illnesses develop false beliefs which cannot be shaken off in spite of repeated requests and arguments from family members. It appears that your daughter has developed some such false beliefs about you and you and your husband are unable to convince her otherwise. This can be treated with medicines. In my opinion, both you and your husband should discuss this issue with her husband who can then inform her doctor. Do not feel guilty about things you have no control over, as it is not good for your own mental health.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"I have a weird addiction of punching myself in the stomach.

She doesn't take care of herself, and last week her doctor dropped her from his practice because she was not being compliant with her meds and missed some appointments. Now she feels even more depressed, we don't know how to help her.  What can we do to get her moving again?","Doctor":"Hi,The first thing that you should do is to find her a new psychiatrist or request her old one to take her back again. I think he will agree if you take the responsibility of supervising her and ensuring compliance. After this try being a bit more assertive with her when issues related to her treatment are in question. Praise her and reward her for all the efforts that she makes to get well and to follow her doctor's instructions. The best you can do for her is to ensure that she takes her treatment properly.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"I need your advice. It is a complex situation. I am in love with a married man and we have been each other s soul mates for years. He can t leave because of his two young sons. He texts me ( on the phone he gave me) every single morning and we text all day until we both have to go home to our spouses/families. He recently had surgery for a mass on his esophagus. He hasn t received the results from biopsy/surgery yet but out of the blue the other day, he said he needed me to promise that if I ever go a week without hearing from him....that I would go close out the secret phone account and throw the phone away. I know he has a lot on his mind right now with his health and his family, but he told me that if his health goes bad, he won t have the mental capacity to involve me. He will be dealing with it with his family and not a committee . He said I can stay until his is dead or dying, which could be 50 years....or end it now. It s my choice. Should I give up on us and leave him even though I know he still needs me?.....probably more now than ever. Help! Yesterday he said he had the flu and isn t him a funny picture and then a cute picture that was a heart that simply said: I still pick you . He said he hates mush even more when he is sick and told me to STOP! It hurt my feelings so I told him to take his sick and sorry ass home then. Hope that makes you feel better, cranky pants! He replied with okay I will I didn t hear from him at all today but if he was home with the flu that would be the reason why. Especially if his family is home sick too. How is the best way to handle him without overwhelming him?","Doctor":"Hi,In my opinion, give him some time off to get back to his usual self and then decide what should be done. Also ask him to send you a picture of his biopsy report or other test results so that you know that he genuinely is suffering and not just using illness as an excuse to get rid of a girlfriend he has got bored of.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"Hi, I was just wondering what to do about my adhd symptoms.

If your ADHD is new, or the symptoms came within a time frame or 6 months or so, the best way to approach it is with training to gain attention. Although ADHD has most often been treated with medication, medications do not cure ADHD; they are used solely to treat the symptoms associated with this disorder and the symptoms will come back once the medication stops.

Would homeopathic medicine help her ?","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for choosing health care magic for posting your query.I have gone through your question in detail and I can understand what you are going through.olimelt 2.5 mg and sertraline 25 mg will not help her with OCD. The treatment of OCd essentially requires the medications in high dosages. Lower dosage wont help. OCD is a very common illness and effects many. It can be mild and some times unrecognizable and sometimes it can be severe. You certainly need to be treated for OCD. Although there are plenty of options available like clonil, fluoxetine, escitalopram, fluvoxamine, sertraline etc all in high dosage my best option for my patients is fluoxetine in higher dosages. If at all sertraline is used , it has to be used above 200mg. Also there is an option of cognitive behavioural therapy. This therapy is taken by either a psychologist or a psychiatrist in which the therapist identifies impaired cognitions (Thoughts) and try to correct them. They are 15-20 min weekly session and there should be around 8-10 sessions to help you with your illness.Hope I am able to answer your concerns.If you have any further query, I would be glad to help you.In future if you wish to contact me directly, you can use the below mentioned link:bit.ly/dr-srikanth-reddy"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am mona from dhaka,bangladesh, I am 28 years old, My weight is 46kg & i am thin & bulky , I masturbate one a day, it is my old habit,I am not sex with a women yet, My penis size is 4.5' when it is eject, Now, my question is , Is my penis size is ok for sex?

Valproate is one of the first line mood stabilizer and would be effective in your case. 3) Also there is an option of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

I was feeling very scared when I was alone, thinking that I am going to die, I could not sleep in my bed because of some fear. If i have slept 2 hours I was awaking in panic and fear. Could not stay alone, could not concentrate on my job, constantly having bad thoughts passing through my mind. I have visited doctor who gave me Deanxit tablets, and after first one i felt amazingly better, only i had trouble sleeping. I was taking two tablets per day for about a month, than I signed off from the ship and stop with Deanxit. During vacation I have visited psychiatrist, explained what happened to me, and he told me that I have suffered panic attack. My psychiatrist has prescribed me SEROXAT - Paroxetin tablets, 20 mg, if happens againAfter two months at home, where everything was ok, only trouble sleeping from time to time, I have signed on another ship, and situation has started but not that strong as before.I have started taking Seroxat and everything was ok, only trouble sleeping again, and I have been taking Seroxat for full 4 months while I was on board the ship.Another two  months at home without tablets, but again trouble sleeping, and here I am on my present vessel, just signed on today.After talking with my family I am sensing and experiencing some kind of fear, now when I am alone in my room.Fear comes and goes, but I am still kind of afraid to go to sleep, even I am very tired.Thinking about taking Seroxat again or maybe Deanxit.Could you please tell me what to do and how and if is possible to treat this fear permanently.Thank you very much.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details.

Depression can occur with regular stress and it can also occur biologically without any stress as well. You need proper treatment for the same. There are various effective therapies for depression like fluoxetine, venlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine or escitalopram and they are all very effective and mostly safe. You may also require some benzodiazepines like clonazepam or lorazepam for a short period like 2-3 weeks to reduce the anxiety and help with your sleep.  If you are averse to the drug therapies then there is also an option of cognitive behavioural therapy. This therapy is taken by either a psychologist or a psychiatrist in which the therapist identifies impaired cognitions (Thoughts) and try to correct them. They are 15-20 min weekly session and there should be around 8-10 sessions to help you with your illness.Hope I am able to answer your concerns.If you have any further query, I would be glad to help you.In future if you wish to contact me directly, you can use the below mentioned link:bit.ly/dr-srikanth-reddy"},{"Patient":"Hi Dr, I'm 58 years old; my question is when I get nervous I have this itching and burning feeling all over my body,I take buspar, welbutrin xl 300 and 150 but never I had any problem with these medicines, please what could it be?I forget to let you know I also take synthroid, 075mg","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for choosing health care magic for posting your query.I have gone through your question in detail and I can understand what you are going through.It could be a manifestation of anxiety disorder.

But yes, excess is bad. there are many ways to overcome it--1. Try to speak in front of many people when ever you get an opportunity, try first doing this while sitting, it is easier to do it sitting than while standing. 2. do it not only in front of like minded people but to others as we'll,  this will help you.3. you may practice deep relaxed breathing five minutes prior to performance, this will help to distract frightful thoughts and also help you become calm.4. you should always have trust in God, the supreme power ...without an ounce of doubt, this is the best remedy. You must unstand ( every artist is sensitive enough to understand this ) that : fear creeps from uncertainty, and doubts. so, once you eradicate the doubt and anxiety by giving yourself to the supreme power, there will be no fear what so ever...so, built trust in God, he has given you this art so it is upto him to take care of your performance...not yours...this will help you bloom..5. you may take etizolam half an hour prior to performance, this reduces anxiety without giving sedation.

There are around 3500 psychiatrists in India and its very difficult to identify the best. Infact more than the best, its the one who is sincere in his efforts, that will matter more. You may visit me at Indore, Madhya Pradesh, and I can assure you to be sincere in my efforts. The other option is visiting national institute of mental health and neurosciences in Bangalore. Its a government hospital, supposed to be a very good one. But be prepared to stand in the lines.

For ADHD to  be present in the adulthood, its essential for that to be present since childhood. Your parents may agree to the finding of ADHD since adulthood, if at you were having an ADHD. The best way to get dignosed as ADHD is to visit a psychiatrist who will take a detailed history and mental status examination and get the diagnosis confirmed using the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental health disorder (5th ed).

Ever since I attempted to confiscate her iphone about 6 months ago, she has seemingly turned into a someone I don't recognize. That first day when I attempted to take the phone away, she physically attacked me to try to get it back. I called the police. Since then she has been physically violent with me on several occasions. All of them have been when I have attempted to take something away from her as punishment (her phone, her makeup which she is obsessed with, trying to look in her book bag for missing progress reports, etc). On top of her being physically aggressive with me, she turned the tables and has made false claims that I physically hurt her. Three child protective cases have been brought and dismissed because they have been found to be baseless.  She has threatened to commit suicide when she didn't get things that she wants. She stole my mother's credit card and charged over 2000 in products on amazon (perfume, makeup, coutour dog products for a dog she doesn't have). She has been hospitalized three times for suicide attempts. The last time she claimed it the hospital wouldn't even admit her because they too could see she was manipulating. The ER psychiatrist even told her so. This weekend when I confiscated items from her room she had stolen, she proceeded to destroy her room and then told her caseworker that I did it. She is currently in intensive home therapy and on medication but nothing seems to be helping. Her case worker and the ER things it is all behaviorial. But is that possible? Certainly there is some mental or psychiatric problem causing all of this. She was normal before a year ago.

How can I safely come off the drug?","Doctor":"hello,If you are feeling fine and able to carry on with life like before illness, then you may try to gradually reduce the drug by 5 mg at a time. Wait for 3-4 weeks and then if everything is normalv, reduce it further by 5 mg and continue doing so if you are ok.Now the last stopping of 5 mg is done if you are feeling normal. Continue taking your sessions.Dr. Manisha GopalMD Psychiatry"},{"Patient":"I have an adult age daughter who lives with me along with her older sister.

I have to sell my home soon because of a divorce after 33 years of marriage. My son has had several neuro-psych evaluations done. He has many indicators for Aspergers Syndrome. He has been in and out of several treatments centers and psychiatric hospitals here in Hawaii. But Hawaii does not have Medical Detox here so he begins too suffer from pain, depression, anxiety, etc. and ends up back home. This has been going on for over 15 years. I was diagnosed with a rare Lymphoma Cancer. When I went into the hospital to have surgery on my ring finger that I contracted staph from gardening, Jude had a total mental breakdown. When I came home 6 days later I found him in a depressing holding house and promised to come and get him the next day. My family lives in Michigan and I was desperately looking for a good place for him. I thought I did. It was in Battle Creek and called Best Rehabilitation. I checked references, even CARP. He was flown there with supervision. As the days wore on, I began to be treated quite rudely and unprofessionally. I sent my brother to go check the place out. Long story short, it turned out to be a front for Scientology. I had given them 5,000, over 3,000 in airfare. Then they demanded that I send a bank Cashier s check for 20,000 by that day s end or he would be taken to a hotel, given 20 and the rest was up to me. I threatened to call the police if they did this. He was sick mentally and physically. So now he is back on drugs and his behavior is getting worse. He s angry. especially at me, putting himself in dangerous situations, stealing from me, very disrespectful and at times yells and acts out of control. I need help for him. Preferably on the West Coast near upper California, Oregon, someplace. He is more interested into a Buddhist philosophy and not AA. He s very suspicious of other guys because he is teased and thinks everyone hates him. I need help.

I suggest you not to worry much. You are right. PTSD and ADHD are disorders which are caused due to change in neural signal structure.

Body metabolism changes whole. When the stress creating situation stops, body cannot tolerate the absense of those hormones and withdrawal symptom occurs and that is PTSD.

Depression can occur with regular stress and it can also occur biologically without any stress as well. She needs proper treatment for the same. There are various effective therapies for depression like fluoxetine, venlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine or escitalopram and they are all very effective and mostly safe. You may also require some benzodiazepines like clonazepam or lorazepam for a short period like 2-3 weeks to reduce the anxiety and help with your sleep.  If you are averse to the drug therapies then there is also an option of cognitive behavioural therapy. This therapy is taken by either a psychologist or a psychiatrist in which the therapist identifies impaired cognitions (Thoughts) and try to correct them. They are 15-20 min weekly session and there should be around 8-10 sessions to help you with your illness.If it is severe then she needs to be hospitalized.

Also, I understand Klonopin can be addicting and loses its potency over time.","Doctor":"!You are taking Zoloft for the anxiety and depression but I do t think it is well controlled with 50 mg and so, you have been advised to increase klonopin. I do not feel that this will be the correct way to handle the situation as increasing klonopin will not help the real purpose of handling the illness effectively. What should be done in such case is -- that the dosage if sertraline should be increased to 75-100 mg and then if required to 150 mg daily. This will help to handle the illness and is also not addictive like klonopin. once the illness is well controlled for some time , we should plan to reduce the dosage of Zoloft. moreover, once we increase the Zoloft, then need to take klonopin also reduces , or may even be not needed at all after some days.Do get your blood test done, and check your blood pressure.

Resistant depression is diagnosed if the depression is not treated after using atleast 2 different antidepressants.  Depression can occur with regular stress and it can also occur biologically without any stress as well. You need proper treatment for the same. There are various effective therapies for depression like fluoxetine, venlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine or escitalopram and they are all very effective and mostly safe. You may also require some benzodiazepines like clonazepam or lorazepam for a short period like 2-3 weeks to reduce the anxiety and help with your sleep.  If you are averse to the drug therapies then there is also an option of cognitive behavioural therapy. This therapy is taken by either a psychologist or a psychiatrist in which the therapist identifies impaired cognitions (Thoughts) and try to correct them. They are 15-20 min weekly session and there should be around 8-10 sessions to help you with your illness.Hope I am able to answer your concerns.If you have any further query, I would be glad to help you.In future if you wish to contact me directly, you can use the below mentioned link:bit.ly/dr-srikanth-reddy"},{"Patient":"Hello, I am looking for the best kind of medical professional for a complete mental health assessment to be added to an elderly person s will as in this case, this person s mental status may be challenged in court.

Then I get stressed out shortly afterward and I was bleeding again that night while I was asleep. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to Health care magic forum.                     As you describe,you have spotting,when you are in stress, or when sleeping.                      The reasons may be the anemia, infection,hypertension,etc. Stress may increase the B.P, and there could be bleeding.                        I usually prescribe to my patient with such symptoms fluconazole,cifixime,ornidazole,and hematinics to correct the anemia and infection.

The chances of bleeding increase in case of elderly, women and concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and other anticoagulants. SSRIs decrease serotonin in platelets which impair their ability to agglutinate and hence increase the chances of bleeding.I would advise you to report this immediately to your doctor. If I had been you doctor, I would have advised a complete coagulation profile to find out any causes of bleeding.In case the bruising persists, I would prefer to change to some other antidepressant (preferably not an SSRI).Hope you get well soon.

I suggest you not to worry much. From the details you gave in the first part about people, it is because you are having paranoid personality disorder possibly. Paranoid personality disorder (PPD) is a mental disorder characterized by paranoia and a pervasive, long-standing suspiciousness and generalized mistrust of others. Individuals with this personality disorder may be hypersensitive, easily feel slighted, and habitually relate to the world by vigilant scanning of the environment for clues or suggestions that may validate their fears or biases. Paranoid individuals are eager observers. They think they are in danger and look for signs and threats of that danger, potentially not appreciating other evidence.Due to the PPD you are having nightmares when you masturbate.

Means you are imagining fear and your body produces symptoms of fear when there is no reason for fear now. Psychotherapy and relaxation techniques can surely help your daughter. Please do not worry.

The panic attack happened with the symptoms of this. I felt a freezing cold sensation in my feet which rose up my legs and into my chest and armpits. I can describe this similarly to the feeling of when having a catscan I think it is and they inject you with that chemical that makes your groind and armpits feel very warm, except it was freezing cold. Along with that my heart started pounding and I was twitching and trembling. I was sweeting profusely and I had the feeling that I was about to die.

I suffer from extreme anxiety and panic attacks to the point where I won t leave the house form days, miss apppointments, don t bath regularly etc. The problem is that I also suffer from fibromyalgia a bone disease which is a very painful adult form of rickets disease , have many bad spots in my back, I wake up with it killing me in three separate areas. I also suffer from extreme migraines at least 15 days out of the month. I have a pain Dr. who has tried successfully over the years to give me the right medications so that I can have some kind of life. But after a very serious car accident (a drunk driver was going 75 miles an hour and I was driving 55 miles an hour .I was shown not to be at fault) my suv rolled over 5 times and rode upside down for about 600 yards. I was working on my Bachelors degree trying to get off of disability when this happened and I went downhill very fast from here. We had to up my pain meds and I lost my psychiatrist when he moved too far away. after a few yeaRS ON MAINLY NARCOTICS AND NO PSCH MEDS THINGS QUICKLY GOT WORSE. I DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL AND AT MY REQUEST I HAVE ASKED MY PAIN DR. TO LOWER MY NARCOTICS SLOWLY because I never felt comfortable in my own skin. I Know I need to focus on my psch meds and slowly reduce pain meds because they don t even touch my headaches. To be clear my biggest problem is my migraines. I had them since I was little up to 5 times a year and they would get slowly worse as mthe day went on .I d go to the ER and they would give me a shot of Demerol and id sleep it of and id be fine. But then they stopped helping me (I wanted a dr. in control of my meds at all times because I went to rehab for alcohol when I was 23 and am a big believer in sobriety and am not a high seeker. for years nothing but injection based Demerol would help my headaches then I discovered that my psych med Xanax worked as well if not be sooner. so I want to ween myself off almost all my pain meds and just be on 1 mg. 4 times a day of Xanax (which stops the panic and constant fear as well as the headaches) 160 mg of Geodon and 60 mg of Prozac. but no one will help me do this. I think I take more narcotics than I need because I m on the wrong meds. I m self medicating with narcotics especially when I feel anxious or have a migraine. But NO ONE will prescribe me the Xanax. that and Geodon and Prozac is the most important meds .they should start from there and then see where I m at with the pain. please help. I want my life back. these migraines hit me like a mack truck. within 15 minutes the pain is so intense my body tries to reject it by projectile vomiting which also causes me to pee myself go through cold and hot sweats and to shake and wine-scream violently. all I want to do is drill a hole in my temples to release the pressure and the pain but even that wouldn t work. I ve tried all the Imitrex , Maxalt etc which help once in a while but by no means controls it. the vomiting happens so soon after the pain starts that s I cant keep any meds down. So medication delivery becomes a problem, that s why I went to the ER for shots. But they wont give them to me any more because they are to frequent now. when all I need is I mg of Xanax every 5 hours. Help isn t less meds better than 15 or so of everything you can think of verses 3 psch meds.? I need psych meds not narcotics.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details.

Then i opted to have the whole vein removed. This was in December. My erections have gotten weaker after initial improvement and i have a cord on top of my penis which connects to my suspensory ligament. I had swelling prior to this that immediately dissipated one day, and i did masturbate too early, and anyways i believe this cord iss the bucks fascia as my doctor made a longitudinal incision to it and im pretty sure the fascia split from the base to a few inches up my penis a couple weeks after surgery when i had major swelling confined to the penis (so must be below dartos fascia, since it wasnt in groin).

My question #1) is, b/c it has made me drowsy during the day, could I take it h.s. and perhaps not experience the daytime drowsiness. Question 2) In the past, I usually have a glass of wine at dinnertime or one lager ale. All the literature I have read says that ETOH is not safe with Lexapro.. I had my annual P.E. this week and am in good health. Thanks for any advice you can give me.","Doctor":"Hello.  Thank you for your question.... it is a good one!First, I would like to clarify the Lexapro dosage. The lowest dose manufactured is a  5 mg tablet... so perhaps when you say 0.5 mg you really mean 5 mg?In any case, it is perfectly okay, and in fact wise, to take your Lexapro at bedtime.Regarding the ETOH.... nearly every medicine in the mental health realm has a warning about alcohol. To be honest, in the real world (or perhaps a world where lawyers don't exist), it is likely to be perfectly safe to drink one 4-6 oz glass of wine or 12 oz lager ale at dinnertime; especially if you are already doing so along with the medications, and experiencing no issues.Best of Luck.... and hope this answer helps."},{"Patient":"I have had fluttering in the heart for 4 weeks.

This is a disorder of anxiety and occurs cause of imbalance of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. especially serotonin, nor adrenaline,  and dopamine to some extent. Medicines are the best options to take care of these symptoms. Paroxetine is the the most popular medicine and my drug of choice. I generally prescribe my patients 12.5 mg per day at night which takes care of anxiety symptoms. Also certain medicines like propranolol and clonazepam can be give as required when there is a panic episode or expected situation where panic attack can appear.Also there is an option of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). This therapy is taken by either a psychologist or a psychiatrist in which the therapist identifies impaired cognitions (Thoughts) and try to correct them. They are 15-20 min weekly session and there should be around 8-10 sessions to help you with your illness.If you have a prescription you may even order the treatment from the wallsgreen pharmacy which is an online pharmacy.

It leads to no physical or mental problems. The sperms and semen which are formed in the body are meant to come out of the body. They cannot be accumulated in the body and like urine they are formed in the body and are thrown out. They may come out on having sex or during masturbation. If you are indulging in none of these then the sperms and semen will come out at night by self (night fall) or routinely during any sexual stimulation. This is a normal phenomenon and will not cause any harm to you. Masturbation is safe and will cause no harm. It is harmful only when  indulged in excessively leading to avoidance of normal work and schedule.Hope I am able to answer your concerns.If you have any further query, I would be glad to help you.In future if you wish to contact me directly, you can use the below mentioned link:bit.ly/dr-srikanth-reddy"},{"Patient":"Hi!

I was diagnosed with Major Depression more than 20 years ago, and with PTSD maybe 6 years ago. I ve been taking a variety of anti-depressants such as prozac, paxil, effexor-these are usually what I go back and forth and back agaqin, to get some kind of hope and energy to re-engage in life. I also use alcohol too much,way too much, and have been in re-hab type facilities of my own volition for many times over the years. I asked my MD last year for adderall, which I then took with the effexor and/or prozac, as I simply had to get some motivation to move. It all increases my anxiety, which is when I usually drink, altho I take clonazepam, one-half, usually of a .o5mg script, usually 2-4 times a day. My question is (after all that): is there an anti-depressant, maybe in the MAOI family (I had fantastic results from parnate and one other I can t recall, when I was first diagnosed, but the food restrictions were difficult for me, and as I felt better, I went off them, went back to University, etc) but then prozac came to be...and the other ssri s, etc) Is there anything I can take with the adderall that will help me have any kind of interest in life/people/whatever, that won t increase my anxiety, won t kill me, annd I could continue with once I gain some equilibrium in my life?

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Radiation treatment causes some functional derangement of any kind of cell/tissue partly due to swelling of the cells and partly due to the damage to normal cells as well. Therefore, your present symptoms could either be due to the neural cells being affected by the radiation treatment or could be due to the original condition for which radiation treatment was advised to you. This effect could be transitional or permanent depending on the extent of its effect.If I were your doctor, I would advise you for some neuro vitamins, along with a referral to a neurologist if the symptoms increase.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in solving this problem. Thanks for using the healthcare magic forum for your health query. Wishing you an early recovery.

If you are having these non-specific symptoms right from the age of 7 years and they are constinuous at least in 2 settings then you should consider it as an ADHD. However if these are recent change say since a few months or a year then the more probable diagnosis is depression. I would like to go ahead with the diagnosis of depression in your case. Depression can occur with regular stress and it can also occur biologically without any stress as well. You need proper treatment for the same. There are various effective therapies for depression like fluoxetine, venlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine or escitalopram and they are all very effective and mostly safe. You may also require some benzodiazepines like clonazepam or lorazepam for a short period like 2-3 weeks to reduce the anxiety and help with your sleep.  If you are averse to the drug therapies then there is also an option of cognitive behavioural therapy.

It did a good job of addressing my feelings of depression. A friend told me that it s difficult to come off Venlafaxine and that I should talk to my healthcare provider about the idea of introducing Wellbutrin while reducing the venlafaxine. While taking venlafaxine alone I had some pretty typical side effects; I gained weight steadily since starting the venlafaxine and I have very strange dreams. My mood was definitely positively effected with this medication though. I recently stopped taking venlafaxine all together. I have been experiencing typical side effects like blurry vision, buzzing in my brain, and I m now getting pretty agitated. Before I didn t feel irritable, was pretty calm and happy. I m now feeling anxious, ealiy frustrated, irritable etc. I m super frustrated about the weight gain that i have had over the past four years, however, i m wondering if it would make sense for me to go back on venlafaxine if i m going to be grouchy. Also - my healthcare provider did suggest that I increase my wellbutrin from 300 to 450 now that I m off venlafaxine. I haven t increased the amount yet. I m wondering if it is likely that the increase in Wellbutrin will address the issues I m now experiencing. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this situation. thank you, Stephanie","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for choosing health care magic for posting your query.I have gone through your question in detail and I can understand what you are going through.You have not mentioned that how was the venlafaxine withdrawn.

She is much better now though she still has delusions.  My concern is that she is not on an anti-psychotic med -- currently on Prozac and Ativan.

I have talked to her parents about seeing if her GP can start her on Trileptal after her Dad told me she had a major side effect with olanzaprine.

I kept searching on different disorders and I found a couple that sounds very close to mine symptoms. First off let me tell you a little bit about myself. When I was born I had hearing issues, couldn't hear and lost a vast amount of learning. When I got my adenoids removed I started eating as could taste food, I also had surgery and got tubes in my ears. Always had problems with my hearing. I was mis diagnosed with ADHD and was on three different medications which didn't work. Later I found out I didn't have that I just had a learning disability but as I have problems with that I still feel something is wrong with me. I always hit myself in the head or arms and legs. I had a sleep problem ever since I was a baby. Slept during the day and stay awake at night. It doesn't matter what I do to change my schedule I still can't change it around. When I was 14 I was attacked and hit in the face with brass knuckles which caused a traumatic event which I can't forget. Doctors told me I have PTSD but I think I have more that that as well. I have suicidal thoughts and I self harm, hit myself, cut my arms. I have an impulsive behavior in masturbating as I do it daily. I have daily episodes of anxiety and depression. I have difficulties controlling my emotions and do know how to act on them. I feel misunderstood, neglected, alone, empty and hopeless. I have intense anger issues that result in me being weird with people. If someone gets me mad I act weird and laugh out loud like a crazy clown. I throw fits and punch my head or slam it on the wall or if I'm laying down the couch. In school I had a hard time concentrating, I got distracted easy, I had a hard time making friends. I never had a girlfriend. No sex, nothing. I'm 22 now. I see weird things from time to time like a cat that's not suppose to be there or a person walked by me and there's no one. I never could get a job or stay in something I liked. I just recently got everything done for college. Went for one week and dropped all my classes because I wanted to walk across the United States.

Ideally it should be managed by a psychiatrist and I expect that your primary care doctor will refer you to one. While you are waiting for the referral, it will be better if your primary care doctor can start you on an antidepressant like Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro, Effexor etc. Since these medicines take around 4 to 6 weeks to show their response, the sooner these are started, the better it is.

Ones the depression improves the sleep will improve by its own. As your concern is weight gain as well, you should opt for antidepressants that are weight neutral like bupropion or fluoxetine etc.For sleep along with the antidepressants you may take some sleeping aids like zolpidem or clonazepam. Also follow all the steps for a proper sleep hygiene :1) Have some aerobic workouts during day preferably in the morning.2) Have a light dinner.3) Completely avoid coffee/tea/alcohol/energy drinks/coke/smoking.4) Have a warm water bath before going to sleep.5) Dont try very hard to go to sleep. If you are not sleepy then sit on a couch or sofa and do some reading and go to the bed only when you are sleepy.6) Avoid watching tv or working on laptop/computer or bright screens at night.7) Keep the lighting of your bedroom dim and make your bed every morning after you wake up so that you get a cozy bed to sleep at night.8) Use your bedroom only for sleeping and resting and do not do any other work there.9) Avoid afternoon nap for any reason.Using these sleep hygiene along with medications should improve sleep.

You should get off of buprenorphine, clonazepam and welbutrin. If there is still depressive symptoms only then you need to continue antidepressants. For these personality features, you need to have intensive psychodynamic psychotherapy or cognitive behavioural therapy. This therapy is taken by either a psychologist or a psychiatrist in which the therapist identifies impaired cognitions (Thoughts) and try to correct them. They are 15-20 min weekly session and there should be around 8-10 sessions to help you with your illness.These therapies have to be continued for a few months to show its effects.

Take for example a patient who is a Vietnam era vet- he has PTSD flashbacks and has recently developed hallucinations or possible dementia.

Since both have differing treatment strategies, how do we figure out what is what?  As a Psych NP student, I've gotten this question from the attending psychiatrist and been given instructions to \\"figure it out\\" and have been assured there is an answer.

She has been attacking her staff, she is unable to sleep at night, she has episodes of constipation and diarrhea.   I am looking at the side effects of Ability and it seems as though it may be exacerbating some of her symptoms.   The list of side effects is rather long, and I am rather sleepy, can you tell me if Ability could be causing some of these symptoms?  I am her Dieititan, of course trying to assist her in losing, without success. Sorry I did not know that there was a charge for this service.  I have Teledoc for myself.  This question is for a client.I will withdraw the question.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query.Abilify (Aripiprazole) is an anti-psychotic medication, which can be used in patients with MR who have psychotic symptoms or aggressive / violent behaviour. Now, regarding the side effects of Abilify, constipation, dyspepsia (indigestion) or other bowel disturbances are relatively common.So, it is likely that the worsening of your client's bowel disturbances could be related to Abilify. Usually, these side effects are temporary and tend to subside withing a couple of weeks. I would suggest that you ask her to take plenty of fluids and a fibre-rich diet. In case her symptoms are persistent or worsening, then you have to discuss with her doctor about considering other options.Wish you all the best.Regards,Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"Hi. I am what I would consider a normal woman with normal emotions however since the age of 16 my mother has tried to convince me that there was something wrong with me. At the age of 16 I was given numerous medications for depression and anxiety and they only seemed to make things much worse. I became very depressed and more anxious. I took myself off the medications several years ago and have been living a very normal life. I have felt no depression nor anxiety in years and am actually enjoying life. I finally have goals for myself and my six year old son and life is pretty good. However my mother is still convinced that there is something wrong with me and I cant help but question if she may be right. I am what I consider to be normal and I am very happy but she is a very strong figure in my life and I cant help but wonder if she may be right. This in itself is starting to cause me anxiety and its starting to depress me. Please Help.","Doctor":"Greetings !Well there is one simple way to find out whether your mother's diagnosis for you is actually right or is just her assumption and that simple way is to get yourself evaluated thoroughly by a psychiatrist who will be the best person to make a formal diagnosis and may i address here that there is no need to worry or become tense because there is a high chance that she may be wrong since she is not a mental health expert and her perception about you may fall short of the diagnoses that she proposes.So as of now without taking any tension about the diagnosis and to put this speculation to rest once and for all, you shall seek evaluation from a psychiatrist and once the assessment comes it is will be clear whether your mother's suspicion was validated or not and this shall bring closure for both of you.I hope this helps.Regards"},{"Patient":"I was prescribed venlafaxine hel er tabs to treat long term hot flashes.

I suggest you not to worry much. Attention Deficit Disorder is not as you think. Please understand. A 6 year old child is supposed to have vibrant and creative mind and he cannot stick to any task continuously for more than 5 minutes. You cannot diagnose it as ADD. Your child is normal and other children are not vibrant and creative, if you compare. You need to give him training, not stimulants. Otherwise stimulants will be a habit and it ruins health in the future. Teachers will say so because their task is cut off. They are supposed to train your child. If they don't, you do.

During my last time, I smoked too much of it, and within 5 minutes after smoking it, I went into a intense panic attack/anxiety attack. I started feeling weird, I felt like I was gonna die, I could barely speak, and my heart felt like it was beating extremely fast and it was gonna explode. I tried my best to stay calm, but the feeling was horrible. I sat in one place for almost 2 hours, and then I finally attempted to walk to the bathroom and wash my face, so I could come back to reality. Finally after like 3 hours, I could walk and function. But speaking was difficult, because whenever I tried to speak I used to run out of breath. My left hand and feet used to feel numb and tingly and my chest tight. I could finally speak properly(without running out of breath) after like 2 days, but my left hand and left feet still kept feeling tingly and my chest tight for a period of 5-6 days until it slowly vanished. Now its been almost 3 months since that happened, and I am functioning perfectly normal. But still, from time to time, I keep getting anxious/nervous for no reason and my left hand and feet start getting tingly and cold, and my chest area feels tight.

Thanks for your query.I understand that you are distressed by your husband's comments and suggestion that you may have bipolar disorder. To clarify on this issue, bipolar disorder is a psychiatric illness where people have alternating episodes of depression and mania. Usually, each of these episodes last for at least two weeks continuously. Merely having anger outbursts or extreme emotional reactions does not qualify for the diagnosis of a bipolar disorder. In order to make a firm conclusion about this diagnosis, a detailed history and a psychological assessment is necessary. So, you can see a psychiatrist for a detailed evaluation to find out the possible cause of your problems. This would also help you find ways to handle your anger issues.Wish you all the best.Regards,Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"I am feeling so bad about my procrastination; I know what should be done, how to organize things, but I am not doing it..day by day I am more stressful, tired and unhappy.

He has also become extremely volitive in mood, becoming angry quite suddenly. He sometimes also bothers other people to the point of harassment, just by his attention and comments he makes.

It could have been initiated by irregular intake of medicines, induced by alcohol or alcohol intake could be initiated by re emergence of symptoms .

Its use is not recommended in persons with underlying heart issues or those persons with abnormal levels of potassium or magnesium in the blood.It is possible that since you do not have regular follow up for your heart that your history of heart disease would not have a significant impact but it would be best to inform your doctor prior to starting the medication.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I have been taking Fluoxetine (20 mgs) for 6 years with much success.

Thanks for your query.I understand that you must be going through a very difficult time, taking care of your step-father as well as other family members. From the limited information that you have provided about your step-father's mental illness,  it is difficult to come to a conclusion regarding his diagnosis. A detailed history and a proper psychological assessment is required in order to arrive at a definitive diagnosis. However, I would like to let you know that Paranoid Schizophrenia and Manic Depression (or Bipolar Disorder) are two entirely different psychiatric illnesses and a person cannot have both diagnoses at the same time. So, I would suggest that you clarify with his psychiatrist about his diagnosis and discuss what would be the best line of management. Most of the time, medication is essential and stopping medication may cause worsening of problems. If he is not willing to take tablets, then there is the option of giving long acting injections, once or twice a month, which can be equally effective. Please discuss this with his psychiatrist.Wish you all the best.Regards,Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"my ex-wife is trying to take my boys from me..... she has told lies that others can confirm, and i dont know what to do.... we were married 20 years and she sufferd depression all of them. many eppisodes lasted all nite... she ws very controlling to the point that she did not allow my mom to have a 40th birthday party for me....i would bet my life she has some sort of mental illness but not sure how to force her to take a test","Doctor":"HiThanks for using healthcare magicI think, she has underline psychosis.

Baclofen tablets is useful for the alleviation of signs and symptoms of spasticity, particularly for the relief of flexor spasms and concomitant pain, clonus, and muscular rigidity.

Tramadol is a strong analgesic, that's why u will get relief from pain fast. You have not mentioned which antideppresants u are taking.

After moving in together i noticed that she has an anger problem. She gets very aggresive angry the way she speaks when she gets mad about something. She hates everyone in the family as her stepdad slept with her aunt behind her moms back and the family stuck up for the aunt and disowned her and her mom. She is always on the defencive and gets mad every time someone has a suggestion. She feels she is right about everything. She also states that she never forgets things when i have noticed that she does. In ten years i have been living with her,it was as if we live in a storage locker and gets worst by the day. She does not clean very often and when she does its not a very good job. She has never finished any projects she has started and keeps finding more projects to start. She has never had a steady job and as of four years ago,she got hurt at a job that she was at for four months and went on disability for it.

Avoid sex for a couple of days till the tear heals. The fraenulum tear commonly heals by itself. However, you can apply ointment Neomycin or Soframycin for relieve. Take care of your hygiene. Since you saw blood in the tip of the penis, you are suggested to get clinically examined by a Urologist, get Urinalysis(C/S & R/E) & STD tests done to rule out any STI.

I no longer contribute my ideas. I'm not sure how to deal with her, even after all of these years. today she called and talked non stop for an hour and said don't you think I'm better. I'm tongue tied, can't say yes but don't want to upset her. What's the best way to deal with her? She is bipolar.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query.I understand that it must be difficult for you as a mother to see your daughter suffer multiple episodes of mania and depression. As you would know by now, these episodes can cause a lot of disruption and dysfunction in a person's life. So, the only way of avoiding this suffering is to prevent such episodes. There are good medication available (called mood stabilizers) which can prevent such mood episodes. But it is important to take these medication regularly and be under periodic follow up in order to prevent relapses.So, I would suggest that you discuss with her husband and take her to a psychiatrist nearby for a detailed assessment and further treatment. During the episodes of mania, when she is taking a lot, sometimes, even irrelevantly, the best approach is to be neutral. But it is also equally important that you ensure her safety and have a close watch over her as such people can do rash or reckless things when they are in a manic phase.

One being that I had seen my OBGYN last month for an extremely long lasting period (27 days) fluctuating from light to heavy flows in November which I thought was due to my implanon because I have had irregular bleeding since having the initial insertion two and a half years ago. He did a CBC, TSH, and a few other blood tests that were all normal but the swab of my cervix was positive for chlamydia which I know I had caught in November because I have been married for the last 3 years and was tested for stds during my pregnancy and marriage. I was treated with 2 azithromycin pills in a single dose along with my partner who had caught it from his ex fiancé who cheated on him. I was to be re-tested in three weeks and during that time I had no bleeding problems and also was treated with a 5 day z-pack for bronchitis and my partner was treated with that also. I went back in for the retest and I was completely negative for gonnorehea and chlamydia but my partner had not been re-tested yet. We abstained from sex for a week and a half after the first treatment and then used condoms since then. I started my cycle on the 13th of January and it ended a normal 7 days later. 2 days after my cycle ended we had sex with protection again but the condom actually came off inside of me and it took me some digging around to get it out. 2 days after that mishap which was yesterday I started having some abdominal pressure and a brownish pink discharge and today it is a brownish and bloody light discharge with little abdominal pressure. I work at a lab and sent in a urine sample to test for chlamydia again and am waiting on the results. Is it possible for one partner to be treated exactly the same but still have chlamydia when the other one had been cleared of it after treatment since its the same strain of the disease? And if not the chlamydia what else could be wrong could it be PID? I have only had a brown discharge one time and that was due to implantation with my first and only pregnancy. I m stressing out and can not see my OBGYN again until next week. Btw they also did an ultrasound of my ovaries and I only had one small cyst on one ovary. I had talked to my OBGYN about changing birth controls when I went in before finding the chlamydia and after getting treated for that I decided I wanted to evaluate my cycle this month being cleared of the disease but I am worried because the condom came off it isn t due to birth control.","Doctor":"Hi, I went through your query. It is possible that your partner has not been cured even if the strain is the same because it might have undergone some mechanism of resistance in your partner's body. But the discharge and heaviness after unprotected intercourse could be due to pregnancy loss. I would advise you to get urine pregnancy test done. If negative and symptoms continue have a transvaginal ultrasound. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I have been dealing with depression and nervous stomach anxiety for some time now.

Patients of depression do have symptoms such as the ones that you have described. You will need medications such as fluoxetine or escitalopram or sertraline for the management of depression.

The fact that you have already stated that you have a lot of stress states a possibility that your current depression could be due to the stress independently rather than the medication adverse drug reaction. You may take escitalopram or fluoxetine along with the medication for herpes. The stress needs to be managed properly. That will require cognitive behavioural therapy.

It appears to come down thru my father and his father before him. I do have a 52 year old son who is on military disability and 3 weeks he had the flu so badly he couldn't take his medications. I saw a full blown bipolar episode and it scared me terribly. I am living in his home with him to help him because his wife died from cancer a yr and a half ago. When he is taking his medication is sleeps most of the day. Some days he says he feels just awful and other - never wants that to happen again. Now, I have a son who at age 34 committed suicide and had 6 different personality disorders. One of those disorders had to be bipolar from the things that happened in his home. I also have a 40 year old daughter who at around age 13-14 started having a problem with me. She started writing terrible little noted and leaving them on my pillow quite often. We both loved horses so that helped her use up some of that nasty energy she threw at me. All these years she has treated me badly but not many other people except her brothers and me. I am now 72 years old and she was wanting me to move into a basement app't they are building but because of the terrible things she says to me. Her dad and brother were killed in a field with a sprinkler pipe 37 yrs ago when she was 3 yrs old. The brother that committed suicide was 9 yrs old and saw the whole incident. He also started acting mean and up and down with his personality at around 13-14 yrs old also. The son who was 6 yrs old at that time has a brain tumor that discovered when he was 27 yrs old. He never showed the same personality traits as his brother that committed suicide but there were a few problems. After over 14 yrs with the glyoma (spelling) tumor so deep in is head he is doing fairly well after radiation and chemo therapy.

If u dont want to take sleeping pills, u can follow some measures like dont watch TV or read book till late night, try to sleep at fix time, never check time again and again if u dont get sleep. u cam also try relaxation exercise before it.  It would definitely help u.thanks"},{"Patient":"ive been dx with general anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder in the past, I am taking Ativan 1 mg twice dly, I am experiencing mood swings, and wondering if I am bipolar as well, I have researched the bipolar s/s and they do not seem to fit my mood swings.","Doctor":"Greetings !Well while Bipolar disorder may develop in a person who has past history of anxiety and depressive disorders but you should also take into account the fact that based on a single premise of mood swings one cannot be diagnosed as Bipolar disorder as there need to be a cluster of symptoms present together for formalization of this diagnosis.I am mentioning below some core symptoms and signs of Bipolar disorder which will help you to understand better about this condition.1) Elevated, expansive mood , also called as infectious gaiety.2) Inflated self esteem and increase sense of self worth.3) Over confidence in one's abilities.4) Delusion of grandiosity and feeling superior over others.5) Over-familiarity and  dis-inhibited behavior.6) Hyper-sexuality and promiscuity7) Decreased need for sleep ( sleep only for 3 or less hours) but still one is able to get up with full energy8) Hyperactivity9) Flight of ideas and pressured speech that is oen's ideas are produced in the mind at a fast rate so much so that one's speech is not able to complete one topic but before that jumps to another topic thereby making the speech incoherent and incomprehensible.10) Poor judgment and lack of insight, investment in doomed business ventures and going on spending sprees.11) Mood swings So you see you got to have few of these symptoms to be able to get diagnosed with Bipolar disorder, one single symptom does not support the diagnosis.I hope this helps.Regards"},{"Patient":"my son is 22 years. last seven years he is suffering from hair fall. treatment made with tricologist. not regularly but suddenly he became arrogant and made vandalism at home when see top of the head hair blankness. how to reduce his tension and arrogance & treatment. can i use zapiz 0.25 for reducing tension. mr. dey","Doctor":"Greetings !I am sorry to learn about your son's situation but it is quite apparent that his recently acquired arrogance and violent streaks come from underlying frustration and agony that he is enduring due to loss of hair in the prime of his youth. You see a young person like him will not take loosing of hair lightly but it will make the same person feel low self esteem and lack of confidence after seeing his deteriorating appearance which any young person like him will like to preserve.So based on the above premise i feel that the tension and aggression that he has been displaying are signs of an impending depression and in order to prevent this depression from becoming full blown i will suggest that he needs to be started on a good anti depressant drug  like escitalopram at dose of 10-20 mg / day although zapiz ( i.e is clonazepam) at dose of 0.25 mg twice a day shall be added for 3-4 weeks to calm his nerves and make him relax. So to summarize zapiz 0.25 mg twice a day + escitalopram at dose of 10-20 mg/ day shall be a more formidable drug regime to control his aggression and pain that he is going through owing to his appearance.I hope this helps.Regards"},{"Patient":"my wife experience his late father and brother voices and try to find them in everyperson she meet and experience sleepless morning from 2am,now prescribed sizodon and parkin will it be ok or any other medicine required  kindly advice, how long this will last","Doctor":"Greetings !Well it seems like your wife has developed paranoia, delusions and auditory hallucinations centered around her late father and brother, so for her these conditions she is quite appropriately placed on sizodon and parkin combination.You see while sizodon is an anti psychotic drug which will act as the chief drug to manage her symptoms while parkin is an anti cholinergic drug ( i.e is generic name Trihyexylphenidyl) which is usually added to the likes of sizodon to prevent Extrapyramidal side effects and anti cholinergic effects that sizodon may bring along with it's good action.I hope this helps.Wish your wife speedy reocovery.Regards"},{"Patient":"thank you.

My son is anxious.thank you,","Doctor":"Dear User,Thanks for using health care magic.I am sorry to say that there is no role of buspar in OCD. In my view dose of risperdal need to be increased as 0.75 mg is too low for augmentation if he is not responding to this dose. Other than this there is no harm to change the SSRI from lexapro to other one. If he already tried all or most of SSRI than augmentation with clomipramine is another option.'Hope I have answered your query.

What to treatment do I have to undergo?I cannot look into the eye of a person straight and my peripheral view is with his or her companion when we are conversing.  I am intimated to be attending any occasion.  I have in mind that they will just be laughing at me or they will just observe my incapacity because my incapacity is blatantly observed through my actions.  When I admire somebody (specially men), wherever he is, there my peripheral vision is. May be that's one reason I cannot look in the eye straight to those people I am talking with.   This manifestation occurs everywhere  even with my male sibling except  from my family (since i'm married with four kids).  With this problem, I felt the whole world is mocking me at my back specially when I observe the faces of the people smiling with meaningful look at each other when i'm talking with them.","Doctor":"HelloYou seem to be having social anxiety disorder .

This CBT needs to be sought from a psychotherapist or clinical psychologist.So the combination of drug therapy and counseling can take care of your panic disorder effectively, while drug therapy will kick start your recovery and control over the panic attacks on the other hand counseling shall help you in the long run by teaching you coping skills.I hope this helps.Regards"},{"Patient":"I just want to know if my friend has OCD.

And if were in a store for awhile they will start putting things back where they belong.","Doctor":"Greetings !Well the friend of yours in question seems to have Obsessive Personality traits/disorder instead of OCD per say, the difference lies in the fact that the former is a type of personality disorders or trait which is concerned with orderliness, maintaining proper decorum, high ethics and moral values, punctuality, seeking perfection in minor to major things, etc. As opposed to this the latter (i.e OCD) is a type of anxiety disorder which is concerned with obsessive thoughts/ ideas coming to one's mind and which after initial resistance tend to overwhelm the will power of the individual and compels him/ her to carry out a ritual act. for example a person having obsession with dirt contamination shall develop a compulsive ritual/ act of washing hands repeatedly or washing clothes or bathing repeatedly, etc.So your friend seems to be struggling with his personality which has traits of Obsessive Compulsive personality and if he is convinced to seek help from a therapist with use of CBT ( Cognitive Behavior Therapy) applied on him then hopefully he will have a good chance to alter his behavior through altering his thought process.I hope this makes sense.Regards"},{"Patient":"Is it possible for an adult (mid 40s) to have a sudden onset of a disorder such as schizophrenia?

I am afraid to say that the sudden manifestation of schizophrenia is possible and noted in many occasions, but not that often. It is possible definitely. But most of cases, it used to be found later that the victim had been suffering from anxiety disorder or paranoia throughout his / her life which went unnoticed due to so many causes.

I have had a disc-ectomy with fusion in 2012 and in Feb of 2013 reinjured my neck in an auto accident. I, in the past greatly benefited from Oxycodone 10mg, It totally worked for me. Other medications such as Nambumetone, Naproxen, Cyclobenziprine, Amitriptyline, Prednisone, as well as several others were not effective. I am an electrician and I do a lot of tasks that are posture compromising. I am often required to crane my neck for extended periods, ( a recent pain management Dr did not know what craning of the neck meant) I have to access crawl spaces and attics. I have to manually bend conduit, and work overhead. I have to work above suspended ceilings off of a ladder, outstretching and reaching to pass wires along, By days end I am in agony. I am unable to get my current primary care physician to prescribe the one medication that works for me. Oxycodone.. I am aware of the dependency risks. I am also aware of some of the warnings that come with the medications they are so freely willing to give me. Shouldn t the decision be mine as to which risks I am willing to take. Nambumetone for example has risks of gastric bleeding, increased incidence of stroke and a slew of other possible side effects. The Amitriptyline has been shied away from for years as an anti depressant because of far safer forms of antidepressants currently available, yet they are more than willing to let me take it for neuropathic pain, even-though it is ineffective. How does one approach a physician about prescribing Oxycodone, without appearing as someone seeking it for less than honest reasons? I genuinely benefit from the 10 mg dose. It worked wonders the 8 months I was on it. it worked so well I opted not to have the additional fusion surgery recommended after my 2/10/13 accident.. When I opted out of having the 2nd fusion surgery the surgeon subsequently ceased prescribing the oxycodone & told me to get it from my PCP who is unwilling to prescribe it, and now I am once again contemplating having the surgery. I actually had the most productive 8 months in over 5 years while taking Oxycodone. My pain was managed, my pain associated depression was non existent, I functioned at work, and got things done at home after a day at work. Now I just barely make it through the day, and when I get home I am a couch potato, to sore to do anything. .
