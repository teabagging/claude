Safe period like traditional methods are not safe methods for avoiding pregnancy. Though in this era there are many contraceptive methods available, they can be grossly categorized into three main groups:1. Hormonal Methods: They include pills, implants, etc. 2. Condom like barrier methods3. Intrauterine devicesEmergency contraceptive pills should not be used as a regular method of contraception and should be reserved only for emergency situations. According to me, pills or condom should be best suiting for you to start with. Later on you may switch over to the other long term methods. I hope this gives you preliminary guidelines.

I got my period 2 days after coming off of the course and finished my period 2 days ago (7 day period) I ve now started again with fresh blood spotting. Is this normal or does it need medical help?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Usually within 4-7 days after discontinuation of pills withdrawal bleeding starts. Such bleeding stops within 5 days. However, your withdrawal bleeding started within 2 days and continued for 7 days. Even after stopping the bleeding, it restarted again after few days. This is not expected. It is denoting some hormonal imbalance. It can happen if you have taken Oestrogen only pills. I will advise you not to neglect it. Please report to your Gynaecologist ASAP. You may need low oestrogen birth control pills cyclical treatment for about 3 months. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I had unprotected sex last weekend. I forgot to take my pill a few week ago i cant remember. My boyfriend claimed he never cam in me but when i stood up some stuff came out and im pretty sure it was not me. then he told me it might of been him. Please i need help.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,If you are on regular oral contraceptive pills and have missed only one pill in the complete cycle, there should not be any concern about it. Missing up to 3 pills  is permissible in one cycle.It is very difficult to believe that ejaculation did not effect in the vagina when you have seen semen flowing out of your vagina. Even precum also contains some sperms which can impregnate a woman. In case of unprotected intercourse, following methods can give protection against pregnancy: 1. Consumption of emergency contraceptive pills within 72 hours of unprotected sexor2. Getting intrauterine contraceptive device inserted within 5 days of unprotected sex. The advantage of this method is then you get ongoing contraceptive protection for many years to come. If neither of these methods were followed within stipulated time and the pregnancy has resulted, it can be terminated by Medical Methods of termination up to 9 weeks of pregnancy. However, these medicines should be taken only with Obstetrician's advice. I hope this serves your purpose. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Ive had a mirena iud in place for 5 years. The doctor try to take it out but couldnt grasps the strings. I had went to the doc originally thinking i was preg. My belly looked 2 mths preg. Neg test. He ordered a ultrasound to see where the iud is situated. Been nausea ous for 2 mths. Took laxatives. Belly went away but im still sick. Whats your advice. Ultrasound on the 15 of this mth.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Since the threads of Mirena are neither visible nor palpable, it is likely that it has migrated outside the uterine cavity - may be in the peritoneal cavity by perforating the uterine walls. Perforation of intrauterine device, particularly in the abdominal cavity can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, etc.. You are having these symptoms for about 2 months. Therefore it is likely that Mirena has perforated since that date.  Your doctor therefore has advised you Ultrasonography. It will locate the position of Mirena. If it has perforated the uterine wall - partially or completely, you will need surgical intervention for removing the device. Please follow your doctors religiously. You need Gynaecologist's care.

Whatever the hormone fluctuations that caused you to bleed probably produced the side effects of the night sweats.Most of the time, these symptoms resolve themselves after a week or so, so try to be patient and your hormones will probably be back to normal soon.  Unless you have other reasons to have hot flashes (if you are over 40, or have thyroid disease or other medical problems) this is unlikely to recur.  If you continue to have these symptoms for more than a week, you may just want to check in with your OBGYN regarding hormone tests for your thyroid and menopause if you are of an age to be at risk.I hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Regards,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I have been feeling like I am pregnant. I ve had the implanon in for 2.5 years and I feel movement in my stomach and I have gained at least 5lbs. I m shocked because I work out at least 3 times a week. My last menstrual cycle was the 24th of July. I know it may be soon to tell but I just have a strong feeling. I have done 4 pregnancy test and they all came out negative...is there a possibility that I may be pregnant?? Can the implanon give multiple false negative??","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.If your pregnancy tests are negative, then you are not pregnant.  The Implanon will not cause a false-positive pregnancy test.  However, the hormone in the Implanon, called Progesterone, can cause many similar symptoms to pregnancy, because the same kind of hormone is produced in your body by pregnancy.  So feeling bloated, having breast tenderness, spotting or irregular periods and weight gain can all just be side effects of the Implanon.  Many women think they feel fetal movements, but most women don't feel fetal movement until they are at least four to five months pregnant, so you are likely mistaking the movements of your intestines for fetal movement.I suggest you discuss your situation with your healthcare provider, as you may prefer to try an alternate method of birth control which may not give you these symptoms.  Your Implanon will need to be replaced at 3 years anyway, and other hormonal contraceptives that are not systemic, like the hormonal IUD, can give long-term pregnancy protection without as many systemic side effects.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, So I have a really strange question haha. So like 2 mins after I took my birth control I burped and regurgitated and something yellow came up so I spit it into the sink and washed it down, after I thought about it I realized it was most likely my birth control pill a little mushy from just being swallowed, so umm what do I do? ha","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, You have a logical valid issue. If you have regurgitated the pill, or even if there is a suspicion of its throwing out within 30 minutes of ingestion, you should repeat the pill. You have regurgitated it within two  minutes. So you should repeat the pill. Even though the pill is not thrown out, one additional pill will not do any harm; however missing a pill may. Henceforward, please make sure that you take the pill on full stomach or with a glassful of milk at bedtime. This will prevent vomiting out of the pill. I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I had jus got off the implanon i was put on b.c. pills n i was on my period for two week right after my period i had unprotected sex.

Should I keep taking the hormone pills and finish out the pill pack like I normally would or when I stop should I start my next pack?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.If you already missed three pills in a row in this pack of pills, you already have been at risk for pregnancy since you may have ovulated this month.  You can finish the pack you are taking, but I would use a backup method of birth control for the protection during the rest of the pack.  After your placebo week finishes, if you are not pregnant, you should just start a new pack of pills on time and if you don't miss any, your contraceptive will be effective after the first week of the new pack.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I got the implanon removed on Tuesday and was wondering if I could go to the gym or do i need to wait as the area is sore to touch and hurts when any thing rubs against it. i had to change the dressing yesterday as the other one had gotten too much blood on it.","Doctor":"HelloHealth care magic user I understood your concern and My opinion is that you can do exercise without worry if your wound at implanon removal area looks healthy, if it is not healthy or you are having pain and bleeding than you should wait for few more days before going for exerciseI hope my answers help you Thanks"},{"Patient":"Sir, my name is sukumaran .K and I am 58 yrs old I am affected by prostate enlargement, and I am passing urine frequently is there any ayurvadic tablets or there can I take this tablets alonng with alapathi tablets, how long I have to take ayurvedic tablets, what is the cast and exact medicene pl advise.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.

These cramps can be managed by some anti-spasmodic painkillers. However, after the first menses, these cramps stop or may be become very mild. However, you are having severe cramps leading even to the excessive watering of the mouth and drowsiness. It is likely that the device has got infected. This will cause severe pain in abdomen. May be you are having some foul smelling vaginal discharge (either you might not have noticed it or it may start later). If you have no infection, may be that the uterus is not accepting the device and is continuously trying to expel it by forceful uterine contractions. In either case, the device has to be removed. In such case, you may better switch over to different type of reliable birth control method like contraceptive pills and/or condom.Please report to your Gynaecologist ASAP.

I-pill is a progestational medicine; hence, few days after its consumption, some little bleeding is known and you need not be concerned about it. Moreover, the following menses may get delayed by few days. I do not think, you should be worried about such irregularity in the bleeding after I-pill.

As you may be aware that in a woman with regular cycles, day 10 to 20 is the most fertile period of the cycle. If you happen to have unprotected sex activity in this period, then only you need to use emergency contraceptive pill like i pill or unwanted 72, that too within 24 to 72 hours of unprotected sex act.3. So there is no point in taking it repeatedly after each sex act in the same cycle. Also, if you have got your next periods after that episode,you need not worry.4. In future when you want to conceive -I will suggest indulging in a healthy diet and regular exercise regime.Include plenty of fruits, salads, vegetables in the diet.Have adequate water intake , say 8 – 10 glasses per day.Avoid deep fried foods, bakery products, and refined sugars.Avoid substance abuse, if any.Start on FOLIC ACID, B12 supplements at least 3 months before you plan to have baby.I hope my answer helps you.Thanks.Wish you great health.Dr Purushottam S Neurgaonkar"},{"Patient":"hi..i m 26 yr old.n i have hypothyrodism..in may month periods also not came n had unprotected sex on last may(30)..still periods didnt come..15 days early..used a kit..it gave negative result.but today kit gives a positive result..i m confused with my periods activity..i dont want a child now...so plzzz suggest..what can i do???","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Your first test reported negative, probably because you had performed it too early. Now that your pregnancy test is positive, you are pregnant. If you do not want to continue with this pregnancy, you may terminate it with medicines. You can use Tab. Mifepristone followed within 24-48 hours by Tab. Misoprostol for terminating pregnancy up to 9 weeks duration. Usually the abortion process starts within 24 hours but not later than 72 hours of the last dose of Misoprostol. Theses medicines have to be taken by Ob-Gyn Prescription. These medicines cause developmental abnormalities in the baby. Hence, if these medicines fail to terminate the pregnancy, it should be terminated by surgical procedure like MVA or so.

I m actually confused if I m on my period or its the effect of the drugs. And please if it s an effect, how many days is the bleeding meant to last.Thanks","Doctor":"Hello dearUnderstand your concernBleeding one week after the postinor 2 is the effect of the pill and it is the progesterone withdrawal bleeding as pill contain high progesterone level, As you had sex just on the nest day of period ends and that is safe period of cycle and chance of pregnancy is nil.

After taking pill 2-3days i discharge light browny fluid... Bt many days past i didn t get my periods? What does it mean and what is happening? And from 14 i am getting frequent urination.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You had unprotected intercourse on day 27 of your cycle. In fact on that day, the egg is not present to get fertilized. The egg is released 14 days prior to the next expected menses and has a life of 24 hours (only) while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a period of about one week around the day of egg release is fertile period. You had intercourse far away from this period and hence carried practically no risk of pregnancy. Moreover, you have covered that with I-pill within 5 hours of the intercourse. This pill when taken within 24 hours is highly effective. So you need not be concerned about pregnancy. Post coital emergency contraception is to be taken only once after the intercourse. You have taken 2-3 pills, which were not required. These pills contain Progestational medicine; hence some bleeding few days after the pills is known occurrence and they may cause the delay in the periods also. Due to overdose of the pills, the period may be delayed little longer.  The frequent urination has nothing to do with your pregnancy status. Drinking of excess water, cold/rainy season, stress also may cause more urination.  Just wait for few days. You should get your menses within a week's time maximum. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"hi i am deepthi and i hv been inserted copper t before 20 day and daily i am having stomach pain,backache and little bleeding is this realy a problem? and  some of my friends are teling that it's not safe and may get pregnent is it realy true? plz answer","Doctor":"Hello dear,i understand your concern.In my opinion the copper T is one of the best contraceptives.It is safe but the sideeffects associated with it are pain abdomen,irregular bleeding or excess bleeding during menstruation.But this sideeffects are not seen in all woman.Only a few people experience them.As you have pain and spotting i suggest you to consult doctor to check if they are due to copper T only.If copper T is the cause then it might not suit for you.And it might be removed.So kindly consult your doctor.Best regards...Dr.Srilatha"},{"Patient":"I started birth control (mid cycle, so not effective right away) recently and my package and doctor said it will be effective without backup 7 days in. So, I took 7 pills consecutively and had unprotected sex the night after I had taken the 7th pill that morning. However, I realize this is technically SIX days, because the package says Sunday to Sunday whereas I did Sunday to Saturday, 7 pills but only 6 days. My partner did pull out as well, but I m still a little concerned. Should I be worried about a pregnancy risk?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You have to be worried. If you have started the pills midcycle, this cycle will not be protected. You will start getting the protection against pregnancy only from your next cycle, when your pills will be continuous from day 2 of the cycle. Now, if you take two pills after the unprotected intercourse within 72 hours, you will get the same protection as post coital emergency pill. Beta hCG test 10 days after the last unprotected intercourse will give you the reliable information of your pregnancy status. I would advise you to report to your Gynaecologist ASAP for further advice and any intervention if needed. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"I started Chateal (birth control) roughly 3 months ago.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.You are having premature ejaculation. You need not worry about the condition, because it can be cured by proper practice.

In absence of pregnancy other causes are hormonal imbalance, ovarian cyst/PCOS, adenomyosis and thyroid disorder should be rule out.In absence of pregnancy, period can be induced by progesterone injections  in case of hormonal imbalance.Take healthy diet and fresh fruits, avoid stress and do regular exercise.Hope this may help youContact HCM for additional queryBest regardsDr. Sagar"},{"Patient":"hi sir, i had done sex with my gf on the seventh day 20 mar after her period stoped (14 mar) ..i gave her i pill within 24 hours and after that she had her period on 26 mar and bleeding more than expected and having headache ...sir m i need to be worry plzzz suggest me","Doctor":"Hi dear..bleeding is one of the commonest effect of I pill along with pain,fever and headache etc..so I advise not to worry but she can follow this points1) Take iron supplements2) Take green leafy vegetables and fresh fruits3) Check her Hb level4) Bed rest for 2 days if possible5) in case pain and fever take Tab.

For the lady 3 months I have been getting my period a week early. The first month my period lasted 11 days, the second month my period was really light and lasted 2 days and this month I just started my period a week and a half early. What is wrong?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,In fact birth control pills are supposed to and used to regularize the menstrual cycle and control the menstrual bleeding. There are mainly three types of birth control pills: Oestrogen dominant, Progesterone dominant and balanced. It is not clear which pills you are taking. From your history it appears that you are an Oestrogen dominant woman. These women usually have heavier type of bleeding. If such women start consuming Oestrogen dominant pills, their menses would be still heavier. They should take Progesterone dominant pills. Hence, I would advise you to consult your Gynaecologist and get  prescription of appropriate contraceptive pills for your phenotype, after thorough clinical examination. Every packet of contraceptive pills have fixed number of pills - either 21 or 28; either way, only 21 pills of them are hormonal pills. After finishing these hormonal pills, within 4-7 days the menses appear. If your periods are starting earlier, may be your original periods were rather longer. If in spite of the contraceptive pills, your periods are becoming irregular, you will have to get investigated for your hormonal profile - particularly Thyroid function. Please report to your Gynaecologist for assessment and management. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hello, my 3 year implanon implant was due to be removed last week.

I will try to address your medical concerns and would suggest you the best of the available treatment options.1)First of all do not panic.2) if MTP kit was properly consumed under expert medical advice, then the date of sex activity carries no chance of pregnancy. As it will be hardly day 8 or9 after abortion process. SO there is no need to take i pill.3) I wont be wrong in telling you that please get a proper sex counseling done. Use of barrier method like condom will not only help to prevent unwanted pregnancy but will protect from STDs.I hope my answer helps you.Thanks.Wish you great health.Dr Purushottam S Neurgaonkar"},{"Patient":"My daughter is taking oral contraceptives. she is finishing her 2nd week but in the first week skipped one night doubled up the next then skipped the next night doubling up the following day. During the 2nd week she missed tues, wed, and thurs, and took two pills yesterday. Today she got her period. What should she do?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Healthcare Magic.I am Dr Ramadevi Wani. I will be answering your concerns today.Since your daughter has missed up so many pills she has started her period now.Let her throw away the remaining tablets and start the new pack of pills today.

I was just curious, if on my 4th week, when i remove my patch for my cycle; Am I still protected? or is it possible to become pregnant during the first few days the patch is off while I am awaiting my cycle to begin. I cannot seem to find any information regarding these few days prior to my period actually taking place. I would assume that the medication has to work its way out of my system and this is why i do not receive my period for about 3-4 after i remove the last patch, however I want to make sure I understand when I am and am not covered by the medication. Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Healthcare Magic.I am Dr Ramadevi Wani. I will be answering your concerns today. Evra contains estrogen and progesterone and works just like birth control pills and is more than 99% effective in preventing pregnancy. In the fourth week when you remove the patch you are still protected. During this time when you are waiting for periods to start, unprotected sex does not result in pregnancy. This week is safe period. As you have rightly said , as the hormone levels reduce in 3-6 days time , you start your period. What is extremely important is that to remain protected from pregnancy you should put the new patch of Evra exactly after a week ( even if you still have period bleeding). If you delay, there is a possibility of ovulation occurring exposing you to the risk of pregnancy.I hope this is helpful.If you have further concerns, contact me through Healthcare Magic.Best wishes,Dr Rama"},{"Patient":"Good morning, I had an unprotected sex last saturday at 1 pm and then i take 4 pills (nordette) at 8 pm and after 12 hours i follow it with another 4 pills. is is really effective in preventing pregnancy?the first day of my last period was May 26, 2014. Hope you can help me. Thank u","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Healthcare Magic.I am Dr Ramadevi  Wani. I will be answering your concerns today.Nordette can be used as emergency contraception. You have taken them correctly. When used within 5 days of unprotected sex it reduces your chances of conception by 75%. There is a slim possibility of pregnancy due to method failure. Therefore get a pregnancy test done if you miss your period.In order to avoid such unnecessary stress, I suggest that you consult doctor and start regular contraception like birth control pills. They are more effective in preventing pregnancy than emergency contraception.If you feel that you are at risk of STDs, always use condoms during sex.I hope this is helpful.If you have further concerns, contact me through Healthcare Magic.Best wishes,Dr Rama"},{"Patient":"Hello...

Hence considering your menstrual cycle to be of 28 days, it would be day 14 of the cycle (you can adjust the day according to your cycle periodicity). The egg has life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence the fertile period is about a week around the day of egg release, which would then be day 10 to day 18 of the cycle. Your had a sex on day 4 of your menstrual cycle which is far away rom the fertile period. Hence, practically  there is no possibility of egg being present on that day to cause pregnancy. For post coital contraception, there are two scientific methods:1. Post coital emergency contraceptive pill to be consumed ideally within 24 hours of but not later than 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. 2. Intrauterine device to be inserted within 5 days of the unprotected intercourse. There is no home remedy to avoid pregnancy after unprotected intercourse. I hope this helps you.

The drop in hormones after the plan B leaves your system is one of the ways that it works to prevent pregnancy, and the fact that you bled is actually an encouraging sign that you did not conceive.Your next cycle may be delayed because of the Plan B as well- i would expect your next real period to come about a month after you saw the bleeding after the plan B.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was reassuring.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi good day.

I also have this brown discharge which is like old blood instead of fresh blood. Could this be implantation bleeding or does it mean that I m about to have my period?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,The intrauterine devices can prevent only intrauterine pregnancy and not the ectopic pregnancy. Since along with some bleeding you are having severe abdominal pain, please get checked for ectopic pregnancy. First get your pregnancy test done on overnight early morning first  urine sample. If the test is positive, please get ultrasonography done. If there are no products seen in the uterine cavity, the chances of ectopic pregnancy are high. Alternatively, get Beta hCG test done on the blood. Values under 5 mIU/ml will rule out the pregnancy; values above 25 mIU are diagnostic of pregnancy. Any values between 5mIU/ml and 25 mIU/ml are suggestive of ectopic pregnancy where ultrasonography can be of help.Ectopic pregnancy is a condition where pregnancy is implanted somewhere outside the uterine cavity, most commonly the tube. This pregnancy does not grow and there are chances of rupture with alarming intra-abdominal bleeding requiring surgical intervention with many units of blood transfusion. Please report to the Gynaecologist ASAP. I hope this convinces you.

Is it normal to have spotting and vaginal bleeding in the following 2 3 mths after I pill was taken. I dont take any pills other than this one time.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, I pill contains Progestational medicine. After taking these pills, some amount of spotting to bleeding is common to occur (break through bleeding); even sometimes the regular expected period also may get delayed up to one week or so. After such delayed period, usually trail bleeding is not known commonly. However, your period has appeared rather earlier than the expected period. It is likely that this was not a regular period but was an extension of break through bleeding. Now this bleeding you have got may be your regular periods. Alternatively, this is some trail bleeding after your regular period. Very rarely it may happen so. Such bleeding would stop within few days. If it does not, you may take some Progestational pill like Deviry till the bleeding stops; 4-7 days after discontinuing these pills, you will again get some bleeding for few days (mostly you won't require this). If the bleeding is minimal, you may ignore it. Such irregularity is not reported to occur in subsequent months. I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hello.

It also sounds like there must have been pain present even after the IUD removal given that you went ahead with surgery.  Sometimes the evaluation of pelvic pain is in an effort to answer the question \\"is it GYN related pain or not\\".  Given that your uterus is gone and you still have the pain suggests that it is related to something else - perhaps the pelvic bones or muscles.  Evaluation in a pain clinic is a good idea.

Just wait until your patch is due to be removed, and start the new pills the next day.  The Cerazette will be efffective immediately as a contraceptive, so you do not need any backup method.However, you should be aware that Cerazette is a progesterone-only pill, which means that it will not give you regular menstrual cycles, and it is less effective than combination birth control pills or the patch.  The patch is greater than 99 percent effective Cerazette is only about 92 percent effective, unless you are breastfeeding. So you will not get any complications from changing your birth control method, however, you should be aware of the decreased effectiveness of Cerazette compared to the patch you have used previously.I hope i was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Im 20 and have been on Microgynon for a year now.

Or am i still safe from getting pregnant? thank you","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Healthcare Magic.I am Dr Ramadevi Wani. I will be answering your concerns.

Any birth control pill that contains ethynyl estradiol and Levonorgestral can be used as emergency contraception (eg LO/Ovral, Alesse, Lutera etc). The dose is 100 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 0.5mg of levonorgestrel taken as soon as possible after unprotected sex and repeated again after 12 hrs.Tri-sprintec  contains Ethinyl estradiol and Norgestimate.

My last period date was 20th August'2011, should I use emergency Contraceptive pill? Is it Safe? I have heard that after having such medicines, periods become very irregular and lot of other side effects are there.","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. If you had the intercourse during your safe period, there is no need for any emergency contraception because pregnancy cannot occur. However, if you had the intercourse during your fertile period, chances of conception are high and hence, emergency contraception is needed. You can either take the pill or go for the insertion of an IUD, depending on your need. It is true that emergency contraceptive pills create hormonal disturbances owing to their high hormone content. That is why their use should be restricted to the real emergencies, once or twice a year. Occasional use does less harm.

And so, i took a third dose to make sure. I took this third dose 12hours after the second dose. Can i now be assured that I won t be getting pregnant? And I m taking oral gluta which they say increases chance of pregnancy. should i stop my gluta while taking this emergency contaceptive pills? and what are the signs that Nordette has taken effect prior to preventing pregnancy? This is my third day already after having unprotected sex and after taking nordette. Thanks a lot please answer","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Healthcare magic.I am Dr Ramadevi Wani. I appreciate your concerns. Nordette can be used as emergency  contraception. But the dose to be taken is 4 active tablets at the earliest ( within 120 hours) followed by another 4 tablets 12 hours after the first dose.But you have used only 3 tablets. So the dose you have used is not sufficient to protect you against pregnancy. These tablets can be used within 5 days of unprotected sex although they are less effective as more time goes by. Since this is your third day after sexual intercourse you can still use Nordette in the right dose.Among couples trying for pregnancy,not all but only about 25% of them get pregnant in one menstrual cycle. So let us hope that you do not conceive in this cycle. Get a pregnancy test done if you do not get your period in two weeks' time.Oral Gluta does not increase the chance of pregnancy. So you can continue to use it.I have an advise for you. If you wish to avoid pregnancy in future use contraception like birth control pills or intrauterine contraceptive devise as they are more effective than emergency contraception in preventing pregnancy. In addition Please use barrier contraceptive methods to protect yourself from sexually transmitted diseases.I hope this is helpful."},{"Patient":"I m getting married in the history of 28-9, but I have a problem I am in this period will be two sessions monthly and I want to delay taking the pill cycle ... My question is when to take them? Whether it helps in the prevention of pregnancy? Knowing my fiance and I do not want to have children during the first year of marriage ....","Doctor":"Hallow Dear, Birth control pills are very good for delaying the period. These pills have to be started in one a day dose at least 7 days prior to the expected menses. Continue the pills till you are OK to have menses. After discontinuing the pills, within 4-7 days you should get the withdrawal bleeding. In fact, the exact timing of this withdrawal bleeding cannot be predicted; hence better take the pills till you are ready for menses. Considering your requirement of postponing the pregnancy for few years, I would suggest you to start the birth control pills regularly from the day 2 of the next menses. Continue this pills cyclically till you are ready for the pregnancy. It will serve your both the purposes - delaying the period and contraception. I hope this helps you.

They are known to cause stomach irritation, nausea and sometimes vomiting too. Also, these pills do put on weight. So the pain in your abdomen and increased waistline could both be due to birth control pills. To avoid gastro-intestinal upsets, please take these pills after dinner at bedtime.

Thank you!Hannah","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to Health Care Magic.I am Dr Ramadevi Wani. I will be answering your concerns.Mirena releases about 12 micrograms  progesterone in the uterine cavity which mainly acts locally causing thinning of endometrium. A very small amount is absorbed in the blood stream. Mirena  does not cause imbalance in your body hormones. So there is no need to use Vitex. There is no evidence of interaction between vitex and Mirena. There is no evidence that Vitex decreases the effect of MIrena.

This led to excessive bleeding. Your doctor very rightly advised you to repeat Misoprostol. This was retained and hence made your uterus contract effectively. Therefore, mostly the abortion process got completed and your bleeding stopped. Now I would advise you to get ultrasonography done to confirm that your uterus is empty. If so, you need not take any more steps; however, if some products of conception are visualized in the uterine cavity, they need to be evacuated surgically. Hence forward, please adopt some reliable contraceptive method like birth control pills, condom or intrauterine device. I hope, this clarifies your doubts.

On the first week i was taking it, i was experiencing lightheadedness, i get tired easily, and really bloated. My partner even noticed i gained weight so quickly. But what most alarms me is that i would sometimes get light sort-of-painful sensations around my belly where i would experience cramps when i have my period before. And with this, i would have a brownish discharge and (sometimes) urine, too. Is this normal? What should i do?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You seem to be from Philippines. Althea is mainly available in Philippines. These pills contain Cyproterone which is a progestational agent, and  Ethinylestradiol which is an Oestrogen product. Both these medicines cause nausea, sometimes vomiting and pain in abdomen due to the fact that they increase acidity in the stomach and secondly due to the fact that they are detoxicated in the Liver. From your history, it seems you are not consuming these pills after dinner. Please change the timings of these pills to post dinner time. On full stomach, the gastritis effect is much minimized. Stick to one specific time for consumption of these pills. Moreover, you may take some proton pump inhibitors like Pantoprazole every morning on empty stomach which will help you control the gastritis. All the gastro-enteric symptoms you are experiencing are known with the birth control pills due to hormones in them. Usually they stop after a month or so; however if they continue, you may try Pantoprazole. If still they persist, you may change the brand with the help of your Gynaecologist. The brownish discharge you had is known as breakthrough bleeding which is a hormonal effect. If it continues, you may take two pills on that day which will stop the bleeding. Yes, putting on weight is  a known (side) effect of birth control pills. It is due to water retention as well as fat deposition. You may try to control it by restriction on salt intake and consuming high protein, low fat and low carbohydrate diet. I am sure this would help you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hello.

I am Dr Ramadevi Wani. I will be answering your concerns today.Have you done the pregnancy test to confirm pregnancy? It could just be a delayed period. So first do the pregnancy test. If pregnancy is confirmed consult doctor to make sure that the pregnancy is within the uterus. Once this is confirmed you may take the abortion pills.Occasionally pregnancy can occur outside the uterus. In such a scenario taking these abortion pills may cause life threatening bleeding. So it is very important to confirm the location of pregnancy.Taking the abortion pills repeatedly is not advisable. It can cause anemia. Sometimes abortion can be incomplete and predispose to infections.So I suggest you consult your doctor and use reliable contraception. I hope this is helpful.Best wishes,Dr Rama"},{"Patient":"at 4th day of my mensturation i have sexintercourse with ma patner .but due to unwanted of pregnancy i have taken tab. unwanted 72  on the next day day so now after 5 days i have bleedg ang slight abdomen pain....i feel fear and anxiety please help me out.my age -26yrs,height-154cm,weight-47kg,medical history-oesophagitis,migraine and sinusitis<br","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Please shirk off all the anxiety off your mind. On fourth day of the menstrual cycle, egg is not present to get fertilized. Egg is released 14 days prior to the next menses. Therefore sex on 4th day of the menses is absolutely safe as far as the possibility of pregnancy is concerned. There was no necessity of Unwanted 72 to protect this intercourse. Unwanted 72 contains Levonorgestrel which is a Progestational medicine. Hence few days after these pills, some amount of bleeding is known. You need not be concerned about it. Slight abdominal pain also can be safely ignored as related to menses. It will subside within a day or so. If it persists or becomes intolerable, you may report to your Gynaecologist. If you wish, you can take some Paracetamol product to get relief from the pain. Moreover, your next menses also may be delayed due to Unwanted 72 pills. Please be patient. I hope this de-stresses you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Hi ive just been given yasmin to try today, to help clear up my skin the only reason i agreed to go on it was because i was told it would not make me gain weight , i already suffer from depression and struggle with my eating bingeing and fasting and training at the gym. i have just been reading peoples views on yasmin and it is totally freaking me out , people gaining loads of weight by changing nothing in their lifes and training at the gym,, i am terrified of gaining weight im still trying to lose weight, also i am emotional as it is and im very worried i will become worse ?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Yasmin is a contraceptive pill which contains drospirenone which is a synthetic progestational compound and ethinyl estradiol which is a synthetic estrogenic compound. Like any other birth control pills, these pills also contribute in increasing the weight. Also, if you are suffering from depressive attacks, you should not take the contraceptive pills without consulting your Psychiatrist. These medicines may increase the tendency for depression. Please do not take this medicine without your Gynaecologist's advice. Please report to your Gynaecologist about the changes in your physique and psyche.

It is true that hormone imbalances are created while on hormone contraception. The associated weight gain makes things worse. Since you have been trying for two years without success, it is time to get further investigations. Please get a trans-vaginal sonogram, complete hormone profile and tubal patency test apart from establishment of regular ovulation. Male factor also needs to be tested. If everything is fine, monitored induction along with IUI may be tried. Please maintain a healthy weight, regular exercise and a healthy diet.

My first period was longer heavier and more painful, and I have had a gap of two weeks without bleeding before it started again. I am now on to day 10 of an extremely heavy, extremely painful period, and the flow seems to be getting heavier and cramping worse, not better. What do you suggest?","Doctor":"HiDr. Purushottam welcomes you to HCM virtual clinic.I have gone through your query. I think I have understood your concern, I will try to suggest you the best possible treatment options.1. You are right in judging the response of newly fitted IUD. Certainly it will take time for your body to get adjusted to this new IUD.2. I will suggest use of Tablet MEFTAL SPAS 2 to 3 times a day during the menstrual period as needed to overcome pain and bleeding. If needed Tab PAUSE 500 mg can be added 2 to 3 times in a day. You should aim at blood loss that needs 2 sanitary napkins per day and there is no passage of clots.3. If you still have heavy periods, a course of antibiotic like Cap Doxypal 100 mg 2 times a day for 10 days is advisable. Also, Tab REGESTRONE 5 mg 2 times a day for 5 days from day 21 to 25 of the cycle will help reduce menstrual bleeding.Last but not the least , Please get IUD checked up from your doctor every 3 monthly.I hope my answer helps you.Thanks.Wish you good health.With regardsDr Purushottam Neurgaonkar"},{"Patient":"I currently just switched from sprintec to tri sprintec to try to lighten my periods. I am sexuall active but only have been for about 2 months now. My boyfriend and I had sex last week (protected with me being on the pill and a condom) and he did not finish inside of me. Just last night it was the same thing only he did finish inside but notin was wrong with the condom and it was used properly with no tears or holes. I had brown discharge right after sex last night and that had happened before but not that soon after sex. I know there s almost no chance I could e pregnant, or atleast hope there isn t. I know it s dumb of me to probably even worry...i have been getting a lot of cramps and I got discharge the week I was suppost to ovulate but assumed the birth control would stop that. Is all of the cramping and discharge normal for just switching pills? Am I freaking out for no reason??","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Tri-Sprintec  is a birth control pill that has a triphasic regimen; which means that each color pill in the package has a slightly different dose of hormones. Occasionally, women who take triphasic pills may have some spotting in the first few days after each pill strength changes over the course of the month.  This may cause some slight bleeding or spotting when were not supposed to have your period. Whenever you had vaginal bleeding, regardless of the cause, usually there is some cramping that accompanies it.  Furthermore, it is not unusual to have irregular bleeding or spotting in the first 3 months of pill use.Both Sprintec and Tri-Sprintec are considered low-dose birth control pills, however there are many brands on the market that have a lower dose of estrogen than the pill you are currently taking. so you may have less irregular bleeding and spotting on a different kind of monophasic (same dose all month) birth control pill.Regarding pregnancy,  the chance of your conceiving while taking birth control pills  and using a condom is basically nonexistent.So I believe the symptoms you were experiencing are side effects due to the new birth control pill.  If you're desire is for lighter, regular periods, a different brand of monophasic pill may work better for you with fewer side effects.I hope I was able to adequately answer questions today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi All, I am in my 7th week with no periods and urine test is showing negetive ..did meet the doctor was adv to take Lupigest 200 do i have to insert this or take it as a pill? if so y is it taken for ..can i still be pregnanat even after taking this pill please answer","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Since at 7 weeks amenorrhoea, your pregnancy test is negative, you are not pregnant.

Ovulation tests do not always give you accurate result. In fact, they can only predict the LH surge but not actual ovulation detection.

Else, you can also get the blood test for pregnancy ten days after ovulation. Ovulation can be monitored through follicular studies or basal body temperature record from day one of the cycle.

Chances of ectopic pregnancy are raised with intrauterine devices and in view of your history, I would ask you to go for a proper clinical appraisal immediately. A sonogram of the pelvis should be done to detect any ectopic pregnancy. If negative, you can be treated for hormone imbalance after excluding local causes like infection, polyps and erosion. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hello i had the new implant put in my arm end of may and did not have a period till september and then i have only had a couple and its been very light for a couple of days. but i have a interest in new foods and i am slowely putting on weight but i am trying to lose it. i get a sick feeling every day but have not been sick. do u think i am pregant or is it just the implant? thank u","Doctor":"Hello what, and I hope I can help you today.The contraceptive implant is actually one of the most effective birth control methods available, and has a lower failure rate than even sterilization.  Unfortunately, it is also very common to have irregular bleeding, mood changes, food cravings, and weight gain as a side effect of the hormones in the implant.So just in case, I would perform a urine pregnancy test to make sure that you are not pregnant, however the most likely explanation for your symptoms is general side effects from the hormones in the implant. Most people eventually stop menstruating completely with the implant and have minimal hormonal changes, but this may take 6 to 9 months to develop.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have a question about birth control . I ve been on the pill for about 4 months, I had my last period November 11, and I went to my gyno on the 26th to make sure the pill was working, it was so I decided I d start taking a less expensive generic pill. I was on Generis Fe for 3 months and I switched to Junet Fe. I should have gotten my period any where from December 11-15.. It s now the 17th and I still haven t gotten my period. I ve never missed a pill, and my boyfriend and I always use condoms .. This delay in my period is really freaking me out, and I m not sure if it s from a lot of emotional stress I went through last week or the change in pills. Your help would be greatly appreciated!","Doctor":"hello,Change of pill may interfere with your period initially until body adjusted with dosage of pill.Exclude pregnancy by doing urine/blood test for hcg as no pill gives 100% safety.Avoid stress by doing regular deep breathing/pranayama, take healthy diet, need proper sleep and control your body wt by light exercise.Also consult with your gynecologist if period not comes within 7 days and need some investigations like USG lower abdomen etc.Be well."},{"Patient":"I am on the Marvelon contraceptive pill and have been for 8 months with no problems.  I just had my pill free break and withdrawl bleed.  I should have taken the first pill of the new pack last night (Monday night) but forgot and took it first thing this morning (Tuesday).  I had sex with my husband last night.  Should I take an emergency contraceptive?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You have started the next pack of contraceptive pills in time. 12 hours delay once in a while during the cycle is permissible. Moreover, this delay was just at the start of the menstrual cycle. At this time, for practical purposes, no egg is released by the ovaries for fertilization. The egg is released 14 days prior to the next cycle when you are not on any contraceptive pill. While on contraceptive pill, there is no egg release. The released egg has life of 24 hours and the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence period of about a week around ovulation is considered as fertile period. However, since you are on contraceptive pills, even that possibility does not exist. Dear Madam, you are well protected against the pregnancy. You need not take emergency contraceptive pills after this incidence of unprotected sex; because basically it is not an unprotected sex - you are well protected. I hope this releases your stress.

Since Mirena is a hormonal device, removal causes withdrawal bleeding. The amount of bleeding depends on the endometrial thickness present prior to the onset of the bleed. Cramping is mostly an after effect as the uterus contracts during the process. You may use an uterine anti-spasmodic for relief. To reduce the bleeding you should use styptics and and report the matter to your gynecologist for proper management. If there is no respite, you may need hormone supplements to arrest the bleeding. Avoid using tampons to know the exact amount of bleeding and also to reduce cramps and chances of infection. Hope your query has been answered. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"i had taken i pill after 30hrs .. mine was only a doubt that whether sperm has entered by mastebating.. no  real sex happened. my problem is tht i cant feel nothing special after having i pill. no common side effect... should i take another pill... pls help me plz","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. If a sexual intercourse has happened where there are chances of penis discharge or semen entering vagina, then only you can get pregnant. Chances of getting pregnant by masturbation are nil. To answer your question regarding i pill, not all women feel the side effects of i pill. Presence of adverse effects is not a sign of effectiveness of any medicine. So you do not need to repeat the pill.I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing HealthcareMagic. Take care.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"I had the Mirena IUD inserted 4 weeks ago. Since then, I have not stopped bleeding. I have a sharp downward shooting pain that starts right below my belly button. I also have lower back pain , both medial and lateral of my spine . The pain appears to be worse on the left side however. In addition, the ribs on my left side are tender and painful to touch. My OB/GYN suggested the IUD b/c I have been on Nuvaring for 5 years and had debilitating migraines for the past 3 years. Since the Mirena, the headache has switched from the right side of my head to the left. Is it time to consider removing the IUD?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You seem to have shifted from one agony into another.After Mirena, continuous bleeding for 4 weeks with the pain in abdomen is suggestive of:1. Infection2. The uterus is not tolerating it and is trying to push it out3. Partial perforation: This should not cause such a bleeding. If it is perforating, it has to be out of your uterus. X-ray/Ultrasonography will diagnose this complication. What is your obstetric history? Did you have any previous pregnancies?  The women who never had any previous pregnancies are more likely to be intolerant the intrauterine devises, though it is not a rule. If your uterus cannot tolerate it, better get it removed. Even if there is infection causing pain and bleeding, better remove the device and be under antibiotics. Please report to your Gynaecologist who will examine you clinically and take the decision. Please do not ignore this problem."},{"Patient":"hello , My question is: My fiancee nd i had sex four times dis week, I have already consumed i pill twice,but after dat also we couldnt control ourslf and had sex again,Evrytym he leaked outside,bt we dont want to take chance.

Even if your partner ejaculates outside vagina, there are chances of your getting pregnant as little fluid may come out of penis during intercourse before ejaculation that contains sperms.As you have already engaged in unprotected intercourse, to prevent pregnancy, emergency contraceptive pill is the only option you have. I should caution you here for future that i pill is only for emergencies and accidents. Do not make it a routine as it has very severe side effects. Experts recommend that emergency contraceptive pills should not be taken more than twice a month. This is already your third. So please take care next time that you not have to repeat this pill. You can switch to other birth control methods like 21-day course contraceptive pills, condoms or IUD. These options are safer than i pill.I hope this information helps.

Sometimes you feel these symptoms when you start taking them and they disappear after some months. If the symptoms are not very severe, you should not worry about it. However, if you vomit within one to two hours of taking the medicine, back up contraceptive plan like condom or spermicide may be required for prevention of pregnancy.If the symptoms worsen or other side effects start making your routine troublesome, then you can contact your gynecologist.

Althea is a birth control pill that is taken in 21 day cycle. It gives protection against pregnancy if you have unprotected sexual intercourse while already taking the pills regularly.In your case, you will not get protection from Althea. You need to take an emergency contraceptive pill (I Pill, Plan B etc). These pills are available over the counter in all medical stores. You just have to take this one pill preferably within 24 hours of unprotected intercourse. Make sure you take it within 72 hours by latest as it may not have any effect after 72 hours. The sooner the pill is taken, the more the protection. I would advise you not to make these pills a routine as they may have severe side effects. Make sure you do not take it more than twice in a month. Use other contraceptive methods like condoms for future birth control.I hope this information helps.

Taking an emergency contraceptive pill is the right decision you have taken. However, these pills act by changing the hormonal levels in the body that are responsible for the menstrual cycles. They sometimes change the cycle. So finding some vaginal spotting or bleeding on the next day of taking the pill is a routine side effect of the pill. There is nothing to worry about.Your partner can expect normal menstrual cycles from next month. If she does not get menstruation, she should take a he pregnancy test and visit a gynecologist.

I had unprotected sex a day b4 my unsafe period.i took postinor2 tab. Now my period is late since 7th of Aug. U bought pregnancy strips about 4 and ve been checking buh it's negative. Don't know if I can take gynaecosid because I took it sometime in March. Pls am worried","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Postinor 2 is a Progestational medicine which is known to delay the menses. Hence, you should not be stressed for the delayed menses. You may safely wait for about a week expectantly for your menses to appear, provided you have taken Postinor 2 within 72 hours of the unprotected sex.If even after one week of the missed period you do not get the periods, better rule out the pregnancy by urine test or Beta hCG test before you take any medicines to have withdrawal bleeding. Gynaecosid is an Oestrogen preparation. After this medicine, you will get withdrawal bleeding; however, the bleeding will be rather heavy. Hence I would suggest you to go for some Progestational preparation like Deviry for 5 days; 4-7 days after that you will get moderate withdrawal bleeding.I hope this helps you.Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"Me and my boyfriend had sex last night. We were both under the influence of marijuana, and the condom broke and he ejaculated inside me. So we went around and got his dad to get me plan b one step, but I smoke cigarettes. So will smoking cigarettes effect the pill?

If you took the plan B withing 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, there is only a 10 percent chance that you will conceive. It is not unusual to bleed slightly a few days after you take Plan B.  This is a side effect of the medication and not your real period.If your real period is delayed, take a urine pregnancy test and if it is negative don't worry- Plan B can also delay your period for a week or so as a side effect.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful to you.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"What is the best birth control pill to take? I am will be starting birth control soon and am wondering from personal experience what is the best birth control pill to take? I have heard there are issues with women gaining weight or breaking out while on birth control and I don't want these issues. Are there any birth control pills that you can recommend that wouldn't cause one to break out or gain weight? Or any that are non to help a person lose weight? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,There are varied types of birth control pills. Some contain low progesterone and high oestrogen, some are balanced while others are low oestrogen and progesterone dominant pills. I do not want to bother you with the continuous and sequential and such types of pills. Generally, the women who are having oestrogen dominance should take progesterone dominant pills, those with Progesterone dominance should prefer Oestrogen dominant pills while the balanced women may take any type of pills. Oestrogen dominant girls are usually short statured, having gorgeous breasts and their menses are heavier; while Progesterone dominant girls are taller with smaller breasts and have lighter menstrual cycles. You can decide about your hormonal balance and accordingly choose the pills. Any pills you take, they do increase weight due to water retention. Also there is some fat deposition as these hormones are cholesterol based. With restriction on salt and dietary fat intake, you can control the weight gain. Break through bleeding usually is more common in Progesterone dominant pills; however, any pills may cause it. It is not an issue and can be controlled just by taking an additional pill. I feel you should have little more positive view towards birth control pills. The pills do get adjusted to the body eventually. I hope this helps you.

One of my nostrils feels slightly blocked, although I can still pass air in and out. Please help! Should I take another pill?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Even though you have swallowed birth control pill without water, it would not go into the nostrils. Nostrils are at higher level than throat. It will go through the throat into the stomach or respiratory tract. If it gets stuck up in the respiratory tract, you would have become breathless and have had cough. Then you would have become very serious. Do not worry, it has gone in your stomach. The pills are quite sizable as compared to nostrils. So if at all it goes in to the nostrils, it will block the nostril completely. Before the pill was swallowed, it caused some inflammation which has given you feeling of partial nasal blockage. Take steam inhalations through nostrils and they will be clear. I hope this quietens you.

The sizes of the cysts the number of cysts in each ovary? And if you have been having irregular periods? Have you done any blood test to know if these cysts are due to hormonal imbalance and any blood test to detect tumor markers like Ca125, LDH?The main factors determining the treatment of cyst is your age and size of the cyst. If you are less than 40 years and the cyst are less than 5 cm then you need not take any treatment for them. Just a repeat scan after 6 months would suffice. But if the ovarian size is more than 5 cm then you may need a laparoscopy to determine the nature of the cyst. In both cases, hormonal pills are not to be given for cysts.

I have taking a home test came back negative but i'm almost 3 weeks late.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.The proper way to use the Nuvaring is to put it in, leave it in for 3 weeks, take it out, wait one week, and replace it.  During the week you are not wearing the ring, you should have some bleeding that is considered a menstrual cycle.If you wore the ring continuously for two months and then had a new one replaced but only removed it 3 days later, the pinkish spotting was your \\"period\\", which is caused by not wearing the ring.  The bleeding was very light because you had suppressed it by continuously wearing the ring for over 2 months.So you shouls expect your next period about 4-5 weeks after the episode of spotting that you had.  If you do not have menses by then, I recommend repeating the pregnancy test at that time.If you did not have regular monthly cycles before you used the ring, your cycle will follow your regular pattern that you typically have when not using hormonal contraception.If you are trying to get pregnant, you should have intercourse about every other day and begin taking prenatal vitamins as it benefits the health of the baby for the vitamins to be present at conception.I hope I was able to adequately answer your quesiton today and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,  Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Been using althea for months but switched to diane 35.

There may be some medicine left in the patch after one week, so you may still have some pregnancy protection, but it is not possible to know if the patch is still effective because it was not studied.

Firstly, please make sure that you are using the ring of the right size suitable for you.

So there are multiple issues at the same time going on, Need your help to understand what can be done. I went to urologist and he is prescribing medicine to delay ejaculation but not the solution to the problem. I am not sure if this due to the weakening of the parasympathetic nerve that keeps the ejaculation value close and help to maintain erection or some other problem.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Precum is a normal phenomenon to all men indicating that your genital system is working normal.Never try to stop that. If the volume of semen is very low you will need hormonal analysis. Consult an andrologist. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"Hi! I had been taking the Pill for about four years and quit last September. Well I am back on the pill as of two months ago, but my boyfriend and I have been sexually active for approximately three months. He doesn t wear a condom but instead pulls out. I don t have exact dates for anything, but I m on the pill. And I KNOW I should have started my period Saturday. Today is Monday and still no period. On this pill I normally have terrible cramps but theres been no cramping as of yet. I ve had sore breasts for about a week now and diarrhea as well. I ve had a brown spotting that only comes when I wipe down there for about a week now as well. ( Implantation bleeding? I m not sure) Anyways. I just wanted to know what you would recommend I do. Is it too early to take a pregnancy test?","Doctor":"Hi,I have gone through your query and understood the concern. If you have been regularly using the pill for the past two months now, you should have a protected cycle. So, chances of failure are less. Though you have been having unprotected intercourse even before the start of the pill, if you had the normal withdrawal bleed in every cycle, the risk is negligible. Your symptoms are suggestive of a hormone imbalance and hence, a breakthrough bleed. Home pregnancy tests may not read well now and you can get benefit from the blood test for pregnancy. This can be aided by a trans-vaginal sonogram to know the status of the pelvic organs. Further management can be planned accordingly. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"For how long does Postinor 1 give side effects? I am concerned that after takign the tablet five days ago that I am after the third day experiencing breast tenderness and lower abdominal pain . IAs it is only 5 days after intercourse and may be too early to detect prenancy, I am wondering if this is still a lingering effect from Postinor 1 or an effect of being pregnant therefore?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Pregnancy symptoms never appear so early. The first cardinal symptom of pregnancy to appear is missed period. All other symptoms like nausea & vomiting, frequent urination and breast symptoms appear about a week after that. Postinor 1 is a post coital emergency contraceptive pill. It contains progesterone hormone. This pill is to be consumed within 72 hours after the unprotected sexual intercourse. If you have taken it within that stipulated time, you need not worry about pregnancy as it has got more than 90% success rate. Being a progesterone medicines, it can cause some discomfort like engorgement and/or tenderness in the breasts. Even there is likelihood of having some withdrawal bleeding 3-5 days after consuming Postinor 1 pill. It increases acidity in the stomach and hence may cause some abdominal discomfort to pain also. I feel you should wait for your menses to appear in their scheduled time. If they are delayed, still it could be due to Postinor which can delay it by about a week or so. So you can safely wait for 3 weeks after Postinor 1 has been consumed. If you do not get menses after that, you may perform pregnancy test on the first morning urine sample to find the status of pregnancy. Alternatively, you may opt for Beta hCG test which is very sensitive and can detect the pregnancy even few days before missed period. If any of this test reports that you are pregnant and it is unwanted pregnancy, you can terminate it by medicines. Please get rid of the stress of pregnancy. Stress also can delay menstruation.  I hope this helps you. Dr. Nishikant Shrotri"},{"Patient":"My copper t is getting expired this february. I am 37 yrs old. I want to get myself operated or my hubby. Which is a better option. I hv certain queries. 1) Do our stomach get bloated if we put cooper t. as i do regular exercise but stomach is a problem. 2) Do pen looses erection after 50 if they get operated as i saw my dad and my fil having this prob as my mil n mother had discussed that with me. 3) I am type 2 diabetic i take Amryl M 2mg everyday will i have a problem if I get operated.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,It is a nice option for a husband to get vasectomized. Throughout the reproductory life of a couple, woman is all the time taking the brunt of bearing a child, bearing pains during delivery, breastfeeding the child, raring a child and so on. What man does is only impregnates her. Now this is only one scope for him where he can cooperate with the wife and get vasectomized. Now coming to your questions:1. Copper T is fitted in the uterine cavity. It has go no connection whatsoever with digestive system. Hence there is no possibility for stomach bloating after inserting Copper T.2. In vasectomy, the tubes carrying the sperms from the testis are cut and ligated near the testis. It has got no relation with erection of the penis. Erection of penis is governed by a hormone Testosterone which is produced in the testes and is directly poured in the blood. Since you are type 2 Diabetic, it is likely that your father also is diabetic. Erectile dysfunction is one of the complications of Diabetes.3. So long as your blood sugar is within normal limits, you should not have any problem in undergoing any surgery. However, as I have mentioned in the beginning, vasectomy of man should always be a good option of preference. The sperm carrying tube is cut and ligated near the testes. Hence the part of the tube distal to the site of surgery do contain sperms which can cause pregnancy. Hence it is advised that after vasectomy for 3 months of for 15 intercourses, condom should be used to avoid embarrassing situation. I hope this helps you.

And also I am planning to get pregnat. After stopping it I get swollen and sore brest as well as i feel sick everyday for 4 weeks I am wondering are these symptoms from northisteron? the other thing could northisteron decrese my chances from getting pregnant?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear Asmaa,Norethisteroe is a Progesterone preparation. It does cause engorgement and soreness of the breasts. If increases the acidity and also due to effect on liver, it does cause nauseating feeling. However, after discontinuing the medicines, these symptoms should not persist.  Norethisterone being progestational medicine, may act like birth control pill; however after discontinuing the pills, it should not create any problem in conception. You do have good chances of pregnancy provided you are releasing your eggs fairly regularly, there is no block anywhere in your genital organs and the husband has a good quality semen. You may get these tested if you do not conceive in fair time. Currently, if you have not missed your period and are still sick for more than 4 months, please report to your physician to get your Liver function test done. Norethisterone may diminish the function of liver and then these symptoms may continue. Take Folic acid tablets daily. I hope this helps you.

I have been bleeding now for a week which isn't normal. I have had a pullop on my overies before, I did have it removed but they didn' get it all. Could it be the pullop returning or is the pill not agreeing with me?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope i can help you today.Bleeding when you are not supposed to have your period is called breakthrough bleeding and is common when you start taking birth control pills until your system is used to it.  The bleeding usually stops by the third month back on the pill.  Taking the pill close to the same time every day will help to minimize the bleeding.It is unusual to have a polyp on your ovary.  Many people have cysts on their ovaries, so it is more likely to be a cyst if you had ovarian surgery in the past.Either way, a cyst on your ovary would not cause vaginal bleeding.The bleeding itself is not dangerous or harmful, but it is likely just a side effect of the pill. If the bleeding continues after two more menstrual cycles, you may want to talk to your healthcare provider about trying a different brand of birth control. I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"helllo doctor ..... i m marrried and havin 2 yrs old daughter...recently in jan i taken time gap injection...bt this month periods ddnt come yet.....i done pegrancy test bt dat shows negtive 2 days before....itoday i taken mifigest 3 tablets....i dnt waanna be  pregrancy yet....do answer what to do ....i m tense","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for writing to us.First of all, you must repeat the home pregnancy test or undergo blood test for beta-hCG to confirm pregnancy. Without positive test result, taking Mifegest tab may NOT induce bleeding or period. It may cause ill-health effect.On NEGATIVE test, I can suggest progesterone pill (Norethisterone) for 5 days to induce period. You will get your period within 5 to 7 days after stopping medicine.On POSITIVE test, you have to undergo medical abortion under the guidance of local gynecologist. Taking abortion pill by yourself is NOT recommended at all.By procedure, at first, you need to take Tab Mifepristone or Mifegest 200mg (ideally 600mg) on D1, after 48 hrs take 2 Tab Misoprostol 200mg in the morning and other 2 tabs need to insert inside vagina under supervision of gynecologist or local doctor.You may need double dose sometimes. Soon after taking Tab Misoprostol, abdominal cramp and vaginal bleeding start within 7 days and next period may be earlier/delayed.Post pill abortion, you must do a USG lower abdomen to check retained bits/ conceptional products if any and may need D &C to complete abortion.Practice safe sex by using safe period/OCP/ other methods to prevent unwanted pregnancy.Be well.

I started my new pack of pills on time and everything was fine. Well on the 3rd week I messed up and skipped two pills. I had to restart a pack and now have been spotting for over a week. Help!","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope i can help you today.First of all, I want to tell you that the antibiotics you took in the first pack should not interfere with the birth control you took, and the fact that you got a normal period on time means you do not have to worry about pregnancy.Missing two or more pills in a row usually causes some breakthrough bleeding a few days after the missed pills, even if you make them up.  This is the bleeding you are experiencing now.  It most likely will stop eventually, but may continue until you finish this pack. You maximize the possibility of stopping the spotting by trying to take your pills at the same time every day.  A way you can help remember your daily pill is to take it at the same time as some routine activity you do every day, for example brushing your teeth, or having a morning coffee.  Carrying your pills in your purse all the time can also help if you do not consistently stay in the same place every night.I hope I was able to answer your question today and that this information was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. BrownYou should use a backup method of birth control for at least a week after your two missed pills (in case you ovulated then), but after that you can rely on the pill for contraception."},{"Patient":"Hello, I have been on Aviane birth control for 3 months and my pharmacy said they no longer carried that generic brand so they switched it automatically to Lessina another generic form for Alesse . I didn t think anything would change in my body because Aviane and Lessina had all the same levels of everything and everyone said I should have no problems with it changing. But I have had bleeding for the past 6 days. I started the new pack of pills(Lessina) after I finished my Aviane pack and had my period during my Placebo pills and then started Lessina. I was fine for the first 5 days but then I had breakthrough bleeding which is brown and clotty. It has been going on for 6 days and ive been on this pack for 11 days. I have no started looking really pale and feel light headed and woozy. Why am I feeling this way? Is it from switching BC eventhough they have the same levels of everything?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.  Generic medications have the same active ingredients as the brand name drug, but the ingredients in the pill that give it it's color and shape can affect how your body digests the pill and can sometimes give you different side effects.  I have seen many patients who have new side effects when changing from a brand name to a generic, or substituting one generic for another.The breakthrough bleeding with Lessina may improve over time, but if you are feeling lightheaded and dizzy you should call your healthcare provider and have an examination to check for anemia or any other reasons you feel lightheaded.  Unless you are bleeding very heavily (changing a soaked pad every hour) it is unliklely you have lost enough blood to become symptomatic from 6 days of brekthrough bleeding, so a medical evaluation really needs to be done for your light-headedness.In the meantime, i would also contact the doctor who prescribed you the Lessina and see if you could be changed to a pill with a slightly higher dose of estrogen.  The amount of estrogen is what helps to control your menstrual cycle on the pill, and you may benefit temporarily for a change in brand.Also, if your local pharmacy doesn't stock Aviane, another pharmacy in your area may have it and changing pharmacies may help you to get more of the brand that works best for you.

If any pill is missed, it should be taken next morning, in addition to the These pills are regular birth control pills. However, if double dose is taken , it can give you protection from pregnancy.

So if you have been having unprotected sex and your period is late, you are at risk for pregnancy.  Your cycle should also not be affected by removal of the coil, so it should not affect your cycle.However, if you are deliberately trying to become pregnant or are worried about pregnancy, the stress from worrying about it may actually delay your cycle further.So I recommend performing a urine pregnancy test and if it is negative, retest in one week if your period does not come by then.

But it becomes necessary to remove such  a device as it may not function as it is supposed to if it gets displaced.To remove the displaced coil is a relatively easy procedure and can be done in most cases at the Gynaecology OPD itself. This will feel like an internal examination to you, and may be only just slightly more uncomfortable than that as they may use a small instrument made specially to remove it for the same.It is not very long procedure and you need not worry as this removes the dislodged IUD which is in the womb very easily in 99% of cases.In a rare few if the IUCD is displaced further ultrasound guidance may be required. In a few more if the above procedure fails we may have to do removal under anesthesia with the help of hysteroscope or laparoscope.

I'm almost 20 years old, 5'3\\", and 150 pounds.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,If your periods were not normal for continuous two months (I believe they were scanty), and you are suspecting yourself to be pregnant, you should get your pregnancy status confirmed. In fact birth control pills should not be started unless pregnancy is ruled out. Please get pregnancy test done on the overnight first morning urine sample. Along with get ultrasonography also done. If your pregnancy test reveals 'no pregnancy', no worries. However if the pregnancy test is positive and the ultrasonography shows empty uterus, you have to consider the possibility of pregnancy somewhere outside the uterine cavity (ectopic pregnancy). Since your previous menses are likely to be scanty and had continuous pain in the lower abdomen, ectopic pregnancy possibility should be kept in mind. To diagnose an ectopic pregnancy, one has to be ectopic minded. If it turns out to be ectopic pregnancy, you will have to get admitted in hospital. It is an haemorrhagic emergency when it ruptures. Please report to your Obstetrician. If the pregnancy test is positive and ultrasonography shows gestational sac in the uterine cavity, you are having a normal intrauterine pregnancy. If it is unwanted pregnancy, you may opt for termination of pregnancy by medicines. It is safe and effective method for terminating pregnancies upto 9 weeks of gestation. If pregnancy test is negative and the uterus is empty, your stress is over since there is no pregnancy. In that case, cramps in your abdomen could be attributed to increased acidity due to birth control pills. Proton pump inhibitor antacids like Pantoprazole will help you in this. If there is any type of pregnancy, please discontinue oral contraceptive pills till the further decision is executed by your Obstetrician. I hope this helps you for further management.

And when would sexual intercourse be safe to do the moment I start taking them? Thank you!","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.The Althea contraceptive contains a combination of estrogen, progesterone and an ingredient that is an anti-androgen, meaning it fights your body's production of male hormones, which can help decrease acne and excessive hair growth. You take the pill every day (at the same time if possible) every day for three weeks of the month.  For one week a month, you take no pills and you should have your period start during this time.  You should start the pill on the first day of your next period and it will protect against pregnancy immediately.  Birth control pills are 99 percent effective in preventing pregnancy, and usually give you a short, light period every 28 days or so. So you finish the three weeks of pills, and then start a new pack exactly 7 days after you finish the old one.The birth control injection, called Depo Provera, has only the hormone progesterone in it, so it doesn't have any known benefits for your skin.  You get the injection every 3 months and usually the shot causes spotting and irregular bleeding for the first 6 months followed by no periods at all.  The shot is nearly 100 percent effective and you don't need to remember to take a tablet every day, but many people dislike the injection due to the bleeding side effects.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful to you.

Take iron supplements with your diet.Avoid stress, control body wt by regular light exercise, drink plenty of water and need proper sleep.If you need further consultation with me,then you can visit  care."},{"Patient":"Hello, i have a question about getting off of birth control . i took birth control pills for two months. when i first strted them i got my period the week after i started them, which was only two weeks after ending my last period. Now, i havent gotten a oeriod in almost two months, but ive gotten several pregnancy tests that have come out negative. is it normal not to get a period for this long? how long will it take ?","Doctor":"Hello,I have gone through your query and understood your concern. Firstly, I would like to know if you used any additional protection during your first cycle of pill usage and secondly, if you are still on the pill. Menstrual disturbances are common during the initial cycles of the usage of oral contraceptive pills. They can take the form of frequent periods, inter-menstrual spotting or bleeding or absent periods. This usually covers up in a couple of months as the body adjusts itself to the new levels of hormones. However, regular evaluation by your health care provider is mandatory in vies of the possible side effects. In the current scenario, you need a proper evaluation by an expert to plan further management. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, good day! Me and my girlfriend had unprotected last Sunday which is Oct. 28, 2012. We bought nordette and used it as an ECP. She took the 4 pills at 1:00 PM after the day we had unprotected sex(Oct. 29, 2012) and she took the other 4 pills at 1:00 AM(Oct. 30,2012) then after 4 hours she vomited. I am thinking that the effect of the pills is lessen because she vomit, am i right or what? Please advise, should she repeat the procedure i mean should she take another 8 pills? Thank you very much!","Doctor":"Hallow Dear In fact Nordette  is a regular birth control pill. However, since she has taken 4 pills, it should act as an emergency contraceptive pill also. The first 4 pills were sufficient and they were retained. Next day, she has repeated the same dose again. Then she got vomiting after 4 hours. Within 4 hours, the pills leave the stomach, so the pills would not get vomited and they will have their effect. She would avoid pregnancy due to this unprotected sex. 8 pills was quite a high dose and hence she vomited due to stomach irritation. Now please give her a tablet of Pantoprazole every morning on empty stomach for a week or so to control the stomach irritation. I hope this helps.Dr. Nishikant"},{"Patient":"I had sex on December 3 and the condom broke he didn t ejaculate in me but I was nervous anyway and took a plan b just to be safe. I took the plan b on 4th. I have irregular periods and my last one was on 11/23/2015. Thursday, December 10th I was bleed like a period, but I just had my period so I don t know if it s a side affect of plan b. I m supposed to begin birth control the Sunday after my period but I don t know if this is my actual period so i don t know if I should start taking it yet","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to HEALTHCARE MAGIC..I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. The first time you had bleeding must be breakthrough bleeding. This type of bleeding normally occurs within 3 weeks of intake of a plan B pill or emergency contraceptive pill. This a normal feature of a plan B pill intake & there is nothing much to be concerned about it.Now you should wait for your next period to come. Start your birth control pills on 1st day of menstrual bleeding. However your period might also be delayed due to plan B pill intake. Use condom until your next period.Don't use a Plan B pill too frequently. Use condom or regular contraceptive pill as method of contraception in future. Regular taking emergency contraceptive pills can cause problems like irregular periods, ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome & even infertility.For more queries consult a gynaecologistHope this information helps"},{"Patient":"I have recently replaced my implanon birth control so I kind of expected to have irregular bleeding for awhile.

Kindly see a Gynaecologist and get an internal examination done for the same.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"i am a trust pills user for 10 months. and i decided to switch to daphne pills. i tdid not finish the trust pills coz i already got my first period on sunday, so on sunday night i took the first pill of daphne. i had unprotected sex with my husband 3 days after my menstruation but i drink regularly the pills . i am expecting for my period this last week of sunday this month. but it didnt arrived it, and its tuesday now. am i pregnant? but i dont have any signs of pregnancy at all. i already have 1 year old and 3 months son. but i dont think im pregnant coz i dont feel anything at all just like before my first pregnancy","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Trust pills are birth control pills having Ethinyl estradiol, levonorgestrel and  ferrous fumarate. The last is iron to complete 28 days. First two are the hormonal components which give the effect of birth control. After getting the menses, you shifted to Daphne which contains  Lynestrenol  (Progesterone). Both these pills are good birth control pills provided they are consumed regularly. However I would suggest you to stick to Trust. You had sexual intercourse 3 days after your menstruation while on the pills. So the chances of the pregnancy are very rare. When you are taking birth control pills regularly, you are well protected from the pregnancy, whenever you may have intercourse. Moreover your intercourse was not during the fertile period. !4 days prior to the next menses (when you are not on pills), the egg release (ovulation) occurs. Egg has got a life of 24 hours and sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a period of about one week around the day of ovulation is considered as fertile period. Your intercourse was far away from this period. Also, you are not having any 'feel' of the pregnancy too. Further more, you are on the pills regularly. So you are not forming eggs. Therefore most probably you are not pregnant. The delay in your menstruation may be due to change and irregularity in the composition of the pills. Progesterone only pills are known to cause less bleeding. Delay by two days should not be considered as delay. Still to confirm the diagnosis, please wait for 1 week more and then perform urine pregnancy test on the overnight morning first urine sample. Earlier these tests may give false negative results. If you do not want to wait that long, you may go for Beta hCG test which gives reliable results even few days before missing period. This should take away your stress. And finally, even if the pills have failed (which is very rare) and you are pregnant, you can terminate the pregnancy safely by medicines up to 9 weeks. I hope this helps you.

I herd that after 2 days you should not finish the pack and just wait until that pack would have been completed to start a new one. When I forgot to take my pills i started my period that week. It has been about 2 weeks since then. Me original pack would have ended today and I would have started a new one tomorrow. Should I go ahead and start a new one tomorrow or should I wait until after I have my next period and start the new pack the day i finish?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.You are correct in the fact that after missing your birth control pill for four days you do need to start over with another pack. However, you are supposed to start that pack as soon as your next \\"period\\" begins, not ends, even if it came at the wrong time. So you really should have started a new pack a while ago, and you should have used a backup method to prevent pregnancy in the meantime.It sounds like it has been about three weeks in total since you took your last active birth control pill. So if your menstrual cycle off the pill is regular, you should be expecting a normal menstrual cycle in about a week. If you decide to wait until your next period starts, you should start the pill in the same way you did when you first started taking it in general- either starting on the first day of your period or the Sunday after your period begins (if you get your period on Sunday you should start that day). Ideally you should be bleeding when you start the pack, this will ensure that you get your menstrual period during the pill free week and also protect you most effectively against pregnancy. What will get you back on effective birth control the fastest is to just start taking the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control during this first pack. You may not menstruate at the correct time this month, but it will get back to normal once you have gotten back to taking the pill every day and not missing any.If you do not get your period at the end of the new pack, I recommend performing a pregnancy test just in case if you had unprotected sex in the time period between your last menstrual cycle and now.So in summary, you will be protected against pregnancy fastest if you start your new pack right away. In the future, please remember if you miss more than two days of your birth control pills, the best thing to do is to immediately start a new pack of pills and throw out the old one. Your menstrual cycle should come at the end of the pack that you took correctly and completely.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"i has sex with my fiancee on 20th i was careful not to ejaculate inside.it was unplanned and we both were having sex for the first time.i gave her UNWANTED 72 after 3 hrs on the doubt as some part of semen could have gone inside and now she is experiencing vaginal bleeding and lower abdominal pain .how can we neutralize the effect and how long will it last. is there any effect on the coming menstrual period. she is about 5ft 5in and 54 kgs.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,The fact that she has taken Unwanted 72 within 3 hours of unprotected sex gives her protection against pregnancy. Unwanted 72 is a preparation which contains reproductory hormones Levonorgestrel . Hence after few days when the raised levels of this hormone levonorgetrel start dropping down, there is withdrawal bleeding which lasts only for few days. You do not have to do anything for that. However, if there is some pain in the abdomen, she may take antispasmodic painkiller to get relief. Because of the pills and this bleeding, it is likely that her expected menses will be delayed by few days. Nothing to be worried about. I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"I had the depo shot on August 3rd, 2012. I had unprotected sex on August 17,2012. I have not had any bleeding during the entire time I ve had the shot. During unprotected sex he definitely did not cum inside me, but may have had Precum. What are the chances of me being pregnant? I am so worried. That was the only time we had sex. Yet alone unprotected.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.If the depo shot is given to you in the first five days of your menstrual cycle, or if you had a negative pregnancy test at the time the shot was given, it is immediately effective in preventing pregnancy. So you do not need to use a condom or other backup method if you are having unprotected sex to prevent pregnancy while using the Depo-Provera injection.Depo-Provera in addition causes irregular to absent menstrual cycles. This will continue as long as you use the shot, however you are protected against pregnancy as long as you get your subsequent injections on time. Many women enjoy the convenience of not bleeding every month.So to ease your peace of mind, you may perform a urine pregnancy test, but if it is negative you really do not need to be concerned about accidental pregnancy as the shot is nearly 100% effective. You should continue to use condoms, if desired, to protect from STDs.I hope that I was able to adequately answer your question today, and that this information was reassuring.Best wishes,Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I have been changed from Microgynon 30 to Loestrin 30, i was given my new pill during my 7day break and i was told that i could carry on taking my new pill after 7 days as normal ...

On the leaflet it said I should have carried on taking my new pill without a break but doesn't say whether I need a second contraceptive if i did not do this ... any information would be great full","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Microgynon 30 and Loestrin 30 are two brands of the exact same kind of pill, meaning that the active ingredients are the same.  It is equivalent to changing from store-brand Ibuprofen tablets to Advil brand... which means that your body is getting the same dose of the hormones of the pill when you start your new pack regardless of which brand you use.Therefore, your new pill is effective immediately as birth control and you do not need to use a backup method if you start the new brand after a 7 day placebo week.If more than a week has gone by since you finished your old pack, you should start the new pack immediately and use a backup method of birth control for the first 7-10 days if you accidentally ovulated.I hope I was able to adequately answer your question today and that this information was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I am 21 and have had the implanon birth control since October, and it has pushed its way close to the surface of my skin and feels like its going to push through and if I lean on my arm wrong it feels like it is trying to poke out, is my body rejecting it?","Doctor":"Hi there,More than the worry of rejection, if the Implanon is not properly intradermal it may not be an effective contraception.You need to get it removed and replaced preferably on the opposite arm by a trained medical professional.

This is enhanced when there is weight gain during usage of hormone medication. Also stress, concomitant use of certain antibiotic and other medications can reduce the contraceptive effect of hormones and can lead to failures and hormone disturbances leading to several symptoms.

And It would have been easier to insert, though it would have caused bleeding as well. Some Mirena insertions are painful and result in crampy pain. The maneuver of insertion involves holding the cervix, which could cause nausea and uterine cramps.I would advise you to go for the mirena insertion on the 8-9 day of your next period.

If you can find them by palpating with your fingers, it means that the IUD is in place. Spotting after intercourse could be due to an unhealthy cervix with some cervicitis or an erosion, vaginitis, a polyp of the cervix or endometrium or some hormone imbalance.

So, this is sort of an awkward question, but for the past few days I've been getting headaches while masturbating.  The first couple times it hasn't been so bad, but the last two I believe have been so bad I couldn't even finish.  I'm just wondering if this is something I should be worried about, and what I can do about it.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.

It is very very effective with a failure rate of less than 0.03%, when taken correctly and regularly.It would be advisable to you, especially since you are keen to avoid conception.Another good alternative for you would be the intrauterine copper T. It is also reversible and you don't have to remember taking a pill everyday.Also it is non hormonal.With Novelon you will not have any problems conceiving later, nor does it cause weight gain.Hope this helps.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am currently on Tri-cyclen Lo birth control, and take it regularily and responsibly.

Is this all normal??","Doctor":"Hi,It is true that after stopping hormone contraception, some disturbance is observed, but, it does not persist for days together. Your symptoms point to general ill health and hence, I would suggest an evaluation by a general physician. This should be followed by a pelvic examination along with an abdominal sonogram, complete blood picture, urinalysis to exclude infections. Please maintain a healthy weight and a healthy diet. Regular exercise along with meditation helps to control the irritability. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"What should my married, 31yr old daughter do?

In fact we do not prescribe oral birth control pills to a woman who has high blood pressure. The women on oral blood pressure pills are monitored for their blood pressure. If  persistent alarming rise in blood pressure is noted, they are not suitable candidates for oral birth control pills. I feel your wife should switch over to some other method for birth spacing. She may opt for non-hormonal intrauterine devise like CuT or condom. Oral birth control pills or any hormonal method does not seem to be safe for her.

I have only been sexually active for a month, and always with a condom as well as the pills, but I discovered recently that I did not start my pills at the correct time of month when I first began taking them (roughly a month and a half ago). Am I satisfactorily protected against unwanted pregnancy? I take the pills consistently now.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.Errin is actually a pill that contains only progesterone.  You need to take a pill every day of the month for it to work.  Alone, the Errin pill is about 90 percent effective in preventing pregnancy, so if you always use a condom you are very safe from pregnancy.If you started the pills over a month ago, you need not to worry about an error in taking the pill from last month.  As long as you use condoms too, you are very well protected against pregnancy.  Progesterone-only pills are generally not recommended as a primary form of birth control (alone with no backup method) unless you are breastfeeding, where the breastfeeding hormone also provides some protection.If you decide to have unprotected sex, a combined (both estrogen and progesterone) pill is more effective (over 99%) than the \\"mini\\" pill.I hope I answered your question adequately today and that this information was reassuring.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"two days ago, while i am taking bath, accidentally some undiluted dettol spilt over my penis.

I know everyone s body is different, but an estimate will be helpful. Thanks!!","Doctor":"Hello,You can get the IUD removed soon after your period. It can be removed with more ease if it is done during a period, since the softer cervix makes pulling the IUD out easier. Most often, the removal is smooth and there is no bleeding or spotting. Withdrawal bleeding can sometimes occur as with any progesterone pill. In case there is some trauma to the soft parts while removal, or if instrumentation is needed, some amount or spotting or bleeding can be seen.

This is perhaps the reason why you have also been experiencing diarrhea and headaches. Please see your consultant for proper appraisal of the situation as you may need other medications to arrest this bleeding and also a sonogram to assess the status of the pelvic organs. You would need hormone supplements to stop the bleeding completely in addition to styptics.

Depo provera is medroxyprogesterone acetate which has the common side effect of irregular spotting, prolonged amenorrhea and irregular periods.The periods usually normalize once you stop taking depo shots.There is nothing to worry, however you can stop taking further depo shots if you find irregular bleeding troublesome.Hope you found the answer helpful.

The pill I am on allows you to do this and take your next pill as you normally would without having to use backup birth control. I am now having a brown discharge and would like to know what you think this means and if I should take the morning after pill. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.You were completely correct in following the proper instructions for what to do when you forget to take your pill.  If you miss one pill but take it within 24 hours of when you forgot it, the effectiveness of the pill is not reduced and you still rely on it as primary contraception.  However, one of the side effects of taking the pill at irregular intervals is having spotting when you are not supposed to have your period.  The brown discharge you see is actually very light bleeding and will usually stop within a few days after you take your pill at the same time every day.There are apps you can download (if you have a smartphone) or email programs on the internet that will send you a reminder to take your pill every day.  Or a good low-tech method to help you remember is to coordinate taking your pill with something you do around the same time every day (like brushing your teeth) so you get into a daily habit. I hope I adequately answered your question and that this information was reassuring.

I have never taken any kind of contraceptive before. I am also a smoker (average of 6 sticks a day) I would appreciate your advice. Thank you","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today. I assume the pill you are mentioning is Nordette... which is a regular monthly cycle birth control pill.  You can use regular birth control pills as emergency contraception, but you must take 4 pills twice- 12 hours apart.  In short term dosing, this is not an issue with smoking nor will it be affected by any other medicines you are taking.  However, emergency contraception really is only effective within 72 hours of unprotected sex.However, you may develop nausea and vomiting as a side effect from all the estrogen in the pills.  Emergency contraception kits are available in pharmacies that have a different kind of hormone and fewer side effects.  Depending on where you are in the world, you do not necessarily need a doctor's prescription.  These kits can work up to 5 days after intercourse ( though most effective within 72 hours) so I recommend you use a store-bought kit rather than the Nordette.If you do use emergency contraception, it usually either delays your period or makes it come about 2-4 days after taking the medicine.So either way, if you miss your period, you should do a pregnancy test just in case.I hope I was able to answer your question and that my advice was helpful.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hello i am on logynon but had diarrehia 2 days ago do i take an extra pill for the day that i was ill from my other packet and then carry on as normal? i havent had sex yet as was on my period so im not to worried but just dont know weather i have to replace the pill from sataday as thats when i had diarrehia :(","Doctor":"Hello and I hope I can help you today.You do not need to take an additional birth control pill because of diarrhea.  Diarrhea may make you lose water, but it does not wash out medication you have taken.  The only situation where you need to replace a pill is if you vomited within a few hours of taking it.So you can go about your routine as usual and start the next pack at the normal time.  I would advise you also to drink plenty of fluids as diarrhea can make you dehydrated.I hope I was able to answer your question and that this information was reassuring.

Now there are many modified versions of intrauterine device like Copper T (CuT), Mirena, etc. Some of them are with copper coils while some are with hormones impregnated in them. All of them are good and their active life varies from 3 years to 10 years as per the device chosen. Since you are going abroad the chances of less availability of medical services cannot be ignored. Hence, Intrauterine device would suit you better. I would advice you to get the device fitted at least a month before you are leaving the country so that if there is any problem, you will know it well in advance and can be tackled in your own country. The common side effects include pain in abdomen and intermittent bleeding. Before putting in the intrauterine device, you have to undergo a clinical examination to rule out any contraindication for intrauterine device. The important contraindications are infection and any tumour in the uterus. If at all, intrauterine device does not suit you, you may even switch to oral birth control pills. You can carry the complete stock for three years with you. Moreover, condom is very safe and easily available contraceptive device all over the world, which if used correctly has more than 95% success rate. So in nutshell, if there is no contraindication, intrauterine device is a good option you have made and go with it. Bon voyage, madam!"},{"Patient":"This is a birth control question.

I am 3 days late and on birth control.  My husband and I had intercourse 3 times during the week I should have been ovulating and we forgot to use a back up method.  Does generic diflucan affect the effectiveness of my birth control?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.The interaction between certain medications and the birth control pill are really theoretical except for a few medications that treat seizures and a couple of very strong antibiotics.  Diflucan is not one of those medications so you do not have to worry about the effectiveness of your birth control method.  So even if you didn't use a backup method it is extremely unlikely you would conceive, as long as you didn't miss any pills.I would recommend doing a urine pregnancy test just in case as your period is late (the pill normally is 99.5 percent effective which means 1 in 200 women a year will get pregnant even when using birth control). But the greatest likelihood is that everything is fine and you and your husband do not need to be concerned.I hope I was able to answer your question today and that my advice was reassuring.Best wishes, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"I am a 16 year old female and have just been put on levlen ed with my mother's consent after losing my virginity. while i am in a steady relationship and my family is aware i am sexually active, a pregnancy could not come at a worse time for me. my boyfriend and i will always use condoms in addition to the contraceptive pill, but i have done my research and found the levlen ed is one of the least reliable forms of the pill. if i am on levlen and using condoms, how likely is pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.I am not sure what internet source you are using, but Levlen is a completely effective low-dose birth control pill.  Unless you weigh more than 180 lbs (about 80 kg) low dose pills have the same effectiveness as any other- meaning you are protected against pregnancy 99.5 percent of the time.  Condoms are 90 percent effective as a contraceptive as well.Most people who use the pill use it as a single method of birth control, but the fact that you use condoms in addition makes accidental pregnancy really impossible.  It is a good habit to use condoms all the time anyway to prevent transmission of sexually transmitted infections, but you do not have to worry about pregnancy.I hope I was able to answer your question today and that this information was reassuring to you.

The symptom subsided, but came on again after 2weeks, but this time, the discharge seems to have gone from milky/yellow to pink/brown, and of course the itching too. What could be wrong with me, please. I m so scared now.","Doctor":"Hi,From the description of your symptoms, it appears as though you have some vaginitis. This could be secondary to the procedure of insertion of the IUD, or may have happened in an isolated manner. This is a recurrent problem, especially if not completely treated. Since you are breastfeeding, you cannot be given oral medication. You need to take the vaginal medication again after a proper evaluation. If needed, a swab test for culture and sensitivity should be done to plan proper management. Periodic treatment is needed for 3-6 months to prevent recurrences. Please maintain proper genital hygiene, avoid vaginal tampons and sexual intercourse until complete healing. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I am on tricyclen lo birth control pills.

But I have been bleeding/spotting for the past week and a bit. My periods normally only last 5 days. I m scared, what could be going on?","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can help you today.It is very common to have breakthrough bleeding, which is bleeding when you are not supposed to have your period, when you miss a birth control pill. The pill is out of your system within 24 hours which is like day 2 of your pill-free week, so some women will start to have a mini-period then.  You may bleed at the end of the pack, but if you don't, you should do a pregnancy test because missing two pills, even if you back them up, can trigger ovulation.So you don't need to worry about the bleeding, because that is just a side effect of missing pills.  This should not continue to happen when you remember to take the pill every day.  Keeping the pill with you at all times (like in your purse, instead of at home so you have access to it wherever you go) can help avoid missing pills.  There are also internet programs and apps you can use as a reminder to take your pill.I hope this information was reassuring and I was able to adequately answer your question, and that my advice was helpful.

This is because the dosage given in the initial phase should be sufficient to cause the abortion while the successive doses complete the process. The abortion soon after a missed period is similar to an ordinary menstrual period since the products of conception are small in size. A trans-vaginal sonogram should be able to give you information on the completion of the process along with a clinical evaluation by an expert.

Am I protected against becoming pregnant","Doctor":"Hello,Since you have started the pills afresh after taking a break, you are not protected in this cycle and perhaps in the next one also. So, you have chances of conception if you do not take any additional protection during this period. You can go ahead with unprotected intercourse while taking the pills after the first two cycles are completed. This assures that the contraceptive effect is in place since ovulation is stopped with Cerazette in most cases. Hope you find this information useful.

You can wait for your natural period to ensue and if it does not, please go ahead with a HPT 3-7 days later. Also, see your specialist for a local examination to see where the ring has gone.

Now my breast are sore after a week of being on sprintec and my nipples have grown however the soreness is not as bad as a previous time when i was pregnant. Im scare that i might be pregnant since my breast are sore, or if its just a common side effect of tri-sprintec but i dont understand why my nipples have grown a bit pls help?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,Both the pills you have mentioned are birth control pills. Lo Loesterin Fe is a low oestrogen pill hence it may cause low bleeding. Tri-Sprintec is a average Oestrogen-Progesterone pill. If you were on one brand pill regularly and just change the brand without having any gap, the chances of protection are very high. Moreover, the intercourse happened in the first week of menses. This is little away from the fertile period.Egg release in women happens 14 days prior to next menses. Considering 24 hours life of egg and 72 hours activity of sperms, a week around this day is considered as fertile period. Already on birth control pills and intercourse away from the fertile period, the chances of pregnancy are very low. You have not mentioned whether you have missed period or not. Missing a period is the first and cardinal symptom of pregnancy. All other symptoms appear later.Your breast and nipples symptoms could be due to rough handling also. Still if you are in doubt, please wait for the periods to miss. If at all it misses, then 8-10 days after that perform urine pregnancy test and/or ultrasonography for detection of pregnancy; done earlier, they may prove to be inconclusive. Beta hCG tests are conclusive even 2-3 days after missed period.I hope you are satisfied with the explanation."},{"Patient":"I am a 35 year old male and own a landscape business for 2 years, for the last 6 weeks It has become difficult for me to get through half the day without becoming exhausted (low energy that comes on fairly sudden, slightly shakey, foggy mind kinda like im in a dream) I have cut my hours back and have had employees make up the difference, thinking maby I am working to hard, energy still cuts out half way thru the day.

I suggest you to investigate with serum calcium, serum sodium, pottasium estimation, serum TSH estimation for primary work up. Sgot, sgpt, urea, creatinine also investigated as toxic metabolite accumulation also sometime can lead fatigue.You are absolutely right in a way that fatigue can be from exhaustion, overwork, lack of sleep etc. Revert back with above reports to guide you further.

Should I get it removed or ask my doctor about it at my apt next week?","Doctor":"HIWell come to HCMI really appreciate your concern, Intra uterine device and thyroid dysfunction are complete different condition and nothing to take anything with each other, unless you have some clinical complaint due to IUD then this can be removed else this is no need to removed, hope this information helps take care and have a nice day."},{"Patient":"Hai Dr. i tnx the opportunity. my query is on the 20/08/2012 i used PETOGEN FRESENIUS INJECTION from there i started bleeding very dark blood , sometimes i change pad 2 times some once, when i stop bleeding other day i had sex with my hub immediately i started bleeding. I went to a clinic on the 18 /09/2012 the nurses gave me famynor pill is every thing going on the right track, what the pill for now?","Doctor":"Dear Friend,Please try to understand the situation and the medicines. PETOGEN FRESENIUS is medroxy progesterone preparation which is Progesterone Hormone. Famynor are birth control pills, combination of Oestrogen and Progesterone. These hormones stop the bleeding which is occurring from the uterine lining.It seems you are having irregular and profuse bleeding irrespective of sex. This seems to be from the uteine lining. Progesterone would control it better than oestrogen+Progesterone. PETOGEN FRESENIUS was better medicine for this purpose.If you are continuing to have bleeding in spite of progesterone, it is better you get the cause properly diagnosed. You may require study of the uterine lining through telescope and microscope, hormonal levels in the blood checked. This will not only clinch the diagnosis but will rule out certain alarming conditions like cancers.Please report to your Gynaecologist for further management."},{"Patient":"i had sex with my husband on 25 oct and my periods date is 8 and periods will start on 8 november then when should i start taking mala d ? can i start taking mala d tablets from 25 oct ( the day when we had sex) ?

I want to know proper about safe tablets / medicine process which i eat after sex with ym husband and sex without condom. please advise me urgent. thanks.","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,You had unprotected intercourse in fertile period. You should have taken emergency contraceptive pill or two tablets of Mala D within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. Now you have to wait for the menses to appear. If they appear, start Mala D tablets from second day of the menses. If menses do not come, get your urine pregnancy test or/and ultrasonography done for detection of pregnancy 8-10 days after missed period. Tests done earlier may be inconclusive. If you are pregnant and do not want the pregnancy you can get aborted by medicines. Report to your Gynaecologist for that. After abortion, you can start the Mala D tablets immediately. I hope this answers your query."},{"Patient":"Dear Dr. Manjunath, I m at the day of 12th of taking Jasmin and I know that I will have my period 7 days after finishing the last one , in 9 days. I need to advance my period for 5-6 days due to my vacation. I would appreciate it if you could help my with it. Best regards Neda Jonson","Doctor":"Hallow Neda,If you want to extend your period for next 15 days or so, you need to continue the tablets for next 12 days at least, or may be for 15 days till you do not want the menses to appear.Jasmin tablets are Oestrogen + Progesterone tablets. These hormones grow and maintain the lining of the uterus (Endometrium). When the tablets are discontinued, the levels of the hormones start falling down and thus the grown endometrium cannot be supported. It then starts breaking down and is thrown out along with some blood after about 4-6 days. This is menstruation. Now you can plan when to discontinue the tablets. Continue taking the hormone tablets as per your requirement. I hope this solves your query."},{"Patient":"hi, im currently on the pill but have been having issues with it (was taken off it and only been back on for two months). my last period was 2 weeks ago but was barely there, now i have very sore breats that even my partner has said look bigger, light dark discharge for the past 5 days, nausa, fatigue and headaches . i have done a urine test and it was negative. Could i be pregnant oris it something else. im normally very regular and havnt had a discharge like this before. Thank u for your advise.","Doctor":"Sore breasts, nausea and vomiting could be pregnancy signs. It is not clear from your question whether the discharge is from nipples or from vagina. If it is from vagina, this could suggest non-viable baby inside the uterus trying to get aborted (Missed abortion). If it is from nipples, the chances of pregnancy are very high. However, very scanty period 2 weeks ago is a tricky issue. If it was a real period, you cannot be pregnant and the breast changes and nausea, fatigue, etc. could be due to birth control pills. To me, this looks to be the most possible cause. However, you may get ultrasonography done to rule out the pregnancy. If it turns out to be  missed abortion, then urgent termination has to be performed lest serious complications like serious bleeding due to bleeding disorder. Your Obstetrician will take care of it. Now do not waste time and go to Obstetrician."},{"Patient":"hi, I have the iud and last couple weeks I have been experience nauseas, dizziness and my stomach is getting big and I have been working out, and since I got the iud I have been having my periods this month I didn t got it but my pregnancy test at home came out negative what do you recommend to do?","Doctor":"Hallow Dear,I have understood your situation and problem.Whenever a period is missed in childbearing age, pregnancy should be ruled out first. Moreover, you are having nausea and other gastric problems.Please keep in mind that iud prevents only the intrauterine pregnancy and not the pregnancy outside the uterus. Hence, whenever one misses a period with iud fitted in, we first try to evaluate the woman for ectopic pregnancy. The other possibility is pregnancy with iud which is a rare incidence. Also a possibility of migration or expulsion of iud is to be kept in mind when pregnancy can occur. Of all these possibilities, ectopic tubal pregnancy is a very serious condition and when ruptured, may cause alarming bleeding inside the abdomen. Please do not waste time and report to an Obstetrician to pinpoint the diagnosis and help you. I hope you have got proper guidance. Ultrasonography may help you to diagnose the condition."},{"Patient":"hi i had a baby in march, used the mini pill until beginning of may and then had a mirena coil fitted, i carried on taking the mini pill for a further 7 days after the coil was fitted as doctor suggested i do. 2 days after i had coil in i had a little spotting which was fine and then 2 weeks after i had some bleeding but not alot. i havnt had any bleeding at all since that so a good 9/10 weeks ago. i was supposed to return 6 weeks after the coil fitting to check it was still in place, but with a new born baby that was poorly i didnt go for the check unfortunately. for the last couple of weeks i have had a very strong sense of smell, very overpowering at times and its making me feel very sick and i have also tody been sick, i have had no bleeding as i explained for about 9 weeks now, also tired and gaining weight. is this normal for the mirena coil or could it be something else? thanks","Doctor":"Hello, and I hope I can answer your question.The Mirena coil normally produces irregular bleeding in the first few months of use, so those symptoms are completely normal.  However your fatigue, weight gain and feeling sick make me concerned that your IUD may not be working properly (you never went back for the re-examination) and that you may have gotten pregnant.  The device can fall out occasionally, especially in women who have given birth recently.I suggest you do a pregnancy test right away. If the test is positive, you should see a doctor immediately, as there is a risk of a tubal or ectopic pregnancy if you get pregnant with an IUD. An ectopic pregnancy is an emergency and can even result in death without proper treatment.If you are not pregnant, I would still advise you to see a health care provider to check that the Mirena is working properly and evaluate your other symptoms. I hope this advice was helpful, and that you feel better.Sincerely, Dr. Brown"},{"Patient":"Hello, I have been taking the Noriday pill for around 10 months and have had regular periods whilst taking it however last month i had a break though bleed that lasted for around 2/3 days then had my regular period i am due to have my period again in a couple of weeks but the beginning of this week I got another break through bleed but this time its just a brown stain and occasional brown discharge is there anything to be worried about ?","Doctor":"Noriday is progesterone only pill, and breakthrough bleeding is more common than combined estrogen-progesterone pills. So you may change the pill with doctor's advice. Other cause of inter menstrual bleed may be a small polyp or erosion of the uterine cervix. This can be detected by clinical examination with a speculum."},{"Patient":"Hi I ve been on depo for about 9 months so I ve had 3 shots, I ve read alot of bad things about so I decided not to get my 4th shot which was on 2nd of July I ve been waiting on my period now but it seem to taking forever it s been 3 months now but last week I had brown discharge for 2 days no odour but now it s gone..

I had sex with my boyfriend and we had a failure of protection (broken condom) on last Thursday, so I took the morning after pill (as I was not yet on hormonal contraception). My period was due to start on Thursday too, but instead only slight spotting started and this had lasted until Monday, when I got \\"real\\" period and I therefore started the first cycle of my hormonal contraception. How long will it be before I will be under protection of the pill? Do I need to wait for the whole cycle? I am worried if the \\"morning after pill\\" could somehow change the workings of the pill, and while the information leaflet says that my hormonal contraception should be effective from day 1 if taken on the 1st day of period, I am not sure if this is valid in my case? Thank you very much in advance for your reply","Doctor":"Hi,Firstly, since you were due for your natural period at the time of your intercourse, you did not need the emergency pill at all. This medication does not interfere with the regular contraception you are having at present. Only, when an emergency pill is taken, there is a disruption in the menstrual cycle with a delayed period in that cycle. The drug itself leaves the body in five days. With oral pills, additional protection should be taken for 2-3 cycles as a precaution. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"i am 18 and have just found a purple spot on head of my penis, i noticed it straight after sexual intercourse,which was really only oral but did penetrate the vagina unprotected, a women also grabbed at my penis quite hard could this cause damage? i have read online an it seems it is not a sign of a std,but it does say it could be a burst blood vessel am not sure what to do..should i be worried?","Doctor":"Hello welcome to 'Ask A Doctor' service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advise.The purple spot is seems to be because of traumatic injury to penis head.

In June 2011 I stopped with the pill (Yasmine) after 13 years, as we would like to have kids. Since then my body went through weird changes, I gained already 10 kgs and I’m extremely bloated. My belly looks like if I was at least 4-5 months pregnant, I don’t fit in my old pants..I go to the gym at least 3-4 times a week and I watch what I’m eating and still..Besides this I have also terrible mood swings, get irritated very easily and start crying without any reason.. My blood results don’t show anything abnormal and my doctors can not find any reason why this is happening to me, so they also can not help me..I still think it must be hormonal as it all happened since I stopped with the pill.. Could you please advise? Thank you in advance for your help. Kind regards, Eniko","Doctor":"Hi Eniko, I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. Yasmin is an oral contraceptive pill which contains drosperinone which is known to cause weight loss as it removes excessive fluid from the body. Since you have taken these pills for such a long time, stopping them can lead to weight gain and mood swings. However, other causes of weight gain and mood swings like hypothyroidism, cushings syndrome , PCOS should be ruled out by proper examination and investigations by an OBGYN specialist.Hope you found the answer helpful.Wishing you good health.Dr Deepti Verma"},{"Patient":"Hi, I m 14. On the 14th of last month i had sex with my boyfriend, we used a condom and he did cum inside me. At first i thought i was fine because we used protection, but after he pulled out realised that there was cum running down my leg and everywhere else, then i noticed the condom had a massive tear init. I was going to get the morning after pill the next day when early on the morning i had my period, it was a normal period, started at around 9am the usual time and i was heavy! This lasted four days, that is how long it usualy lasts for. So i presumed everything was fine. But lately i have been experiencing heartburn , moodswings, breakouts, sore breasts, cramp in my lower stomach and constant back ache. Some of those symptoms i usually get about a week or so before my next period but not all of them. Today i noticed i was bleeding quite heavily, this only lasted an hour or so and since that bleeding i have no longer been feeling anything, no symptoms at all and my stomach used to be bloated but now its gone back to what is near enough its regular size. but since then it had made me consider my options on the possibility s of why this could be happening.

Thank you very much","Doctor":"Hi,Since you attained your natural period soon after the intercourse, you are safe from pregnancy. Ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile period when conception can occur. You may have had an early period owing to stress in the next cycle. Your symptoms could be the usual premenstrual ones. If you continue to bleed irregularly, you need medical help and should see a specialist for a proper appraisal of the situation. Please try to avoid further intercourse until you heal well and go for regular contraception.

The pain may be unrelated. Yet, to rule out, you can get a sonogram of the pelvis if possible in the trans-vaginal route after seeing a specialist for a proper clinical appraisal of your situation.

When with Mirena in you start getting severe pain in abdomen, the cause could be:1. The uterus cannot get adjusted with it and is trying to throw it out. This is more commonly observed in women without any previous pregnancy.2. There is infection in the uterus and the device.3. The device is trying to perforate through the uterus. You will have to report to the Gynaecologist at the earliest. Ultrasonography/X-ray can reveal about the perforation aspect. Rest two will have to be evaluated by the Gynaecologist by clinical examination. You may have to get the device out if it is not tolerated by you. If there is infection, you may require a course of antibiotics. I hope I have guided you with sufficient information."},{"Patient":"Hello! I was wondering if it would be effective to take marvelon 28 birth control pills as an emergency contraceptive, and if so, how many? I am not on the pill anymore as I found out all oral contraceptives use lactose as a binding agent, and I am lactose intolerant. Sidenote: condom was used, it broke. Any help is appreciated, than you!","Doctor":"Hi,Marvelon may be taken in high doses to act as an emergency contraceptive, but the efficacy has not been proved and would definitely be lesser than the usual emergency pill in view of the raised side effects on account of the increased dosage. This happens with any other oral contraceptive meant for regular use. If you cannot use pills being lactose-intolerant, the ideal choice would be to go for the insertion of an IUD which is non-hormonal. Insertion of the IUD soon after an unprotected intercourse also acts as an emergency contraceptive. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I am currently taking the Depo Provera .

I am having a lot of breakthrough bleeding and I am wondering 1. If its possible I have or will ovulate with how long I ve been on antibiotics and 2. How long until the birth control will be effective again...","Doctor":"If you have been on Seasonique for a while, breakthrough bleeding in general, especially in the second or third month of the pack is not unusual, and can also be caused by the stress of the infection on your body, not necessarily due to ineffectiveness of the birth control.  If you are in the second or third month of the pack, stop taking the pill for about 5-7 days, then restart the same pack and finish it... or throw it out and start a new pack if there are not many left.  The time off the pill, as long as it is 7 days or less, may help you rebuild your uterine lining and make the bleeding stop, like your \\"period\\" at the end of the three month pack.  The decreased effectiveness of birth control with antibiotics, with the exception of certain types that they use to treat TB and other major infections, is largely theoretical.  It is safest to use a backup method until you are off the antibiotics, but you are most likely still adequately protected against pregnancy, especially if you've been on Seasonique for more than one pack."},{"Patient":"HI my g/f had period on 16 oct finished 24oct during the period we had sex many time and i had sex on 24 oct when her period about finished without protection then she had i- pill with 24 hours her period started again on 29 oct and finished on 5 nov today n i had sex again with her without protection will she get pregnant or she has to take again i-phill","Doctor":"Hallow, welcome to HCM!Any intercourse during the menstrual period will not cause pregnancy as during this phase the egg release does not take place. However, it is not advisable to have sex during menstrual period for the great risk of infection. Blood is a very good medium for bacteria to grow. Such infection may affect her fertility, may cause pain in abdomen and back due to congestion or at times even may endanger her life.The egg release takes place 14 days prior to next expected menses. Life of the egg is 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence a week's period around that day is fertile window. Therefore sexual intercourse on 5th day of menses is very unlikely to cause any pregnancy.She should get her menses on time. If she does not, you may get urine pregnancy test and/or ultrasonography performed 8-10 days after missed period as before that these tests are inconclusive.I hope you got proper guidance."},{"Patient":"hello, I am wondering about when to resume taking my birth control pills after a rhinoplasty procedure.

I forgot Friday and took it dead on midnight Saturday, so exactly 12 hours later. I then took it again normally 12pm Saturday,Sunday and today. I ve just had sex, using my pill as a protection. Am I protected from pregnancy?","Doctor":"Though you might be protected from pregnancy, there is a small risk of getting pregnant as you have taken the pill 12 hours later. Usually in such a situation it is wise to avoid sex for two days after the missed pill was taken or condom should have been used by your husband. Not to give any chance for pregnancy in future, I suggest that you should take emergency contraceptive pills if you had sex."},{"Patient":"So i missed two pills in the beginning of my birth control pack and during that time i had sex more then once. i feel nauseated but i took a pregnancy test and it came out neg. the only issue is its been like 4 or 5 days since we we had sex. should i take a morning after pill even though the test came out negative? or will i be fine?","Doctor":"Hi, I have gone through your question and understand your concerns.Urine pregnancy test becomes positive after your periods are overdue and not just after sex.

My Q is now that I m using Charlize pills,(my first try) I m done using the 21 active pills and now I m on my 4th take of my ferrous fumarrate, but suddenly my monthly period started this morning, I m supposed to take my 4th tablet of ferrous this evening. What should I do?do I have to continue taking those 7 ferrous tablets until I m done then start taking a new pack. Or I need to stop taking the left ferrous and start taking the active pills by tomorrow? (coz it says that we should take the pill on the 2nd day of your period) when will I take the new pack?tnx","Doctor":"Hallow, I have read your query and have understood your confusion. Charlize  tablet pack contains 28 tablets. First 21 days tablets are the  main hormone containing tablets. Last seven tablets are as you know are iron tablets. The main purpose of iron tablets is not to break the habit of taking daily tablets. Also they help you to regain the blood lost during menses. After finishing the hormone 21 tablets, any day during the iron tablets the menses start. By the time you finish iron tablets, your menses are over and the new pack starts. You do not have to worry for starting the menses while on iron portion of the tablets. Now you have got two options:1. Continue taking the iron tablets of this pack till the tablets are over. Mostly by that time, your menses also would be over. Then start the new pack from tablet 1.2. On second day of your menses, discard the remaining tablets from the current pack and start the new pack with tablet 1. I would prefer you to opt for second option. No need to be under stress. You are well protected.I am sure, I have resolved your confusion. If so please respond."},{"Patient":"Hi doc, I took postinor 2 in november and sw my period that same november on the 30november and I missed by period for december without having unprotected sex.

I have an unsafe sex with my boyfriend 4 days ago without ejaculation, then he had ejaculated last 3 & 2 days.Last night I took one pill (Lady oral  contraceptive pill manufactured by Pond's Chemical Thailand R.O.P.) and this morning another pill. Would this be effective to prevent pregnancy? Will I be harmed taking this pill i'm using?","Doctor":"Lady oral contraceptive pill are regular contraceptive pills. They have to be started ideally from second day of the menses and taken through out the menses regularly. Random consumption of these pills does not give you protection against pregnancy. To use them as post coital contraception pill, the dose would be much higher, which you have not taken. Now the best option for you is to wait for your menses. If you do not get them, then wait for further 8-10 days to get urine pregnancy test and/or ultrasonography to detect the pregnancy. These tests done earlier may not give reliable results.Beta-hCG tests are highly specific and sensitive. Their results are reliable even 2-3 days after missed period.If you are pregnant and you do not want pregnancy, you may terminate your pregnancy by medicines also. They terminate pregnancy safely up to 9 weeks of gestation.Please remember these medicines have to be taken by Obstetrician's advice and under his/her observation lest the risk of incomplete abortion and/or infection.

I am on a fixed income and can't afford to just go to a doctor if this is normal with an IUD.","Doctor":"This is not normal with IUD.The pain you have described seems to be in the lower abdomen on the sides - one or both. This indicated infection/inflammation of pelvis. If the IUD remains in the uterus for longer time than its life it gets infected. Also if it gets infected by any reason, this can happen.I would advice you to get IUD removed first. Then you may have to take a course of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines to get rid of the infection and swelling in the pelvis. Then your doctor will decide whether you can be fitted IUD again or you need some other birth control method. Please do not ignore nor pull on with this for long. You already done so for a very long period. You need to report to your gynaecologist to get things set right.You may further discuss with me on phone, direct question or by premium question."},{"Patient":"Hi.

Also, if you had a menstrual period on the day of insertion, it should also be ascertained that the IUD did not get expelled. This can be done by checking the threads or getting a sonogram trans-vaginally. In the current scenario, you can see a specialist for a clinical evaluation if you do not see your next period even after one week after it is due. You would need a trans-vaginal sonogram to clarify the situation.

She may start without additional protection from next cycle onward. It is difficult to say if she has conceived already during this cycle.

These may be in the form of a depo shot, implant, IUD or oral medication. For acne, you would need specific treatment from a dermatologist. The triggering factors should be avoided. Intake of oily foods, fats, sweets and baked items should be avoided. Dandruff should be treated. Local applications and oral medication are used for treatment of acne.

You should test for exclusion/confirmation of pregnancy to be on the safe side if you have been sexually active throughout. A blood test followed by a trans-vaginal sonogram would suffice.

Sometimes, cramps can occur around ovulation and if severe, may also result in vomiting and distress. Since you stopped taking the pills, it is likely that ovulation could be returning. Please follow up with your consultant and exclude pregnancy through a blood test ten days after the intercourse. This is the earliest way now. You can ask for a sonogram later.

I was put on the Zpak and steriods for my respiratory infection that I ended up getting a month ago and the rashes and bumps went away. Soon as I was done with my meds the bumps came back even worse. They were so tender like I had splinters all in my fingers.So I was put on a second round of antibiotics and steriods. Now I get them every now and then but not how they were. Now my big thing is a major smell down there that wont go away! I thought maybe it was from being on two rounds of antibiotics and steriods but all the research seems to point at the Mirena which has been a pain ever since I got it!

Its unlikely that the rashes were due to the mirena as you have had it since 2010. Pelvic inflammatory disease should be ruled out. You may need to have the mirena taken out first.

Birth control pills do not lead to bleeding or spotting after the intercourse( post coital bleeding) . Local lesions in cervix or vagina including cervical cancer are the causes of post coital bleeding.

This would take care of possible discomfort.I would ask you to pass urine just before the procedure and place you in lithotomy position and insert IUD. There is no need for any local cervical anaesthesia. The prick of  the local anaesthesia would cause same discomfort as inserting IUD.

In addition, it reduces the risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer, ovarian cysts and fibrocystic breast disease. It also helps to regularize cycles and reduce the incidence of anemia, premenstrual tension and pain during periods.

My girlfriend has taken the Birth control pill Belara , and someone told us if we take 10 of those pills it will work as a Plan B pill or a Morning after pill ... do you think this would work ?and does she need to take those 10 pills again after 12 hours ?","Doctor":"Hi, I appreciate your concerns.Belara does not work as emergency contraception. Please purchase Plan B and use it at the earliest. Though it can be used for up to 120 hours  after unprotected sex it is used, the earlier it is used, more effective it is.Certain contraceptive pills can be used as emergency contraception. Eg; Seasonale, Trivora, Nordette, Lo/ovral ( take 4 pills within 120 hours of intercourse and take 4 more pills after 12 hours) , Lutera, Sronyx(take 5 pills within 120 hours of intercourse and take 5 more pills after 12 hours).. But I do not know whether these pills are available in your country.In order to avoid such unnecessary stress let your girl friend consult her doctor and start using regular contraception like birth control pills.I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hi.... ma boyfriend rubbed his penis on my vagina after he came over me... we did not have intercose....and also some fluid was discharged from his penis.. and i had completed mu periods 6 days before... after 3 days that is on  5th day i had an i pill is there any chance of me gettin pergnant?","Doctor":"Hi,The precum contains sperms. So even if there is no intercourse, if the precum fluid has entered the vagina, there is a possibility of pregnancy.I pill helps in avoiding pregnancy.The earlier after unprotected sex you take i pill more effective it is. If taken on the fifth day it is about 50% effective.

I'm suppose to get my period since i'm on my last white pill before my new pack... Do I still take my new pack as ususally? what will happen with my period?","Doctor":"Hi,Since you have missed the last two active pills, the pill free interval is more than 7 days. So there is a possibility of ovulation occurring and you will not be completely protected by the pills.As you are already on the last white pill ( inactive), start the new pack tomorrow.  In addition you should use an additional method of contraception like condom for the first seven days of the new pack, if you have intercourse.The other alternative will be not to have sex during the first 7 days of the new pack. In all probability you should be starting your periods in a day or two.I hope this helpsI hop"},{"Patient":"i was on birth control and at the end of july i started feeling like i was pregnant and my belly got bigger so i stop taking them well i had two period in sept and i missed last month and i have started yet i took home pegnancy test and it said no but i look like im pergnant and im sick to my belly and i done this with my last one can u help me","Doctor":"Hi,If the pregnancy tests are negative and and if you are getting periods there is no possibility of pregnancy.There are two reasons why your belly may be looking big.1. What is your age? May be you are putting on belly fat. In that case, you need to exercise well.2.Please get an ultrasound done.

If you are expecting some external evidence to suggest that the pill has been effective in avoiding a pregnancy, please understand that no such obvious effects are immediately seen; it is a silent process that works inside your body. Since you have taken the pill within the stipulated time interval, you are amply protected and as such, there is no need to consume another one. Also, please keep in mind that recurrent pill usage can harm your hormonal balance immensely. If you are in your safe period, you do not need the pill at all.

I am also overweight.","Doctor":"Hi,It is not normal to have high blood pressure at this age. What is your BMI? One reason for your high blood pressure could be you being overweight. You must reduce weight. This is important for your overall well being too.I advise you to first consult physician to find out the cause for high blood pressure and get it treated.You can have the Implanon inserted while being treated for high blood pressure.

Secondly my breast have become a bit bigger and they are a bit tender. is all this normal???","Doctor":"Birth control pills are not supposed to cause any irregularity in bleeding neither the heavy or prolonged bleeding. In fact they are supposed to regularise otherwise irregular periods. If with the pills you had continuous bleeding for the whole of the month, it means that either the pills were not taken regularly or they are not suiting you and you may have to switch to some other dosage combination, may be with higher dose of oestrogen in them.Heaviness and tenderness in breasts is known while on birth control pills. It is due to the water retention property of progesterone component. Soon you will be used to the size and the tenderness will not last long. If it is becoming too uncomfortable, you may try restriction on salt intake."},{"Patient":"Hello,I have been prescribed levest as a contraceptive pill. I have hear a lot of bad reviews about it. Many people complained about head aches mood swings and acne. I am a bit scared now to start taking it. What would you recomend? Is microgynon 30 better? Should I ask my doctor to change the prescription. How common are these side effects?","Doctor":"Hi,Levest and Microgynon 30 contain the same hormones. There is no difference between the two contraceptive pills. Both pills cause same kind of side effects like headache, mood swings etc. This does not mean that all ladies who use these pills get these side effects. Only some women may suffer these side effects. These side effects often disappear after the first few months of use.So you can safely start using levest. If you still feel worried, you can start using Microgynon 30. I repeat again that both pills contain same hormones. The only difference is that they are manufactured by different companies.I hope I have answered your concerns."},{"Patient":"hi i missed the first pill (microgynon) after my 7 day break.

So I took some pregnacy test and they all showed up negative. 2-3 days later I ve started to bleed again but brown and everyday its getting heavier and heavier Ans I need to take my new pack of pills. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello,The bleeding you are experiencing is due to the hormone imbalance created by the missed pills. If you have had any sexual intercourse later on in the cycle, you are not protected also. Home pregnancy tests, however, can only read well 3-7 days after the missed period. You should therefore get a blood test for pregnancy and follow it up with a clinical exam and a trans-vaginal sonogram. Once pregnancy is excluded, you can start your new pack of pills. You may also need styptics simultaneously to help arrest bleeding faster. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I took Plan-B One-Step briefly after the 72 hour period.

The condom was held in place inside the vagina after he pulled out. (He didn t hold the end of it when he pulled out). I noticed some ejaculate leaked out of the condom onto the bed (I didn t feel it on me) and I m not sure if he touched it before he proceeded to finger me and perform cunnilingus again.(The cunnilingus was unprotected.) The end of the condom was outside the vagina extending beyond the lips a little Should I be worried about taking the pill 78 hours after intercourse? My period is due by the end of this week or the middle of next week. (It alternates between the first week of the month & last week of the month). When could I expect to see my period?","Doctor":"Hi,Since there was leakage of ejaculate from the condom and as you had unprotected cunnilingus there is a possibility of pregnancy occurring.   The earlier after the event,  Plan B is taken, more effective it is. If taken after 72hours, it is about 50% effective.

Is the urine colour due to the fingering or postinor 2? And is it normal? Is it okay to take postinor 2 in this situation? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,You have done the right thing by taking Postinor as even the precum contains sperms.The Postinor drug itself does not cause change in the colour of the urine.The fingering might have caused small abrasion on the vaginal mucosa resulting in mild bleeding. This can explain the red colour of the urine you saw.If you have not had enough intake of water the urine becomes concentrated and it appears yellowish red.Both these are temporary causes. If the urine colour remains so on the third day also, despite drinking enough water, then you need to see your doctor.To avoid such unnecessary stress I advise you to consult your doctor and start regular contraception like hormonal contraception or have an intrauterine device fitted as they are more effective than Postinor in preventing pregnancy.

Moreover, if the unprotected intercourse happened during the safe period of her menstrual cycle, she is naturally protected.

It helps in avoiding implantation and thus the chance of pregnancy. It is 95% effective in avoiding pregnancy if taken within 24 hours of unprotected sex.

This falls to 85 percent as time advances. The chances of conception are very minimal in your case. Emergency pills cause hormone disturbances as they contain high hormone content.

I would like to start taking the pill again though as I have become sexually active again. Can I just start taking it or do I need to wait for a period? Many thanks","Doctor":"Hi,You have not had mensus for two months. Were you sexually active during these two months? If you were not sexually active then you can start taking Microgynon right now. But you need to use additional contraception like condom or diaphragm for the first seven days until Microgynon effect is established.  Since you did not have mensus for two months, the endometrial lining of uterus must have become thick. It may cause irregular bleeding/spotting once you start pills. So I advise you to first take progesterone to bring about Period bleeding and then start Microgynon.If you were sexually active during those two months, then it is extremely important to rule out pregnancy by blood pregnancy test. If negative, use progesterone for withdrawal bleeding and then start Microgynon from the first or second day of mensus.I hope I have answered to your satisfaction."},{"Patient":"I just started my period today.

I pill or the emergency contraceptive pill has its action in preventing only that pregnancy which can occur by the last intercourse episode.

This irregular spotting could be due to hormone imbalance. Such things often happen while on the pill, but, usually in the initial months. Please get a proper clinical evaluation and if necessary, a blood test for pregnancy and complete hormone profile. A trans-vaginal sonogram can help to exclude ovarian causes. Local lesions like vaginitis, erosions, polyps and sudden weight changes along with stress also can cause such spotting.

Hormonal contraceptive pills which contain, levonorgestrel alone or in combination with ethinyl estradiol can be used as emergency contraception.So there is a possibility that you may get pregnant from that intercourse.Since you started contraceptive pills in the in the second week of the cycle, they become effective as contraception after 7 days. You can have sex with your boyfriend while taking pills, after seven days of using pills. But I advise you to defer it until next period.

If you had sex during this time then there is no possibility of pregnancy.  If you have had sex on any other day then you need to take I PILL if you wish to avoid pregnancy. I PILL is most effective when taken within 24 hours of intercourse. If I pill is taken in the second half of menstrual cycle it can delay the period. If period is delayed by more than a week then you need to do pregnancy test as there is a possibility of method failure ( I PILL is not 100% effective).I have an advise for you.

It induces pre-menstrual syndrome-like effects. Usually, you should get a withdrawal during the seven-day window. If you suspect pregnancy, I would ask you to get an estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres to exclude/confirm pregnancy. Once this is ruled out, you may continue with the medication as prescribed. The medication is meant to induce a state of hormone balance that mimics the natural process and does not induce ovulation. Hence, if you have an ovulation defect, that needs to be corrected before you can conceive. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, M 27 years old unmarried gal.

Diane contains ingredients similar in action to  hormonal birth control pill. Cyproterone acetate contained in it is a progesterone derivative and ethinylestradiol  present in it is a synthetic estrogen. So this tablet is also a effective combined hormonal contraceptive. It is as effective as any  other combined hormonal pill.  Therefore if you have been using this pill correctly as per the instructions there is no need to use emergency contraception.However there is a very small possibility of method failure as in birth control pill. So if your periods get delayed  get a pregnancy test done. I advise you to use barrier method of contraception like condom along with Diane to protect yourself from sexually transmitted diseases.I hope I have answered to your satisfaction.

My girlfriend and I had sex december 13. but the condom broke and i wasn t aware when I came inside of her. she usually takes birth control pills. one month ago, she stopped taking the rest of her pack, because she missed a few already. 2 weeks ago, she started taking her regular birth control pills again. We had sex 18 days after her first menstrual day (she was already 18 pills into her current pack). Since this is the first time that this happened, we bought nordette, and she took it an hour after our little accident . So, in conclusion, she took nordette on top of her regular medicine.

So even though your boyfriend did not ejaculate in you there is a possibility of pregnancy if you have had sex on days other than safe period. Therefore you need to  take emergency contraception.

There are specific emergency contraceptive pills available like Plan B, I Pill, next choice etc. If these are not available in your country, your doctor will advise based on the contraceptive pills available. It is important to take the pills at the earliest after unprotected sex . The earlier the pill is taken, more effective they are ( 95% effective if taken within 24 hours). After taking the emergency contraception, if your period is delayed by more than a week you must get a pregnancy test done.It is good that you have realized it is dumb not to use contraception.

Please note that with  this method your mensus will be delayed until you complete active pills in the pack.Starting contraceptive pills on the first day of cycle is another choice of starting the pill.

Sex done during that period does not cause pregnancy.Condom is a reasonably safe contraceptive method. It has a typical failure rate of 18% ( of 100 partners using this method  18 women get pregnant in one year). Since you say that your period was very light do a pregnancy test first. That will make things clear.

Since you have taken the medication after one week, this is not going to help prevent pregnancy. The only way left is to wait for the next natural menstrual period, which may get delayed by a week or two in view of the pill intake, and then see a specialist for further help if no period is seen even after ten days after it is due.

Since you have PCOD I am answering your concern pesuming you have irregular cycles.With irregular cycles it is difficult to predict the timing of ovulation and hence fertility period.

It is more effective than emergency contraceptive pills and has the advantage that it can be continued as contraceptive method If you wish to avoid pregnancy I advise you to discuss with your doctor and  use regular contraception like intrauterine devise or hormonal contraception.

Mood swings are usually due to the hormonal surges prior to the onset of menstruation. Blood in stool can be due to local causes if it is fresh. These include mostly fissures and hemorrhoids. Bleeding higher up alters the color of the blood to black or greenish black. Passage of hard stool can erode the mucosa and can lead to bleeding. Infections also can lead to fresh bleeding associated with diarrhea.

Therefore it has no long term ill effects. Therefore the need to undo the ill effects does not arise.If frequently used it may cause temporary irregularity in menstrual cycles.If you wish to avoid pregnancy I  advise your girl friend  to consult her family physician and start using  hormonal contraception or have the intrauterine devise fitted. These methods are more effective than emergency contraception in preventing pregnancy.As regards your girl friend regaining the body shape, I advise her to watch her diet or consult dietician.

Yet, it is imperative that you should have a physician visit to look for other possible sources. Constipation can be relieved by increasing the intake of fiber in the diet added by lactulose to facilitate easy passage. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, I nees some information about antibiotics (Penicillin) and the Progestogen-only pill Cerazette. Im taking Penicillin since Monday 3 pills per day. Cerazette i take each day at the same time! Yesterday i had unprotected sex with my boyfried, should i be worried?","Doctor":"Hi You did not write why you are taking penicillin.It is good to know that you are taking cerazette regularly at the same time. Taken in this perfect way cerazette is very effective i.e.> 99% in preventing pregnancy. But it does not protect you against sexually transmitted diseases.So having unprotected sex is a cause for worry.If you see excessive vaginal discharge/ vaginal itching/ ulcers or rashes on the vagina see a  genitourinary specialist/family physician. Henceforth make sure that you practice safe sex by using condoms.I hope I have answered to your satisfaction.

To confirm the cause, you need to have a proper clinical evaluation and also get investigated. If it is deemed that the pill is causing the effect, it should be changed and a suitable alternative should be supplemented. Micro-pills are often helpful in such situations. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, my name s Allie. I m 16 year old and recently went to the doctors to recieve birth control . The pills prescribed to me are called Generess Fe, and the doctor gave me those because since I m petite (only 95 pounds) she thought a higher dosage would cause me nausea & Bad side effects. Since I ve started the pill about 5 days ago, it s giving me bad nausea, even though I take it before bed. When I waleup I can t even move or I feel like I ll throw up. Will this side effect end? And if so, how long will it take to go away? I really hate being sick & there s no signs of my nausea going away:(","Doctor":"Hello Allie, I am Kathy - a nutritionist- and I may be able to help you with thisNausea is a common side-effect with iron supplements. There are other iron supplements that are gentler on the stomach and you may want to discuss this with your doctor. I am assuming you are on iron because your iron is low. You can increase your iron naturally by eating high iron foods such as raisens, spinach, molasses and, if you eat meat, red meat is high in iron. Eating a source of high vitamin C along with your iron will increase the amount of iron you absorb, so fruit, vegetables are naturally high in C as is vitamin C enriched juices. Iron should always be taken with food. From what it sounds like, you are not eating with it. Try taking it in the am with food (but not dairy or high fiber foods) and include a source of vitamin c with your iron supplement. Food does decrease absorption, but if the iron is making you nauseous, eat and/or ask to be switched to a gentler form of iron. In summary, take iron in am with food low in fiber and a source of vitamin c. Check with your doctor about these problems and see if there is a gentler form of iron you can take. Increase your iron in your blood naturally by including high iron foods. High iron foods should be combined with a source of vitamin C. Have a Great Day!"},{"Patient":"Hello, I'm a 24-yr-old female, 5'10\\", 170 lbs. I had an IUD incerted 2 yrs ago and recently I've been having discomfort/pain after sex and also experienced rectal pain. This morning it was really strong, but when I had a bowel movement it kind of went away....any advice? thanks in advance...","Doctor":"HIWell come to HCMYes such discomfort may be due to IUD, and this need to be ruled out, some times this may happened due to infection around the IUD, it is already couple of years gone now better to get the thing out, it is most advisable, hope this information helps, take care."},{"Patient":"have been changed from Microgynon 30 to Loestrin 20, i was given the new pill during my 7day break and i was told that i could carry on taking my new pill after 7 days as normal ... Will I be protected against pregnancy straight away? On the leaflet it said I should have carried on taking my new pill without a break but doesn't say whether I need a second contraceptive if i did not do this ... any information would be great full","Doctor":"Hi,The instruction is meant for the continuation of the medication while you are on it after each cycle. Since you have started afresh, your doctor may have suggested the standard method. Either way, during the first couple of cycles of the pill, you would need additional protection as ovulation is not effectively inhibited sometimes. You can rely on the oral contraceptive pill alone later on, but please make sure you take the pill regularly at the same time everyday. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello I took the morning after pill last month and had my period (it was early) and I took it again this month. Will it still work? I actually didn't have sex on both ocassions but his penis (and cum) was in contact with my vagina although he didn't enter me.","Doctor":"HiYes the morning after pill works whenever taken. It does work when taken in consecutive months.Even the cum contains sperms. Therefore  you have done the right thing by taking morning after pill to avoid pregnancy.If you have regular cycles of 26-30days then the first week  and the last ten days of your cycle are safe period. Having sex during those days does not make you pregnant. I wrote this as i felt this information is useful for you.I have a advise for you. If you wish to avoid pregnancy it is better for you to discuss with your doctor and use birth control pills or have copper intrauterine devise fitted. They are more effective than morning after pill in preventing pregnancy.The morning after pill if used within 24 hours of unprotected sex is 95% effective. Since there is a small chance of failure of the method, if your period is delayed for more than a week consult your doctor.I hope I have answered to your satisfaction."},{"Patient":"Hi i have problem of menstrual migraines.

I am upset what to do. please guide me. im 4days ahead of my scheduled period date.","Doctor":"HiPanadol does not interfere with menstrual cycles.

I just had unprotected intercourse. and right after the intercourse I 4 take abets of althea contraceptive and plan to take another 4 tomorrow. I'm fertile and I'm scared. What are the chances of geting pregnant? Will i still need to take emergency contraceptive?","Doctor":"Hi,If you are not using any other hormone contraception and have regular cycles, chances of conception are high after an unprotected intercourse during the fertile period. The efficacy of althea as an emergency contraceptive is not well documented. Since you have taken heavy doses of the medication, taking another dose of an emergency pill, which in itself contains high dose of hormone, may totally derange your hormone milieu. Please wait for your next natural period and get help if you miss it by more than a week. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I have been on Loestrin 24 for about four years now.

Or is juicing up a little bit simply a bad idea?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Taking hormone supplementation may be not good for your health . You may take testosterone booster foods like Tuna, egg yolk, fortified cereals, oysters, shellfish,beef,beans etc. Yes, testosterone supplement injections is available but please check once about your serum testosterone before taking.Please consult your fitness trainer he will examine and treat you accordingly.

I feel my stomach has got bigger no weight gain really. I m more emotional than usual, sometimes cry for no reason. I ve had mild headache for over 6 days, and get hot flushes. sometimes i feel sick but dont vomit . I feel overly hungry at times, like stomach cramps??? I ve never really had a problem with the injection , but i really don t feel right, not myself?? could it be the injection or something else??","Doctor":"Hi,If you are due for the injection in few days, it is likely that you could be having withdrawal symptoms, more so if you have gained any additional weight after the treatment. Also, protection may dwindle especially toward the end of the course, when there is weight gain because the body requirement of the hormone rises with weight and contraception is no longer effective. So, as your symptoms suggest, you should also exclude/confirm pregnancy through assessment of the serum beta-hCG titres. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"doctor i m married since 5 yrs i have a son.i had taken i pill twicein 2 yrs 1 in each yr because i didn't want second child now.also i had an abortion 3 yrs back and last month also i took i pill.i want second child aft 2 yrs what should i do.i can't consume i pill everytime","Doctor":"HiIf you wish to plan for second baby after two years as you have rightly said you should not use ipill for the same.There is a wide range of effective contraceptive methods available to avoid pregnancy.You have hormonal contraception containing  both estrogen and progesterone   in the form of pills, injections, patches and rings. There is hormonal contraception containing progesterone only in the form of pills, injections, implants and intrauterine devise.Then there is copper intrauterine devise.All these methods are more than 99% effective when used correctly.Male and female condoms are also available.

She gave me Lutera tablets 28 s ( Levonorgestrel 0.1 mg and Ethinyl Estradiol 0.02 mg). My concern is that she told me to take two, but when I research online about the drug everything says take 5 and 5 more 12 hours later. I don t normally take birth control and she knows this because I seem to be sensitive to even low dose pills and react adversely. I don t get sick, but I have severe personality and mood changes. Even taking the two pills has made me feel like a very different person, but I can deal with it because it s temporary. Do you think this is why she told me to only take two? Will it be effective? I don t want to take 5 and OD myself because I am afraid of the reaction I will have, but if it is safe physically I would rather do that than get pregnant.","Doctor":"Hello,The efficacy of the medication as emergency contraception has not been proven often and hence you have to keep fingers crossed. Perhaps because of the unwanted side effects you have toward high doses of hormone, your doctor may not have prescribed the standard emergency contraception since it contains very high doses of hormone. Another non-hormonal way of emergency contraception is to get an IUD inserted and this serves the dual purpose of long term contraception as well. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I started taking althea even I haven't have my menstruation yet. Because I read in the paper inside the box of althea pills that its ok to take during the menstruation or any other time. I haven't finish all the tablet so I don't have may menstruation for almost 1month more.  Am i safe?I'm worried about it.","Doctor":"Hi,Althea pills are usually taken starting from day one of the menstrual cycle, but they can also be taken at any time, the only precaution being that pregnancy has been excluded before taking them in such a manner and follow up with condoms is done for first seven days. In the current scenario, you should go for n estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres, if you do not see a period within the seven days of pill break. A trans-vaginal sonogram and a clinical evaluation by an expert are also needed. Take care."},{"Patient":"I'm 22 years and married for an year. We have planned to have a baby for past 4 months and suddenly my periods are irrugular. When I took a blood test, my TSH level was 4.5. But my doctor gave me femilon to regularise it. Is it safe to start the dose?","Doctor":"Hello,If your TSH levels are on the higher side, it is also ideal to go for the estimation of free T3 and free T4 levels. You may need to start low doses of hormone thyroxine as subclinical hypothyroidism may manifest in this way. Femilon can be used once other hormone imbalances are corrected to keep the cycles back on track. This medication inhibits ovulation and hence, after a few cycles of pill usage, you may stop once periods get regular and wait for a couple of cycles for ovulation to resume. Meanwhile, maintain a healthy weight, balanced diet and regular exercise.

This is because you were no longer protected in this cycle. Please go ahead with home pregnancy test with a fresh early morning sample of urine 3-7 days after the missed period. If positive, you can go for a trans-vaginal sonogram to see the status of the pregnancy. If you wish for an earlier and better confirmation/exclusion, please go for the estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi I'm 27 and I have never had a child.

The cause of the current scanty menstruation is perhaps due to the pill and also common for some time after an abortion due to the hormone disturbances that ensue thereafter.

You can take it with food to lessen the side effects. Diane 35 is usually started on day one initially, yet, you may start it now.

If so, how long after you finishing using Macrobid do you continue needing a back-up method?","Doctor":"Hi dear and thanks for your query.In the past, women using hormonal contraception such as the pill or patch would be advised to use an extra method of contraception (eg condoms) while taking an antibiotic like this one and for seven days after finishing the course. However, this advice has now changed. You no longer need to use an extra method of contraception with the pill, patch or vaginal ring while you take a course of antibiotics.

If the intercourse you had falls within first 7 days  or last ten days of your period cycle then there is no need to worry ( as it is safe period).There is no need to use lutera as emergency contraception. If you are using Lutera regularly Odwalla drink should not be of concern.If you have not used  lutera regularly then you can  use lutera as emergency contraception.

Firstly make sure a urine culture has been done and the antibiotic you are taking is the right one. Secondly intercourse increases chances of having a urine infection so you are having recurrent infections using a condom would be a good idea.

What I am writing below holds good if your periods are regular.In a menstrual cycle there are several days at the beginning that are infertile. In the middle is the fertile period. Several days before the start of next period are infertile. If you have a regular 26 to 32 days cycle then day 1to7 (day 1 is first day of the bleeding) and day 21 to beginning of the next period are safe days. You wouldn't get pregnant if you had sex during this period. The middle two weeks i.e. day 8 to 20 are unsafe. You can get pregnant if you have sex during this period. During this period either you or your husband can use condoms to avoid pregnancy.

It is quite unclear as to what your doctors told you about your ovaries. Is your menstrual cycle irregular? Have they told you that you have POlycystic ovvaries? If yes then birth control pills are infact the right choice of medicines to get your period regularly. Birth control pills are low doses of hormones which will allow your periods to come every month at a regular interval (during the pill free period). There is no evidence that these pills damage the reproductive system. There maybe some side effects with these medicines like headaches, nausea vomiting, breast tenderness but these are mild and fade away in few days to weeks.However these pills are not going to cure your underlying problem. So do discuss with your treating doctor about the cause for your irregular periods and ovary being small. I am sure your doctor will explain after seeing the reports if any.Hope this helps.Take care."},{"Patient":"I am 53.  I have a Merina IUD that was inserted a year ago to stop my heavy periods.

Mirena contains hormone and hence helps to control the duration and amount of bleeding. It does thin the endometrium. In the current scenario, you need further monitoring to see if the Mirena is really working or not.

You should take them throughout the month in a regular pattern, else, your menstrual cycles tend to get disturbed due to irregular hormone pattern similar to what has happened now.

Now I have read your post (and others) that say to take 4 each interval. So I took 2 pills at 9:00pm then waited 2 hours and took 2 more. Any advice on how I should time it? Do you still think the emergency contraception will be effective?","Doctor":"Hello there,Thank you for the question.Marvelon are regular contraceptive pills and not the typical emergency contraceptive pill. For them to work as an emergency contraceptive pill it has to be taken in a high dose at a 12 hour interval. The recommended dose is 4 pills immediately after having unprotected intercourse and 4 pills after 12 hours of the first dose. This method is also proven to be quite effective in preventing an unwanted pregnancy. So you did the right thing by taking 4 pills but it should have been together and not 2 hours apart. Take the next dose correctly after 12 hours of the last dose. However if you miss your period by 2-3 days please confirm with a urine pregnancy test that you are not pregnant and take action accordingly. Emergency contraceptive methods should not be used regularly and should be the last resort. Use condoms as they also protect you from sexually transmitted diseases.Hope this helps.Take care."},{"Patient":"I missed 5 days in a row in the first week of falmina.

If you miss more than 2 doses of these pills in a month then their efficiency goes down considerably. Now that you have missed 5 doses of the pill that too in the first week they are completely inefficient and there is a good chance that you could get pregnant from the intercourse during that period. Although in the first week after a period it is the safe period and so it is less likely but the chance cannot be denied. So if you miss your period by 2-3 days then please get a urine pregnancy test to confirm that you are not pregnant. Try not to miss more than 2 doses in a month and if you do always use alternative forms of contraception. If you miss a dose take it immediately when you remember or take it next day with that day's pill. Hope this helps.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi...i am 31yrs .I have a 4month baby..still i didnot get my period..i am breastfeeding .recently had sex with my husband 2times in a month..I do not want to get pregnant..I took test yest got negative..can u plz suggest any medicine for not to get pregnancy..priya","Doctor":"Hello Priya,Thank you for the question.Its very right on your part to consider contraception now that you have resumed sexual activity. Breast feeding is a good contraceptive in itself but not foolproof. So its better if you use some other forms of contraception even while you are breast feeding. Preferably use a condom each time. If you dont want to use a condom then you can take a progesterone only pill (PoP) or you can get an intrauterine device (IUD) or even a progesterone depot injected. In all these cases there is small chance of baby receiving some progesterone except in condoms and IUDs but that has no effect on the baby. These are all prescription drugs and it will be better you visit your gynaecologist who can prescribe the method you choose.Till then the safest method is using a condom.Hope this helps.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi I am on cerazette and realised I had forgotten to take one pill and had intercourse the same night.didnt realise I had forgotten to take it until the following day.so I took the missed one and the pill from the day before together.would this protect me","Doctor":"Hello there,I can understand your concern. Yes what you did is the right thing to do. It is normal sometimes to miss an occasional dose and the right thing to do is to take the dose immediately when you remember. You can take 2 doses on the next day. This will protect you and not lose effectiveness. However do not miss more than 2 doses in a month. Then the effectiveness goes down considerably and you should use a condom while having intercourse to avoid unwanted pregnancy. Try and be careful next time and use the ones with days of the week marked so that you can be sure about when you missed if at all.Hope this helps.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have been on birth control for several months but last month there was a miscommunication between my doctor and my pharmacy and it took a month for me to get my new pack.

Thanks, Caitrin","Doctor":"Hello Caitrin,I can understand your concern. The correct way to start your new pack would be to wait for your next period and begin on the 5th day of your period. But till then you have to use other form of contraception like condoms if you indulge in intercourse.Starting it now will mess up your hormones.

Depression can either be a consequence or a cause of these symptoms and has to be assessed by an experienced psychologist and help given.

This has occurred because of the missed pills.  This is of concern because the pill is not as effective as a form of birth control under these circumstances.  For this reason, I would recommend the following:1.  Check a pregnancy test now and again in 1-2 weeks2.  Keep taking the pills exactly as they are dispensed in the pack3.  Expect that in addition to the early bleeding, you will also get your regular period (though it might be lighter)4.  Start the next pack as per your normal routine5.

It cannot do anything if implantation also has occurred. In your case, since she took the pill within the stipulated time, protection should have been high.

You should definitely take the help of your consultant and see if any other additional supplements are needed or if you can change the medication.

If you have never missed the any of the pills, pregnancy is very unlikely. In the current scenario, you should see a specialist for a complete clinical assessment and get a trans-vaginal sonogram along with a blood test for pregnancy.

That occurs with the menstrual cycle, and if she has menstrual pain and menstrual bleeding, then, that is about expected. Pain without the cycle... something else is going on and needs to be looked at (although serious problems are uncommon they are not rare; mostly they would be coincidental, like an infection or a stomach flu or a UTI.. if also pain on urination then that's the situation).Which brings up the vaginal discharge. Some discharge after intercourse is 100% and this is the type you would get. Doesn't have to be abnormal BUT the pain implies a potential (treatable) infection. Pain and discharge goes away, could be an STD.. unlikely. Pain and discharge stays... big problem. Pain turns into a normal period.. oh... not so much a problem."},{"Patient":"Three weeks ago I went to my OB to remove my IUD. After checking through ultrasound it was embedded in the uterine wall. My Ob arranged to have a tysterography two weeks later it was no longer there. Again another ultrasound it is now in my lower stomach ...\\" Aim in a lot of pain like a really period and the need to pee all the time.  My OB arranged to have surgery remove the IUD in three weeks.  My question is can this cause any other problems and should I see another Dr for a second opinion Thank You","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for writing..This is a very rare situation were the IUD has perforated through the uterine wall into the lower stomach.. if you have any doubt get a repeat scan or xray abdomen  to see the position of the IUD.. Only option if it is in the lower abdomen is laproscopic removal of the IUD at the earliest.. This can cause infection if left in the abdomen.. You need to take a course of antibiotics after the surgery..Hope I have answered your query.. Good day"},{"Patient":"I have had the Mirena for nearly 4 years now. I do not have periods. However, if I am very stressed out, I get horrible cramps and spot for a day or two. My concern, more, is that I have a clear, mucus , sticky discharge from my vagina . Comes out all times of day and night (I ve began to wear pantiliners because of this) and more recently, when I am using the toilet, quite a lot comes out. I ve read that mostly, this would occur during ovulation . But I am concerned/curious as to what is causing this and if I should be worried. There is no pain or itching, aside from occassional cramps that I have considered normal since I had the Mirena placed.","Doctor":"Hi,It is common for some amount of white discharge to be seen throughout a menstrual cycle and the consistency and the amount varies depending on the hormone status. The presence of an IUD is perhaps leading to the excessive discharge owing to some irritation. Yet, since the discharge is seen increasing of late, I would ask you to get a clinical evaluation by a specialist to exclude vaginitis, erosions and/or polyps and if deemed necessary, replace the IUD. A trans-vaginal sonogram is also needed to see the condition of the pelvic organs; pelvic inflammation also should be excluded. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"yes i wanted to know if i have been on the depo brith control shot for a month and my boyfirend cumed inside me just a lil do i have a change of being pergant and should i take a peragancey test? ok so saturday me and my boyfriend deside to have sexual intercourse and i was on top of him he said babe can i cum inside you sence you have been on the shot for a month and said i dont know so as we where in the prosses of having sex he said im about to cum so i let him cum just a bit inside me thanking it wouldnt do anyting and the rest he cumed out of me, my question is knowing that im on depo and not letting him cum so much do i have a chance of being pergant or am i just being to worried about it","Doctor":"Hello,Depot shot is very much effective in preventing unwanted pregnancy and to be taken once in 3 months. It has failure rate less than 0.3 per HWY. Though it takes some times for fully effective, it is advisable to take some back up method like condoms etc for initial 1-2 months.Some amount cum or ejaculation can make you pregnant if it occurs around fertile days or in case of failure of depot shot. You need to wait for next period to be sure.If your next period delays more than 7 days from expected date, then you need to undergo home pregnancy test or blood test for beta-HCG to rule out pregnancy. Following test report, you can consult with your gynecologist.Good luck."},{"Patient":"I had prostate cancer and a prostatectomy in January 2014.

Recurrence may happen after prostatectomy in case of prostate cancer. Serial PSA assessment is required if we see a rising trend in PSA level, we have to suspect a recurrence.

Had you missed a pill and made up after a day, two pills should be taken in the next dose or additional protection sought. In the current scenario, you can exclude/confirm pregnancy through estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres along with a clinical evaluation before you start on your next pack of pills. if negative, you can go for the next pack even if you do not see a period.

While a thick discharge is seen during the estrogen phase, in the progesterone phase it is thin and elastic. The discharge you have is perhaps related to the return of the ovulatory cycles subsequent to stoppage of the pills.

Yet, if she is in the fertile or ovulation period, you can ask her to take an emergency pill or go for the insertion of an IUD, which can serve both as emergency as well as long-term measure. If none of these can be done, you should either get a blood test for pregnancy at least ten days after the intercourse or wait for her next normal period and go for further help if she misses it. Please remember that period may get delayed when emergency pill is taken. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi there My name is kim i just recently had a baby four months ago and i am on noriday conreception pill and haven t had a period for 3 months now i took a pregnancy test and it came back as negitive. I m still waiting for my period. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hi,Arrest of bleeding can sometimes occur as a side effect of the pills, but, since you have not seen even one period since you started taking the medication, you should see a specialist for a proper appraisal of the situation. You may need a trans-vaginal sonogram and an estimation of the serum beta-hCG titres to exclude/confirm pregnancy and other pelvic causes for the absence of periods. If you have started the medication within 21 days after delivery, you are safe; else, additional contraception is needed in the initial two days. This is because, though ovulation is inhibited in some, it is not necessary in all. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"i had sex with my bf on 26thdec unknowingly condom got ruptured and he ejected into me... on the last day of my periods that is 25dec wen it was almost ended... when we came to know about it in another 15 mins i ate unwanted 72 pill... my cycle is of 28 days and today 32nd day i did n't had my periods.... and i did pregnancy test yesterday...bt it is showing negative wat is the solution for my problem....wat should i do to have my periods soon....","Doctor":"Dear madam i got your concernthe intercourse was done in last seven days before period so its a safe timeand within 72 hrs you took the pill so you are in safest zonebut with this hormonal pills especially if taken in second half of cycle it might delay your periods little bitrelax and there is nothing to panicregardsDr sreegynecologist"},{"Patient":"Hi, I had a sex just before 5 hours.

Off and on I've had problems with severe pains that seem to be from gas but I can feel it in my cervix. This month during my period I had severe pains and cramping just like when they put it in. When I checked it I could feel a bump but my strings were still in place. Went to my local clinic that I had it inserted at and they looked for about thirty seconds said, oh your strings are there so you're fine, and dismissed me.

I'm really afraid the pain means it's perforating something...","Doctor":"Hello,You are right to become concerned about the position of the intra-uterine device. In the current scenario, the accurate position of the device can be known through a trans-vaginal sonogram and/or an MRI of the pelvis. If the device has been confirmed to be in-situ, then the cause of the pain should be identified and the possibilities are some pelvic infection and endometriosis. Though you may get relief through use of antispasmodics, since you say the pain is sever, you should get investigated further. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hi, my boyfriend and I had sex last night and the condom slipped inside me. I took it out and we got Plan B.

Other reasons may be that the bleeding is unrelated to the pills and may be due to other causes like cervical polyps, uterine fibroids or ovarian cysts.So try changing your pills and take combined estrogen and progesterone pills of another brand if possible.

You are lucky not to have gross hormone imbalances; these pills are known to cause severe hormone disturbances in many users leading to fertility problems in future. So long as you continue to have regular ovulatory cycles, you need not worry about the reduced flow. Slight variations often do happen with increasing age.

Yet, you should get a confirmatory conclusion through an assay of the serum beta-hCG titres and a trans-vaginal sonogram.

Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hi,Though it is common during the initial months of any birth control pill for menstrual irregularities to happen, I would ask you to see a specialist since you have had persistent bleeding for the past fortnight. Most often, such bleeding is a consequence of the altered hormonal milieu induced by the pill intake. Coagulation profiles and blood work is necessary to exclude any vascular factors secondary to the pill. You may need styptics and additional hormones to control the bleeding.

Yet, in the current scenario, you should also rule out any infection of the gastro-intestinal system. Please see a physician for further appraisal of the situation and appropriate management.

Just last month, I decided to stop taking pill. After finishing my last pack, I did not take the pill anymore. After a week of not taking the pill, I had my period again until now which is 10 days already...Most of the time, the blood is brown in color. Is it normal? Please advise. Thanks","Doctor":"Hello,Owing to the hormonal imbalance created by the withdrawal of the pill usage and the subsequent recoil by the natural system until a fresh hormonal balance is struck again, breakthrough bleeds are often seen. This is not to be worried about unless you are sexually active. Return of natural ovulation occurs during the first couple of months. You should pay a visit to the gynecologist to check for hormonal status and also exclude other causes if the spotting persists. Maintain a healthy weight and a healthy diet.

You are perhaps having some vaginitis which needs to be treated, your partner also may need treatment. Since the bleeding is decreasing in intensity, you may wait for it to subside on its own.

If more than one pill is missed, just keep taking them but use another method for the next 7 days.As you have already used these pills then now it cannot be undone.

The clarithromycin is generally cleared from the system in 36-48 hours. So it is better to begin the pills 2 days after stopping the drug. In that case you will be starting them on an odd day and not the first day of the period. So they will start providing protection 7 days after the first pill.

Most women have some bleeding issues after taking depo shots. But some of them do not have any problems and some continue to have absent periods. I your case however you have a history of unprotected sex before the shot. So if there was a pregnancy in place before the shot then the shot will not prevent it as it is already there.

It is meant for emergency use in cases where regular contraception is not possible like unexpected sexual episodes. Using it regularly is not recommended at all as we do not know if it will provide protection if used more than once in one cycle. The symptoms that you are getting now are due to the pills. They cause an inflammation of the stomach [ gastritis] causing pain and nausea. They may also cause liver dysfunction in high doses. So as of now, pease take an enti vomiting tablet like ondensetrone to help decrease the nausea. An hour later take antaacid like omeprazole 20 mg. With this the nausea and stomach pain must decrease. Please eat a simple diet like clear soup [ not sour] without any spices, or rice gruel until the pain subsides. If the symptoms decrease, continue to take omeprazole once daily for 5 days.

I'm very worried as I was not trying for a baby and have been drinking wine and have not been taking any folic acid. if it is the case i am will the baby be effected by this and will they remove the coil.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for posting your concern in the HCM.Most commonly the Mirena string becomes invisible when it has hot displaced from its site of lodgement. Your doctor has correctly advised you to have a scan to find the exact location of the Mirena coil. And it should be considered as an emergency. So, scan should be done as early as possible.If it has got displaced or by any chance removed, there is chance that you may pregnant. In that case chance of ectopic pregnancy is higher. An ultrasound scan can rule out that possibility. In case you become pregnant and the fetus remains in the usual normal position, consumption of alcohol and no folic acid intake definitely poses risk of development of neural tube defect (NTD). Hence, if there is normal uterine pregnancy, and you want to continue with that, immediate commencement of Folic acid would be needed and Anomaly scan should be done as per schedule.But, above all, the first thing you need is to locate the missed coil and hence please have the scan done at the earliest.In case you have any new query in future, you can directly ask me questions @  Regards,Dr. Kaushik"},{"Patient":"Im on implanon , have been since febuary.

You should get a blood test done to exclude/confirm pregnancy as urine test cannot be relied up on under these circumstances. Once clarified, further management can be accordingly planned.

Yet, you should get a proper evaluation first to see the exact cause of the bleeding. If the depo shot is the culprit, you may stop using it and switch to another form of contraception. Coagulation profiles, hepatic function assessment and urinalysis also may be needed. A hormone profile and a pelvic/trans-vaginal sonogram aid in the diagnosis. Hope your query has been clarified.

I am 27 years old and am looking forward to conceive in 3-4 years from now.","Doctor":"Hi,Emergency pills contain excess hormone enough to disturb the normal hormonal milieu. This creates menstrual irregularities like withdrawal bleed, delayed cycles and inter-menstrual spotting. Since you have taken many pills in one cycle, your cycles have gone wayward. You need a proper evaluation by an expert, get a complete hormonal profile and a trans-vaginal sonogram to exclude local causes like ovarian cysts and get proper hormonal course to attain regular cycles. Please do not use these pills at random. They are meant to be used for the real emergencies only once or twice in a year.

Although I threw up more than a few hours after taking the pill I am worried about the pills effectiveness because while having intercourse last night the condom broke. I am reluctant to take an emergency contraceptive but was wondering if one would be necessary.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for posting your concern in the HCM. My understanding is if you have vomited out your pill within 2 hours of intake, you should have taken another at that time. If it is more than 2 hrs, that need not be done. However, as you are on regular birth control pills and the condom ruptured, I need to know what day of your cycle it was (the first day of your current menstrual cycle should be considered as day1).I also need to know whether you have regular cycles and what the duration is for a cycle.If you are in the unsafe period, or you have irregular cycles and you had vomited out the pill within 2 hours of intake you need to opt emergency contraception. More so, because, women on contraceptive pills are more prone to have ectopic pregnancy, if they at all become pregnant and that ectopic pregnancy is an emergency and can be fatal as well.Hope you are satisfied with my answer.

It is working wonderfully for me. However, I am seriously considering getting a copper IUD implanted, and continuing my BCP alongside this. My main concern is the periods - I have heard that they can become VERY heavy on the copper IUD. I already have anaemia , and so far my periods are very manageable. But I was wondering how manageable would they be if I were to continue taking my current BCP as well as having an IUD? Also, what are the chances of an ectopic pregnancy with an IUD? If my periods became heavy, would a combination of mefenamic acid whilst I m on the week s break from my pill help lessen them? What are the chances of pregnancy with the IUD and BCP? It seems to be the best form of long term contraception that is not hormonal (previously I HAVE been on depo and microgynon together for three months, but I found the depo to have had too many adverse side effects for me). Thanks in advance! Edit - I am now considering the Mirena instead, but I wanted to know whether any nulliparous woman can actually get it or not... the WHO guidelines and several studies etc said they can, but I know some doctors are iffy to do so.. Why is this?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome,I understand your issue.However there is no need to use two types of birth control measures together. If an IUD is in place then BCP are not needed. If heavy bleeding is a cause of concern then other options like mefenamic acid can be used. Also heavy bleeding does not occur in every patient and many women tend to get used to the IUD after a few cycles and the bleeding returns to normal. One needs to try it first to actually know if it suits you or not. So there is no need to take BCP. If you are using BCP regularly then IUD is not needed. So choose any one method as both are equally effective if used correctly and regularly. The advantage of IUD is that there is no need to remember and take any medication daily. Once it is inserted no other BCP measure is needed. About the risk of ectopic. The IUD does increase the risk of ectopic marginally. However as it decreases the risk of getting pregnant, the risk of having an ectopic pregnancy is actually lower than the risk in a woman not using the IUD. Women not using IUD are more likely to get pregnant and so as the number of pregnancies is more the risk of ectopic pregnancies is also more. So the risk is actually lower than the general population. About Mirena, it has hormones in it so it either causes irregular periods or missed periods in some women. The return to fertility after removing it is also good and most women are fertile in the first cycle after removal. Many doctor believe that it is not a good way to have intrauterine devices in place before testing fertility by having atleast one pregnancy. The risk of infections is slighlty higher with devices and so doctors are a bit reluctant to prescribe them in nulliparous women. Hope this satisfies your query.

I have one week left of cycle 2 on yasmine until I take my sugar pills. This morning I started clotting agian and having cramps and have very dark brown blood discharge . Is this from Mirena?","Doctor":"Hi,Mirena cannot be the cause of your current symptoms. Though, withdrawal effects are seen after removal, the fact that you were put on hormones immediately rules out this cause. As menstrual disturbances like inter-menstrual spotting, heavy bleeding and irregular bleeding are a common side effect during the early months of pill intake, this seems to be the more likely cause. Please see your specialist for a proper appraisal of the situation and see if you need to change the pill. Please have a good diet and adequate rest.

Yet, if you have been sexually active throughout this phase, you should see a specialist for a complete evaluation and also test for pregnancy. Your symptoms can happen in very early pregnancy, too.

Once you stop the pills, you are no longer protected and you need some other form of contraception before you plan further intercourse. For the time being, please get your sore and urinary infection treated by a specialist. Please abstain until you are totally cured.

I asked him if the condom broke, he says it didnt.

Added to this, there should be no problem due to late insertion of the ring too. So, please do not worry about the possibility of conception, even if the condom broke.

Is this just a side affect???","Doctor":"Hi,During the first couple of months of hormonal contraception, menstrual disturbances are often seen, but, heavy bleeding of this sort needs immediate medical attention. You would need styptics and a change of the contraceptive method, if there is no relief.

You can as well go for permanent contraception through vasectomy or tubal ligation if you do not want any more children; vasectomy would be the better choice. To decide on the method best suited for your wife, she needs to see a specialist for a proper evaluation and after preliminary investigations, the appropriate device is given.

Yet, added protection is needed in the initial month of pill intake as safety cannot be guaranteed. As such, you may need the emergency contraception if you happen to be during the fertile period when the intercourse happened. If you need the pill, please take it within the stipulated time, and a few hours away from the regular pill intake.

Is it a sypmtom to miss a period or lightly sot on the pill?","Doctor":"As time goes on for women on birth control pills it is not unusual to stop having en daily withdrawal bleeding. Over time the progestin in the pill wins out and the lining of the uterus thins beyond the ability of the low-dose estrogen formulations to produce enough thickness to cause withdrawal bleeding.  There is no reason to be concerned. The Pill is effective for contraception if taken daily regardless of whether or not you're having a withdrawal bleed. There's nothing building up. Prior to the industrial age, what was natural is for women to be either pregnant or lactating most of the time and to have very few periods at all. Relentless menstruation is an entirely modern phenomenon and not always beneficial. If the pills work well for you-feel free to continue them through menopause.I hope this answer was reassuring.

As to whether or not the symptoms you are experiencing I do a pregnancy fatigue or the IUD I would recommend pregnancy test as a first step.  Next we need to consider which type of IUD was placed. If it was the Mirena or Skyla, it is possibly causing some of the systemic symptoms that you described. If it was a copper or inert IUD then the symptoms you describe are not related. please make sure that you're getting enough iron, enough rest, and continue to take your prenatal vitamins. If your symptoms persist, you aren't pregnant. and you have a progesterone IUD you may need to consider alternative contraception."},{"Patient":"Hi i am 22 years old girl i take ipill on regular basis..i had sex in march and took ipill and even had mu periods that month but after that till now i did not have my periods.

The most likely cause of rectal bleeding is hemorrhoids however it is important to rule out cancer. Some hemorrhoids cannot be seen externally because they are inside, which is why you may not be aware of them except by bleeding. You need to get this evaluated by a doctor. Onto the irregular periods. If your cycle was irregular before you started Depi then there is no reason that they would be regular now. However if your cycle was always regular without birth control pills or other medicine prior to starting Depo it can take a full year for regular cycles to reestablish. If it has been more than a year since you had a get depo shot then rhe most common reason for regular menses to become irregular is significant weight gain. Other common reasons are thyroid abnormalities or an elevated prolactin level. Those two can be evaluated by laboratory tests. Regular menses will resume when the underlying problem is treated.Untreated irregular periods can eventually lead to endometrial cancer especially in overweight individuals but even in regular weight  ones.

If it is different from cramping which may be associated the bleeding then maybe it's some type of sensitivity to the string which would require removal. Another possibility is that the IUD itself may be too low in the uterus and the bottom of it is poking into the cervix. An ultrasound should be able to locate the IUD and make sure it is in the correct position. Only you can decide if the unwanted effects outweigh the benefits. None of the problems you're having indicate the IUD is not working. Unfortunately, no method of birth control is perfect however there are many alternatives to consider."},{"Patient":"Hi.

If you have started the pill 2 weeks ago and are taking it regularly then there is no chance of pregnancy. Also if your partner pulled out before ejaculating then there is no chance.

It seems that you are having anemia and hypoprotenemia. It means that there is low hemoglobin and low blood proteins. To correct this you will need to take iron and plenty of protein. Eat eggs twice daily [ if you are a vegetarian eat sprouted beans one bowl twice daily]. Soyabeans, and protein supplements [ protein powders ] mixed with milk are also very useful. Also add a lot of green vegatbles and fruits as well as carrots and beet to improve the hemoglobin. If the swelling is due to low proteins it will improve with this. Addition of B complex vitamins also helps to correct anemia as their deficiency commonly causes anemia. We also advice a dose of albendazole to kill worms as they are a common cause of anemia. Other causes of swelling over body are kidney problems and hormonal issues. So get a kidney function test done as well as blood TSH done to rule these out. Hope this satisfies your query.

They can be affected by the dose and type of hormone in the pill. Some women find that their headaches and migraines improve when they start the pill; others notice that their headaches and migraine get worse.There are several ways to prevent headache or migraine that occurs only during the week that you don’t take the Pill:•     Consider changing to a different type of Pill with a different dose of ethinyloestradiol and/or a different type of progestogen.•     You may find that by taking the Pill continuously for at least 3 cycles followed by a 4 to 7 day break may help. This keeps the levels of oestrogen constant whilst you are taking the 3 packets. You should have less withdrawal bleeds per year and therefore fewer migraines.•     You may wish to consider taking the Pill continuously and never take a break.•     Cupping therapy to remove toxins from body (details can be obtained about cupping points through drizharnium@gmail.com)take care"},{"Patient":"I have been taking Mononessa for the past year regularly and skipping periods so they re only every 3 months.

My question is should I stop and wait for my period to start, or should I just carry on no I have started? I am normally really irregular with my cycles and at present not in risk of pregnancy","Doctor":"Hello and welcome, Your concern is very valid. Thanks for asking us.Cerazette can be started on the first day of period, but this is not compulsory. You can start it on any day but will need to use another contraception method like condoms for the first 7 days of tablet use. After that the protection will start. So if you have started it continue using it and use condoms for the first 7 days. After that there is no need to use any other method. Hope this answers the query. Thanks for choosing health care magic.Feel free for any further queries.Dr Madhuri Bagde"},{"Patient":"i am currently on birth control and i think i could have a yeast infection, my vagina and surrounding areas are itchy but not unbearable. i have read that when on the pill you are more prone to getting these infections. i am trying to keep clean and eat healthy in the hope that it clears up by itself and if not i will go see a doctor next week.

It is designed to be used when there is unexpected sexual episode and no other contraceptive is available. It is not to be used on a regular basis. The dose is if it is a single tablet of 150 mg then one tablet is to be taken as soon as possible within 72 hours after unprotected sex. If there are 2 tablets of 75 mg each then one tablet is taken as soon as possible within 72 hours of unprotected sex and the second tablet is taken 12 hours after the first. In one menstrual cycle this can be used only once. It prevents pregnancies in 97% cases if used early. The common side effects are nausea and vomiting and irregular periods. It is not a replacement to regular contraception and we advise regular contraception like pills, condoms, IUD or implants if the frequency of sexual contact is regular and more than once every 6 months.

However, it is not likely, as most bleeding is not due to pregnancy, but more likely it is just a period, and it ,may take up to nine months after the depo shot for your periods to return to normal.  If they don't become normal by then, you should see your doctor to figure out why your periods are not normal and to get treated for that problem.I would recommend that you take a pregnancy test just to make sure.  I hope this helps, please let me know if you need any more information."},{"Patient":"Hi, i am 32 yrs old mother of 1.

In fact, it is a good idea and may help prevent the possibility of uterine cancer later in life.  However, if you desire pregnancy, you will obviously need to talk to your doctor about what the possible causes are for your periods not coming back (There are many possibilities, and you would need to talk to your doctor about how to figure out what your problem might be).  Once you figure that out, you should be able to try and treat it with other medications that may help you get pregnant.I hope this answers your question, please let me know if you need any more information."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor!I have being using famymor birth control pill for three month now.

So please do suggest me with the name of the pill.","Doctor":"Hi,If you are feeding your baby, it is better not to use emergency pill contraception; you may choose one of the barrier methods or go for insertion of an IUD as an emergency contraception. Emergency pills do contain excess hormone and this can cause breakthrough bleed as well as delayed periods and hence as such is not advisable on a regular basis. Emergency pills should be used only once or twice a year. Hope your query has been clarified.

If you have missed 1 pill then you can take 2 next day. But since you have missed 3 consecutive pills, you are no longer protected now, and you may get withdrawl bleeding anytime if you are not on any pills.

Both this month and last I ve had very, very slight spotting for less than a day and then nothing. Is it normal for my BC to pretty much rid me of my period like this?","Doctor":"The longer that you're on birth control pills the more likely it is that you will cease to have a period. It does not mean that the birth control pill is not effective. On the contrary it is working very well. The lining of the womb has become so thin that there is nothing to shed. In other words the progestin has won out over the estrogen. Many women actually like this as a side effect of taking oral contraceptives. You will have to take a stronger estrogen containing pill to avoid the side effect but I don't think there's any medical reason that you need to."},{"Patient":"Hi there, I am a 19 year old female who takes birthcontrol regularly and have for aproximatly 7 years now and have been on Apri (birthcontrol) for 3 years.

In addition if you were having unprotected sex and this is the same partner that you received chlamydia from it's important that he was treated as well as any of his sexual partners.Are you sure that you are allergic to latex.? Many women who experience sensitivity to nonoxynol nine, a spermicide in some condoms.  Please check with your local doctor to confirm that you're truly latex allergic because if you're not then condoms provide protection against many sexually transmitted diseases including ones that can't be cured."},{"Patient":"I have been spotting for about a month now.

As per your description it seems like something like carbuncle or minor abscess. It is nothing but local infection and pus collection underneath the hair follicles.

(I m a virgin so I can t be pregnant). I finally got it today and I m not sure when to start it. Today is a tuesday, and I have finals this week I don t want to take the pill today because I don t know how my body will react. 1. So should I start this coming Sunday, or can i take it any time between today and and the day my period ends? 2. When I start my first pill, should I start with the hormone pill (white) or inactive (pink) pill? 3. I will be going on a week long family trip in the summer (July) so when should I take my pills to plan a missed period during that time according to the trip? 4. I would prefer my periods to come during the week like mon-friday. how should I know what day to take it? Please help. Thanks!","Doctor":"first of all boys begin with the active pills. There's nothing magic about starting on Sunday is just a convenient starting time. Certainly if you are not sexually active you can begin your pills any time you wish in your cycle.  you should be on the pills two weeks before initiating sexual activity if you wish to wait pregnancy. It may take several months for you to figure out your normal cycle on the pill. You may have spotting or breakthrough bleeding. Hopefully by July things will settle down and you will know how things are going to go. You can always skip some all of the placebo pills to manipulate the start of your period.

After intercourse I bleed like for a couple of days and when I go to use the bathroom it burns, are these normal symptoms for this shot?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome,Bleeding during intercourse is not a symptom caused by depo. However it may cause an erosion of the cervix [ change in the lining of the cervix ] that tends to bleed. Also it may cause irregular bleeding or spotting that may be coinciding with your sexual activity. Other reasons may be a cervical polyp which is a non cancerous growth of the cervix. You will need a per speculum examination for this so please get it done. Also burning in urine indicates either a low water intake or a urine infection. So you will need a urine examination. Also please drink plenty of water to flush off the bacteria. Hope this satisfies your query. Thanks for using HCM.     Feel free to ask any more questions that you may have.

The doctors have an IUD hook that is inserted inside the uterus and the IUD gets entagled in it. It is a very simple procedure requires just 5 minutes but must be done under anesthesia.

Did nordette stop it or delay it? as much as possible i dont want to take ecp again, so if the pills i took before prevented the whole ovulation phase, then i would not need to take nordette now *fingers crossed* should i take it? i know it may be unsafe. but i just want to know if there is a chance this last time can make me pregnant. i also know its better if i just take regular and more reliable modes of contraception and that is what i am planning to do. i just need to get this problem off my mind before i start taking regular pills on my next cycle :) nordette is the only form of ecp here. thank you so much!","Doctor":"hello,Frequent or irregular taking of Nordette pill may cause delayed or irregular period. I suggest you to undergo one home pregnancy test 2 weeks after last sexual intercourse. It helps to clear doubt about pregnancy.After that, you must consult with doctor for other relevant investigations like ultrasound scan, hormone test etc. Combined hormonal pill or regular pill is the best choice of contraception to prevent pregnancy (99.9%) and regularize period. Kindly, consult with doctor for complete prescription.Good luck."},{"Patient":"Hi, I take Gianvi oral contraceptive . I never have had any spotting on that, or my previous birth control ( loestrin 24fe, I switched 3 or 4 months ago). Tonight I ve been having some light pink spotting, and I m wondering if it s maybe implantation bleeding? I took a couple pills several hours later than the normal time I take them this month (about 3 hours late), so is it possible I could have gotten pregnant?","Doctor":"If you have been taking your oral contraceptive pills DAILY, a few hours earlier or later does not make a lot of difference. Implantation bleeding occurs when a person has conceived, but your chances of pregnancy seem slim,nay almost negligible. Chances are that this is breakthrough bleeding, however to be absolutely sure you must get a urinary pregnancy done 28 days from your last menstrual period."},{"Patient":"hi..sr my question is that....do i need to take 2 i pills after having unprotected sex wid my bf ?????????/ or 1 tab is enough????? i had 1 pill just after 15 mins we had sex. m perplexed regarding this.. m not sure whether 1 pill is enough.. still i hav tym only 36 hrs hav lapsed..i still hav tym left..plzzzzzzz advise me do i need to take 1 more pill or 1 is enough","Doctor":"Hello,YES, One I-Pill is enough following unprotected sex and it will give more than 95% protection against unwanted pregnancy.

I am now at day 3 after and i have more brown blood and it is chunky.. also causing cramping. what could this mean ?","Doctor":"Hello,You are perhaps experiencing a withdrawal bleed secondary to the pill effect. Intake of the pill within the stipulated time offers 99% protection. As you do not know whether you ovulated and if so, when it happened and if you had the intercourse during the fertile period, you should wait for three weeks after the incident and get help from a specialist if you do not see a period by then. Hope you find this information useful. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have been on birth control pills for about 8 years now, and I have been on a new pill since last summer.

I shouldnt start my period for about 10 more days.

As per your query it seems like something called genital wart. It is more or less similar to warty anywhere in the body. They are generally harmless and doesn’t cause much problem. You can consult a dermatologist and get it removed either by laser or cautery. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"I am about to start taking Marvelon - Birth control . I was told I could start the Sunday following the end of my period, which would be this Sunday (June 10th) I would like to confirm that, also another thing I would like to confirm, is how long after starting this contraceptive is it safe to have unprotected sex. I know that it s never really safe but me and my boyfriend are very serious and have both been to our family doctors for tesst and we are both a-okay.","Doctor":"Hi, Oral Contraceptive Pills like Marvelon act by raising the levels of female hormones in the blood thus preventing ovulation. They are most efficient when started within the first five days of beginning of the cycle, when the natural hormonal cycle of the body restarts. After the first five days, it takes about 7 days for the hormones to reach effective levels for contraception. So if the pills are started within first five days of the cycle, first day being the first day of menstruation, you can have unprotected sex without fear of pregnancy. However if started after the fifth day you need to use another add on method of contraception like condoms during the intake of the first seven active pills. Also for the pills to be fully effective you need to take the active pills regularly at the same time without a break as prescribed."},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, My girl friend has been on Yasmin for the past six months but last month we shifted to femilon. So my question is it safe to have unprotected sex in the seven days after the proper use of the 21 tablets without missing any tablets? Further if you miss a tablet do you need to use another form of protection and for how long? Thank You Dileepa","Doctor":"Hi Dileepa,it is safe to have unprotected sex anytime during the cycle if the pills have been taken regularly over time.Still, for the pills to be fully effective following guidelines should be adhered to. The first pack of pills should be started from preferably the 1st or 2nd day of the cycle, the first day of cycle being first day of menstruation . If it is started within the first 5 days of the cycle, no other back up method of contraception is required. However, if it is started after the 5th day, a back up method like condom is required during the intake of first 7 active pills.Once the active pills are started they should be taken without a break ,at preferably the same time, every day usually after meals. At the end of 3 weeks she will start the placebo pills. After 3 to 4 days of the placebo pills ,she will have her periods and she should start the next pack in continuity of the old one the day after the last placebo is taken. If the periods are delayed by 7 days she should get a urine pregnancy test done. If she misses one pill she should take it as soon as she remembers or two pills together the next day.If she misses two pills consecutively she should continue the pills as usual but you should use a back up method for the next 7 days along with the pills."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 16, just had a baby 11/5, and had the depo shot around the beginning of January.

Should I get the morning after pill?","Doctor":"Hi,  As you have taken oral contraceptive pill everyday so there is no need to take other contraceptive measures .   You should take OC pills regularly but if you miss a pill then take double dose next day. If two consecutive days are missed then another measure of contraceptives should be sought out. Avoid drugs like rifampicine , macrolids , tetrcycline which decreases its efficiency . Even it has complication including  failure rate( but less than others ).

However, it is the main reason for NOT getting period on your actual date. It occurs due to hormonal imbalance and mental stress. Period may be delayed for 1 -2 weeks.

All family planning methods are good but they need to be used as per directed. Postinor is not a family planning method. It is emergency contraceptive pill that must be used only in case of unexpected unprotected sex that is incidental. It is not to be used more than once in one cycle. Also it is to be used in absolute emergency when contraception was not used as no other methods were available. So please do not do this again. There are so many safe methods safer than postinor. Condoms are the best as they protect against sexually transmitted diseases also.Oral contraceptive pills are pills that must be taken after seeing your doctor. One pill must be taken every day at same time for 21 days or as per the type of pills [ your doctor will explain]. Period come after stopping the pills for 21 days pack or while taking the sugar pills 28 days pack. They are very effective if taken daily and no pills are missed. If pills are missed then pregnancy may occur. They protect against ovarian and uterine cancer.Other methods are injections taken every 2 or 3 months depending upon the type. Commonest is depo provera. it causes irregular periods or spotting but is very effective in preventing pregnancy. Intrauterine devices like copper T or hormone containing ones like Mirena are fitted inside the uterus by your doctor and stay there not allowing the baby to come there. Extremely effective and once inserted the copper t 380 can be kept for 10 years. If pregnancy is desired, just get it removed by the doctor in the clinic.various others are female condoms, contraceptive implants etc. But the above ones are the most used. I strongly recommend condoms and pills or intrauterine devices as they are very effective is used correctly.  Pregnancy can occur as soon as you stop using the method. So there is no need to worry.

A little worried now whether i should just stop on my own- i only take them so I can forcast my cycle since I bleed so much I cant leave the house. Please help!","Doctor":"Hello and welcome, The birth control pills increase the risk of blood clots. Immobilization and surgery is another reason for increased risk of clots and the third is age. So if you use pills and are immobilized and operated plus the post operative recovery period where a person is relatively less moving about, the risk of blood clots increases a lot. These clots go to the lungs and lodge there so there is trouble in breathing. Having said that every surgery will not lead to clots, but it does increase the risk. So we stop the pills as a safe guard to decrease this risk that can be life threatening. If your surgeon is confident, then he must be mobilizing the patients real fast so that the risk decreases. So just discuss this with your surgeon and then decide with his consent as he is the one who will operate and responsible for post operative care. Hope this satisfies your query. All my best wishes are with you for an early recovery.Thanks for using HCM.     Feel free to ask any more questions that you may have.

You have done everything that was possible to prevent pregnancy. So nothing more can be done now. Also not every woman will experience bleeding after taking the pill. Some may not have any problem while others may have irregular cycle for a month or two and some may bleed within 7-10 days. So the bleeding does not predict the efficacy of the pill. Do not worry.  If the periods are missed for more than 14 days [ provided that there was no bleeding in the intervening period] get a pregnancy test done.

Tubectomy can be reversed in most cases and the surgery is called tuboplasty. The results however depend upon what type of tubectomy was done. If fimbriae [ end of tube ] were removed then the surgery will not be successful, but if the ampulla [ middle part of tube ] was removed then it will more likely be successful. Also the success rate will not be 100% as some women may not conceive even after surgery and sometimes the tubes may also get blocked or pregnancy may occur in tube. Tuboplasty is a safe procedure and if pregnancy occurs after that the baby will be just like any other baby. The procedure does not put the baby at any risk. Other options for you are an invitro fertilisation or test tube baby procedure.

I ve asked my doctor and hes useless so hoping you can help. Since I ve been fourteen I have been on some sort of birth control , either microgynon (30ED) contraceptive pill or depo provera injection . 1 1/2 years ago, I went on the injection and got 3 shots, and after this I went straight on the pill for 3 months again. Then 9 months ago I got another depo shot (I am 18 now), and I haven t had a period since I was on the pill, so no period in 9 months and depo ran out 6 months ago. I know it stays in your system for a few months afterwards but I have cleanse my body, drinking only water and eating healthily and still no sign of it coming. For the last 4 months I ve have swollen boobs, that are a little tender under the armpits however I know I am not pregnant because 1) I haven t had a period therefore i can t be ovulating 2) I have done several tests recently - all negative. I have regular unprotected sex with my boyfriend because I wish to have his baby as we are stable and I live with him and he wants his first child (he s 21). We have sex usually thursday - sunday up to 4/5 times a day and still nothing. I am slim - 5 foot 5 and 118 pounds, and I do not have much body fat which I heard is where it is stored. Today I was diagonosed with a kidney infection, which isn t bad but I have no idea why I haven t had a period? Is this normal for someone my size and after the detox? I had fake pg symptoms which you normally get after it leaves your body or as it is doing so. Today my doctor just said get on with it basically however he did give me utovlan 5mg three times a day to try and kick start my period, however I am worried because this is the same hormone as depo that it will cause more damage then good and I will have to wait another 6 months afterwards for things to go back to normal. I am TTC so can someone please help and say what I can do to help ovulation? I have started taking vitamins etc. sorry for the essay, also 2 months ago I had brown discharge for 2-3 days - could this have been my first post depo period?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome, It is a long and exhaustive history but it helps a lot. It seems that you have post pill amenorrhea. It is common and sometimes there is a delay for menstrual function to return after depo and pills. You had spotting so that may have been a sign of return to fertility. However not having periods does not mean not having ovulation. Periods occur 14 days after ovulation. So ovulation comes first and then periods. Many times women who are not using protection conceive in the first ovulation and so periods do not come as there is a pregnancy. So please get a pregnancy test done if you have not done it already. If it is negative then look for other causes of absent periods like thyroid dysfunction, abnormalities in prolactin hormone, ovarian cysts, premature ovarian failure and stress which all delay periods. See a gynecologist and get examined and evaluated. Treatment will depend upon the cause. Also you may need some ovulation inducing drugs to help in conception. Do not worry. All the causes can be treated. Hope this satisfies your query. Thanks for using HCM.     Feel free to ask any more questions that you may have.

You should have taken the pill on the first day because irregularly taking decreases the efficiency of the pills. My advice is to visit your gynecologyst or make a pregnancy test to be sure if you are pregnant.

I m 20 years old and recently had intercourse when the condom broke. I m on my 4th active pill since my period when this happend. I take my pills daily in the morning... What are my chances on pregnancy? (My mother fell pregnant on the pill twice-thats my main reason for concern)","Doctor":"Hello and welcome, I understand the issue. If the pills are used as per instructions, irrespective of periods, active pills for 21 days and 7 days off pills or placebo pills irrespective of the period, chances of pregnancy are very low an failure twice in the same woman is extremely rare.  The commonest mistake with pills are that women tend to begin them on day 3 or day 5 of period every time and not follow the schedule. If you have been using them as per instructions, then there is no chance of pregnancy. So the use of condom is inconsequential, meaning that use or no use will not have much effect in relation to pregnancy. However it does protect against sexually transmitted disease so its use is always wise. Do not worry. If the pills have been taken properly, there is no chance of pregnancy.

Kindly suggest me the safest pill for 1 year that have minimal or no side effects. Also advice the how i have to use them , how many times a day? Thanks Deepika","Doctor":"Hi Deepika,Birth control pills are very effective in preventing pregnancy if used properly. However they do have some side effects and cannot be used by women with certain conditions like liver and heart problems, breast cancer etc. In addition minor side effects are nausea, vomiting and weight gain. These tend to disappear after repeated use as one gets adjusted to the pills.  However they provide protection against ovarian cancer even after the pills are stopped and are excellent in providing contraception if used correctly. So you will need to see your gynecologist, get and examination and blood pressure evaluated and then get pills prescribed. The newer ones like loestrin and femilon are all low dose and have lesser side effects. The pill must be started from day 1 of periods and taken every day at same time preferably at night after dinner. For a 21 day pack, pills are taken for 21 days and then 7 days, no pills, when the periods come. For 28 days pack, pills taken every day and last 7 pills are dummy pills when the period comes while on these pills. If one pill is missed take it as soon as remembered and take the next pill in its usual time [may mean 2 pills in a day]. If more than one pill is missed, another method of contraception must be used for next seven days. More than 3 pills missed, they will not be effective and use other method until new pack started. Irregular pill intake will cause irregular periods.

I have been on Femodene contraceptive pill since I was sixteen because of my periods were a nightmare, Femodene was a godsend. My periods used to be quite heavy and made me ill and depressed for days on end, also I used to get bad mood swings causing me to shout at everyone. I once booked a party (my own) but couldn’t go in the end because my periods ruined it all and made me very ill. I used to get bad headaches that made me throw up, and severe stomach cramps that I could hardly walk. I had my son eight years ago and tried to stay off the pill to see if that would make a difference. I had been told it wasn’t so bad after having children. There was no difference at all, in fact it went back to what it was, I couldn’t even track it on a calendar as it is so unpredictable and irregular. So I went back onto Femodene again and things got better for a while. Now my Dr wants me to come off and go onto something else because of my age, I’m 39. I would like to go on the mini pill as I have checked all my options. She is abdement that I must have a coil inserted. I don’t want this, but she is insistent I must have it. Apparently it’s inserted for five years like having a smear. I am scared to death as I hate smears, the last one I had hurt me very much and was a real ordeal. I want to go on the mini pill but I feel I am not being listened to. I said I would try this before I considered the coil. There are two types of mini and I am worried that if one doesn’t suite me, then she will force me to have the coil, and this is something I am desperate to avoid.

Very small, don't seem clustered.  Not Raised, no itching, nothing noticeable at all.  I just can see them.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Red spots on the penis may be seen in pressure induced allergy patients. After vigorous masturbation it lead to release of histamine locally lead to induration. Nothing to worry, apply less pressure. Use antihistamine before masturbation. If symptoms not improved please consult your doctor he will examine and treat you accordingly. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

If that is the case, then it is not uncommon to have some hormonal symptoms like you describe, as your body starts to get back to normal natural cycles.  Although it is possible that you are pregnant, is in unlikely that you got pregnant so soon after stopping the shots.

How many tablets could I take to at least try to prevent pregnancy. I was not being irresponsible, a condom leaked. I appreciate any help...","Doctor":"Hello and welcome, I am Dr Nilajkumar a consultant gynecologist and I will be helping you in your queries. I understand the concern. The regimen is use of combined pills containing one estrogen and one progesterone drug [ 2 drugs in one pill] and not norethidrone only pills. Also the estrogen content in the tablet must be known. It must provide at least 100 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and 2mg norgestrel. Usually 3-4 tablets are needed and must be taken as 2 doses, first dose as soon as possible within 72 hours of incident and second dose 12 hours after the first dose. Other methods are levonorgestrel only pills commonly sold as plan B one step or unwanted 72. It has only one pill and must be taken as soon as possible within 72 hours of unprotected sex. Remember that is is not advisable to use emergency contraception more than once in one month and it must be used as an occasional method and not a routine one. So continue to use the condoms.      Thanks for using HCM.Have a good day.Dr Nilajkumar Bagde     Consultant Obstetrics and Gynecology"},{"Patient":"Hello, Doctor! If I may ask, is there any danger of overdosing on a birth control pill? I took 4 today to catch up. I have PCOS and my doctor advised me to take Diane35.","Doctor":"Hi,Overdosing up to two pills is done to make up for a missed pill, but taking four pills at a time is not going to help make up the missed doses and the cycle is no longer protected. You may also see a breakthrough bleeding due to excessive hormone levels. Other side effects like rashes, nausea, breast tenderness or abdominal pain, apart from vascular disturbances, may also be seen with high doses. I do not think you should be using some other form of pill once you are on Diane 35. You are amply protected if you are regular with your medication. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hi..i had sex with my girlfriend and during sex condom breaks.then my partner had taken one unwanted 72 tablet after  2 hours of doing sex. is there any possibility of pregnancy?what should i do?plz help me ..i am really worried?what happens if she take one more unwanted 72 tablet ?is there any problem?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM, Please do not worry. You have already taken the necessary step to prevent pregnancy by using unwanted 72.The pills contain the drug levonorgestrel. There are two ways to take the pill. One is a single dose and other is two dose regimen. If the pill has 0.75 mg of the drug the dose is take one tablet within 72 hours and the second 12 hours after the first tablet. If it is a single tablet in the pack: it has 1.5 mg of levonorgestrel and only one tablet must be taken within 72 hours. It prevents more than 95% pregnancies if taken within the stipulated time and proper dose and efficacy is more if it is taken soon after the episode. So do not worry.

I was going through with the procedure and I had told the doctor, who was doing the procedure that the IUD was still inside. Before she did the vacuuming she searched for the IUD and said I may have flushed the IUD out of my body (whatever that means) and then proceeded to do the abortion. Three days later I had severe stomach pains and went to the walk-in. They sent me to the emergency room. They did blood work and x-rays. They showed the the x-ray and the IUD is above my uteras or at the top of it and its bent. They told me to call my obgyn on Monday. But will they have to do surgery to take the IUD out or can it be taken out like it was put in?","Doctor":"Your IUD is on top of your uterus so surgery is required.It cant be removed vaginally.

Please i m too nervous right now. Thanks, Dr.","Doctor":"I have a lot more experience with leavonorgestrel or norgestrel birth control pills. However the same principle holds with Althea as a morning-after pill. I would suggest 4 pills now and 4 pills in 12 hours. You can then take the rest of the pack as usual one pill per day. But it is not necessary for the emergency contraceptive effect only for ongoing contraception. Emergency contraception may work as long as five days out. It is not however hundred percent reliable. If you miss your period entirely you need to do a pregnancy test. Another alternative would be to make an appointment at the clinic and have a Marenda IUD inserted. Using oral contraception as emergency contraception has the disadvantage of causing nausea because of the high dose of estrogen. Also it would not be advised if you have high blood pressure.

Your raised TSH is well beyond the upper limit of 5.5. If you feel that the result is a false positive one you may retest it after a month and then go.

Any intercourse especially unprotected around this period is unsafe and carries the highest risk of pregnancy. Toward the end of the cycle, conception is not possible. Added to that, she has consumed the emergency pill and this provides 99% protection. Since the pill contains excess hormone, it tends to disturb the normal hormonal balance of the body and as a result, the next normal period may have been delayed. If she does not see her period even after 10-14 days after she is due. please get expert help.

Implanon if kept un removed may delay periods or cause irregular periods as small amount of hormones may be released from it for a few more days to months. However these are not effective in preventing pregnancy. So if you have not used any other contraceptive there is a likely hood of pregnancy. If you were in my clinic, I would first get a pregnancy test done to rule out pregnancy before attributing the delay to implanon. Hope this was helpful.

It is to be used within 72 hours of sexual intercourse and works best if taken within the first 12 to 24 hours.

I am Dr Nilajkumar Bagde consultant gynecologist and will be answering your queries. You have said in your heading that you will be just one day late but since you had sex on 1st and will be taking the shot 2 days later, it seems that the delay is more than a day. A difference of 1 or 2 days does not make much difference. You were protected on 1st as ovulation will occur only after the effect of the shot was over meaning after 28 and it usually does not occur on the first day. Still I recommend that you take the shot as soon as possible and use another backup method like condom from now up to seven days after taking the shot to ensure complete protection against pregnancy.

About 2 to 3 years ago my cycles went from being  five days  to now  eight sometimes nine why is that?  will I ever be able to have any more children. Lastly has the depo shot been known to cause women to never never able to conceive again.","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to health care magic,I am Dr Nilajkumar a consultant gynecologist and I will be helping you in your queries. You have been having a heavier period than your regular one since 2-3 years. it would have helped to know your age. However, the possible causes for prolonged periods may be due to hormonal imbalances, increase in the size of uterus due to adenomyosis or fibroids which are tumors in the uterus.If you want to have children, it is better to get yourself evaluated to look for the cause. Sometimes no cause is found. Such cases are termed dysfunctional uterine bleeding. The treatment will be directed according to the cause. Hormonal issues also tend to correct spontaneously if there is a pregnancy.  The depo shots are not known to cause infertility though the return to fertility may be delayed upto 1 1/2 to 2 years in some cases. You have already stopped them since 5-6 years so this must not be an issue. However an ovulation study will help in determining ovulation. You will be able to conceive as long as you are menstruating, but it is advisable to complete child bearing as early as possible if you have menstrual problems.
