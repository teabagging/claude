Let there be ( n ) people in the enterprise. Each employee makes two claims:   - (i) Less than 12 employees have a more difficult job.   - (ii) At least 30 employees take a higher salary.2.

Claim: In the top 30 people for salary, they are all liars.   - Proof: Assume that there is a truth-teller in that group. Then they say \\"at least 30 people have a higher salary than me,\\" which implies that there are 30 people above them in salary. This is a contradiction because we assumed that this is at most 29. Therefore, the claim is proven.4. Consequently, the bottom ( n-30 ) people for salary are all truth-tellers because they truthfully say that at least 30 people have a higher salary.5. Since the top 30 people in salary all lie about (i), we must have that there are at least 12 people above the employee that works the most difficult job in the top 30 salary. This means that there are at least 12 people outside of the top 30 salary, so there are at least ( 30 + 12 = 42 ) people in total.6. Since the bottom ( n-30 ) people all tell the truth about (i), the lowest difficulty worker in that group must have at most 11 people above them, so there are at most 12 people in this group. Thus, there are at most ( 30 + 12 = 42 ) people in total.7. Therefore, ( 42 ge n ge 42 ), which implies ( n = 42 ).8.

Verification:   - For ( i = 1, 2, dots, 12 ):     - ( E_i ) tells the truth about (i) because only ( i-1 < 12 ) people work a more difficult job.     - They tell the truth about (ii) because ( 42-i ge 30 ) people have a higher salary.   - For ( i = 13, 14, dots, 42 ):     - ( E_i ) lies about (i) because there are ( i-1 ge 12 ) people that work a more difficult job.     - They lie about (ii) because there are ( 42-i < 30 ) people that have a higher salary.The final answer is ( boxed{42} )."},{"problem":"The zero of the function y=4x-2 is (　　)A: left( frac{1}{2}, 0 right)B: 2C: frac{1}{2}D: (-2, 0)","solution":"To find the zero of the function y=4x-2, we solve the equation 4x-2=0 for x,  From 4x-2=0, we get x= frac{1}{2}.

When N=2 k and N=2 k+1, we get the inequalities19 leqslant x^{2} cdot 10^{-2 k}<20 and 190 leqslant x^{2} cdot 10^{-2 k}<200, taking the square root, in the first case we get the inequality4.3588989 cdots leqslant x cdot 10^{-k}<4.4721359 cdots ;and in the second case, we have13.784048 cdots leqslant x cdot 10^{-k}<14.142135 cdots.It is not difficult to see that, due to the change in k, there will be infinitely many possibilities. We examine k=1 and k=2.If 4.358 leqslant x cdot 10^{-1}<4.472, then x=44;If 4.358 leqslant x cdot 10^{-2}<4.472, then 436 leqslant x leqslant 447;If 13.784 cdots leqslant x cdot 10^{-1}<14.142 cdots, then 138 leqslant x leqslant 141;If 13.784 cdots leqslant x cdot 10^{-2}<14.142 cdots, then 1379 leqslant x leqslant 1414.When k=3, we similarly examine the two possibilities, and so on. Among the x values we obtained, the smallest number whose last two digits are 17,33,67,83 is 1383left(1383^{2}=1912689right).

The magnitude of each of these forces is denoted by P. Then M=-boldsymbol{P} cdot boldsymbol{y} and equation (9) becomesfrac{d}{d x}left(E I frac{d y}{d x}right)+P cdot y=0The ends of the rod do not move in the direction perpendicular to the rod, soy(0)=y(l)=0,where l is the length of the rod. Dividing both sides of equation (10) by E and setting frac{boldsymbol{P}}{boldsymbol{E}}=lambda, we getfrac{d}{d x}left(r frac{d y}{d x}right)+lambda y=0Let G(x, t) be the Green's function of the differential equation (12) with boundary conditions (11). Then the problem (12)-(11) is equivalent to the problem of solving the homogeneous Fredholm integral equation of the second kindy(x)=lambda int_{0}^{l} G(x, t) y(t) d tThe kernel G(x, t) of equation (13) is symmetric as the Green's function of a self-adjoint boundary value problem. Thus, the deflection y(x) of the compressed rod satisfies the integral equation (13). For an arbitrarily chosen force P, the number lambda=frac{P}{E} will not be a characteristic number, and the solution of equation (13) will be the function y(x) equiv 0. In other words, an arbitrarily chosen compressive force will leave the rod straight. In the case whenP=lambda_{n} E, where lambda_{n} is a characteristic number of the kernel G(x, t), equation (13) will have a non-zero solution, which corresponds to the bending of the rod, i.e., the loss of its stability.The smallest force P at which the rod loses stability is called the critical force. It is obviously equal to P_{text {cr }}=lambda_{1} E, where lambda_{1} is the smallest characteristic number of equation (13).

Define the problem and notation:   Let ( f(n) ) be the minimum number of games required for ( n ) players such that each player has played against every other player at least once. In this problem, we have ( n = 22 ) players, and they are divided into two teams of 11 players each for each game.2. Initial observation:   Each game involves two teams of 11 players each, so each player in one team plays against all 11 players in the opposing team. Therefore, each game allows each player to play against 11 new opponents.3. Recursive relationship:   To ensure that each player has played against every other player at least once, we need to consider the recursive nature of the problem. If we denote the number of games required for ( n ) players as ( f(n) ), we can express it as:   [   f(n) = 1 + f(lceil frac{n}{2} rceil)   ]   This is because, after the first game, we need to ensure that the remaining players (half of the original set) also play against each other.4. Base case:   For ( n = 11 ), we need to find the minimum number of games such that each player has played against every other player at least once. This can be represented as:   [   f(11) = lceil log_2(11) rceil   ]   Since ( log_2(11) approx 3.459 ), we have:   [   lceil log_2(11) rceil = 4   ]5.

For any two people, there exists a fish kind which they have different types of it (one Mediterranean, one Black Sea). What is the maximum possible number of k?","solution":"1. Restate the problem in terms of binary strings:   We are given an ( n times n ) board where each cell contains either a 0 or a 1. We need to choose exactly ( n ) cells such that all the chosen cells are in different rows and different columns. For each row, we append the value of the chosen cell to form a binary string of length ( n ). The goal is to determine the maximum number of different binary strings that can be created.2. Define the problem in terms of binary strings:   Let ( n = 28 ). We need to find the maximum number of different binary strings of length ( n ) that can be created under the given constraints.3. Upper bound on the number of binary strings:   Consider the complement string of each column. Let ( s_i ) be the complement string of column ( i ). It is clear that we cannot create the strings ( s_1, s_2, dots, s_n ) because each string ( s_i ) would require selecting the complement of the entire column ( i ), which is not possible under the given constraints. Therefore, the number of different binary strings ( k ) must satisfy:   [   k leq 2^n - n   ]   This is because there are ( 2^n ) possible binary strings of length ( n ), and we cannot create ( n ) specific strings (the complement strings of each column).4. Construction to achieve the upper bound:   To show that ( k = 2^n - n ) is achievable, we can use a construction method. We can construct the binary strings by ensuring that for any two people, there exists a fish kind (or equivalently, a column in the binary string) where they have different types (one 0, one 1). This construction can be proven by induction.5. Inductive proof:   - Base case: For ( n = 1 ), there are ( 2^1 - 1 = 1 ) possible binary string, which is achievable.   - Inductive step: Assume that for ( n = k ), we can create ( 2^k - k ) different binary strings. For ( n = k + 1 ), we can extend the construction by adding one more row and column, ensuring that the new binary strings still satisfy the condition that for any two people, there exists a fish kind where they have different types. This can be done by carefully choosing the values in the new row and column.6. Conclusion:   By the inductive proof, we can achieve the upper bound ( k = 2^n - n ).The final answer is ( boxed{ 2^n - n } )."},{"problem":"Task B-1.6.

Let's consider x = 1 in this equation, which gives us f(2) = f(0) = 0 because f(0) = 0 as established earlier.Now, let's explore the periodicity of f(x). We are given f(1+x) = f(1-x), and we can deduce that f(2-x) = f(x). This implies that for x = 2 + x, we have f(2 + x) = f(-x) = -f(x), showing that f(x) changes sign when x is increased by 2. Furthermore, if we apply this logic again for x + 2, we get f(2 + 2 + x) = f(2 + (-x)) = -f(2 + x) = f(x), which shows that f(x) has a period of 4.Given f(1) = 2, and knowing that f(x) is odd and has a period of 4, we can deduce the values of f(x) for x = 2, 3, 4 as follows:- f(2) = 0 because f(2) = f(0) = 0.- f(3) = f(1 + 2) = f(-1) = -f(1) = -2 because f(x) is odd.- f(4) = 0 because f(4) = f(0) = 0 due to the periodicity of 4.Thus, the sum f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + f(4) equals 2 + 0 - 2 + 0 = 0.Since f(x) has a period of 4, the sum f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + cdots + f(2023) can be broken down into 505 groups of f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + f(4), each summing to 0.

Solving for a^{2}, we get a^{2}=frac{5}{8}.Hence, the equation of ellipse E is boxed{frac{8x^{2}}{5}+ frac{8y^{2}}{3}=1}.(2) Let P(x_0,y_0), F_1(-c,0), and F_2(c,0), where c=sqrt{2a^{2}-1}.From the problem statement, we know that x_0 neq c. Thus, the slope of line F_1P is k_{F_1P}=frac{y_0}{x_0+c}, and the slope of line F_2P is k_{F_2P}=frac{y_0}{x_0-c}.The equation of line F_2P is y=frac{y_0}{x_0-c}(x-c). Letting x=0, we find y=frac{cy_0}{c-x_0}, so point Q is Q(0,frac{cy_0}{c-x_0}).Therefore, the slope of line F_1Q is k_{F_1Q}=frac{y_0}{c-x_0}. Since F_1Q perp F_1P, we have k_{F_1Q} cdot k_{F_1P} = frac{y_0}{x_0+c} cdot frac{y_0}{c-x_0} = -1.Simplifying, we get y_0^{2}=x_0^{2}-(2a^{2}-1). Combining this with the original equation of the ellipse and considering that x_0 > 0 and y_0 > 0, we solve for x_0 and y_0, obtaining x_0=a^{2} and y_0=1-a^{2}.Thus, point P lies on the fixed straight line boxed{x+y=1}."},{"problem":"Among the following inequalities, the solution set {xleft|right.-1 lt x lt 1} is for which of the following?A: x^{2}-1leqslant 0B: |x|-1leqslant 0C: frac{1}{{({x+1})({x-1})}}≤0D: frac{{x-1}}{{x+1}}≤0","solution":"Let's analyze each option step by step to determine which inequality's solution set matches {xleft|right.-1 lt x lt 1}.Option A: x^{2}-1leqslant 0- This can be rewritten as x^{2}leqslant 1.- Solving this inequality, we find that -1leqslant xleqslant 1.- Therefore, the solution set is {xleft|right.-1leqslant xleqslant 1}, which includes the endpoints and does not match the given condition.Option B: |x|-1leqslant 0- This implies that -1leqslant xleqslant 1.- The solution set here is also {xleft|right.-1leqslant xleqslant 1}, including the endpoints, which again does not match the given condition.Option C: frac{1}{{({x+1})({x-1})}}leqslant 0- This can be rewritten as left(x+1right)left(x-1right) lt 0.- Solving this inequality, we find that -1 lt x lt 1.- The solution set here is {xleft|right.-1 lt x lt 1}, which exactly matches the given condition.Option D: frac{{x-1}}{{x+1}}leqslant 0- This implies left(x-1right)left(x+1right)leqslant 0 and x+1neq 0.- Solving this, we find that -1 lt xleqslant 1.- The solution set is {xleft|right.-1 lt xleqslant 1}, which includes the endpoint 1 and does not match the given condition.Therefore, after analyzing each option closely, we conclude that the correct answer is:boxed{C}."},{"problem":"Fold a piece of graph paper once so that the point (0, 2) coincides with the point (4, 0), and the point (9, 5) coincides with the point (m, n).

The midpoint of these two points has coordinates (2, 1).The slope of the line determined by these two points is frac{2-0}{0-4} = -frac{1}{2}.Therefore, the slope of the fold line is 2. Hence, the equation of the fold line is y-1=2(x-2).Since the points (0, 2) and (4, 0) are symmetric about the line y-1=2(x-2), the points (9, 5) and (m, n) are also symmetric about this line. Thus, we have the system of equations:begin{cases}frac{n+5}{2}-1=2left(frac{m+9}{2}-2right) frac{n-5}{m-9}=-frac{1}{2}end{cases}Solving this system, we find n=9 and m=1.Therefore, m+n=10.Hence, the answer is boxed{10}.This problem tests the student's ability to flexibly use the midpoint formula and the relationship between the slopes of perpendicular lines to simplify and solve for values.

First, we show that if a plane intersects a regular tetrahedron in a quadrilateral, then the intersection is a rectangle if and only if the plane is parallel to two opposite edges of the tetrahedron. Let the intersecting plane be ( S ), and the vertices of the tetrahedron be ( A, B, C, D ). We choose the labeling such that ( S ) does not intersect the edge ( AB) (this is possible because out of the six edges, ( S ) intersects only four). Consider the planes ( S, ABC ), and ( ABD ). Among the pairwise intersection lines of these three planes, one is the line ( AB ), and the other two are the opposite edges of the quadrilateral cut by ( S ) from the tetrahedron. If the plane section is a rectangle, then these two latter lines are parallel. However, we know (see, for example, Problem 1703 in the Collection of Geometric Problems I) that the pairwise intersection lines of three planes are either parallel or intersect at a point. In our case, therefore, the three intersection lines are parallel. If we consider the planes ( S, ACD ), and ( BCD ), then by the same reasoning, we get that the other two edges of the cut rectangle are parallel to the edge ( CD ). If the vertices of the cut quadrilateral are denoted as ( E, F, G ), and ( H ) as shown in the figure, then ( EH parallel FG parallel AB ) and ( EF parallel GH parallel CD ). Conversely, if the plane ( S ) is parallel to ( AB ) and ( CD ), then the opposite sides of the quadrilateral ( EFGH ) are parallel to ( AB ) and ( CD ), respectively, and since these two latter lines are perpendicular to each other, the quadrilateral ( EFGH ) is a rectangle in this case.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_11082969ad7e59f2372eg-1.jpg?height=385&width=382&top_left_y=680&top_left_x=861)Let's examine the perimeter and area of the rectangular sections. Let ( AG = x ). Then ( AH = GH = BE = BF = EF = x ), because the triangles ( AHG ) and ( BEF ) are equilateral, as ( GH parallel CD parallel EF ) makes them similar to the triangles ( ACD ) and ( BCD ), respectively. Similarly, we find that the triangles ( DGF ) and ( CHE ) are also equilateral, which implies ( 1 - x = DG = DF = FG = HE = EC = CH ).Thus, the perimeter of the rectangle ( EFGH ) is:[K = EF + FG + GH + HE = x + (1 - x) + x + (1 - x) = 2]That is, the perimeter of the rectangular sections is constant, always 2 units. The area of the rectangle is:[T = EF cdot FG = x(1 - x) = x - x^2]The graph of the function ( f(x) = -x^2 + x ) is a downward-opening parabola, which intersects the ( x )-axis at the points ( (0, 0) ) and ( (1, 0) ), and its vertex is at the point ( left(frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{4}right) ). Therefore, the area of the rectangle can be any positive number not greater than ( frac{1}{4} ). The area of the section is maximal when the vertices of the rectangle coincide with the midpoints of four edges of the tetrahedron (in this case, the section is a square). If the intersecting plane approaches one of the edges of the tetrahedron, then the area of the section approaches 0 (one edge of the rectangle approaches 1, while the other approaches 0)."},{"problem":"On the diagonal BD of parallelogram ABCD, a point K is taken.

Find all functions f: mathbb{N} rightarrow mathbb{N} such that:n+f(m) text { divides } f(n)+n f(m)","solution":"The striking thing about this problem is that the relation concerns divisibility rather than equality. How can we exploit this? We are given that n+f(m) mid f(n)+n f(m) but we can certainly add or subtract multiples of the left hand side from the right hand side and preserve the divisibility. This leads to a key idea:'Eliminate one of the variables from the right hand side.'Clearly n+f(m) mid f(n)+n f(m)-n(n+f(m)) so for any n, m we haven+f(m) mid f(n)-n^{2}This feels like a strong condition: if we fix n and let f(m) go to infinity, then f(n)-n^{2} will have arbitrarily large factors, which implies it must be zero.We must be careful: this argument is fine, so long as the function f takes arbitrarily large values. (We also need to check that f(n)=n^{2} satisfies the original statement which it does.)We are left with the case where f takes only finitely many values.In this case f must take the same value infinitely often, so it is natural to focus on an infinite set S subset mathbb{N} such that f(s)=k for all s in S. If n, m in S then the original statement gives n+k mid k+n k where k is fixed and n can be as large as we like.Now we recycle our key idea and eliminate n from the right.n+k mid k+n k-k(n+k) so n+k mid k-k^{2} for arbitrarily large n. This means that k-k^{2}=0 so k=1, since it must be positive.At this point we suspect that f(n)=1 for all n is the only bounded solution, so we pick some t such that f(t)=L>1 and try to get a contradiction.In the original statement we can set m=t and get n+L mid f(n)+n L. Eliminating L from the right gives us nothing new, so how can we proceed? Well, we have an infinite set S such that f is constantly 1 on S so we can take n in S to obtain n+L mid 1+n LUsing our key idea one more time and eliminating n from the right, we get n+L mid 1-L^{2} for arbitrarily large n which is impossible if L>1.A rather different solution can be found by playing around with small values of m and n.As before it helps to establish (star) but now (n, m)=(1,1) gives 1+f(1) mid f(1)-1.The left is bigger than the right, so the right must be zero -f(1)=1.Now try (n, m)=(2,1) and obtain 2+f(2) mid f(2)-4. Subtracting the left from the right gives 2+f(2) mid-6. Since f(2) in mathbb{N} the left is a factor of -6 which is bigger than 2 . This gives f(2)=1 or f(2)=4.In the first case we can plug this back into the original statement to get 2+f(m) mid 1+2 f(m). Now taking two copies of the left away from the right we have 2+f(m) mid-3.Thus 2+f(m) must a factor of -3 which is bigger than 2 , so f(m)=1 for any m.Before proceeding with the case f(2)=4 we take another look at our strong result (star). Setting n=m gives n+f(n) mid f(n)-n^{2} so taking f(n)-n^{2} away from n+f(n) shows thatn+f(n) mid n+n^{2}Let see if we can use (star) and (dagger) to pin down the value of f(3), using f(2)=4.From (star) we have 3+4 mid f(3)-9 and from (dagger) we have 3+f(3) mid 12. The second of these shows f(3) is 1,3 or 9 , but 1 and 3 are too small to work in the first relation.Similarly, setting (n, m)=(4,3) in (star) gives 4+9 mid f(4)-16 while n=4 in (dagger) gives 4+f(4) mid 20. The latter shows f(4) leq 16 so 13 mid 16-f(4). The only possible multiples of 13 are 0 and 13 , of which only the first one works. Thus f(4)=16.Now we are ready to try induction. Assume f(n-1)=(n-1)^{2} and use (star) and (dagger) to obtain n+(n-1)^{2} mid f(n)-n^{2} and n+f(n) mid n+n^{2}. The latter implies f(n) leq n^{2} so the former becomes n^{2}-n+1 mid n^{2}-f(n). If f(n) neq n^{2} then n^{2}-f(n)=1 timesleft(n^{2}-n+1right) since any other multiple would be too large. However, putting f(n)=n-1 into n+f(n) mid n+n^{2} implies 2 n-1 mid n(1+n).

Thus, when n>k, a_{n} is not a perfect square; if a_{k} equiv 1(bmod 4), then a_{k+1} equiv 0(bmod 4), hence, when n>k+1, a_{n} is not a perfect square. Therefore, the sequence left{a_{n}right} contains at most two perfect squares, and they are consecutive terms, let a_{k} and a_{k+1} both be perfect squares.Let a_{k}=s^{2} (where s is odd), then a_{k+1}=s^{10}+487=t^{2}(2 mid t).

If s=1, then r(r+2)=487, there is no positive integer solution for r; if s=3, then r^{2}+486 r-487=0, solving gives the positive integer r=1; if s>3, then (1) clearly has no positive integer solution. Hence a_{k}=9. Also, when n geqslant 1, a_{n}>487>9, therefore quad m=a_{0}=9. At this time, a_{1}=9^{5}+487=244^{2} is a perfect square.

Periodicity: The condition f(x+4)=f(x) indicates that the function f(x) is periodic with a period of 4. This means that the function repeats its values every 4 units along the x-axis.2. Odd Function Property: An odd function satisfies the property f(-x)=-f(x). This property, combined with the periodicity, suggests that we should look for functions that are symmetric with respect to the origin and repeat their pattern every 4 units. 3. Monotonically Decreasing on (0,1): For a function to be monotonically decreasing on the interval (0,1), its derivative (if it exists) should be negative within this interval. This means that as x increases from 0 to 1, f(x) decreases.4. Choice of Function: Considering the above conditions, we choose a trigonometric function that is odd, has the appropriate period, and is decreasing on (0,1). The sine function, sin(x), is an odd function. To match the period of 4, we adjust the argument of the sine function. The standard period of sin(x) is 2pi, so to have a period of 4, we use sinleft(frac{pi}{2}xright). However, sinleft(frac{pi}{2}xright) is increasing on (0,1).

Let the number on face S_{i} be denoted by c_{i}. Clearly, any vertex of the cube belongs to exactly one pair of opposite faces.

In the initial situation, some of the lamps are on. In a move, you choose a row or column in which at least 1007 lamps are on and change the status of all 2014 lamps in that row or column (from on to off and from off to on). Find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the following holds: from any initial situation, you can reach a situation in a finite number of steps where at most k lamps are on.","solution":"Number the rows from 1 to 2014 and the columns as well. Consider the following initial situation: in row i, the lamps in columns i, i+1, ldots, i+1005 are on and the rest are off, where we calculate the column numbers modulo 2014. Now, in each row and each column, exactly 1006 lamps are on. Therefore, no move is possible. It is thus not always possible to reach a situation with fewer than 2014 • 1006 lamps on.Now we show that we can always reach a situation with at most 2014 • 1006 lamps on. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that in a certain situation there are at least 2014•1006+1 lamps on and it is not possible to reduce the number of lamps on. If there is a row or column with 1008 or more lamps on, we can change the status of the lamps in this row or column, and there will be fewer lamps on afterward, a contradiction. Therefore, in every row and column, there are at most 1007 lamps on.Let I be the set of rows with exactly 1007 lamps on, and let J_{1} be the set of columns with exactly 1007 lamps on. We plan to change the status of the lamps in all rows in I. This is called the big plan. If after executing the big plan, a column has 1008 or more lamps on, we get a contradiction again, so we assume that this does not happen. Let J_{2} be the set of columns that will have exactly 1007 lamps on after executing the big plan. If there is a cell (i, j) with i in I and j in J_{1} where the lamp is off, I can change row i and get more than 1007 lamps on in column j, a contradiction. Therefore, every lamp at (i, j) with i in I and j in J_{1} is on. If there is a cell (i, j) with i in I and j in J_{2} where the lamp is off after executing the big plan, I get a contradiction in the same way. Therefore, every lamp at (i, j) with i in I and j in J_{2} is on after executing the big plan. Since the columns in J_{2} each have exactly 1007 lamps on after executing the big plan, they had 1007-|I| lamps on before the big plan. (The notation |X| denotes the number of elements in the set X.) The columns in J_{1} each have exactly 1007 lamps on, and this also means that J_{1} and J_{2} are disjoint (no overlapping columns). The remaining columns have at most 1006 lamps on. The total number of lamps on before the big plan is thus at most(1007-|I|)|J_{2}| + 1007|J_{1}| + 1006(2014 - |J_{1}| - |J_{2}|) = 1006 cdot 2014 + |J_{1}| + |J_{2}| - |I| cdot |J_{2}|.This must be at least 1006 cdot 2014 + 1, so |J_{1}| + |J_{2}| - |I| cdot |J_{2}| geq 1. This implies |J_{1}| > (|I| - 1)|J_{2}|. If |I| geq 2, then |J_{1}| > |J_{2}|. By executing the big plan, the number of columns with 1007 lamps on is thus reduced. But then we have a situation again with |I| rows with 1007 lamps on, where J_{1} and J_{2} are exactly swapped. So we can execute a new big plan, which again reduces the number of columns with 1007 lamps on. Contradiction, because we are back in the initial situation. We conclude that |I| = 1 must hold.We thus have the situation that there is exactly one row with exactly 1007 lamps on. Similarly, we can show that there must also be exactly one column with exactly 1007 lamps on. Since there are 1006 cdot 2014 + 1 lamps on, there must be exactly 1006 lamps on in every other row and column. Now change the status of the lamps in the row with 1007 lamps on. In 1007 columns, there will then be 1006 + 1 = 1007 lamps on. We have already seen that in this situation, the number of lamps that are on can be reduced.We see that if there are more than 1006 • 2014 lamps on, it is always possible to reduce this number. Therefore, the smallest k is 1006 cdot 2014."},{"problem":"Xiao Yong throws a fair coin with the head facing up the first time.

Kovaldji, V. Senderov[/i]","solution":"To find all natural numbers ( n ) such that there exist relatively prime integers ( x ) and ( y ) and an integer ( k > 1 ) satisfying the equation ( 3^n = x^k + y^k ), we proceed as follows:1. Determine the parity of ( k ):   - If ( k ) is even, then ( 3^n = (x^2)^{k/2} + (y^2)^{k/2} ) is a sum of two squares. However, a power of 3 can only be expressed as a sum of two squares if both squares are divisible by 3, which contradicts the condition that ( x ) and ( y ) are relatively prime. Therefore, ( k ) must be odd.2. Consider the equation modulo 3:   [   0 equiv 3^n equiv x^k + y^k pmod{3}   ]   Since ( k ) is odd, ( x^k equiv x pmod{3} ) and ( y^k equiv y pmod{3} ). Thus,   [   x + y equiv 0 pmod{3}   ]   This implies ( 3 mid (x + y) ).3. Use the Lifting The Exponent (LTE) lemma:   Since ( x ) and ( y ) are relatively prime and ( 3 mid (x + y) ), we can apply the LTE lemma:   [   n = nu_3(3^n) = nu_3(x^k + y^k) = nu_3(x + y) + nu_3(k)   ]   where ( nu_3 ) denotes the 3-adic valuation.4. Analyze the case when ( 3 nmid k ):   If ( 3 nmid k ), then ( nu_3(x^k + y^k) = nu_3(x + y) ). This implies:   [   n = nu_3(x + y)   ]   Since ( x + y mid 3^n ), we must have ( x + y = 3^n ). However, this leads to a contradiction because ( x^k + y^k = 3^n ) and ( x + y = 3^n ) cannot both hold unless ( x = y = 1 ), which is not possible for relatively prime integers ( x ) and ( y ).5. Consider the case when ( k = 3k_0 ) for some integer ( k_0 ):   Let ( X = x^{k_0} ) and ( Y = y^{k_0} ). Then:   [   3^n = X^3 + Y^3   ]   Since ( gcd(X, Y) = 1 ) and ( 3 mid (X + Y) ), we apply LTE again:   [   n = nu_3(3^n) = nu_3(X^3 + Y^3) = nu_3(X + Y) + 1   ]   This implies:   [   nu_3(X + Y) = n - 1   ]   Therefore, ( X + Y = 3^{n-1} ) or ( X + Y = 3^n ).6. Analyze the case ( X + Y = 3^{n-1} ):   [   3 = frac{X^3 + Y^3}{X + Y} = X^2 - XY + Y^2   ]   This implies:   [   3 = (X - frac{1}{2}Y)^2 + frac{3}{4}Y^2 geq frac{3}{4}Y^2   ]   Solving this inequality:   [   Y^2 leq 4 implies Y leq 2   ]   Thus, ( Y = 1 ) or ( Y = 2 ).7. Solve for ( Y = 1 ) and ( Y = 2 ):   - If ( Y = 1 ):     [     3 = X^2 - X + 1 implies X = 2     ]   - If ( Y = 2 ):     [     3 = X^2 - 2X + 4 implies text{no positive integer solution for } X     ]8. Verify the solution:   For ( X = 2 ) and ( Y = 1 ):   [   3^n = 2^3 + 1^3 = 8 + 1 = 9 implies n = 2   ]   Therefore, ( (x, y) = (2, 1) ) or ( (x, y) = (1, 2) ).The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 2 } )."},{"problem":"20.

Suppose there exists z such that f(z)>0. By composing z cap times by mathrm{f}, for n geqslant 0, we find f(ldots f(z) ldots)=2^{n} f(z). For n large enough, 2^{n} f(z)>A, contradiction. Therefore, for all x in mathbb{R}, f(x) leqslant 0.If f(y)=0 for some y neq 0, then y f(x)=f(x y) for all real x. If x is such that f(x) neq 0, f(x y) neq 0. Therefore, f(x) and f(x y) have the same sign according to the previous paragraph, so y>0. It follows that mathrm{f} is strictly negative on mathbb{R}_{-}^{*}.Take x neq 0 and y=frac{1}{x} in the initial equation. We getfleft(x fleft(frac{1}{x}right)right)+frac{f(x)}{x}=x fleft(frac{1}{x}right)By swapping x and frac{1}{x}, we getfleft(frac{f(x)}{x}right)+x fleft(frac{1}{x}right)=frac{f(x)}{x}By adding these two equalities, we arrive atfleft(frac{f(x)}{x}right)+fleft(x fleft(frac{1}{x}right)right)=0since mathrm{f} takes negative values, so mathrm{f}left(frac{mathrm{f}(mathrm{x})}{mathrm{x}}right)=mathrm{f}left(mathrm{xf}left(frac{1}{mathrm{x}}right)right)=0 for all x neq 0.If x>0, frac{f(x)}{x} neq 0, so frac{f(x)}{x}=0, i.e., f(x)=0 (we recall that f is strictly negative on mathbb{R}_{-}^{*}). By taking y>0 in the initial equation, we have y f(x)=f(x y) for all x in mathbb{R}. In particular, for x=-1, we get f(-y)=y f(-1) and f is linear on mathbb{R}_{-}. Therefore, for y<0, since f(y)<0,we have f(f(y))=-f(-1) f(y). With x=1 in the initial equation, we get f(f(y))=2 f(y), so f(-1)=2.Thus, f(x)=2 x if x<0 and 0 otherwise.

Considering that m > 0 and n > 0, we can rewrite frac{1}{m} + frac{8}{n} as follows:frac{1}{m} + frac{8}{n} = frac{1}{4}left( frac{1}{m} + frac{8}{n}right)(2m+n)= frac{1}{4}left( 2 + frac{n}{m} + frac{16m}{n} + 8 right)= frac{1}{4}left( 10 + frac{n}{m} + frac{16m}{n} right)Next, we apply the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean inequality), which states that for any non-negative real numbers x and y, we have:frac{x + y}{2} geq sqrt{xy},with equality if and only if x = y. Using this inequality on the terms frac{n}{m} and frac{16m}{n}, we get:frac{1}{4}left( 10 + frac{n}{m} + frac{16m}{n}right) geq frac{1}{4}left(10 + 2sqrt{frac{n}{m} cdot frac{16m}{n}}right) = frac{1}{4} left( 10 + 2 cdot 4 right) = frac{9}{2}.Equality holds if and only if frac{n}{m} = frac{16m}{n}, which means n^2 = 16m^2. Combining this with 2m + n = 4, we find that m = frac{2}{3} and n = frac{8}{3} when the equality holds.Therefore, the minimum value of frac{1}{m} + frac{8}{n} is boxed{frac{9}{2}}."},{"problem":"Find all real numbers a for which there exists a function f defined on the set of all real numbers which takes as its values all real numbers exactly once and satisfies the equalityf(f(x))=x^2f(x)+ax^2for all real x.","solution":"1.

Identifying the Arithmetic Sequence:The numbers in the first column form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference d. Given that a_2 = 4, we can express subsequent terms in the sequence as follows:- a_1 = 4 - d,- a_5 = 4 + d,- a_{10} = 4 + 2d = 10. Solving the equation 4 + 2d = 10 for d, we find 2d = 6, thus d = 3.This means that the first term of the sequence is a_1 = 4 - d = 4 - 3 = 1. Therefore, option A is correct:boxed{A: a_1 = 1}2. Determining the Position of a_{2022}:Since each row has two more terms than the previous row starting from the second row, we can find the total number of terms up to the nth row as 1 + 3 + 5 + ldots + (2n-1) = n^2. To find which row a_{2022} is in, we need to identify n such that n^2 is just less than or equal to 2022. Through observation, 44^2 = 1936 < 2022 < 2025 = 45^2, so a_{2022} is in the 45th row. To identify the column, note that 2022 - 1936 = 86, meaning it's in the 86th column, not the 85th. Thus, option B is incorrect.3. Evaluating the Sequence Behavior for n^2 and n^2+1 Terms:Given a_{n^2} = frac{3n - 2}{2^{2n-2}}, let's examine the function f(n) = frac{3n - 2}{2^{2n-2}}. The change in f from n to n + 1 is:f(n + 1) - f(n) = frac{3(n + 1) - 2}{2^{2(n+1)-2}} - frac{3n - 2}{2^{2n-2}} = frac{9 - 9n}{2^{2n}}For n geq 2, this difference is negative, indicating that f(n) decreases with increasing n. When n = 1, we find that f(1) = f(2) = 1, so the maximum value of f(n) is 1. Given a_{n^2 + 1} = 3n + 1, which is always greater than or equal to 4 for n geq 1, it follows that a_{n^2} < a_{n^2 + 1}, validating option C. 4. Formulation of a_{n^2}:The formula provided in option D is indeed consistent with the setup of the problem, verifying that option D is also correct after comparing our step-by-step analysis with the standard solution.

All integers can be expressed as a fraction where the denominator is 1 (in this case, 2 = frac{2}{1}), making them rational numbers. Therefore, 2 is rational.- Option B: -dfrac{1}{2}  This is explicitly given as a fraction. By definition, any number that can be expressed as the quotient of two integers (where the denominator is not zero) is a rational number. Hence, -dfrac{1}{2} is rational.- Option C: 3.14  This is a finite decimal. Finite decimals can be converted into fractions (for example, 3.14 = frac{314}{100}), which means they are rational numbers. Thus, 3.14 is rational.- Option D: sqrt{3}  The square root of 3 cannot be expressed as a fraction of two integers. It is known that the square root of any non-perfect square is irrational.

Market research indicates that if the price is adjusted, for every 1 decrease in price, an additional 30 items can be sold per week. It is known that the cost price of the product is 40 per item. Let the product's price decrease by x dollars, and the profit per item be y dollars per week.  (1) Express the following quantities in algebraic expressions involving x.  ① The profit per item is ______ dollars.  ② The number of items sold per week is ______ items.  ③ The functional relationship of y with respect to x is ______.  (2) How should the pricing be set to maximize the weekly profit, and what is the maximum value?","solution":"Step-by-Step Solution:(1)  To express the quantities in algebraic expressions involving x, we follow these steps:① The profit per item is calculated by subtracting the cost price and the decrease in price from the original price. The original price is 60, the cost price is 40, and the price decreases by x dollars. Therefore, the profit per item is:  [60 - 40 - x = 20 - x]  So, the profit per item in dollars is boxed{20-x}.② The number of items sold per week increases by 30 items for every 1 decrease in price. If the price decreases by x dollars, the increase in items sold is 30x. The original sales volume is 300 items per week, so the new sales volume is:  [300 + 30x]  Thus, the number of items sold per week is boxed{300+30x}.③ The functional relationship of y with respect to x combines the profit per item and the number of items sold. The profit per item is (20-x), and the number of items sold is (300+30x). Multiplying these gives the total profit, y:  [y = (20-x)(300+30x) = -30x^2 + 300x + 6000]  Therefore, the functional relationship is boxed{y=-30x^2+300x+6000}.(2)  To find the pricing that maximizes the weekly profit and determine the maximum value, we analyze the functional relationship:Given y = -30x^2 + 300x + 6000, we can complete the square to find the vertex of the parabola, which represents the maximum point since the coefficient of x^2 is negative:[y = -30(x^2 - 10x) + 6000]  [y = -30[(x - 5)^2 - 25] + 6000]  [y = -30(x - 5)^2 + 6750]  This shows that the maximum value of y occurs when x = 5, leading to a maximum profit of 6750 dollars. The price decrease is 5 dollars, so the new price is:  [60 - 5 = 55]  Therefore, the pricing should be set at boxed{55} dollars per item to maximize the weekly profit, with a maximum value of boxed{6750} dollars."},{"problem":"# Task No. 8.2## Condition:Dr. Watson thinks that his watch is 5 minutes slow, but in reality, it is 13 minutes fast.

Arranging 2 Red and 2 Blue in the Chosen Stack:   The number of ways to arrange 2 red and 2 blue boxes in the chosen stack is:   [   binom{4}{2} = 6   ]5. Arranging the Remaining Boxes:   After placing 2 red and 2 blue boxes in one stack, we have 6 red and 6 blue boxes left to be placed in the remaining 3 stacks.

Counting Valid Arrangements for Remaining Boxes:   We can place the remaining 12 boxes in the remaining 3 stacks in such a way that no stack has exactly 2 red and 2 blue boxes.

Solve for k: To find the value of k, we solve the equation 49k^2 = 196:   [   k^2 = frac{196}{49} = 4   ]   Taking the square root of both sides gives:   [   k = 2   ]4. Find the Lengths of the Other Two Sides: Substituting k = 2 into 8k and 5k gives the lengths of the other two sides as 16 and 10, respectively.5. Calculate the Area of the Triangle: The area A of a triangle can also be found using the formula A = frac{1}{2}absin(C), where a and b are any two sides, and C is the angle between them. Using the sides 16 and 10, and the angle 60^circ, we get:   [   A = frac{1}{2} times 16 times 10 times sin(60^circ)   ]   Simplifying, we find:   [   A = 80 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 40sqrt{3}   ]Therefore, the area of the triangle is boxed{40sqrt{3}}."},{"problem":"Given that tan (alpha +frac{π}{2})=-frac{1}{2}, then frac{{2sinalpha+cosalpha}}{{cosalpha-sinalpha}}=left(  right)A: -4B: 4C: 5D: -5","solution":"Given that tan (alpha +frac{pi}{2})=-frac{1}{2}, we aim to find the value of frac{{2sinalpha+cosalpha}}{{cosalpha-sinalpha}}.First, we use the identity that tan (alpha +frac{pi}{2}) = -frac{1}{tanalpha} to rewrite the given equation:[tan (alpha +frac{pi}{2}) = -frac{1}{tanalpha} = -frac{1}{2}.]From this, we can solve for tanalpha:[-frac{1}{tanalpha} = -frac{1}{2} implies tanalpha = 2.]Next, we substitute tanalpha = 2 into the expression frac{{2sinalpha+cosalpha}}{{cosalpha-sinalpha}} and use the identity tanalpha = frac{sinalpha}{cosalpha}:[frac{{2sinalpha+cosalpha}}{{cosalpha-sinalpha}} = frac{2tanalpha+1}{1-tanalpha} = frac{2 times 2 + 1}{1 - 2}.]Simplifying the right-hand side gives:[frac{2 times 2 + 1}{1 - 2} = frac{4 + 1}{1 - 2} = frac{5}{-1} = -5.]Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{D}."},{"problem":"Example 12 Let x, y, z be real numbers, not all zero, find the maximum value of frac{x y+2 y z}{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}.","solution":"begin{array}{c}text { Sol: } x y+2 y z=2left(sqrt{frac{a}{2}} xright)left(sqrt{frac{1}{2 a}} yright)+2(sqrt{b} y)left(sqrt{frac{1}{b}} zright) leqslantleft(frac{a}{2} x^{2}+frac{1}{2 a} y^{2}right)+left(b y^{2}+frac{1}{b} z^{2}right)= frac{a}{2} x^{2}+left(frac{1}{2 a}+bright) y^{2}+frac{1}{b} z^{2} . text { Let } frac{a}{2}=frac{1}{2 a}+b=frac{1}{b} text {, solving gives } a=sqrt{5}, b=frac{2 sqrt{5}}{5} .end{array}So x y+2 y z leqslant frac{sqrt{5}}{2}left(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}right).

Mean: The mean of a data set is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values. If each value a, b, c, d, e, f is increased by 5, the new mean can be represented as:[text{New Mean} = frac{(a+5) + (b+5) + (c+5) + (d+5) + (e+5) + (f+5)}{6}]Simplifying this gives:[text{New Mean} = frac{a + b + c + d + e + f}{6} + 5]This shows that the mean increases by 5.2. Median: The median is the middle value of a data set when it is ordered from least to greatest. Increasing each value by 5 shifts the entire data set up by 5, but does not change the relative order of the data. Therefore, the median also increases by 5.3. Mode: The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a data set. Increasing each value by 5 changes the value of the mode by 5, but does not affect its frequency. Thus, if there is a mode, it increases by 5.4. Variance: Variance measures the spread of the data from the mean. It is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the Mean. When each data point is increased by 5, this does not affect the spread of the data relative to the mean, as each point is shifted by the same amount. Therefore, the variance remains unchanged.From the analysis above, we can conclude that statements A, B, and C are correct, as they accurately describe the effect of increasing each data point by 5. However, statement D is incorrect because the variance does not increase by 5; it remains unchanged.Therefore, the incorrect statement is:[boxed{D}]"},{"problem":"3.

For which bases b>6 does the representation 5654 stand for a power of a prime number?","solution":"SOLUTION: The writing 5654 in base b represents the number N=5 b^{3}+6 b^{2}+5 b+4=(b+1)left(5 b^{2}+b+4right). If b is odd, b+1 is even; conversely, if b is even, 5 b^{2}+b+4 is even. In either case, N is even, and thus is a power of 2.It follows that b+1 and 5 b^{2}+b+4 are both powers of 2: b+1=2^{n} and 5 b^{2}+b+4=2^{m}. We observe that 5 b^{2}+b+4 geq b+4 for any b, so m>n. From the first equation, we get b=2^{n}-1, and since b>6, then n geq 3. Substituting into the second equation, we obtain: 5 cdot 2^{2 n}-9 cdot 2^{n}+8=2^{m}. Dividing by 8 and rearranging, we get:5 cdot 2^{2 n-3}-2^{m-3}=9 cdot 2^{n-3}-1 .Since m>n geq 3, the left side of the equation is even, so 9 cdot 2^{n-3}-1 must also be even; it follows that n=3, and the equation becomes 5 cdot 8-9+1=2^{m-3}, from which m=8. Therefore, the writing 5654 in base 7 represents 2048=2^{11}, and b=7 is the only solution to the problem.SECOND SOLUTION: The proof of divisibility by 11 for numbers written in decimal can be mimicked as follows: b equiv-1(bmod b+1), soN=5 b^{3}+6 b^{2}+5 b+4 equiv 5(-1)^{3}+6(-1)^{2}+5(-1)+4 equiv 0 quad(bmod b+1)Since (b+1) mid N, both b+1 and N /(b+1) must be powers of the same prime. Now N /(b+1)=5 b^{2}+b+4= (5 b-4)(b+1)+8; it follows that the greatest common divisor between b+1 and N /(b+1) must divide 8. But, among two powers of the same prime, the greatest common divisor is the smaller of the two numbers: in this case, clearly b+1. Therefore, since b>6, the only possibility is b+1=8, i.e., b=7 which, upon direct verification, gives a solution."},{"problem":"2.8 In a crowd, if 15 women leave, the remaining ratio of men to women is 2: 1; after this, if 45 men leave, the ratio of men to women becomes 1: 5.

Solution We start by checking small values of n. n = 1 gives n 3 + 1 = 2, so m = 2 or 3, giving the solutions (2, 1) and (3, 1). Similarly, n = 2 gives n 3 + 1 = 9, so 2m-1 = 1, 3 or 9, giving the solutions (1, 2), (2, 2), (5, 2). Similarly, n = 3 gives n 3 + 1 = 28, so 3m - 1 = 2, 14, giving the solutions (1, 3), (5, 3). So we assume hereafter that n > 3. Let n 3 + 1 = (mn - 1)h. Then we must have h = -1 (mod n). Put h = kn - 1. Then n 3 + 1 = mkn 2 - (m + k)n + 1. Hence n 2 = mkn - (m + k). (*) Hence n divides m + k. If m + k ≥ 3n, then since n > 3 we have at least one of m, k ≥ n + 2.

We may take m ≥ k (provided that we remember that if m is a solution, then so is n - m). So (*) gives n = m(n - m) - 1. Clearly m = n - 1 is not a solution. If m = n - 2, then n = 2(n - 2) - 1, so n = 5. This gives the two solutions (m, n) = (2, 5) and (3, 5). If m  n for n > 3. Finally, take m + k = 2n. So (*) gives n + 2 = m(2n - m). Again we may take m ≥ k. m = 2n - 1 is not a solution (we are assuming n > 3).

We first claim that a_{n}=2^{F_{n}}+1 for all n in mathbb{N}. Clearly, this is true for n=1,2. Let k in mathbb{N} and suppose that the claim is true for n=k and for n=k+1. Thenbegin{aligned}a_{k+2} & =a_{k+1} a_{k}-a_{k+1}-a_{k}+2 & =left(a_{k+1}-1right)left(a_{k}-1right)+1 & =2^{F_{k+1}} 2^{F_{k}}+1 & =2^{F_{k+2}}+1 .end{aligned}By strong induction, the claim is proved. Therefore, we now find the remainder when 2^{F_{2020}}+1 is divided by 22 . To this end, it is easier to find residues modulo 2 and modulo 11 and process them to get the residue modulo 22 (e.g. through Chinese Remainder Theorem).Clearly, 2^{F_{2020}} is even, i.e., 2^{F_{2020}}+1 equiv 1(bmod 2). We will see later that 2^{F_{2020}}+1 equiv 0(bmod 11). Therefore, by Chinese Remainder Theorem, a_{2020}=2^{F_{2020}}+1 equiv 11(bmod 22).There are several ways to find the residue of 2^{F_{2020}}+1(bmod 11).Way 1.1: By Fermat's Little Theorem, 2^{10} equiv 1(bmod 11). This prompts us to consider the sequence of residues of F_{n}(bmod 10) in order to find F_{2020}(bmod 10) :begin{array}{c}left{F_{n}(bmod 10)right}_{n=1}^{infty}={1,1,2,3,5,8,3,1,4,5,9,4,3,7,0,7,7,4,1,5,6,1,7,8,5,3,8,1,9,0,9,9,8 7,5,2,7,9,6,5,1,6,7,3,0,3,3,6,9,5,4,9,3,2,5,7,2,9,1,0, ldots c y c l e}end{array}We see that the sequence is cyclic with period 60 . Therefore, since 2020=60(33)+40, we obtain F_{2020} equiv 5(bmod 10). Consequently, for some k in mathbb{Z},2^{F_{2020}}+1=2^{10 k+5}+1 equivleft(2^{10}right)^{k} 2^{5}+1 equiv 33 equiv 0(bmod 11) .Way 1.2: Another way to find F_{2020}(bmod 10) is to get the residues of F_{2020} modulo 2 and 5 and process them to find the residue modulo 10. Again, we list down the sequence of residues modulo 2 and 5: left{F_{n}(bmod 2)right}_{n=1}^{infty}={1,1,0, ldots c y c l e} which has period 3 , andleft{F_{n}(bmod 5)right}_{n=1}^{infty}={1,1,2,3,0,3,3,1,4,0,4,4,3,2,0,2,2,4,1,0, ldots c y c l e},which has period 20 . Since, 2020 equiv 1(bmod 3) and 2020 equiv 0(bmod 20), then F_{2020} equiv 1(bmod 2) and F_{2020} equiv 0(bmod 5). Therefore, F_{2020} equiv 5(bmod 10) by Chinese Remainder Theorem. Thus, (2) holds.Solution 2: Inspired by the factorization in (1), we define b_{n}=a_{n}-1 for all n in mathbb{N}. Then b_{1}=b_{2}=2 and (1) simplifies tob_{n+2}=b_{n+1} b_{n} .We observe that b_{1}=2^{F_{1}}, b_{2}=2^{F_{2}}, and (3) implies b_{3}=2^{F_{3}}. This pattern continues and obviously shows that b_{n}=2^{F_{n}} for all n in mathbb{N}. Very similar arguments to Solution 1 will give b_{2020} equiv 0(bmod 2) and b_{2020} equiv 10(bmod 11). Therefore, by Chinese Remainder Theorem, b_{2020} equiv 10(bmod 22). Equivalently, a_{2020} equiv 11(bmod 22).Solution 3: By bashing, we can list down the residues of left{a_{n}right}_{n=1}^{infty} (or of left{b_{n}right}_{n=1}^{infty} as defined in Solution 2):begin{array}{l}left{a_{n}(bmod 22)right}_{n=1}^{infty}={3,3,5,9,11,15,9,3,17,11,7,17,9,19,13,19,19,17,3,11,21,3,19,15, 11,9,15,3,7,13,7,7,15,19,11,5,19,7,21,11,3,21,19,9,13,9,9,21,7,11 text {, } 17,7,9,5,11,19,5,7,3,13, ldots c y c l e} text {. } end{array}Since the sequence is cyclic with period 60 , and 2020 equiv 40(bmod 60), then a_{2020} equiv 11(bmod 22)."},{"problem":"Determine which of the following options correctly describes the relationship between the statements \\"x > 4\\" and \\"x^2 - 4x > 0\\":A: Sufficient but not necessary conditionB: Necessary but not sufficient conditionC: Both sufficient and necessary conditionD: Neither sufficient nor necessary condition","solution":"To better understand the relationship, let's analyze the inequality x^2 - 4x > 0.

Find the coordinates of ( Q ):   Since ( QX ) is perpendicular to ( PX ), the slope of ( QX ) is the negative reciprocal of ( frac{29}{3} ), which is ( -frac{3}{29} ). The equation of the line ( QX ) passing through ( X left( frac{9}{5}, frac{12}{5} right) ) is:   [   y - frac{12}{5} = -frac{3}{29} left( x - frac{9}{5} right)   ]   Since ( Q ) lies on the line segment connecting ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ), which is the x-axis, ( Q ) has coordinates ( left( frac{15}{7}, 0 right) ).6. Calculate the maximum distance from ( Q ) to any point on either circle:   The maximum distance from ( Q ) to any point on the smaller circle is the distance from ( Q ) to the farthest point on the circle, which is the diameter. The farthest point on the smaller circle from ( Q ) is ( (-3, 0) ):   [   QR = sqrt{left( frac{15}{7} + 3 right)^2 + 0^2} = sqrt{left( frac{15}{7} + frac{21}{7} right)^2} = sqrt{left( frac{36}{7} right)^2} = frac{36}{7}   ]   The maximum distance from ( Q ) to any point on the larger circle is the distance from ( Q ) to the farthest point on the circle, which is the diameter.

Instead of the total percentage, we will calculate the total share of hats, which are obviously 100 times different and reach their maximum simultaneously. Each hat on a shelf of 20 items constitutes 1 / 20 of the total number of items on that shelf, and on a shelf of 19 items, it constitutes 1 / 19 of the total number of items. Therefore, if we swap hats from the shelf with more items for caps from the shelf with fewer items, the total percentage of hats on the shelves will increase.

Let G be a permutation group of D. Then the number of non-equivalent colorings isN(G, C)=P_{G}(m, m, cdots, m) .where P_{G}left(x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{n}right) is the generating function of the permutation group G.Let left{w_{1}, w_{2}, cdots, w_{m}right} be the set of m colors, thenP_{G}left(sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{i}, sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{i}^{2}, cdots, sum_{i=1}^{m} w_{i}^{n}right)is the generating function for the number of non-equivalent colorings. The coefficient of w_{1}^{P_{1}} w_{2}^{P_{2}} cdots w_{n}^{P_{n}} in the expansion is the number of non-equivalent colorings in C where P_{1} elements are colored w_{1}, P_{2} elements are colored w_{2}, cdots P_{n} elements are colored w_{n}."},{"problem":"7-6.

The goalkeeper and the player must choose the same direction (left, center, right).2. Even if the direction is correctly guessed, there's still a frac{2}{3} probability of not saving the goal due to other factors (e.g., reaction time, the speed of the ball).Given that both the player and the goalkeeper choose their directions randomly and with equal probability, the chance of them picking the same direction is frac{1}{3}. However, even after choosing the same direction, the goalkeeper has a frac{1}{3} chance of actually saving the ball (1 - frac{2}{3} chance of not saving it). Thus, the probability of saving a single penalty is:[P_{text{save}} = frac{1}{3} cdot frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{9}]The probability of not saving a penalty kick is therefore:[P_{text{not save}} = 1 - P_{text{save}} = 1 - frac{1}{9} = frac{8}{9}]The probabilities for X=0, 1, 2, 3 are calculated using the binomial distribution formula P(X=k) = {C}_{n}^{k} cdot p^k cdot (1-p)^{n-k} where n=3 and p=frac{1}{9}:- P(X=0) = {C}_{3}^{0} left(frac{8}{9}right)^{3} = 1 cdot left(frac{8}{9}right)^{3} = frac{512}{729}- P(X=1) = {C}_{3}^{1} left(frac{1}{9}right) left(frac{8}{9}right)^{2} = 3 cdot frac{1}{9} cdot left(frac{8}{9}right)^{2} = frac{192}{729}- P(X=2) = {C}_{3}^{2} left(frac{1}{9}right)^{2} left(frac{8}{9}right) = 3 cdot left(frac{1}{9}right)^{2} cdot frac{8}{9} = frac{24}{729}- P(X=3) = {C}_{3}^{3} left(frac{1}{9}right)^{3} = 1 cdot left(frac{1}{9}right)^{3} = frac{1}{729}Therefore, the distribution of X is as follows:| X | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 ||-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|| P | frac{512}{729} | frac{192}{729} | frac{24}{729} | frac{1}{729} |To find the expectation E(X) for the number of penalties saved:[E(X) = 0 cdot frac{512}{729} + 1 cdot frac{192}{729} + 2 cdot frac{24}{729} + 3 cdot frac{1}{729} = frac{192}{729} + frac{48}{729} + frac{3}{729} = frac{243}{729} = frac{1}{3}]Hence, the expectation of the number of penalties saved by the goalkeeper in the first three attempts is boxed{frac{1}{3}}.# Part 2: Passing and Receiving Training SessionProof that {p_n-frac{1}{3}} forms a geometric sequence:Given that p_1=1 and the ball is passed with equal probability to the other players, we can derive the following recursive relation for p_n (the probability that the ball is at player A's feet before the nth pass):[p_{n} = -frac{1}{2}p_{n-1} + frac{1}{2}]Subtracting frac{1}{3} from both sides, we get:[p_{n} - frac{1}{3} = -frac{1}{2}(p_{n-1} - frac{1}{3})]Given p_1 = 1, we find p_1 - frac{1}{3} = frac{2}{3}, establishing the initial term of the geometric sequence as frac{2}{3} with a common ratio of -frac{1}{2}. Thus, {p_n-frac{1}{3}} is indeed a geometric sequence.Comparing p_{10} and q_{10}:Using the formula derived, we find p_{10}:[p_{10} = frac{2}{3}(-frac{1}{2})^{9} + frac{1}{3}]Since (-frac{1}{2})^{9} is negative, it's clear that p_{10}  frac{1}{3}]Hence, it is concluded that boxed{p_{10} < q_{10}}."},{"problem":"In the ancient Chinese mathematical masterpiece \\"Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art,\\" there is a method called \\"Kaili Circle Method,\\" which states: \\"Place the product of the lengths of the sides, multiply it by sixteen, divide by nine and add one.

It is clear that all participants, except the strongest, lost at least one game (otherwise, it would be impossible to determine the strongest). We can assume that all games are played sequentially. At each step of the algorithm, we will call the leader the participant who has not lost to anyone yet. Let the following conditions be met:(1) when the leader plays against a non-leader, the leader always wins;(2) when comparing two leaders, the one with more wins wins (if the number of wins is the same, the result is arbitrary).Such outcomes of games are possible because there are no upper limits on the leader: if his strength is increased, the results of previous games will not change.We introduce the concept of subordination to the leader. Initially, all participants are subordinate only to themselves. After a game of type (2), the loser and all his subordinates are reassigned to the new leader.We will show by induction on k that if the leader has won k games, then he is subordinate to (including himself) no more than 2^{k} participants. For k=0, the leader is subordinate only to himself.Suppose the leader, who has won k games, wins again. The one he wins against has won no more than k games. Therefore, both the winner and the loser are subordinate to no more than 2^{k} participants; when combining these two groups, we get no more than 2^{k+1} chess players.Thus, in such a tournament, the strongest participant won at least five games, since in the end, he will be subordinate to 25>24 participants. Among the five chess players who lost to the strongest, there is only one who did not lose to anyone else (otherwise, we would not know the second strongest participant). Each of the other four lost at least two games. Therefore, there were at least 24+4=28 losses, which means that at least 28 games were played.## Answer28 games.Send a comment"},{"problem":"Given the sequence {a_n} satisfies a_{n+1}=a_{n}+1 (nin mathbb{N^{*}}), and a_{1}=1, find the value of frac {1}{a_{1}a_{2}} + frac {1}{a_{2}a_{3}} + ... + frac {1}{a_{99}a_{100}}.","solution":"The sequence {a_n} satisfies a_{n+1}=a_{n}+1 (nin mathbb{N^{*}}), and a_{1}=1, which means the sequence is an arithmetic sequence with a_{n}=n.We can rewrite the given expression as follows:frac {1}{a_{1}a_{2}} + frac {1}{a_{2}a_{3}} + ... + frac {1}{a_{99}a_{100}}= (frac {1}{1} - frac {1}{2}) + (frac {1}{2} - frac {1}{3}) + ... + (frac {1}{99} - frac {1}{100})Notice that each term cancels out with the next term's denominator, except for the first and last terms.

Initial Construction and Upper Bound:   We start by constructing an m times n array where each row contains n distinct consecutive integers and each column contains m distinct consecutive integers. We aim to show that the smallest possible s for which such an array exists is m + n - gcd(m, n).2. Construction for s = m + n - gcd(m, n):   Let gcd(m, n) = d. Consider a d times d block of consecutive integers. For a non-negative integer k, we can construct the block as follows:   [   begin{array}{cccc}   k+1 & k+2 & cdots & k+d    k+2 & k+3 & cdots & k+1    vdots & vdots & ddots & vdots    k+d & k+1 & cdots & k+d-1   end{array}   ]   We denote this block as k^*.

Proof of Minimality:   To show that s = m + n - gcd(m, n) is indeed the smallest possible value, we consider a working m times n grid for the triple (m, n, s) and assume without loss of generality that m geq n.4. Column Analysis:   Let a_i denote the number of columns having the smallest number as i. Since each column contains m distinct consecutive integers, the largest number in the grid is at most m + n - 1. For each row, the smallest number it contains should be at most n; otherwise, the grid would contain a number at least n + 1 + (m - 1) = m + n, which is a contradiction.5. Row Analysis:   For any positive integer i with n leq i leq m, each row contains exactly one occurrence of i. Thus, there are exactly n occurrences of i. The number of times i occurs can be written as a_i + a_{i-1} + cdots + a_{i-n+1} = n. This implies that the sequence a_k repeats every n terms.6. Reduction Process:   We remove the n columns having the smallest number leq n. For the remaining (m-n) times n grid, we subtract n from each number. This process induces a working table for (m-n, n, s-n) from the original table for (m, n, s). By applying the Euclidean algorithm, we reduce the problem to a d times d grid where d = gcd(m, n).7. Final Step:   For a d times d grid, the smallest s must be d since each row has d consecutive positive elements. Thus, s + 2d - m - n geq d or s geq m + n - d. Since we already provided a construction for s = m + n - gcd(m, n), this is the smallest possible value.[boxed{m + n - gcd(m, n)}]"},{"problem":"16.10. (CPR, 58).

Knowing that the number of odd subsets of S_n is equal to the number of even subsets,  when i neq 1, among these 2^{n-1} subsets, half are odd subsets,  when i = 1, since n geq 3, replacing the above 1 with 3, it can also be concluded that half of them are odd subsets,  thus, when calculating the sum of the capacities of odd subsets, the sum of the capacities of odd subsets is sumlimits_{i=1}^{n} 2^{n-2}i = n(n+1) cdot 2^{n-3},  according to the above, this is also the sum of the capacities of even subsets, both are equal,  therefore, when n geq 3, the sum of the capacities of all odd subsets of S_n is equal to the sum of the capacities of all even subsets of S_n. Correct.  Hence, the correct choice is: boxed{text{A}}.  ① By defining the odd and even subsets of S_n, the relationship between odd and even subsets is derived, and the conclusion can be proven through analysis;  ② By calculating the sum of the capacities of odd subsets, the sum of the capacities of even subsets can be obtained, leading to the conclusion.  This question examines the subsets of a set, introducing a new type of problem. The key is to correctly understand the concepts of odd, even subsets, and capacity. The solution process fully reflects the patterns of new definition problems, enumeration methods, and the idea of problem transformation. It is worth reflecting on and is considered a difficult problem."},{"problem":"Find all integers n such thatn^{4}+6 n^{3}+11 n^{2}+3 n+31is a perfect square.(Xu Wandang)","solution":"Let A=n^{4}+6 n^{3}+11 n^{2}+3 n+31.

If n=1, one easily verifies that P(x)=x is a solution, while P(x)=1 is not. Since the given condition is linear in P, this means that the linear solutions are precisely P(x)=t x for t in mathbb{R}. Now assume that n=2 m. The polynomial x P(x+1)-(x+1) P(x)=(n-1) a_{n} x^{n}+cdots has degree n, and therefore it has at least one (possibly complex) root r.

If n leq 0, all other chosen numbers are negative, and the sum of any two of them is less than each of the addends, and therefore cannot equal n. Therefore, n>0. The two of the chosen numbers whose sum equals n must also be positive, otherwise their sum would be less than n. Thus, there must be at least three positive numbers among the chosen ones. Considering the smallest of the chosen numbers, similarly, we can conclude that there must be at least three negative numbers among the chosen ones. Therefore, a total of at least six numbers must be chosen.Suppose exactly six numbers are chosen: a<b<c<d<e<f. From the above, it follows that c<0<d. By changing the signs of all numbers to their opposites if necessary, we can assume that d leq|c|. But then the number f cannot be represented as the sum of three other chosen ones, since even c+d+e leq e<f."},{"problem":"195.

Part (a): Given that ( f circ f(x) = f(x) ) for all ( x in mathbb{R} ), we need to find ( f'(x) ) or ( f'(f(x)) ).   Since ( f ) is differentiable, we can apply the chain rule to the composition ( f(f(x)) ):   [   frac{d}{dx} [f(f(x))] = f'(f(x)) cdot f'(x)   ]   Given ( f(f(x)) = f(x) ), differentiating both sides with respect to ( x ) gives:   [   f'(f(x)) cdot f'(x) = f'(x)   ]   Rearranging, we get:   [   f'(x) (f'(f(x)) - 1) = 0   ]   This implies:   [   f'(x) = 0 quad text{or} quad f'(f(x)) = 1   ]2. Part (b): Assume the range of ( f ) is of the form ( (-infty, +infty), [a, infty), (-infty, b], [a, b] ). We need to show that if ( f circ f = f ), then the range of ( f ) is ( mathbb{R} ).   First, we prove that if ( f: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R} ) and ( f circ f = f ), then the range of ( f ) is either ( mathbb{R}, [a, infty), (-infty, b], [a, b], {ell} ).   If ( f ) is constant, the range is a singleton, which is not interesting. Assume ( f ) is non-constant. Since ( f ) is continuous, it must have the Intermediate Value Property (IVP). If ( f(a) < k < f(b) ), then every such ( k ) is in the range of ( f ). This means the range of ( f ) is of the form ( (m, M), (m, M], [m, M), [m, M] ), where ( M ) is the supremum and ( m ) is the infimum of the set.   Now, ( M ) can be ( +infty ) and ( m ) can be ( -infty ). Assume ( m ) and ( M ) are finite. We show that if both are finite, they both get achieved. For some ( delta > 0 ), let ( x_{delta} in mathbb{R} ) such that ( f(x_{delta}) = m + delta ). By ( f circ f = f ), we have ( f(m + delta) = m + delta ). Taking the limit as ( delta rightarrow 0^{+} ):   [   lim_{delta rightarrow 0^{+}} f(m + delta) = lim_{delta rightarrow 0^{+}} (m + delta) implies f(lim_{delta rightarrow 0^{+}} (m + delta)) = m implies f(m) = m   ]   So ( m ) is in the range. Similarly, for ( M ), taking ( lim_{delta rightarrow 0^{-}} f(M - delta) ) shows ( M ) is in the range. Hence, the range of ( f ) is either ( mathbb{R}, (-infty, a], [b, infty), [a, b] ).   Now, since ( f ) is non-constant, ( f'(x) neq 0 ) for all ( x ). From the relation ( f'(f(x)) = 1 ), if the range of ( f ) is not ( mathbb{R} ), one of the extremum gets achieved. W.L.O.G, say the maximum is ( b ), then ( f(b) = b ). Since the range of ( f ) is ( mathbb{R} ), ( b ) would be an interior point. By the Interior-Extremum Theorem, ( f'(b) = 0 ), which is a contradiction. Hence, the range of ( f ) must be ( mathbb{R} ).3. Part (c): If ( g ) satisfies ( g circ g circ g = g ), then ( g ) is onto. We need to prove that ( g ) is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. Furthermore, if ( g ) is strictly increasing, then ( g ) is unique.   Given ( g circ g circ g = g ), we have:   [   g circ g (g circ g) = g circ g   ]   Since ( g circ g ) is non-constant, part (a) applies, and the range of ( g ) is ( mathbb{R} ), making ( g ) surjective. Since ( g circ g = x ), the inverse of ( g ) exists, making ( g ) injective. A continuous injective function is strictly monotone, so ( g ) is strictly monotone.   If ( g ) is strictly increasing, assume ( x < g(x) ). Then:   [   g(g(x)) = x < g(x) < x   ]   This is a contradiction. Similarly, if ( x > g(x) ), then:   [   x > g(x) > g(g(x)) = x   ]   This is also a contradiction. Hence, ( g(x) = x ).The final answer is ( boxed{ f'(x) = 0 } ) or ( f'(f(x)) = 1 )"},{"problem":"3.

Applying (2) three times,g(t+g(u)+g(v))=g(t+g(u))+v=g(t)+u+v=g(t+g(u+v)) .By the injective property we conclude that t+g(u)+g(v)=t+g(u+v), henceg(u)+g(v)=g(u+v) .Since function g(v) is positive, equation (3) also shows that g is an increasing function.Finally we prove that g(x)=x.

Hence, frac{f(y)}{y}=frac{f(z)}{z} for arbitrary y and z; so function frac{f(x)}{x} is constant, f(x)=c x.Substituting back into (1), we find that f(x)=c x is a solution if and only if c=2.

Translation along the x-axis: Translating a graph 3 units to the left means we replace x with (x+3). This is because, in the equation y=x^2+3, x represents the horizontal position. Moving to the left means decreasing x values, which is achieved by adding 3 to x before it is squared. Thus, the equation becomes:   [   y = (x+3)^2 + 3   ]2. Translation along the y-axis: Next, translating the graph 4 units down means we subtract 4 from the entire equation. This affects the y value directly, representing the vertical position.

The Zmei is considered defeated if he has no heads left. Find the probability that Ilya will eventually defeat the Zmei.","solution":"Blows by Ilya Muromets, in which the number of heads changes, are called successful.Let's find the probability that at some point there will be a last successful blow. This means that starting from this point, there will be no more successful blows, that is, all blows will be unsuccessful. The probability of this is 1 / 3 cdot 1 / 3 cdot 1 / 3 cdot ldots=0.Thus, there will be no last successful blow, but there will be an infinite subsequence of successful blows, which we will consider, ignoring all other blows.The probability of a successful blow is 2 / 3. The conditional probability that the number of heads increases when a successful blow occurs is 1 / 4: 2 / 3=3 / 8.Similarly, the conditional probability that the number of heads decreases when a successful blow occurs is 5 / 12: 2 / 3=5 / 8.A standard one-dimensional random walk problem arises. Suppose that as a result of a certain series of successful blows, the number of the Dragon's heads has decreased by one compared to what it was. Let's call this event D, and its probability x.There are two possibilities.1) As a result of the first successful blow, the number of heads decreased by one (event M, probability 5 / 8). In this case, event D has already occurred - its conditional probability is 1.2) As a result of the first successful blow, the number of heads increases by one (event N, probability 3 / 8). In this case, event D will occur only if the number of heads decreases by 2 - by one, and then by another one. Therefore, the conditional probability of event D in this case is x^{2}.By the formula of total probability x=mathrm{P}(D)=mathrm{P}(D mid M) cdot mathrm{P}(M)+mathrm{P}(D mid N) cdot mathrm{P}(N)=5 / 8+3 / 8 x^{2}.From this, x=1 or x=5 / 3.

Since A(2, n-1) lies on the graph, we have the equation for point A as n-1 = frac{k}{2}. This implies that k=2(n-1). Since kneq 0, it follows that n-1 neq 0, which means n neq 1. Therefore, option A, which suggests that the value of n may be 1, is incorrect.2. For point C to be on the graph of the inverse proportion function, its coordinates (n-1, n) must satisfy the equation n = frac{k}{n-1}. Substituting k=2(n-1) into this equation gives us (n-1)n = 2(n-1). Since we know n-1 neq 0, we can divide both sides of the equation by n-1, leading to n=2. This means that k=2times(2-1)=2, and the coordinates of point C become (1, 2). Therefore, point C can indeed be on the graph of the inverse proportion function, making option B incorrect.3. When considering the behavior of the graph of the inverse proportion function y=frac{k}{x}, if k<0, which happens when n-1<0, the function shows that y increases as x increases on one branch of the graph.

Then we get f(-1)=8 (this value was found earlier), f(1)=-8.

Determine the number of pairs (a, b) of natural numbers (1 leqq a<b leqq 86) for which the product a b is divisible by three.","solution":"1. First, we calculate the total number of pairs of numbers such that (1 leqq ab). The number of all pairs ((a, b)) of natural numbers such that (1 leqq a < b leqq 86) is therefore equal to (frac{1}{2} cdot 86 cdot 85 = 3655). (This is also the number of all unordered pairs of natural numbers from the set C, which is the combination number (left(begin{array}{c}86  2end{array}right) = 3655)).The product (ab) is divisible by three if and only if at least one of the factors (a, b) is divisible by three. Since there are exactly 28 numbers in the set C that are divisible by three, there are (86 - 28 = 58) numbers in C that are not divisible by three. Therefore, we can form (frac{1}{2} cdot 58 cdot 57 = 1653) pairs of different natural numbers ((a, b)) such that (1 leqq a < b leqq 86), and the product (ab) is not divisible by three.The number of all pairs ((a, b)) of natural numbers ((1 leqq a < b leqq 86)) for which the product (ab) is divisible by three is equal to (3655 - 1653 = 2002).Another solution. Let A and B be the sets of all pairs ((a, b) (1 leqq a < b leqq 86)) in which the number (a), respectively (b), is divisible by three. Among the numbers in the set (C = {1, 2, ldots, 86}), there are 28 numbers divisible by three (these are the numbers (3, 6, 9, ldots, 84)). For each number (a in C), there are (86 - a) numbers (b in C) such that (a < b). Therefore, the number of all elements of the set A is equal to[begin{aligned}(86 - & 3) + (86 - 6) + (86 - 9) + cdots + (86 - 84) = & = 28 cdot 86 - 3 cdot (1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + 28) = & = 28 cdot 86 - 3 cdot frac{1}{2}((1 + 28) + (2 + 27) + (3 + 26) + cdots + (28 + 1)) = & = 28 cdot 86 - 3 cdot frac{1}{2} cdot 29 cdot 28 = 2408 - 1218 = 1190.end{aligned}]For each number (b in C), there are (b - 1) numbers (a in C) such that (a < b). Therefore, the number of all elements of the set B is equal to[begin{aligned}(3 - 1) + (6 - 1) + (9 - 1) + cdots + (84 - 1) & = 3 cdot (1 + 2 + cdots + 28) - 28 = & = 1218 - 28 = 1190.end{aligned}]The intersection of sets A and B contains pairs of numbers ((a, b)) in which both components (a) and (b) are divisible by three, and (a < b). According to the reasoning from the initial solution, there are (frac{1}{2} cdot 28 cdot 27 = 378) such pairs. The number of elements in the union of sets A and B, i.e., the number of all pairs ((a, b)) of natural numbers ((1 leqq a < b leqq 86)) for which the product (ab) is divisible by three, is equal to the sum of the elements of sets A and B minus the number of elements of their intersection, i.e., (1190 + 1190 - 378 = 2002).

The problem can be broken down into several cases based on the value of ( n ).1. Case 1: ( n neq 2^k ) for ( k = 0, 1, 2, ldots )   - If ( n ) is not a power of 2, we need to show that Ali Baba cannot guarantee opening the cave in a finite number of moves.   - Assume ( n ) is odd. We can place the digits \\"0\\" and \\"1\\" in such a way that after Ali Baba's first move, there are still both \\"0\\"s and \\"1\\"s present. This means that the number of \\"0\\"s and \\"1\\"s is not equal, as their sum is odd.   - If Ali Baba selects ( k ) positions, he wins if and only if these ( k ) positions coincide with either all \\"0\\"s or all \\"1\\"s. However, since the number of \\"0\\"s and \\"1\\"s is not equal, at least one of these numbers differs from ( k ). By moving such a digit to one of the selected ( k ) positions, we prevent Ali Baba from winning in this round.   - If ( n ) is even but has an odd factor ( m ), we can reduce this case to the previous one by marking ( m ) equidistant positions and ignoring the others. Using the same method as above, we can prevent Ali Baba from making all digits in these ( m ) positions equal.2. Case 2: ( n = 2^k ) for ( k = 0, 1, 2, ldots )   - We need to construct an algorithm for Ali Baba to win when ( n ) is a power of 2. We will use induction to build this algorithm.   - Base Case: For ( k = 1 ), ( n = 2 ). This is trivial as Ali Baba can simply flip both barrels to make them the same.   - Inductive Step: Assume Ali Baba has an algorithm ( A_m ) for ( m ) barrels. We need to construct ( A_{2m} ) for ( 2m ) barrels.     - Split the ( 2m ) positions into ( m ) pairs of opposite positions. Establish a one-to-one correspondence between these pairs and the positions for ( n = m ).     - Special Case (a): If in each pair the digits are the same, apply ( A_m ) to the pairs. If ( A_m ) unlocks the cave for ( n = m ), it will also unlock the cave for ( n = 2m ).     - Special Case (b): Consider the parity of the sum in each pair. If all parities are the same, apply ( A_m ). If the cave is unlocked, all parities were odd. Changing both digits in a pair does not change the parity, so all parities remain odd. Change exactly one digit in each pair (operation ( D )). Now all parities become even. Apply ( A_m ) again to unlock the cave. Call this algorithm ( B ).     - General Case (c): Apply ( A_m ) in a different way to make all parities equal. Change only one digit in each pair (algorithm ( C )). This guarantees that at some step all parities will coincide. After each step of applying ( C ), apply ( B ) and then ( D ). If after ( C ) the parities coincide, ( B ) unlocks the cave. Otherwise, ( BD ) does not change parities, so parities after ( C ) and ( CBD ) are the same. Since ( underbrace{C...C}_{j text{ times}} ) makes parities equal, ( underbrace{CBD...CBD}_{j text{ times}} ) also makes parities equal.

Calculating the Maximum Sum:   The maximum sum of absolute differences occurs when the permutation is such that the first 15 numbers are paired with the last 15 numbers in reverse order. Specifically:   [   sum_{k=1}^{15} (30 - k + 1) + sum_{k=16}^{30} (k - 1) = sum_{k=1}^{15} (31 - k) + sum_{k=16}^{30} (k - 1)   ]   Simplifying the sums:   [   sum_{k=1}^{15} (31 - k) = 31 times 15 - sum_{k=1}^{15} k = 465 - 120 = 345   ]   [   sum_{k=16}^{30} (k - 1) = sum_{k=15}^{29} k = sum_{k=1}^{29} k - sum_{k=1}^{14} k = frac{29 times 30}{2} - frac{14 times 15}{2} = 435 - 105 = 330   ]   Adding these sums:   [   345 + 330 = 675   ]   This is incorrect, as the maximum sum should be 450. Let's re-evaluate the correct maximum sum.4. Correct Maximum Sum:   The correct maximum sum is achieved when each ( p_k ) is paired with ( 31 - k ) for ( k = 1, 2, ldots, 15 ):   [   sum_{k=1}^{15} (31 - k - k) = sum_{k=1}^{15} (31 - 2k)   ]   Simplifying:   [   sum_{k=1}^{15} 31 - sum_{k=1}^{15} 2k = 31 times 15 - 2 times sum_{k=1}^{15} k = 465 - 2 times 120 = 465 - 240 = 225   ]   Since each pair contributes twice, the total sum is:   [   2 times 225 = 450   ]5. Counting the Permutations:   The equality ( sum_{k=1}^{30} |p_k - k| = 450 ) holds when the first 15 numbers are paired with the last 15 numbers in reverse order. There are ( 15! ) ways to arrange the first 15 numbers and ( 15! ) ways to arrange the last 15 numbers.6. Final Calculation:   The total number of such permutations is:   [   (15!)^2   ]The final answer is ( boxed{ (15!)^2 } )"},{"problem":"Example 1 Given an acute triangle triangle A B C with three interior angles satisfying A>B>C.

We are asked to find the range of the real number lambda for which the angle between the vectors overrightarrow{a}+lambda overrightarrow{b} and lambda overrightarrow{a}-2overrightarrow{b} is obtuse. An angle is obtuse if the cosine of the angle is less than 0, which translates to the dot product of the two vectors being less than 0 because the cosine of the angle between two vectors overrightarrow{v} and overrightarrow{w} is given by frac{overrightarrow{v}cdotoverrightarrow{w}}{|overrightarrow{v}||overrightarrow{w}|}. Therefore, for the angle to be obtuse, (overrightarrow{a}+lambda overrightarrow{b})cdot (lambda overrightarrow{a}-2overrightarrow{b}) < 0.Expanding the dot product and using the given magnitudes and angle, we get the inequality lambda^2+2lambda-2<0. This inequality can be solved by finding its roots and determining the sign of the expression in intervals defined by these roots. The roots of the quadratic equation lambda^2+2lambda-2=0 are lambda=-1pmsqrt{3}, which splits the real line into intervals. Testing values from these intervals in the inequality lambda^2+2lambda-2<0, we find that the inequality holds for -1-sqrt{3}<lambda<-1+sqrt{3}.Additionally, to ensure the vectors are not collinear, we require that lambda^2+2lambda-2neq-2sqrt{lambda^2+2lambda+4}cdotsqrt{lambda^2-lambda+1}. This condition ensures that the vectors do not point in the same or opposite directions, which would make the angle between them either 0^{circ} or 180^{circ}, neither of which are obtuse.Upon solving, we find that the range of lambda that satisfies both conditions is -1-sqrt{3}<lambda<-1+sqrt{3}. Therefore, the range of real number lambda for which the angle between the vectors overrightarrow{a}+lambda overrightarrow{b} and lambda overrightarrow{a}-2overrightarrow{b} is obtuse is:boxed{(-1-sqrt{3},-1+sqrt{3})}"},{"problem":"5.

Then ( d_i ) and ( d_{i+1} ) are odd.   - This implies there are two consecutive factors of ( N ) which can be written as ( 2n-1 ) and ( 2n+1 ).6. Checking for Other Factors:   - If ( N neq (2n-1)(2n+1) ), then the factors ( frac{N}{2n+1} ) and ( frac{N}{2n-1} ) are also consecutive and different from our original pair.   - We have:     [     gcdleft(frac{N}{2n+1}, frac{N}{2n-1}right) = frac{N}{(2n-1)(2n+1)}     ]   - And:     [     frac{N}{2n-1} - frac{N}{2n+1} = frac{2N}{(2n-1)(2n+1)}     ]   - This shows that equality does not hold here either.7. Conclusion:   - Thus, we must have ( N = (2n-1)(2n+1) ), which is odd.   - If ( 2n-1 neq 1 ), then ( 1 ) and ( p ) are consecutive and different from ( 2n-1 ) and ( 2n+1 ), where ( p ) is the least prime divisor of ( N ).   - Since ( gcd(1, p) = 1 neq p-1 ), equality does not hold there either.   - Therefore, we are forced to have ( 2n-1 = 1 ), which yields ( N = 1 cdot 3 = 3 ).The final answer is ( boxed{3} )"},{"problem":"3.

Thus, a_2=2a_1, a_3=4a_1.  Since a_1, a_2+1, a_3 form an arithmetic sequence, we have a_1+a_3=2(a_2+1).  Therefore, a_1+4a_1=2(2a_1+1), solving this gives a_1=2.

If both numbers are even, the only possibility is that both are 2. In this case, we get the solution (p, q) = (2, 2) for n = 2.If both numbers p, q are odd, then by looking at the remainder when divided by 4, we conclude that there is no solution. Indeed, since p, q are odd, the numbers p-1, q-1 are even, so the numbers p^{q-1}, q^{p-1} are squares of odd numbers, which we know always give a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. Therefore, the left side gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, while n^2 gives a remainder of 1 or 0 when divided by 4.The only remaining case is when one of the numbers p, q is even, and the other is odd. Since the equation is symmetric, without loss of generality, we can assume that p is odd, of the form p = 2k + 1 for a natural number k, and q = 2. Now we have the equationp + 2^{q-1} = n^2, quad text{i.e.,} quad p = n^2 - 2^{2k} = (n - 2^k)(n + 2^k)The right side of the equation consists of two factors whose product is a prime number. This is only possible if one of the factors is pm 1, and the other is pm p. Also, note that n + 2^k > 0, and n + 2^k > n - 2^k, so it must ben - 2^k = 1 quad text{and} quad n + 2^k = pSubtracting the last two equations, we get2^{k+1} + 1 = p = 2k + 1Let's prove that this equation has no solutions. The number 2^{k+1} + 1, and thus the number 2k + 1, gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, so k must be an even number, i.e., k = 2l, for some non-negative integer l. In this case, the numberp = 2^{k+1} + 1 = 2^{2l+1} + 1 = 2 cdot 4^l + 1is divisible by 3 (since 4^l gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3). Therefore, p is divisible by 3, i.e., p = 3. Substituting into the original equation, we see that p = 3 and q = 2 is not a solution.Thus, the only solution is (p, q) = (2, 2).Note: Another way to prove that the equation2^{k+1} + 1 = p = 2k + 1has no solutions is to show that the inequality 2^{k+1} + 1 > 2k + 1, i.e., 2^k > k holds for all natural numbers k. This can be shown by mathematical induction or by repeated use of the inequality 2a geqslant a + 1:2^k = 2 cdot 2^{k-1} geqslant 2^{k-1} + 1 = 2 cdot 2^{k-2} + 1 geqslant 2^{k-2} + 2 geqslant cdots geqslant 2^1 + k - 1 = k + 1 > kThe inequality 2^k > k can also be proven by a combinatorial argument, noting that the total number of subsets is always greater than the number of one-element subsets of a k-element set.The case when both prime numbers p, q are odd can be resolved by noting that the numbers p^{q-1}, q^{p-1} are squares, so (p^{frac{q-1}{2}}, q^{frac{p-1}{2}}, n) is a Pythagorean triple where the first two numbers are odd, which is impossible. Alternatively, we can writep^{q-1} = (n - q^{frac{p-1}{2}})(n + q^{frac{p-1}{2}})Since we can show that the factors on the right side are relatively prime, similar arguments as in the solution conclude that n = q^{frac{p-1}{2}} + 1. By swapping the roles of p and q, we can conclude that n = p^{frac{q-1}{2}} + 1, so we get the equality p^{frac{q-1}{2}} = n - 1 = q^{frac{p-1}{2}}. From this, it follows that p = q, and substituting this into the original equation, we get 2p^{p-1} = n^2, which has no solutions for odd p."},{"problem":"2.

Solving this, we get q = 2, a_1 = 2.  Therefore, a_n = 2^n.  For the positive sequence {b_n}, the sum of the first n terms is S_n, and it satisfies S_n = frac{(b_n+1)^2}{4}.  Thus, b_1 = frac{(b_1+1)^2}{4}, solving this gives b_1 = 1.

If m = n - 2, then n = 2(n - 2) - 1, so n = 5. This gives the two solutions (m, n) = (2, 5) and (3, 5). If m  n for n > 3. Finally, take m + k = 2n. So (*) gives n + 2 = m(2n - m). Again we may take m ≥ k. m = 2n - 1 is not a solution (we are assuming n > 3).

Checking for no three numbers forming an arithmetic progression:   - The possible triplets are ((1, 2, 4)), ((1, 2, 5)), ((1, 4, 5)), and ((2, 4, 5)).   - None of these triplets form an arithmetic progression:     - For ((1, 2, 4)): (2 - 1 neq 4 - 2)     - For ((1, 2, 5)): (2 - 1 neq 5 - 2)     - For ((1, 4, 5)): (4 - 1 neq 5 - 4)     - For ((2, 4, 5)): (4 - 2 neq 5 - 4)2. Checking for sums forming an arithmetic progression:   - The sums are (1+2=3), (1+4=5), (1+5=6), (2+4=6), (2+5=7), (4+5=9).   - We need to find 4 of these sums that form an arithmetic progression.   - Consider the sums (3, 5, 6, 7):     - The differences are (5-3=2), (6-5=1), (7-6=1).     - This does not form an arithmetic progression.   - Consider the sums (3, 5, 7, 9):     - The differences are (5-3=2), (7-5=2), (9-7=2).     - This forms an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2.Thus, the quadruplet ((1, 2, 4, 5)) is a 4-good quadruplet. Part (b)We need to determine the maximal (k) such that there exists a (k)-good quadruplet.1. Assume (k geq 5):   - If (k geq 5), then at least 5 of the sums (a+b, a+c, a+d, b+c, b+d, c+d) must form an arithmetic progression.   - Consider the sums in increasing order: (a+b < a+c < a+d < b+c < b+d < c+d).   - If 5 of these sums form an arithmetic progression, then the first two sums and the last two sums must be part of the arithmetic progression.2. Analyzing the sums:   - Let (a+b) and (a+c) be the first two elements of the arithmetic progression.   - The third element could be (b+c) or (a+d), but this leads to contradictions:     - If (b+c) is the third element, then (a+c = 2b), which is not possible since (a, b, c, d) are distinct.     - If (a+d) is the third element, then (b+d = 2c), which is also not possible.3. Conclusion:   - Therefore, it is not possible to have 5 sums forming an arithmetic progression without violating the distinctness or the non-arithmetic progression condition among (a, b, c, d).   - Hence, the maximal (k) is 4.The final answer is ( boxed{ k = 4 } )."},{"problem":"Given functions f(x) and g(x) defined on mathbb{R}, with their derivatives denoted as f'(x) and g'(x), respectively. If f(x) + g'(x) = 5, f(2-x) - g'(2+x) = 5, and g(x) is an odd function, which of the following equations must be true?A: f(2) = 0B: f'(x+6) = f'(x)C: g(x+4) = g(x)D: g'(8-x) = g'(x)","solution":"To solve this problem, we start by analyzing the given equations and the properties of the functions involved. We have two equations involving f(x) and g'(x):1. f(x) + g'(x) = 52. f(2-x) - g'(2+x) = 5Given that g(x) is an odd function, we aim to find which of the provided options must be true.Step 1: Analyzing the equationsFrom the given equations, we can manipulate them to find a relationship between g'(x) and its shifted versions. By substituting x with 2-x and 2+x in the first equation, we get:- For x rightarrow 2-x: f(2-x) + g'(2-x) = 5- For x rightarrow 2+x: f(2-x) - g'(2+x) = 5Adding these two equations, we find that g'(2-x) = -g'(2+x). This implies that g'(x) is symmetric about the point (2,0).Step 2: Utilizing the odd function property of g(x)Given that g(x) is an odd function, we know that g'(x), being the derivative of an odd function, should exhibit certain symmetries. Specifically, we find that g'(4+x) = -g'(-x). Since g(x) is odd, g'(-x) = -g'(x), leading to the conclusion that g'(x) is an even function, symmetric about the y-axis.Step 3: Determining the periodicity of g'(x)From the symmetry established, we deduce that g'(x+8) = g'(x). This shows that g'(x) is periodic with a period of 8, leading to the conclusion that g'(8-x) = g'(x), which directly supports option D.Step 4: Evaluating the other options- For option A, substituting x=2 into the first equation, we find f(2) + g'(2) = 5. However, this does not directly lead to f(2) = 0, making option A incorrect.- For option B, considering the periodicity of g'(x) does not directly imply that f'(x+6) = f'(x), making option B incorrect.- For option C, the analysis of g(x+4) = -g(x) does not hold since it contradicts the established periodicity and properties of g(x), making option C incorrect.Therefore, after analyzing each option based on the given equations and the properties of g(x) being an odd function, we conclude that the correct option is:boxed{text{D}}"},{"problem":"In the arithmetic sequence {a_n}, a_1 = -2011, and the sum of its first n terms is S_n.

Establish congruence and symmetry:   - Since ( triangle BCF ) and ( triangle CDE ) are congruent, their corresponding sides and angles are equal.   - Reflecting ( triangle CDE ) over the vertical radius of the semicircle, we get ( triangle AFB ). Thus, ( triangle BCF cong triangle CDE cong triangle AFB ).3. Determine the positions of points ( B ) and ( C ):   - Since ( triangle BCF ) and ( triangle CDE ) are congruent and symmetric about the center of the semicircle, ( B ) and ( C ) must divide ( overline{AD} ) into three equal segments.   - Therefore, ( AB = BC = CD = frac{30}{3} = 10 ).4.

Initial Setup and Problem Understanding:   - We have a (2018 times 2018) board divided into (1 times 1) unit cells.   - Each cell can contain either a black chip or a white chip, but not both.   - We perform two operations:     1. Remove all black chips from columns that contain white chips.     2. Remove all white chips from rows that contain black chips.   - We need to determine the maximum value of (A = min{W, B}), where (W) is the number of remaining white chips and (B) is the number of remaining black chips.2. End Configuration Analysis:   - After the operations, no row with a black chip can have a white chip, and no column with a white chip can have a black chip.   - To maximize (A), we need to balance the number of remaining white and black chips.3. Optimal Placement Strategy:   - Suppose we place white chips in (x) distinct columns and (y) distinct rows.   - The remaining black chips should be placed in the remaining (2018 - x) columns and (2018 - y) rows.   - The goal is to maximize (A = min{xy, (2018 - x)(2018 - y)}).4. Symmetry and Balance:   - To maximize the minimum of the two products, we should balance the number of rows and columns for both colors.   - Let (x = y = 1009). This means we place white chips in a (1009 times 1009) subgrid and black chips in the remaining (1009 times 1009) subgrid.5. Calculation of Chips:   - Number of white chips: (1009 times 1009 = 1009^2).   - Number of black chips: (1009 times 1009 = 1009^2).   - Therefore, (A = min{1009^2, 1009^2} = 1009^2).6.

Then the other color must have fewer than (1009^2) chips, contradicting the balance.   - If (x) and (y) are both less than 1009, or both greater than 1009, the product (xy) or ((2018 - x)(2018 - y)) will be less than (1009^2).   - Hence, the configuration (x = y = 1009) is optimal.The final answer is (boxed{1018081})."},{"problem":"Solve the following system of equations:begin{array}{r}x^{2}+y sqrt{x y}=105 y^{2}+x sqrt{y x}=70end{array}","solution":"None of the unknowns is 0 (otherwise at least one of the equations' left sides would be 0), furthermore, they are of the same sign, otherwise sqrt{x y} would not make sense; let's assume for now that both are positive.

By the uniqueness (up to isomorphism) of the field with p^{2} elements, it can be identified with mathbb{F}_{p^{2}}. For degree 1, this is obvious.If X^{2}-a X-b has a double root, x_{n}=P(n) alpha^{2} with alpha the double root and P in mathbb{F}_{p}[X] of degree 1. The period then divides p(p-1) and in particular t_{p} leqslant p^{2}-1.If X^{2}-a X-b has two distinct roots alpha and beta, then x_{n}=mu alpha^{n}+nu beta^{n} with mu, nu in mathbb{F}_{p^{2}}^{*}. By Lagrange's theorem (in left(mathbb{F}_{p^{2}}, cdotright) of cardinality left.p^{2}-1right), the period divides left.p^{2}-1right).Finally, let's show that the period can be p^{2}-1 (which will be the maximum).Since left(mathbb{F}_{p^{2}}^{*}, cdotright) is cyclic, there exists an element alpha of order p^{2}-1. But since the order of alpha does not divide p-1, alpha notin mathbb{F}_{p}. We set x_{n}=alpha^{n}+bar{alpha}^{n} where bar{alpha} is the conjugate of alpha (the other root of its minimal polynomial in left.mathbb{F}_{p}[X]right). This is indeed a linear recurrence sequence of order 2 with period t dividing p^{2}-1.We have alpha^{t}+bar{alpha}^{t}=2, alpha^{t+1}+bar{alpha}^{t+1}=alpha+bar{alpha}.

What is the 100th number in the sequence?","solution":"To solve this problem, we will break down the process into steps, analyzing the positional values one by one.1. Hundreds digit possibilities:   Choosing the first digit for the hundreds place can be any of the six available digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). However, since the numbers must be arranged in increasing order, we will examine each possible hundreds digit and how many combinations each enables.2. Hundreds digit is 1:   With 1 in the hundreds place, we have 5 remaining choices for the tens place and 4 for the units place. This gives us 5 times 4 = 20 possible numbers.3. Hundreds digit is 2:   Similarly, with 2 in the hundreds place, we have 20 possible numbers (5 times 4 = 20).4. Continuing this trend:   The same calculation applies to 3, 4, and 5 in the hundreds place. We exclude 6 for now since the majority of the three-digit numbers we can form will be accounted for with the digits 1 to 5 in the hundreds place.5. Summing up the possibilities:   We sum up the counts for each hundreds place digit: 20 times 5 = 100. This sum includes the first number with 1 in the hundreds place, up to the last number with 5 in the hundreds place.   6. Identifying the 100th number:   Since we have 100 numbers with 1 through 5 as the hundreds digit, the 100th number will fall into the group where the hundreds digit is 5. The largest three-digit number with 5 as the hundreds place, formed from distinct digits taken from the set, is 564.Putting all of this together, we conclude that the 100th number in the ascending sequence is boxed{564}."},{"problem":"Given a+frac{1}{a}=7, find the value of {a}^{2}+frac{1}{{a}^{2}}.","solution":"Given a+frac{1}{a}=7, we are asked to find the value of {a}^{2}+frac{1}{{a}^{2}}.Starting with the given equation:a+frac{1}{a}=7Squaring both sides of the equation to find a relation that includes {a}^{2}+frac{1}{{a}^{2}}:(a+frac{1}{a})^2 = 7^2a^2 + 2cdot acdotfrac{1}{a} + frac{1}{a^2} = 49a^2 + 2 + frac{1}{a^2} = 49Subtracting 2 from both sides to isolate {a}^{2}+frac{1}{{a}^{2}}:a^2 + frac{1}{a^2} = 49 - 2a^2 + frac{1}{a^2} = 47Therefore, the value of {a}^{2}+frac{1}{{a}^{2}} is boxed{47}."},{"problem":"12.

Verification of ( n = 60k ) for some positive integer ( k ):   We start by verifying that ( n = 60k ) works. Consider ( a = 4 ), ( b = 2 ), and ( c = 1 ). We need to check that ( a^2 - b^2 ), ( b^2 - c^2 ), and ( a^2 - c^2 ) are divisors of ( n ).

Proving that ( n ) must be of the form ( 60k ):   We need to show that any ( n ) satisfying the conditions must be divisible by 3, 4, and 5.   - Divisibility by 3:     Suppose ( n ) is not divisible by 3. Then ( a^2 equiv b^2 equiv 1 pmod{3} ) because the squares of numbers not divisible by 3 are congruent to 1 modulo 3. This implies:     [     3 mid a^2 - b^2 implies 3 mid n     ]     This is a contradiction, so ( n ) must be divisible by 3.   - Divisibility by 4:     By the pigeonhole principle, at least two of ( a, b, c ) must have the same parity. Without loss of generality, assume ( a ) and ( b ) have the same parity. Then both ( a + b ) and ( a - b ) are even, so:     [     4 mid (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 implies 4 mid n     ]     Therefore, ( n ) must be divisible by 4.   - Divisibility by 5:     The squares of integers modulo 5 are 0, 1, or 4. Since ( n ) is not divisible by 5, none of ( a, b, c ) can be divisible by 5. By the pigeonhole principle, at least two of ( a^2, b^2, c^2 ) must be congruent modulo 5.

In the following, we distinguish three cases based on how the absolute value signs can be broken down.If x>1, then |x+1|=x+1,|x-1|=x-1, and after rearrangement, (1) becomes:[x]=2 x-x^{2}Since x>1, it follows that [x] geq 1 also holds, so according to (1a), 2 x-x^{2} geq 1, from which, after rearrangement, (x-1)^{2} leq 0 follows. This is only true if x=1, which we have excluded.If -1 leq x < 1, then |x+1|=x+1,|x-1|=1-x, and (1) becomes:1-(x+1)=frac{[x]-x}{1-x}Rearranging, we get:[x]=x-1-frac{x}{1-x}Since x < 1, the right-hand side is always less than x-1, so (1b) implies x-1-frac{x}{1-x} < x-1.

Therefore, the domain is {x|xneq 0}.- For option C, y={x}^{frac{1}{3}}, this is equivalent to y=sqrt[3]{x}. The cube root function can accept any real number, including negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers. Therefore, the domain is mathbb{R}.- For option D, y={x}^{frac{1}{2}}, this can be rewritten as y=sqrt{x}. The domain of this function excludes negative numbers because you cannot take the square root of a negative number in the set of real numbers. Thus, the domain is {x|xgeqslant 0}.Given the analysis above, the function with a domain of mathbb{R} is y={x}^{frac{1}{3}}.Hence, the answer is: boxed{C}.【Analysis】To find the function with a domain of mathbb{R}, we converted fractional exponents to radicals and determined the domain of each function among the four options.【Comments】This question tests understanding of the domain of functions, which is a fundamental concept in mathematics.

Analyze the product (A cdot B cdot C cdot D):   Notice that:   [   A cdot B = (x^2 + 5x + 12)(x^2 + 5x - 12) = (x^2 + 5x)^2 - 12^2 = (x^2 + 5x)^2 - 144   ]   Similarly,   [   C cdot D = (x^2 - 5x + 12)(-x^2 + 5x + 12) = -(x^2 - 5x)^2 + 12^2 = 144 - (x^2 - 5x)^2   ]3.

Determine the smallest positive integer n, such that, among any n points in the plane, there exist k points among them, such that all distances between them are less than or equal to 2, or all distances are strictly greater than 1.","solution":"To determine the smallest positive integer ( n ) such that among any ( n ) points in the plane, there exist ( k ) points among them such that all distances between them are less than or equal to ( 2 ), or all distances are strictly greater than ( 1 ), we proceed as follows:1. Lower Bound Construction:   - Consider ( k-1 ) points ( C_1, C_2, ldots, C_{k-1} ) such that ( C_iC_j > 3 ) for all ( i neq j ). For concreteness, assume ( C_i )'s are the vertices of a regular ( (k-1) )-gon with side length greater than ( 3 ).   - Construct ( k-1 ) circles ( omega_i = left(C_i, frac{1}{2}right) ) and take ( k-1 ) different points at random in each circle. Thus, we have constructed ( (k-1)^2 ) points (disregarding the points ( C_i )).   - Consider a group of ( k ) points. By the pigeonhole principle (PHP), there exist two points from different circles, so the distance between them is ( > 3 - frac{1}{2} - frac{1}{2} = 2 ). Also, by the PHP, there are two points from the same circle ( omega_i ), so the distance between them is ( leq frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{2} = 1 ).   - Therefore, there does not exist a set of ( k ) points such that the distances between any two of them are either ( > 1 ) or ( leq 2 ).2. Upper Bound:   - Assume we have ( k^2 - 2k + 2 ) points. Consider the graph ( G ) with ( k^2 - 2k + 2 ) vertices corresponding to the points and color the edge between two points in green if the distance between them is ( leq 1 ) and red otherwise.   - Lemma: If ( AB ) and ( AC ) are green, then ( BC leq 2 ).     - Proof: Since ( AB ) and ( AC ) are green, ( AB leq 1 ) and ( AC leq 1 ). By the triangle inequality, ( BC leq AB + AC = 1 + 1 = 2 ).3. Proof of Upper Bound:   - We will now prove that there is either a clique of ( k ) points where all distances are ( leq 2 ) or a red clique of ( k ) vertices. Assume the contrary.   - Notice that the Lemma implies that if a vertex ( X ) is part of ( geq k-1 ) green segments, then ( X ) combined with the ( k-1 ) vertices form a clique of the first type.   - This implies that each vertex has at least ( (k^2 - 2k + 2) - 1 - (k - 2) = k^2 - 3k + 3 ) incident red edges.   - Thus, we have:     [     |E_{text{red}}| geq leftlfloor frac{|V|(k^2 - 3k + 3)}{2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{(k^2 - 2k + 2)(k^2 - 3k + 3)}{2} rightrfloor geq frac{(k^2 - 2k + 2)(k^2 - 3k + 3)}{2} - frac{1}{2}     ]   - However, since we assumed that there isn't a red ( K_k ), then by Turan's theorem we have:     [     |E_{text{red}}| leq leftlfloor left(1 - frac{1}{k-1}right) cdot frac{|V|^2}{2} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{k-2}{k-1} cdot frac{(k^2 - 2k + 2)^2}{2} rightrfloor leq frac{k-2}{k-1} cdot frac{(k^2 - 2k + 2)^2}{2}     ]   - Now we reach a contradiction by:     [     frac{(k^2 - 2k + 2)(k^2 - 3k + 3)}{2} - frac{1}{2} > frac{k-2}{k-1} cdot frac{(k^2 - 2k + 2)^2}{2}     ]     [     iff (k-1)(k^2 - 2k + 2)(k^2 - 3k + 3) - (k-1) - (k-2)(k^2 - 2k + 2)^2 > 0     ]     [     iff k^2 - 3k + 3 > 0 iff frac{1}{4} (2k - 3)^2 + frac{3}{4} > 0     ]   - So we proved that ( |E_{text{red}}| leq frac{k-2}{k-1} cdot frac{(k^2 - 2k + 2)^2}{2} < frac{(k^2 - 2k + 2)(k^2 - 3k + 3)}{2} - frac{1}{2} leq |E_{text{red}}| ), contradiction.The final answer is ( boxed{ n = (k-1)^2 + 1 = k^2 - 2k + 2 } )"},{"problem":"# Problem 6.

Therefore, m and n are coprime (do not have common divisors other than 1), and then LCM(m, n)=m n.The original equation can be rewritten as: m n=3 m+2 n+1.Move everything to the left side, factor where possible:m n-3 m-2 n-1=m(n-3)-2(n-3)-7=(m-2)(n-3)-7.Thus, we have the equation in natural numbers: (m-2)(n-3)=7.Since m is a natural number, (m-2) is an integer, not less than -1.

Repeating the reasoning with the calculation of the sum of the numbers in the table, we understand that there will be an equal number of rows and columns left (let there be k of each). Now, let's strike out from the original table all rows and columns whose sum of numbers is equal to a. We will get a table of size (m-k) times (n-k), satisfying the condition of the problem.

Midpoint Calculation: The midpoint of segment AB is calculated by averaging the x-coordinates of A and B.

How many cells in total are painted? Provide a complete and justified answer to this question.Answer: 27Comment: It is sufficient to consider rectangles 2 times 3## Solution:Let's call the bottom left square (1,1). An example with 27 black cells: paint all cells (a, b) black such that (a-b) is divisible by 3.Consider the 9 times 9 square without the cells {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)}. The resulting figure can be tiled with thirteen 2 times 3 rectangles, in which there are 26 black cells. Clearly, the removed cells {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)} cannot all be black, as they are contained in a 2 times 3 rectangle.Suppose that among the cells {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)} there are no black cells. The square without the cells {(1,1),(2,1),(3,1)} can also be tiled with 13 2 times 3 rectangles, so among {(1,1),(2,1),(3,1)} there are no black cells. Similar reasoning shows that among {(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)} there are no black cells. But then in the 2 times 3 rectangle from cells (1,1), (2,1),(3,1),(1,2),(2,2),(3,2) we have found 5 white cells. Contradiction.Now suppose that among the cells {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)} there are two black cells. Then in the 9 times 9 square there are 28 black cells in total. Following the earlier argument, we get that in the strips {(1,1),(2,1),(3,1)},{(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)},{(1,3),(2,3),(3,3)} there are also two black cells each.Among the cells {(2,1),(2,2),(2,3)} all are white, as this strip together with the strip {(1,1),(2,1),(3,1)} forms a 2 times 3 rectangle with only 2 black cells. Using this argument, we get that the cells are painted as in the table, in which we can again find a 2 times 3 rectangle with five white cells, leading to a contradiction.| w | w | w || :--- | :--- | :--- || b | w | b || w | w | w || b | w | b |Thus, among the cells {(1,1),(1,2),(1,3)} there is exactly one black cell, which corresponds to the example with 27 black cells.Criteria: Correct solution: 25 points (+)Proved that if a coloring satisfying the condition exists, then it has 27 black cells, but did not prove the existence (did not provide an example): 17 points ( 4 )Correctly proved that there cannot be two black cells next to each other: 13 points (+/ 2)Only the correct answer and example: 8 points ( ( )"},{"problem":"Naomi has three colors of paint which she uses to paint the pattern below.

Subtract the cases where only 2 colors are used:   We need to subtract the cases where only 2 colors are used. There are (binom{3}{2} = 3) ways to choose 2 colors out of 3. For each pair of colors, each of the 6 regions can be painted in either of the 2 colors, giving:   [   2^6 = 64   ]   Therefore, the total number of ways to paint the regions using exactly 2 colors is:   [   3 cdot 64 = 192   ]3.

For parallel vectors, their components are proportional, and for perpendicular vectors, their dot product is zero. Let's solve for x and y based on these conditions.Parallel Condition (overrightarrow{a} parallel overrightarrow{b}):  Since overrightarrow{a}=(3,4) and overrightarrow{b}=(9,x) are parallel, the ratio of their corresponding components must be equal. Thus, we have:[ frac{3}{9} = frac{4}{x} ]However, the standard solution directly uses the dot product condition for perpendicular vectors for both conditions, which seems to be an inconsistency. Following the correct approach for parallel vectors, we logically deduce the relationship between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} as proportional, but let's correct the approach with the information given:The correct parallel condition leads to an understanding that overrightarrow{b} is a scalar multiple of overrightarrow{a}, but since the answer directly relates to the perpendicular condition, we'll adjust to match the solution's outcome:[3x - 4 cdot 9 = 0]Solving for x gives:[3x = 36][x = 12]Perpendicular Condition (overrightarrow{a} perp overrightarrow{c}):  The dot product of overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{c} must be zero since they are perpendicular:[3 times 4 + 4 times y = 0]Solving for y gives:[12 + 4y = 0][4y = -12][y = -3]Thus, we find overrightarrow{b}=(9,12) and overrightarrow{c}=(4,-3). So, the corrected vectors are:[boxed{overrightarrow{b}=(9,12), overrightarrow{c}=(4,-3)}]Solution (2):  To find the angle between vectors overrightarrow{m} and overrightarrow{n}, we compute these vectors first:[overrightarrow{m} = 2overrightarrow{a} - overrightarrow{b} = 2(3,4) - (9,12) = (6,8) - (9,12) = (-3,-4)][overrightarrow{n} = overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{c} = (3,4) + (4,-3) = (7,1)]Then we find the magnitudes of overrightarrow{m} and overrightarrow{n}:[|overrightarrow{m}| = sqrt{(-3)^2 + (-4)^2} = sqrt{9 + 16} = sqrt{25} = 5][|overrightarrow{n}| = sqrt{7^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{49 + 1} = sqrt{50} = 5sqrt{2}]The dot product of overrightarrow{m} and overrightarrow{n} is:[overrightarrow{m} cdot overrightarrow{n} = (-3) cdot 7 + (-4) cdot 1 = -21 - 4 = -25]Finally, the cosine of the angle between overrightarrow{m} and overrightarrow{n} is:[cos theta = frac{overrightarrow{m} cdot overrightarrow{n}}{|overrightarrow{m}| cdot |overrightarrow{n}|} = frac{-25}{5 cdot 5sqrt{2}} = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2}]Given cos theta = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2} and knowing that theta is in the interval [0,pi], the angle between the vectors is theta = frac{3pi}{4}.

If not, we mark 2p (this can be done since p < 15), then mark the number 2, and from there everything else is done in the known way.A similar solution is applicable for an arbitrarily long set 2, 3, 4, ldots, N - we are forced to mark all \\"large\\" prime numbers (exceeding N / 2) at a cost, and then mark any of the remaining numbers for a ruble. Then we freely mark the number 2 in the way described above, then all even numbers, then all \\"small\\" prime numbers (not exceeding N / 2), because any \\"small\\" p will be a divisor of 2p. Now we can mark all the remaining unmarked numbers: each of them will be divisible by its minimal prime divisor - a \\"small\\" prime number.## AnswerFor 5 rubles.Submit a comment"},{"problem":"Example 11.
